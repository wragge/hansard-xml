<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Transport. Has he yet made up his mind whether he agrees with the Minister for Transport in challenging the veracity of the three members of the Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares, namely, Mr Warwick Holcroft, Dr Harold Bell and Professor Warren Hogan? Does he accept that the members of the inquiry were not warned that the inquiry was to be curtailed and a report produced by 31 January? If he does not accept that statement by the three members of the inquiry, can he explain why no public hearings were held in Victoria, South Australia or Queensland and no evidence was taken from Ansett Transport Industries Ltd, Trans-Australia Airlines or the Department of Transport?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In respect of the first matter raised by Senator Button I certainly do not agree that the Minister has been challenging the veracity of the members of the Holcroft inquiry. With regard to the second aspect-Senator Button's allegation that the members of the Holcroft inquiry were not warned that the inquiry was to be curtailed-it is quite clear from the letter of 14 November 1980, which I believe Senator Button would have seen by now, that it was fully intended that the Holcroft inquiry understood that it would be reporting by 31 January 1981. The letter, of course, sought an extension of that time. The Government took a decision which indicated that it would expect a report by 31 January 1981. It must be realised, I think, that the inquiry itself was concerned with the matter of air fares; it did not cover the matter of the two airlines agreement. Consequently, the Government sought an early reply on that matter. Therefore, the rest of the points raised by Senator Button in his question, I believe, fall on that account. I have no further information on any other matters on which he might be seeking information.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to ask a supplementary question. Irrespective of what the Government intended, is it a fact that the Holcroft committee was informed that the inquiry would be curtailed and that the report had to be produced by 31 January? I further ask the Minister: Irrespective of whether the Holcroft committee had to deal with the two-airlines agreement, is it not a matter of concern that an inquiry of this nature received no evidence from Ansett Transport Industries Ltd, Trans-Australia Airlines or the Department of Transport?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe the letter of 14 November 1980-I take it Senator Button has seen it-clearly states that 31 January 1981 was the agreed date. Of course, that date having been stipulated in the first place, it was not changed or the subject of change by the Government. I believe that is the key question, and it has been answered quite clearly.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. It was reported in the Northern Territory News of Monday, 3 March 1981, that the Portuguese Government, through the Dutch Embassy in Jakarta, is refusing to issue passports to East Timorese trying to reach Lisbon. As this avenue of immigration and the reuniting of families is now closed to East Timorese, can the Government advise the present position regarding East Timorese entering Australia? Will the Government consider extending the bounds of the present policy to offset the move by the Portuguese Government?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Under Portuguese law people born in East Timor are Portuguese citizens and are entitled to Portuguese passports. The referral of passport applications to Portugal is associated, at least in part, with the preparation for the provision of accommodation and social welfare requirements of returnees from the former colonies. I am advised that there is nothing at this stage to suggest that applicants in Jakarta will not eventually be granted Portuguese passports and enabled to travel to Portugal. Australia's provisions for the resettlement of Timorese are generous and involve significant relaxation of normal migration policies. The issue of passports by the Portuguese Government is not preventing movement to Australia by Timorese.</PARA></TALK.START>

I think that agreement was made in March 1980. The examinations which were requested by the Prime Ministers are still proceeding, as are consultations with industry and State governments. I am sure that the ideas put forward by Senator Archer in his question will be explored thoroughly in the context of the detailed work which the Prime Ministers have sought. I am equally sure that the Minister for Primary Industry will use his best endeavours to forward the best interests of Australian agriculture and particularly those of the dairy and horticultural industries in the course of the ongoing discussions on a closer economic relationship with New Zealand.

Can the Minister confirm that the Prime Minister, through Cabinet, has now removed ADAB from the action list of the so-called razor gang in its reviewing of government functions?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for National Development and Energy. In view of the many unsubstantiated and conflicting statements being made concerning the input of salt to the River Murray, I ask: Will the Minister provide to the Senate the most up to date information available as to the actual amount of salt input to the River Murray by each of the three States adjacent to it, namely, New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, together with information as to the reason for the input? Further, will he provide statistics on the amount of salt entering New South Wales from Queensland through the Barwon River, which flows into the Darling River which, in turn, flows into the River Murray?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There has been some controversy, as Senator McLaren acknowledged, regarding the actual amount of salt flowing into the Murray River and the origin of that salt. The estimate of 2 per cent which has been cited by New South Wales authorities as deriving from New South Wales rivers is based on a water quality analysis in the Maunsell report on river flows and diversions by the States during the 1967-68 irrigation season. That is quite some time ago. This analysis excluded flows released from storages under the control of the River Murray Commission, and flows in the Darling were also excluded as they represented mainly releases from the Menindee Lakes storage on the Darling River which is controlled by the Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> South Australia, in arriving at its estimate of 28 per cent of salt in the River Murray being contributed by New South Wales, has updated the Maunsell analysis on the basis of available information on river flows during the period October to December 1980. However, salt coming down the Darling River, including that in releases from Menindee Lakes, has been added to the updated analysis. The estimates I have referred to are not comparable in that they relate to different times and to different bases of computation. In any event, it should be recognised that some of the salt coming down the Darling, including that in water released from Menindee Lakes in New South Wales, has its origin in Queensland tributaries of the Darling River.</PARA>
<PARA> It appears that there is no clear or authoritative answer to the precise question. The question has been troubling me very considerably. I will see whether we can get more scientific information. Fundamentally, all South Australians are motivated-I am certainly motivated as Minister-to ensure that the minimum of salt gets into the river and into South Australia. That is the real factor that is occupying my mind. However, if there is statistical or other information that can add to what I have said, I will get hold of that and will let Senator McLaren know.</PARA>

Obviously it was not necessary for the inquiry to consider the whole question of the two-airlines agreement itself. As I understand it, there was no intention that the Government should receive advice from that inquiry on that broader matter.

The Government has investigated the various codes of conduct which the honourable senator mentioned in his question but has not moved to adopt such a code for Australian businesses. We hope, however, that those Australian firms operating in South Africa will be guided by the Government's overall policy on apartheid. In this connection I point out that those codes of conduct adopted by other countries are not mandatory on the firms concerned.

I make the point in the first place that it would be essential for the States themselves to direct their attention to what Australians would regard as a matter of significant interest. It is true that under the Foreign Investment Review Board provisions, the Commonwealth Government has a responsibility and applies that responsibility. I am not aware as yet whether the condition of purchase by foreign interests of land in Australia has caused any considerable difficulties. Nevertheless, to the extent that it is partly a Commonwealth matter in that it involves foreign investment guidelines, I will refer the question to the Treasurer in the first place and presumably to the Prime Minister and ask them to give it consideration, in the knowledge, however, that any primary action must come from the State governments because they have sovereignty over the land.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, since we have experienced the unique situation of the Leader of the Opposition intervening to help in an answer, let me say that I was very accurate with my words. I said I would have thought that members of the Opposition would take a certain stand. Indeed, I accept the assurance of the Leader of the Opposition that they do so. The fact of the matter is that the present strained state of Australia-Soviet relations is the direct result of the Soviet invasion and occupation of Afghanistan. Following the invasion of Afghanistan the Australian Government condemned the invasion in the strongest terms and took a series of measures in concert with its allies. These measures remain in force. If we were wrong in those, we were wrong in very good company indeed. Improvement in relations between Australia and the Soviet Union would be possible if the Soviet Union were to change its policies, which have been widely and vigorously condemned by the international community. Regrettably, apparently the Soviet Union has revealed no intention either to change its policies or to withdraw its forces from Afghanistan. There are 85,000 Soviet troops still in Afghanistan attempting forcibly to suppress Afghan resistance. While the Soviet Union's policies and activities in relation to Afghanistan remain unchanged, Australia's relations with the Soviet Union cannot be normalised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A Soviet Embassy official is reported as saying to journalists that the Government has ignored a request by the Soviet Union to expand the Embassy's trade section. No formal request in that regard has been received by this Government. There is a proper and an improper way of conducting business between governments. Accusations made to journalists regarding inaction by the Government on a request that has not yet been made formally to the Government represent an improper way of conducting business. I note that the Ambassador is reported as referring to Australia as a possible nuclear target. For the Ambassador to make such a grave threat would belie the image of peaceful Soviet policy that he usually seeks to convey and would add to the grounds for concern felt increasingly in the international community regarding Soviet expansionism and militarism. Those Soviet policies further underline the vital importance of Australia's alliance with the United States of America. Finally, Australia could be a nuclear target only if the potential aggressors of this world sought to make it a nuclear target. Indeed, I know of no aggressors within the free world. Unfortunately, I think the reported remarks of the Ambassador have been made in poor taste and judgment.</PARA>

As the multinational Exxon company appears more concerned with the financial well-being of its shareholders than it is with the living standards of Australian people, will the Minister give consideration to: Firstly, relieving Exxon of what seems to be an onerous and embarraising obligation; or secondly, calling for a declaration of interest from others with the necessary technical expertise; or thirdly, advising the Government to set up its own organisation that would be responsible for the development and production of all shale oil in Australia?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whenever an undertaking is made to develop a mining and retorting operation involving shale oil, for example, inevitably, along the journey, changes in timetable may occur because technical problems may emerge. There is no doubt that in any undertaking of a mining project of such magnitude timetables may well be varied. The Rundle project involves a co-partnership in which 50 per cent of the co-partnership is held by Australians and the other 50 per cent is held by Exxon which is acknowledged throughout the world as having a world leadership in the knowledge of the development of liquefaction of shale. So Exxon has high technical efficiency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am aware that throughout the world a number of countries produce oil from shale. I am well aware that there are opportunities for other projects to develop in Australia, notably in Queensland, and there is a lively interest in them. I have no doubt that, in the near future, as more knowledge occurs of the details of the mining operation the Rundle partners will make public any knowledge about timetables that is necessary.</PARA>
<PARA> My understanding was that there would be two stages and that the first stage would be virtually a demonstration plant. I understood that phase one would be available about the mid-1980s and that the second stage would be available at the beginning of the 1990s. There may well be some variation or slippage in years in that regard. Nevertheless, because of the size of the plant, that would be understandable.</PARA>

As to the specifics, Exxon has world acknowledgement of its expertise. Other companies in co-partnerships in Australia are available to come forward and develop shale.

I will certainly check to see whether an approach has been made either at Prime Ministerial level or at other departmental level. I have not received any approach at all. In the normal course of events expenditure for town water supply would be regarded as a State matter and, indeed, the national water resources program that I administer does not specifically deal with it. However, it may be that the South Australian Government which would make such an approach would do so seeking some special loan or special application in another direction. I will look at the matter, refer it to the Prime Minister and let Senator Jessop know if any further information is available.</PARA></TALK.START>

The honourable senator made one comment about the provision of research grants by the National Health and Medical Research Council. My understanding is that these awards are made on a competitive basis among all people who apply. They are not necessarily made on the basis of published work; they are said to be made on the basis of the quality of the submission made. I understand also that the National Health and Medical Research Council has a highly developed assessment program whereby each new proposal is assessed independently by a team of assessors who allot a mark and who then attempt to fund the proposal on a national priority basis.

The fact of the matter is that there has been severe disruption to the oil supply from Bass Strait and as a result there will be a diminution in the volume of money flowing from the oil levy. For a variety of reasons, the increase in the price of oil due to the increase determined by the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries will be relatively small. The OPEC increase, thank goodness, was small and the exchange rate value between the American and Australian dollars produced a relatively low increase.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Mr Deputy President, pursuant to Standing Order 408, I wish to make a personal explanation. I claim to have been misrepresented. During Question Time, when Senator Carrick was answering a question which involved the Soviet Union, I sought to have a paper tabled. He then implied that I had given to him a Dorothy Dix question in respect of the River Murray. I did no such thing. I had had no personal contact whatever with Senator Carrick, nor had I conveyed to him that I would ask that question. No doubt some of the officers in his Department, who are very vigilant, had a look at a copy of my remarks when I was speaking in the Senate on Tuesday 3 March on the tabling of the report of the Australian Water Resources Council. I said that I would pursue by telephone certain matters in respect of whether the South Australian Minister had raised certain matters at the Australian Water Resources Council meeting. I did that. In the course of my conversation I probably mentioned other things dealing with the River Murray. Some things were told to me in confidence. I always respect anything that is told to me in confidence and I never reveal it, no matter how much political gain I might derive from it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is only through those circumstances that Senator Carrick could have been alerted to the fact that I was interested in certain things and that I may raise them in the Senate. I would have raised these matters yesterday had there been a Question Time. Then, of course, Senator Carrick would not have been alerted to the matters which I intended to raise. I want it to be understood that at no time did I consult with Senator Carrick as to whether I would raise this matter. Although I appreciated the answer he gave me-it was comprehensive and it completely satisfied me-I take some umbrage at the fact that he inferred that I asked him a Dorothy Dix question. I do not do such things. If that can be inferred, it is only because of the very expeditious way that the officers in his Department look after the matters under their control. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I was prompted to seek leave to make a short statement on this paper largely by the question that Senator McLaren asked today and the answer to it from Senator Carrick. The paper, a copy of which has been supplied to me by way of an intermediary from Senator Carrick's office, lists the specific projects in four States for which Commonwealth financial assistance has been given. One of the major areas of expenditure in both New South Wales and Victoria itemised in the paper is that of salinity monitoring and control in the Murray Basin. It has been clear for some time, of course, to those who have taken any interest in the subject that an environmental problem of major proportion has already shown up in the Murray Basin and indications are that it is likely to get very much worse unless massive changes are made to both the intensity and the extent of irrigation. Although irrigation is not the only cause of land and water salination in the area, it appears to be without doubt the major cause of the problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question asked by Senator McLaren today and the answer given by Senator Carrick illustrated that our factual knowledge is quite deficient in this area and that there is no definitive information on the contribution to the total salt load in the water from the various tributaries of the Murray. There is, of course, variability, both within and between years, in the amount of water contributed by each of the tributaries and in the salt concentration in that water. So, monitoring would have to be conducted on a continuous basis and over a considerable period before a definitive answer could be given to even so basic a question as the amount of salt coming from each of the tributaries of the river system. </PARA>
<PARA> On the information given by Senator Carrick it is quite clear that the claim being made by the Water Resources Commission of New South Wales-that only 2 per cent of the salt load which finally gets to Lake Alexandrina originates in New South Wales-is highly misleading. I think it is also clear from the technical knowledge available, incomplete though it is, that it would be prudent, to say at least, to be cautious about any further expansion of irrigation works, particularly in the Murrumbidgee-Murray River and tributaries in that part of the system but also in the other areas of the system, because of the ultimate effect which the expansion of irrigation anywhere in the entire Murray catchment area will have on the quality of water which finally reaches South Australia. </PARA>

As this is the last sitting day before this year's Commonwealth Day I would like to take this opportunity to make a brief statement to that end.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This year's Commonwealth Day is especially note-worthy for Australia in two respects. First, it marks the 50th anniversary of the Statute of Westminster, an Act of the British Parliament which gave birth to the Commonwealth. Second, this year Australia will host the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting for the first time. </PARA>
<PARA> To an exceptional extent the history of the Commonwealth has been one of gradual evolution, marked by continuity and subtle modifications rather than abrupt change. But if there is one event which constitutes a decisive step in that evolution, it is surely the passing of the Statute of Westminster in 1931. That event marked the decisive transition from Empire to Commonwealth. By establishing the principles of autonomy, equality and free association among members, it created the conditions for the Commonwealth to grow, diversify and establish a distinctive role in an era of far-reaching changes. Thus as decolonisation proceeded with great rapidity, most of the newly independent countries found it natural and advantageous to become members of it. </PARA>
<PARA> A leading Australian authority on the Commonwealth, Professor Bruce Miller, has referred to the Statute as 'a masterpiece of ambiguity', and no doubt in legal and constitutional terms it was that. But politically it pointed clearly in one direction. The time when discussion of the Commonwealth tended to be clouded by rather dubious metaphysics and the search for the definition of an essence is long since past. The contemporary Commonwealth is confident enough to take itself for granted, to define itself in terms of what it does. Its form is flexible and accommodating; its bent is pragmatic and problem solving; its atmosphere is informal and unpolemical. </PARA>
<PARA> No one who is aware of the recent record of the Commonwealth would be foolish enough to characterise it as a 'talking shop' or an anachronism. At the two Heads of Government meetings the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has attended we have agreed on an effective declaration against apartheid; we have made a substantial contribution to progress on a common fund for commodities; we have initiated an inquiry into factors inhibiting economic growth and structural change; and we have made a major contribution to the solution of conflict in Zimbabwe. We have shown a capacity to make progress on problems which major powers and global groupings have found intractable. Organisationally, we have initiated regional Commonwealth meetings of Asian and Pacific members. </PARA>
<PARA> At the time the Statute of Westminster was passed the Commonwealth had six members. At this year's conference in Melbourne over 40 heads of government are expected to attend and it will be the most important international conference ever held in Australia. The agenda will cover a wide range of issues, but I anticipate that North-South issues-that is issues concerning relations between developed and developing countries-will be of prime importance. These issues are of vital importance for the future peace, stability and prosperity of the world. Yet at present it is proving difficult to have them addressed with the urgency and commitment which their seriousness demands. In these circumstances the Melbourne Commonwealth meeting assumes a special significance. The composition of the meeting ensures that North-South questions will be seriously addressed there, in practical and constructive terms. I hope, therefore, that in September we shall seize the opportunity to contribute towards the removing of some of the roadblocks to a progress on these issues and help generate a momentum which will carry over to other forums. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Deputy President, the Commonwealth is important to Australia as a link with our past. But it is even more important as an instrument which we, along with others, can use to help shape the future, to strengthen the forces of moderation, co-operation and good sense in a world which badly needs them. </PARA>

<PARA>I wish to make very brief comments about this statement.

I do not know what on earth that statement means. Is the second Monday in March each year to be a day on which achievements are to be marked by waffling statements such as the one which has just been read by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner)?

That is what it is all about. It is the Prime Minister setting up a forum for himself at the September meeting where the various issues which are dealt with later in this statement can be raised. If the Government were serious about marking nationally and acknowledging the decision of members of the Commonwealth that a day be set aside for this consideration it would have been incumbent upon the author of this statement to say how we in Australia are going to do that on the second Monday in March.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I am very glad that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner), on behalf of the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Carrick), has made a statement in this place in relation to Commonwealth Day. If my memory serves me correctly, it is the first time that the Government has put down in this place a statement in relation to Commonwealth Day. As one who is interested in the practical nature of this institution, I take this opportunity to make observations on the last sitting day before Commonwealth Day. I am very glad that a statement has been put down in this place prior to the observance of Commonwealth Day, which is to take place next Monday. To some extent I share the view of Senator Button in relation to the statement that 'achievements of the Commonwealth would be duly marked'. I do not propose to go through a whole list of items which might be described as achievements but I think it would have been of value in future years had reference been made in the statement to the achievements that take place within the Commonwealth of Nations. There is a wide range of areas of Commonwealth achievement in education, health research, the law, broadcasting and recreation. A whole range of agreements existing between Commonwealth countries have been brought about simply because they are part of the institution that we know as the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to refer very briefly to one which I will be bold enough to call an achievement and that is the achievement of the institution of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, which has been in existence for some years and which adds to the effectiveness of the Commonwealth in world affairs. This institution provides for a relationship between the countries of the Commonwealth, between the States of this country and enables matters of parliamentary, political or legislative importance to be the subject of appropriate discussion. I refer to the highly successful and beneficial conference on delegated legislation which was sponsored and financed jointly by the Commonwealth of Australia branch of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and the headquarters secretariat in London. Some money also came from the capital fund to which a generous contribution was made by this country. This conference was held in September and October last year in this Senate chamber. It was opened by the Governor-General and chaired very ably by our colleague, Senator Missen, who presided at most of the sessions. It related to an area of legislative process, including regulations and ordinances, in which Australia has played a leading part for a good many years. The delegates came to that conference from the Commonwealth parliaments in Africa, Asia, the United Kingdom, Canada, Australasia and the Pacific. The debates and the discussions were of a high standard and of special benefit and proved the value and the achievement-if I may borrow the word-of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association in the effective functioning of Commonwealth legislatures. </PARA>
<PARA> Regional conferences and regional seminars held in this part of the world at regular intervals are also part of the contribution of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. Last September the branches in the Commonwealth, the States and New Zealand combined to sponsor a most effective occasion. Later this year the annual general conference of the Commonwealth-wide organisation of the CPA is to be held in Fiji. This will be the first occasion on which the conference is held in Fiji. The Commonwealth of Australia branch and the branches within the States are all giving substantial support. </PARA>
<PARA> All of these activities and very many other activities strengthen the Commonwealth heads of government meetings which are held in various parts of the world. A major meeting this year will be held in this country. The meetings also strengthen the parliamentary institution. They add a worthwhile dimension to the observance of Commonwealth Day. I put this information into the record as one who has had a long association with the CPA and one who has some knowledge of the contribution which it makes. I hope that next year, when a statement is made in the Senate on Commonwealth Day, space will be given to the listing of some of the achievements of the Commonwealth which cover every discipline and every range of human and public activity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you. The importance of it did not grip me at the time. I rise to question the attitude which the Australian Government took when it decided that the second Monday in March would be the day on which to celebrate the achievements of the Commonwealth. The second Monday in March has a particular significance for people in Victoria; it is Labour Day in Victoria. I think that it would have been appropriate for the Commonwealth, unless there were very important considerations, to avoid a clash of interests on that day. I do not know why the second Monday in March has been adopted. The second paragraph of the statement reads:</PARA></TALK.START>

Second, this year Australia will host the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting for the first time. </PARA>
<PARA>The second reason advanced in that statement is a non-sequitur because it has nothing to do with the second week in March. The first reason is somewhat doubtful because, in fact, the Statute of Westminster was assented to not on 9 March 1931, but on 11 December 1931. So, frankly, I do not know what this statement is all about. I am interested to know what attitude the Commonwealth Government took when this matter was raised at, presumably, the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-as indicated by the former Chairman of the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Senator Missen, when giving notice of motion for the disallowance of the Nature Conservation Ordinance, notice was given on the last available day for giving notice in order to preserve the rights of the Committee while it concluded its inquiry. The Committee was concerned to secure a balance between the laudable objectives of the Ordinance and the preservation of the rights and liberties of individuals affected by its provisions. Matters of concern to the Committee included: The unfettered discretion conferred by the Ordinance on officers to exercise certain powers; the unduly wide conferral of powers of search and entry under paragraph 77 (2) (a) of the Ordinance unconfined to matters in connection with the Ordinance and the further implication of the admissibility in court of evidence so gained; the automatic forfeiture of any animal or plant which is the subject of an offence or of any substance or any thing used in or in connection with the commission of an offence; restrictive provisions concerning the keeping of pets and the importation of live fish into the Australian Capital Territory; and the possibility that prosecutions could be launched, under various provisions of the Ordinance, for offences which might reasonably be regarded as trivial.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) has undertaken to amend provisions of the Ordinance to ensure that powers of officers will be exercised on reasonable grounds and that search and entry powers will be confined to matters connected with the Ordinance, and to leave the forfeiture of plants, animals or goods to the discretion of the court. The Minister also gave assurances to the Committee with respect to the keeping of pets and the importation of fish, and has satisfied the Committee as to the reasons for retention of the prosecution provisions in their current form. The outstanding matter raised by the Committee, which it does not intend to pursue in the context of the Nature Conservation Ordinance, is the admissibility of improperly obtained evidence. The Committee will, however, take up this general principle with the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) and the Law Reform Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> In the light of the explanations and assurances given by the Minister, the Committee has decided to take no further action in relation to the Ordinance. I therefore withdraw Business of the Senate, Notice of Motion No. 1, standing in the name of Senator Missen, in accordance with notice of intention given on Tuesday. Mr Acting Deputy President, you will have noted that I withdrew the notice of motion standing in the name of the former Chairman, Senator Missen. May I, on behalf of the Committee, take this opportunity to acknowledge publicly his contribution to both the Committee and the Senate since he was appointed Chairman in 1978. Happily, his services have not been lost to the Committee as he remains a member and, following the successful Conference of Commonwealth Delegated Legislation Committees held in Canberra last year, will continue his involvement in the field of delegated legislation at the international level as Chairman of the Commonwealth Delegated Legislation Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also wishes to acknowledge the contribution of Senator Evans during his two years on the Committee. In particular, his concern for civil liberties enhanced the Committee's work. Finally, on behalf of the Committee, I wish to pay a special tribute to our former secretary, Mr Harry Evans, who has taken up other duties within the Senate. His vast knowledge, dedication and efficiency have been of inestimable value to the Committee in its performance of its role as the watch-dog over untrammelled, executive, regulation-making power. Members of the Committee congratulate Mr Evans on his advancement and look forward to his further progress as an officer of the Senate. </PARA>

When we resumed on 24 February Mr President made a statement concerning the resignations of Senator Sheil and Senator Rocher.

Yet on the page of the Senate Hansard on which the members of the Senate are listed neither name, Rocher nor Sheil, appears. I am concerned about whether, when we have further divisions, we will still see the names Rocher and Sheil appear, in view of the fact that yesterday in the House of Representatives Mr Rocher was sworn in as a member for Western Australia. That is a matter that I think needs to be corrected. I am pleased that the Acting Government Whip has made the statement he made today. I hope he follows the precedent set by ex-Senator Poyser in similar, but not the same, circumstances due to the death of Senator Milliner whereby after every division a statement was made so that the reason why members of the Opposition did not take part in the division was on the record.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> The thing I want to see corrected is that after each division the names of these two people, whom the President has notified have resigned from the Senate, do not appear as pairs. We will have to come to some other arrangement when there are pairs, if they are in regard to vacancies for the two States of Western Australia and Queensland and an Australian Labor Party senator is paired against such a vacancy. The names of two people who have officially resigned from this place should not appear. One person is now a member of the House of Representatives.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with Senator Cavanagh in voicing my protest at the Government, so early in the sitting of this autumn session, now moving that Government Business take precedence of General Business on Thursday night. This could quite possibly be the forerunner to the same motion that Government Business take precedence of General Business each Thursday night from now until the Parliament rises for the winter recess. I note that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) has moved that after the introduction of the three private members' Bills we go on to Government Business. Of course, that will mean the deliberation of Bills that are already listed on the Notice Paper and if there is time we will go on to debate the Address-in-Reply. Senator Cavanagh has related to the Senate that Senator Chipp complained recently that many matters, particularly those relating to reports, are introduced into this Parliament and honourable senators adjourn debate on them. The matters are listed on the Notice Paper and if the Government continues with this practice those reports will never be brought back into the Senate for discussion. That is of great concern to both Senator Cavanagh and me and to other members of the Opposition side. Like Senator Cavanagh I seek some explanation from the Minister as to why this practice is being introduced in the second week of the first parliamentary sitting for 1981. Is it the Government's intention to continue with this practice each Thursday or can we have an undertaking that it is only to be for tonight, that the usual procedures will prevail after tonight and that we will be given the opportunity to discuss General Business each Thursday night for the remainder of this session?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When this matter was being discussed on Tuesday night I was referring to a statement that had been issued by the Mayor of Gladstone. It concerned the tremendous problems that have occurred in that town as a result of policies pursued by the national Government and implemented by the State Government and the inability of the local government authority in that region of Queensland-Gladstone is a very big provincial city-to meet the infrastructure and community needs arising from the major resource development which is taking place. Of course, that highlights the importance of the Advisory Council for Inter-government Relations. Clearly, if there is to be a continuation of the resource development about which the Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, has been so outspoken, some assistance and forward planning becomes essential for the States and for local government so that the requirements which our citizens demand in respect of their living conditions can be adequately satisfied.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Mayor of Gladstone has indicated that the area is suffering very gravely from the lack of resources, particularly financial resources and community facilities, because of the influx of citizens. That, of course, will be repeated in many parts of the Commonwealth. The role of this Council becomes more and more important. If those policies are to continue a lot more co-ordination and forward planning will be an absolute essential, otherwise people will be living in intolerable housing conditions. There will be shortages of water, housing, roads, schools and all the other community facilities that are the responsibilities of other arms of government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister promised, when in opposition in September 1975, that if he were elected to government he would introduce a new form of federal financial relations. As we know, Senator Carrick in this place has continually praised this Government's efforts and continually expressed the view that the new federalism policy of the Fraser administration would, in fact, solve all of the problems that the States have had in fulfilling their responsibilities. We have to say, however, that whilst Mr Fraser put this in a rather grandiose setting-he talked about protecting the rights of individual citizens and individual freedoms and the need to provide an effective barrier against authoritarian centralist control-his view has not been realised. Some six years after that statement was made the conflicts between the States and the Commonwealth have not lessened but, in fact, have been aggravated by the policies pursued in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Fraser tried to convey the impression that this new form of federal financial relations would enable the States to be freer of central control than was previously the case. To those ends he promised, firstly, to give the States a share of income tax for revenue purposes and, secondly, to allow the States to impose an income tax surcharge or, in theory, to give a rebate, depending upon their own needs, to their taxpayers. Mr Fraser, in his policy document issued in 1975, said that these measures would:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . ensure that the States will have substantially the financial capacity to meet their responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA>Leaving aside that rather clumsy syntax, he was clearly saying that the new kind of financial relationships would enable the States to be better able to look after themselves financially than had previously been the case. The Opposition believes that the policy has been a fraud. What this Government has sought to do can be epitomised in the following way. A central part of this Government's approach has been firstly, to chop back funds to the States to force them to raise taxes and reduce expenditure; secondly, to manipulate the composition of funds going to the States in accordance with the Federal Government's development phobia; and, thirdly, to seek to control even more tightly the economic policies of the State governments. Why is this so? When comparing the figures for the years 1975-76 with each succeeding year we see the various changes that have taken place in the types of payments made to the States and the way in which the States fared under various headings. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at general revenue funds. It is true that they have increased by 74.6 per cent, which is well ahead of the rate of inflation. Of course, that is the area that has been protected by the Whitlam formula. It has to be surely acknowledged that, in fact, the States have had to seek relief from the financial policies of the Commonwealth by the maintenance of the Whitlam guarantee. The continuation of that guaranteed the States that they would get no less than they would have under the Labor Government's formula. That is the reason for the 74.6 per cent rise in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> The general purpose capital fund figures show an actual reduction in money terms of 3.6 per cent. So with that reduction and with inflation up by 48 per cent since the Fraser Government has come to power, obviously there has been a very severe cutback in real terms. That leaves aside the additional responsibilities which the States have to meet in respect of the development proposals which have been encouraged by the Federal Government. It will be argued, of course, that they are decisions which the States themselves make, but unless they are matched by financial help in one way or another the States are put in a subsidiary and secondary position. Special purpose recurrent payments have gone up in money terms by 43 per cent, which I will concede is marginally less than the actual inflation rate. Nevertheless, the sum total of those changes has been to reduce the amount of funds going to the States. Special purpose capital payments have gone down in money terms every year under the Fraser Government. For this current year they are 25 per cent less in money terms than they were in the 1975 Budget which was brought down in the last year of the Labor Government. Overall, including the Loan Council borrowing, this amount totals 33.6 per cent. We must compare this with the 48 per cent inflation rate. We have to come to the conclusion that the States have been badly affected. The only area of growth has been in the area of general revenue grants. That is one of the attributes-even this Government would have to agree-of the continuation of the Whitlam guarantee. </PARA>
<PARA> As we know, this Bill for an Act to amend the Advisory Council for Inter-government Relations Act of 1976 is not a major Bill; it is more a machinery Bill. I draw the attention of the Senate to details in some sections of the Bill. For example, section 4 (1) of the principal Act states that the Council was established with the object of improving inter-government co-operation. It states further that it shall, in accordance with directions given at the Premiers Conference, inquire into and keep under consideration and review matters relating to inter-government co-operation. The Bill leaves untouched the substantive provisions of the principal Act to which I have referred. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, as we know there is considerable disquiet in each of the State governments at the way in which financial relations between the States and the Commonwealth have deteriorated. I draw the attention of the Senate to the fact that the Senate itself is supposed to be a States House. It is part of the Senate's mandatory obligation to protect the rights of the States. Despite all the rhetoric and all the millions of words we have heard in this place from Senator Carrick about co-operative federalism, we find ourselves in March 1981 with six States, regardless of ideological and philosophical differences, ranged together against the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> I referred earlier to the role of federalism in the Government's overall policy. It is the Fraser Government that has pushed the State governments into providing the infrastructure for the development projects it hoped would revive the economy in 1980. We heard a lot during the 1980 elections about the resources boom being on the horizon. The average person and the average member of parliament would have lost any sense of what the boom represented except as it was measured in terms of many billions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA> Just how fanatical the Prime Minister is on the topic of resources development and foreign investment is shown by the fact that even his Treasurer (Mr Howard) thinks he has gone too far, as was revealed recently in a leaked document. The document revealed how far the Prime Minister has gone in using so-called infrastructure loans to the States as an off-Budget channel for dispensing favours. We know, of course, that the States have been forced into huge borrowings to meet infrastructure costs relating to resources development. In fact, this has had a tremendous effect on our domestic interest rates. It is the principal factor causing local government to suffer and to experience great difficulty in meeting loan borrowing commitments. Interest rates in the money market are so competitive as a result of semi-government and State government borrowings that local government cannot get into that area at all. In fact, this is a contributing factor in pushing up the rates of interest in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The leaked document I referred to suggested that the Treasury, whose advice on budgetary and wages policy the Government usually accepts, is out in the cold when it questions development. The document is a submission made to Cabinet by the Treasurer in preparation for the recent Premiers Conference and Loan Council meeting. In the document Mr Howard and his Department warned of the danger to the economy of too rapid growth in infrastructure borrowings and argued against several of the projects. Fortunately, we have seen a continuing public debate by economists and newspaper writers about the matters that I am referring to. There has been discussion on not just one of the projects but on the combination of projects and what effect they have on the domestic economy. The Treasurer's submission reveals the depth of Treasury concern at the spate of resource projects and the pork barrelling that goes with them. The Treasury might have expected its arguments to be well received by a government that pretends to understand the causes of inflation and which sells itself as having a hard-line attitude towards demands on the public purse. Of course, its arguments have been rebuffed. </PARA>
<PARA> The resources boom is placing pressures on our domestic economy in respect of interest rates, State government responsibilities and local government capacity to meet community needs. All of these matters are surely ones that we ought to be discussing in more detail in the national Parliament. We believe the most important aspect of Fraser federalism is its weakening of controls over business, especially the big resource-type development companies, most of which are in the multinational arena. Just at this time of crisis when more than ever governments need to be able to meet, to negotiate with and to understand what these foreign companies and major corporations are doing, unfortunately the States, because of policies pursued by the Fraser Administration, are forced into competing with each other over who can give the biggest hand-outs to business and who can get industry here, there and everywhere else throughout the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> These are the sorts of matters to which the Parliament ought to be giving much more consideration. These are matters central to the success of the Advisory Council, yet clearly they are not receiving sufficient cofsideration in any of the areas I have mentioned. The arms of government at the lower end of the scale-those on the second and third tiers-are placed at considerable disadvantage as a result of policies pursued by the Commonwealth. Therefore, there is need for planning and development of these projects. There is need for consultation with State and local governments on where these projects are to take place. There is need to examine the impact that it will have on our economy and the spin-off effect it will have upon our housing industry and on our manufacturing base. It is necessary to examine also whether it is desirable that the total effect be the establishment of another major export-type development which will place considerable pressures on our Australian dollar and whether there are other implications which I believe and which we on this side of the House believe will have tremendous consequences for the fight against inflation. Clearly, these matters need to be considered by the Government and the inter-government Council which this Bill seeks to amend. They are matters which ought to be the subject of much more public debate and be better understood so that the Council itself can be informed and be able to convey to the national Government the consequences of the economic policies pursued. To the extent that it operates as a process for consultation and dialogue the Opposition will not oppose the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am the newest member appointed to the Advisory Council for Inter-government Relations and I have just attended my first meeting. In that capacity I would like to express a word of appreciation for the fact that Senator Kilgariff has served two terms on the Council. I believe it is only right and proper that we should record the appreciation due to him for the time he has given and the service he has provided in the formative years of the Council.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have a considerable concern for the charter of the Council and all that is involved with it. I think it is quite well known that I am a federalist at heart. I believe very much that the benefits and responsibilities of the three tiers of government should devolve to their respective places. This responsibility concerns finance, administration and performance which should all be administered in their rightful places. The Advisory Council has a big job. I think Senator Gietzelt tends to underestimate it somewhat. The Council members may select for attention the areas which they consider to be of greater importance. They are not directed as to whether they should or should not deal with matters. The members have the right to determine their own priorities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Council has shown that it is capable of looking at matters in considerable depth. Already it has provided valuable advice. Recently it concluded what I understand to be a most valuable report on roads and road funding and is currently taking up consideration of an area of financing. I hope that it can eliminate areas of duplication and improve relationships. Let us get down to the task of making government work better. At present I am unable to comment on how the Council works because I have attended only one meeting. I was impressed with the aura of harmony that seemed to pervade the meeting which I attended. It provided the sort of atmosphere in which problems can be discussed and looked at all round. As has been explained, the Bill is purely machinery. I support the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will devote my remarks exclusively to the Commonwealth Teaching Service Amendment Bill. The purpose of this legislation was indicated very clearly in the second reading speech of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner). Basically, it provides for the transfer of personnel from the Commonwealth Teaching Service to the teaching service of the Northern Territory. This matter has taken some time to negotiate following the transfer of self-government to the Northern Territory and in the course of those negotiations a number of difficulties have emerged which have now been resolved. That is to the credit of the Commonwealth Department of Education and the Government. However, I want to make one or two comments about the nature of the transfer and the difficulties which we think may be inherent in it which should be looked at at a later stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As the Minister's second reading speech points out, the Northern Territory Government has established the Northern Territory Teaching Service. It will introduce complementary legislation in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly so that teachers, henceforth, following the passing of legislation in both chambers, formerly employed by the Commonwealth Teaching Service will be employed by the Northern Territory Teaching Service and will work under the direction and control of that Service. It is quite a sensible and practical arrangement. In drawing attention to the bones, as it were, of the arrangement, I wish to make one or two comments about the problems of teaching in the Northern Territory, whether one be employed by the Commonwealth Teaching Service or by the Northern Territory Teaching Service. Very considerable problems arise for teachers in the Territory form the remoteness of schools, language problems, the high number of Aboriginal children in many schools in the Territory, the consequent cultural and language problems and the isolation of many teachers from the possibility of the exchange of views and experience and so on with other teachers such as exists in the more settled areas of the Commonwealth of Australia. I raise those matters because the 3,000-odd people involved in teaching in the Northern Territory have very special problems which probably are not being catered for adequately in terms of both training and retraining of teachers. </PARA>
<PARA> If a teaching service in the Northern Territory is to have impact, for example, on the many language difficulties which Aboriginal children have, being subject to diverse cultural and language influences and, particularly, if difficulties are to be overcome in teaching Aboriginal children in their own languages, then there is a need for much greater attention, whether it be by the Commonwealth Government or by the Northern Territory Government, to the training of teachers who, I hope, will do that sort of work. In a sense, the Commonwealth has washed its hands of these problems by transferring the responsibilities of the teaching service to the Northern Territory. The Commonwealth Government has responsibilities in respect of Aboriginals throughout Australia-constitutional responsibilities-and one would hope that the expression I used, 'the Commonwealth has washed its hands of these problems', would not prove to be correct and that the Commonwealth will continue to maintain a careful interest in the operation of the Northern Territory Teaching Service, particularly as it relates to the teaching of Aboriginal children and also to the problems of remoteness and isolation which I mentioned earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation provides provisions for teachers to transfer from the Commonwealth Teaching Service to the Northern Territory Teaching Service. There are also provisions in the legislation for transfer back from the Northern Territory Teaching Service to the Commonwealth Teaching Service. As the Minister pointed out in his second reading speech, a Re-appointments Review Committee is to be established to determine eligibility for re-appointment to the Commonwealth Teaching Service under conditions specified in clauses of the Bill. I think it is of the utmost concern that the Commonwealth continue-if I may use this expression about the Commonwealth-to apply its mind to the question of the needs of teachers in the Northern Territory. One particular need may well be to ensure that the Northern Territory Teaching Service does not stagnate in the sense that the 3,000-odd teachers do not have any opportunities for the exchange of views and experience with teachers outside that Service and that the Northern Territory teaching service is not deprived of the capacity to take teachers from elsewhere and, in turn, to send its teachers into other systems. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I make is that I hope that in the future the question of transferability of teachers in and out of the Northern Territory Teaching Service will be looked at with a little more imagination and flexibility than is apparent in the present legislation. I make that as a constructive suggestion because of the importance of the teaching service in the most multicultural part of Australia, the Northern Territory. The problems of that Service are likely to be very considerable. Those problems could only benefit from the capacity for exchange, new experience and new blood coming into the Service. I hope that those matters will be taken on board by the Government for further consideration because, in launching the Northern Territory Teaching Service, there is a very real danger that the Commonwealth will say: 'It is no longer any concern of ours'. We in this chamber will know if the Commonwealth abdicates its responsibilities, particularly in respect of Aborigines, as it has in some States of the Commonwealth, and the standards, which I hope the Commonwealth Parliament insists on, tend to decline. That can be seen-not to put too fine a point on it-in the States of Queensland and Western Australia, for example. Let us make sure that in regard to this legislation that sort of possibility does not arise. Having made those comments, Mr Acting Deputy President, I otherwise commend the Bill to the Senate as a sensible and non-controversial machinery measure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not oppose this Bill, for the reasons which have been outlined by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Button) and which are reinforced by the Northern Territory Teachers Federation. I have discussed this matter with the Federation and it is quite happy that both of the Bills should go forward. I take the opportunity to mention briefly one or two matters which the Government might care to look at. A couple of these have been alluded to by my leader, but I will still go through them. I am pleased that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) is at the table. A couple of the matters that I wish to raise are relevant to his portfolio.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I shall comment initially on the provision for re-entry into the Commonwealth Teaching Service, which is provided for by this Bill. When the CTS was first established some years ago there was an exodus from Darwin to Canberra. I think this was understandable. Many people had spent many years in the outback and welcomed the opportunity to move to Canberra. That movement has slowed down over the years. Whilst that early exodus was understandable I, and I am sure my colleagues in the Northern Territory-I was in the Department of Education at that time-saw it as unfortunate. Yet there needs to be-I make this point very strongly-an ease of movement in and out of the Teaching Service to allow the movement of people from the Australian Capital Territory into the Northern Territory, from the tertiary and further education colleges into the Northern Territory and so on. Teachers need to get to the Australian Capital Territory to attend the Australian National University and other institutions to upgrade their qualifications. Children need to get to the Australian Capital Territory to undertake university studies and so on. So there is a need for people to be able to move in and out. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another real need. If teachers who are thinking of going north see that they might not be able to get back to the Australian Capital Territory they will be reluctant to take that step. So we want an ease of movement from the north to the Australian Capital Territory and from the Australian Capital Territory up to the top. There have been machinery measures in the past to get specialists into the Northern Territory. I refer to art specialists, physical education specialists, music specialists and so on. These movements were originally covered by a secondment provision. In fact, in 1964 I went to the Northern Territory on secondment from Western Australia. There are disadvantages connected with secondment, but I do not think I have to go through them at this stage. Let me reinforce the point that in the Northern Territory we need to get the sort of cross-fertilisation which comes from experienced teachers moving there from the south. I think we can say without being criticised for it that there are some advantages in people from here going north, gaining experience with Aboriginal children and then returning with their experiences having been broadened. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to draw the Minister's attention to a couple of areas of concern upon which he may care to comment and a couple which he may prefer to refer to someone else. I refer firstly to the Guidance and Special Services Section of the Northern Territory Department of Education. There is a particular need in the Northern Territory for a service such as the Guidance and Special Services Section. The Northern Territory has a comparatively large population of servicemen. As we all know, a ridiculous situation exists in the Services whereby personnel are moved every two years. I have criticised this practice previously in the Senate. A large number of the children of servicemen become clients of the Guidance and Special Services Section. They develop social, emotional and other problems, not the least of which is educational, because of this constant movement. We can do nothing about that. I have raised the matter with senior officers in the Services and they are not prepared to change this policy. What we must do, therefore, is to cater for these children. So we must have a good Guidance and Special Services Section to cater for them. </PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of disadvantaged families in the Northern Territory. Of course I do not again have to go through the problems of the Aboriginal families living in towns. I refer to the problem of English as a second language, the problem of lack of experience in that vital nought to five years of age for which parents, through no fault of their own, have not been able to provide the sort of experiential background on which they can build later education. There are deprived non-Aboriginal families. These have basically the same problems as urban Aboriginal families have. They have been described by quite a number of terms, but culturally deprived might be one of the best. So we have a strong need for guidance and special services particularly in the remedial reading area. </PARA>
<PARA> I have some sense of achievement in saying that there was a good Guidance and Special Services Section some years ago. I think it is a pity that in the last five years there has been a change of direction in the way in which this section operates and that there has also been a shortage of funds to enable it to operate effectively. Many of us have made the point that a small system needs basically the same infrastructure as a large system does. We have to look at the Northern Territory as being a State and having many of the States' requirements. We have to have a body to meet these requirements. If one person handles them in New South Wales we need the same one person in the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the responsibility lies with the Northern Territory some assistance is needed. Senator Carrick, when he was Minister for Education, said that in the Northern Territory he would set the standard for the rest of Australia. Certainly, he took some steps in that direction, but it is fair to say that the bulk of Australia would not want to follow some of the standards in the Northern Territory at the moment. This is not the Northern Territory's fault. I understand that the Northern Territory has asked for additional funds. The particular project I have in mind is the Aboriginal outstation movement. The Territory has asked for funds for this movement, and its request has been denied. I take particular exception to that because the Federal Government allowed the outstation movement, or the homelands centre movement, whatever it may be called, to be established. It must not desert the movement at this stage, by withdrawing or withholding its finance. It is too much to expect the Territory Government to carry the whole exercise by itself. It is beyond what any State government would be expected to do. I put it to the Minister that he give some thought to providing extra finance to that most valuable outstation movement. </PARA>
<PARA> A similar situation is occurring in relation to the Batchelor Teacher Education Centre. Some honourable senators will know that the Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory are trained over three years and that those three years are interpersed with work in their schools. They spend their time at the Teacher Education Centre at Batchelor. Because of government policy relating to finance and staff ceilings, the people who move away from their schools to go to Batchelor for this vital extra training are not replaced. So initially there is some reluctance to let people go. When a headmaster sees that these people must not be denied this opportunity he is left with one, two or three people short on his staff. This is just not good enough. Schools, children and the whole community are deprived when the people, firstly, are denied the opportunity to go or, secondly, are not replaced if they get that opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> Aboriginal teachers are vital. We do not have to debate this matter. All honourable senators who have been connected with education in the Northern Territory would like to see the Aboriginalisation of the whole of the system up to the Director. This will not happen unless we see a steady growth of teachers. Aboriginal parents also see the need for their people to be trained. I was advised that on Tuesday of this week, the parents in the Maningrida, Milingimbi, Goulburn Island and Galiwinku communities all kept their children at home in protest at the fact that the Department was not replacing Aboriginal teaching assistants who were going to Batchelor. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area to concern is migrant education, both adults and children. I think it is fair to say that the Northern Territory has probably the most cosmopolitan group of people in Australia. There is a variety of ethnic backgrounds. There is a continual influx of people from European countries. Many of the local children who were born in Darwin come to school at the age of five or six years with no knowledge of English. So there is still a problem even with children who are born in the Territory. There are Timorese children in the Territory. Unfortunately, there is only a slow dribble into the Territory. Nevertheless they are continuing to come to Australia and they need to be looked after. There is no need for the sort of school that was established in 1975 to cope with the large numbers who came out at that time, but ongoing help is needed. I am sure that Senator Kilgariff, who opened the Tamarind Centre recently, will support the proposition that the Vietnamese population-both children and adults-need some assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Davidson is not in the chamber, but we could not mention education in the Northern Territory without mentioning the Davidson report on education of isolated school children. I commend the recommendations in this report to the Government. I will not go through them again. Several senators, including Senator Davidson, have been through them. They are still relevant. I would like the Government to give a clear indication of what it intends to do. Those of us who were fortunate enough to go to the Canadian High Commission recently to see the Telidon demonstration appreciate just what opportunities are available for isolated people, including isolated children through this form of technology. That is another avenue for the Government to look at when it is thinking of facilities to be provided for isolated children. This sort of thing cannot be provided simply by a State; there will have to be some federal assistance also. </PARA>
<PARA> While on the subject of communications, I trust that when the Dix committee brings down its recommendations they will include some which will enable the children of the Northern Territory to have school broadcasts the year round. We might even get some of our own instead of taking them from Queensland when it is convenient for Queensland to let us have them. </PARA>
<PARA> At the tertiary level the students' living accommodation problem that I have mentioned previously in this place has now been partially overcome with the setting up of the Young Men's Christian Association-Young Women's Christian Association hostel. I hope that the Government will look at further campus accommodation and let the Darwin Community College do the job for which it was established. I hope that wise counsel will prevail and that we will not see a university in the Northern Territory. I know that there has been a change in the basic thinking of the university. The concept is now of something special and not of just another Flinders or another Murdoch. Without pursuing this very far, let us get to the point of saying: ''We will build this university and set it up if the Federal Government gives us money'. The Federal Government, through its Tertiary Education Commission, has made it quite clear that it does not intend to give us money. So we might as well direct our energies in the Northern Territory to making sure that the Community College does the job for which it was set up and that we do not divert funds which are vitally needed in other areas to setting up something which was, let us face it, only a political gimmick at the time it was introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> I have spoken previously of the uniqueness of the Northern Territory situation. I will not dwell on it again. I simply remind Ministers of the particular problems of the Northern Territory and ask them to consider ways of providing finance to assist. In conclusion I make the point that we do not oppose either of the two Bills which are before us at the moment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank both honourable senators who have taken part in this cognate debate on two associated Bills, the purpose of which has been set out by the speakers who preceded me. It is good to hear honourable senators with specific professional knowledge bringing that knowledge into debates in the Senate. I acknowledge that the speaker who preceded me has a professional background in this area which makes his contribution particularly apposite. I understand that these Bills are the result of an approach made to us by the Northern Territory itself and that this approach has the support of all the appropriate authorities there, including the Teachers Federation and other bodies which would have been involved in the discussions which led to the Bills. For that reason I do not think it is really appropriate to use the phrase that was used by the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Button) when he said that the Commonwealth was washing its hands. The Commonwealth is in fact responding to an approach from within the Northern Territory to take a step really to overcome an inconsistent situation in which the Northern Territory had responsibility for the teaching function but did not have the responsibility to employ its own teachers or to have its own teaching service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable senators who spoke in this debate made a number of specific points, and I will just take a moment to respond to some of them. The Commonwealth will maintain its membership of the Bilingual Education Consultative Committee. A Department of Aboriginal Affairs committee is responsible for allocating funds, certainly in the area of education. Some concern was expressed that there may be some kind of diminution in effort or involvement in Aboriginal education. I think that point is worth making. The Commonwealth has already had discussions at officer level with people in the Northern Territory and has offered the Northern Territory the opportunity to make use of existing Commonwealth Teaching Service expertise, particularly in the early stages of the operation of the Northern Territory Teaching Service which, as I think all honourable senators will know, was created this week or last week by legislation of the Northern Territory. That arrangement, of course, could be extended or continued as an ongoing arrangement, as seems suitable to the parties as time goes on. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter raised by Senator Robertson was the situation which occurred on, I think, 3 March at Maningrida, Millingimbi, Galiwinku and, I think, Goulburn Island, where students were kept at home as a protest at the failure of the Department of Education to replace teaching assistants who were attending courses at the Batchelor college. Of course, this is appropriately a matter for the Northern Territory but it is of interest to the Senate in the context of what we are discussing today. The Northern Territory Government is finding it difficult to respond to immediate Aboriginal needs at all communities. </PARA>

It has not been possible to provide replacements at all schools in all cases, but it is not true to say that there have been no replacements in any situations. In fact some replacements have been made already. I understand the Northern Territory Teachers Federation has criticised the Education Department for the situation that has arisen in the areas that were mentioned by name. I understand that an approach has been made to my Department in Darwin seeking assistance in the form of extra grants. There is a proposal that there should be funding of 20 extra positions of assistant teachers during the 1981-82 program. That proposal is currently being evaluated. I cannot say how it will be resolved, but it is currently under consideration. A number of other matters were raised. I will just mention one of them. The Northern Territory has already put in an application to the Commonwealth Grants Commission for special funds, which would include extra funds for outstations. That was another point raised by Senator Robertson in his contribution. That application is still under consideration and the total amount being sought is approximately $52m.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Bill is quite an important and significant piece of legislation for two reasons: First, it highlights the hypocrisy of this Government on the whole issue of a national police force. Honourable senators will recall what was said during 1972-75 when the then Opposition rejected attempts by the Whitlam Labor Government to set up a national police force-Australia Police. One has only to look back at the debates at that time to see the arguments that were produced and the slanderous statements that were made about the endeavours to rationalise our police forces that were operating in the national centre. Of course the then Senator Murphy was traduced and harassed about those proposals as was his successor in the other place, Mr Enderby. It is incredible that, after raising various spectres of a vicious super-police apparatus, we now have the same forces, the same group, the same conservative coalition proceeding in government to carry out the thrust of re-organising the two police forces into the Australia Police. It is also adopting a number of the propositions of the Whitlam Government in respect of complaints against police.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> More generally, the Bill is significant in that it purports to deal with one of the greatest problems in our society-the misuse of power by those in authority. As we know, all the States are following, as the Commonwealth now is, procedures which establish a process by which citizens can seek remedy for the misuse of powers by those in authority, in this case, the Australian Police. All States have now found it necessary to establish an Ombudsman service by which citizens can seek relief against the activities of public authorities. This Bill seeks to provide a means by which citizens can seek some relief from the actions taken against them by members of the Australian Police. It has to be stressed here that one needs to be a very courageous sort of person to lay an information against someone in authority, particularly someone in the police force. One needs not only courage but also some resource and some strength of character to do so because, inevitably, it is a case of a citizen taking on a goliath. So often many citizens who have justifiable complaints against the police do not avail themselves of the processes available to them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Ombudsman's report which was presented to the Parliament just recently reveals a number of instances in which the Commonwealth Ombudsman has had complaints referred to him relating to the deficiencies in, attitudes of and complaints about the behaviour of the police, some of which can be said to have been justified and, of course, some which were found to be unjustified. The Opposition takes the view that the rights of the citizen are paramount in these matters. We do so because we believe the citizen is put in an invidious position, a secondary position, in our society. Taking into account the way in which our society is structured the citizen is at a disadvantage compared with those in authority. </PARA>
<PARA> In saying that, I do not wish to smear the police force because it, too, is in a difficult position. It is very difficult for police officers to make an on-the-spot value judgment in respect of many of the borderline cases that they have to deal with. We concede that the vast majority of police officers carry out their duties in a fair, proper and quiet way. Nevertheless, we are concerned for those citizens who feel, rightly or wrongly, that their rights have been abused. They seek, therefore, to have their complaints dealt with in a fair and reasonable way. From the point of government, it is important that those processes are seen to be fair and to operate fairly because the credibility of the police force itself is at stake. If people do not know that they have rights and are not in a position to exercise them without fear or favour, the police could easily fall into a position of disrepute. </PARA>
<PARA> My position is one of some bias towards the citizen because I believe the citizen so often is placed in a position where he is subject to actions which, in his view, often are not properly carried out by the arresting officer. I think there is plenty of evidence of that in the various reports that have come before us. There is certainly plenty of evidence of that in the States to the extent that the governments in the various States have seen fit to pass legislation similar to that which we are now discussing in order to protect the rights of citizens. </PARA>
<PARA> Having made those remarks, let me say that my party does not oppose the Bill. We have been persuaded that the Bill is a very important step forward in providing a process by which citizens can seek some relief. Nevertheless, we still say that it is far from perfect because all the recommendations that were made by the Australian Law Reform Commission have not been adopted, although the Government does seem to have adopted a great proportion of the recommendations of that Commission. However, we still believe that the Bill has some deficiencies. We would like to see this matter re-examined in a couple of years to see whether the procedures which are outlined in this Bill are working in the best interests of the citizen. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what these deficiencies are as the Opposition sees them. The first is the general weakening of the role of the Ombudsman as opposed to that set out in the Law Reform Commission report 1978, a report, which, incidentally, is now just over two years old. The main issue I would like to discuss is why the Government did not take steps to give the Ombudsman the power to make a formal recommendation that charges be laid. The Attorney-General (Senator Durack) referred to this in his second reading speech, at page 171 of the Hansard. On this issue the Law Reform Commission said:</PARA>
<PARA> It appears to the Commission that where such an extreme circumstance arose the Ombudsman, as an external and independent guardian of civilian rights, should have the right to ensure that charges are brought so that they can be fairly determined. Clearly it is open to the Ombudsman to express his view on a matter to the Commissioner without making a formal recommendation to charge. In all but the most exceptional case it is envisaged that there would be accord between the approach of the Commissioner and the approach of the Ombudsman. If a situation arose where the Commissioner had good reasons for not accepting the Ombudsman's suggested course of action, these should be made known to the Ombudsman. If a difference still existed, it remains appropriate, in the Commission's view. This right would supplement the Ombudsman's existing rights of report to the Prime Minister or Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>There are many other matters about which the Opposition is concerned. I should like to discuss one or two of them. One is the uncertainty that is caused by that part of the legislation which deals with the role of the Ombudsman. We are now to have two legislation Acts covering the role of the Ombudsman in this area as the Bill before us duplicates the existing provisions in the Ombudsman's Bill. I ask the Minister to clarify this point when he replies. We of the Opposition did have some misgivings about this area of the legislation but as we were persuaded that the legislation was an improvement on some of the processes which exist in the States we decided to give our support to the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, we were concerned that the role of the complainant, as difficult as it is-I am sure that will be conceded by honourable senators-has been reduced. There is a great danger that, in unscrupulous hands, the procedures laid down in the legislation could denegrate into a charade. I am not suggesting that it will. Much depends on the way in which the Disciplinary Tribunal works and much depends upon the personality of the Commissioner. My view is that one way to avoid a degeneration is to have the complainant involved as much as possible. The legislation imposes some restrictions in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA> I stress that it is vital that the procedures for investigating complaints be as flexible as possible. From all the evidence that is available to us and certainly from the Ombudsman's report the impression is that the present Commissioner takes a fair-minded approach to the rights of citizens. But of course much depends upon the personality of the person who holds that important position. As far as is practicable, the legislation should be designed to create an inflexible position in respect of the way in which these matters are handled. We would like, for example, to see a regular review of the processes so that the mechanism does not rust and trap a citizen between the cogs as so often happens in these sorts of matters because of the way in which bureaucracy works generally. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not suggest that in the future the Ombudsman will take an action which would remedy the problem of defective administration relating to personal property but one cannot help feeling very strongly about the rights of the person who on arrival in Australia was arrested on a narcotics charge, and subsequently convicted and imprisoned, and the difficulty he had in respect of his return airline ticket. Whilst the Ombudsman has clearly stated that the Australian Federal Police acted properly throughout the incident, the fact is that the person who was charged and found guilty paid the penalty of being imprisoned and also suffered a financial loss in respect of his airline ticket. It might be argued that ultimately the Ombudsman will find a means by which some relief may be granted to the complainant. But in the view of the prisoner it was the members of the Australian Federal Police who were responsible because they were the ones who arrested him and they were the ones to whom he made the complaint to get some compensation for the loss of his return airline ticket. I do not believe that citizen should be penalised twice for the one crime. The fact is that the matter has not been cleared up satisfactorily from the point of view of the citizen. Other cases show that citizens from time to time feel that the Australian Federal Police have not acted in the best interests of the force or protected the basic civil rights of the complainant. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition could have proposed a number of amendments to this legislation. We in fact considered moving amendments. It is interesting that the Government proposes to bring forward an amendment to the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Bill in relation to the appearance of the complainant or his legal representative before the Disciplinary Tribunal. The proposed amendment is a very useful alteration to the procedures. It does take up one of the points at issue which the Opposition did look at. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is glad to note that under the Australian Federal Police Amendment Bill vicarious liability is to be granted to police. This move also is long overdue and I am sure that all members of the Federal Police will be glad that this move is being made. The Australian Law Reform Commission recommended this change two years ago. It is pleasing that this recommendation has been taken on board by the Government. It has acted in respect of complaints that were certainly prevalent in the States against their forces following the demonstrations against the war in Vietnam. Many members of the State police forces removed identification badges from their uniforms and proceeded to act in a manner which reflected upon their own incapacities to deal with the public indignation at Australia's involvement in the war in Vietnam. It was finally determined by the State authorities that at all demonstrations policemen should wear their identification badges. We are pleased-this is a factor that has led us to support the legislation-that this is provided for in this legislation. In those circumstances, the Opposition will neither oppose the legislation nor oppose the proposed amendment which has been circulated today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Bill 1981 and the Australian Federal Police Amendment Bill 1981. These are two parts of the Government's reform legislation and are an excellent carrying out of the recommendations made by the Australian Law Reform Commission in its report in 1975 and its subsequent report in 1978. I listened with almost agitation at first to Senator Gietzelt's original blast which appeared to suggest that he had severe reservations about the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Bill. But it was not long before, in the ebb and flow of his speech, he made it clear that he regarded the Bill as an important step forward in providing relief for citizens, but that it was far from perfect. I suppose that the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) could not expect to get a commendation for the Bill's being perfect. I do not suppose that we have ever passed a Bill in this Parliament that was perfect. But I think this Bill has been the subject of a great deal of examination and consideration and it is a very worthy tribute to the efforts of the Attorney-General and his staff.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YL7">Senator MISSEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Evans said the legislation is a tribute to the Attorney-General's speed. Speed has not been altogether easy to achieve in this matter. One realises that over a period there have been considerable changes to the Australian Federal Police. A new structure was created. Since then discussions between the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police and the Commonwealth Ombudsman have led to the introduction of some of the clauses in the Bill. At first sight they may appear complicated but the various responsibilities of these bodies have been worked out and a system created which may work, I think, quite effectively. This justifies a certain amount of time being taken in achieving that result.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We do have a problem in this community, which Senator Gietzelt referred to when he spoke about the need for individuals to be courageous in lodging complaints. No doubt there are risks in lodging complaints against police. Here I speak of complaints made against police throughout the country, not so much in the Federal sphere. I think that very few complaints are made against the Australian Federal Police. But there have been many more problems and inquiries into police forces in the various States of Australia. I am particularly familiar with the Beach inquiry in Victoria and the Beach report and subsequent dealings with that report. I realise that some people who complained found that they suffered very considerably and were embarrassed. Accordingly, they had to show much courage in coming before the commissioner, now Mr Justice Beach, with complaints which often were found to be thoroughly justified. The inquiry was helpful not only in Victoria but also in other States because it was a fearless inquiry and resulted in a fearless report. The report, I think, has helped in making people throughout Australia understand that although this is a democratic country things can happen. In a police force in which there is a majority of sincere, conscientious, hard-working policemen, there always will be a number of bad hats. It is therefore important that complaints be examined properly and that justice not only be done but appear to be done and that people have the opportunity of being heard in regard to complaints which they make about police misconduct. This Bill offers such a system and is therefore worthwhile. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not go into the details of what is achieved by this Bill at great length because the second reading speech by the Attorney-General gives an admirable summary of the effective things which this Bill does. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . its purpose' 'is to establish a system which permits just and thorough investigation of complaints against police, while at the same time upholding morale and discipline in the difficult work police have to do'. </PARA>
<PARA>The second aspect of that has led to the delicate arrangement between the work which will be done under the provisions of this Bill by the newly created Internal Investigation Division, which is in operation by administrative action and which will be regularised by this Bill, and the efforts which the Ombudsman will make in the consideration of complaints. I believe that the Ombudsman has a very substantial role to play. Senator Gietzelt complained about duplications in this Bill and the Ombudsman Act. Indeed, I was puzzled by that complaint because I think that the Bill does the opposite. One variation recommended by the Law Reform Commission which has been accepted is that separate powers conferred in the Ombudsman Act are not to be maintained when the Ombudsman is dealing with complaints against police. In fact, the powers of the Ombudsman have been written into this Bill so that these powers can be seen clearly by people who want to check the rights of individuals in dealing with complaints against the police force. </PARA>
<PARA> When complaints have been made about practices and procedures of the force-that is, the more general complaints that may be made about more than one individual's problem-these ordinarily will be investigated by the Ombudsman. By and large, other complaints about an individual officer's work or action will be investigated initially by the Internal Investigation Division. Thereafter, if the Ombudsman is dissastisfied with the investigation by the Investigation Division, he can ask for a further investigation to be carried out or carry out an investigation through his office. He is in the position of being able to second guess, to try to elucidate further facts. In addition, under special circumstances, the Bill provides special procedures for the Commissioner and the Ombudsman to agree to either the Ombudsman or a person outside making some initial investigation of a complaint. There is also a provision, where they cannot agree, for the Minister for Administrative Services to make a decision. </PARA>
<PARA> I think a complaint was made by Senator Gietzelt that one recommendation from the Law Reform Commission's report that was not accepted was that the Ombudsman should be able to make a formal recommendation that charges proceed. There is, of course, recognition that the taking away of the formal responsibilities of the Commissioner could be damaging to his standing and be damaging to morale in the police force. It is provided, however, that if there is disagreement on whether charges should be lodged then the Minister will make the final decision. He has a responsibility to Parliament. These matters will be reported to Parliament. Therefore, provision has been made for a third party to make a final decision on whether a charge is to be lodged against a policeman after investigation. </PARA>
<PARA> There are, of course, substantial provisions in the Bill for the setting up of a Federal Police Disciplinary Tribunal. The Tribunal may in many cases, be constituted by a judge of the Federal Court of Australia or of the Supreme Court of a State or Territory, or in some cases by a magistrate. When the Tribunal is constituted by a judge, the penalties may be imposed by him. Different provisions apply in relation to appeals whether the Tribunal is constituted by a judge or a magistrate. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest, that the variations from reports of the Commission are seen, on reflection, to be very minor ones. They are usually matters of judgment which, I think, in all cases, are sound judgments. They are set out in detail in the second reading speech of the Attorney-General. I think they are worthy of justification. One, which I will refer to later, is the subject of an amendment of which the Government has given notice and which I strongly support. The Bills demonstrate that very careful consideration has been given to the needs of the public and also the needs to maintain a police force in which the substantial power of the Commissioner are not in any way vitiated or destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA> The second Bill, as we are aware, amends the Australian Federal Police Act and provides for vicarious liability in the case of civil claims concerning the Commonwealth. It applies in cases where police are involved in civil claims and it overcomes an anomaly which has existed for many years. It also provokes the provision in regard to the identification of the police. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It means second hand, as my colleague says. It concerns the liability of the Commonwealth for the actions of a second party-of one of its servants-and the liability which that servant engages, he also being responsible. If he has no assets or no means whatsoever it is very important that the Commonwealth, as employer, should accept that responsibility. It does in most other areas of activity in the Public Service, but curiously it does not in a policeman's action. Of course, this could mean that in court judgments against policemen-perhaps for substantial damages or for damages for assault-if the policeman is worthless financially it is quite wrong that the person should not be able to recover those damages. I think this provision is a very useful alteration of the law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the course of the consideration of this Bill there have been many discussions, I know, between the Commissioner and the Ombudsman. These discussions have resulted finally in the scheme which is set out in this Bill. I am aware that there have also been discussions between the law and government committee of the Government parties and the Attorney-General and his officers. I thank him for the assistance he has given to the members of that committee in the consideration of this Bill. In the recess that committee put up quite a number of proposals which, in almost every case, have been accepted by the Attorney-General. I think they have added to the clarification of the Bill and the way in which it may be effective. </PARA>
<PARA> A further matter arises in the amendment which will be moved in the Committee stage and which I should say a little bit more about. I shall say something on that matter now so I will not need to repeat my remarks when the amendment is actually moved. I refer to the situation which arises when a complainant would not, under the Bill as originally drafted, have any right to appear and be represented by counsel in proceedings before the Tribunal. Anyone who has read some of the reports in the States will realise that not always is an investigating policeman all that anxious to proceed to look into a complaint. Some complaints are not looked at thoroughly and the complainant has a just cause to complain about that. Perhaps his credit is affected. He wants to see justice done and if he is merely a witness before the Tribunal he may find himself without any strength in pressing his case. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Australian Law Reform Commission report of 1975 reference was made to this proposal. A number of people had given evidence before the Commission and had suggested that they should be entitled to be represented. It was not suggested and it is not proposed, of course, that the complainant should be an actual party or that the mistake should be made of such a polarisation of police and citizen interest that they would be seen as being opposite parties to each other, but there should be a right for a representation by the complainant so that he can be protected and his views can be properly expressed. In the first report the Law Reform Commission gave on this subject, at paragraph 175, it stated:</PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, the special interests of the complainant and the policeman concerned have to be recognised. It would be unreal to suppose that they have insufficent 'interest' to support an appearance. In the Commission's opinion the hearing can be prevented from becoming outright litigation between the complainant and the accused member of the police. </PARA>
<PARA>The report went on:</PARA>
<PARA>The just rights of the policeman and member of the public can be protected by ensuring that the policeman charged has a right to representation and the complainant a privilege to seek leave of the Tribunal to be represented. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commission's putting it in that lesser way is, of course, a recognition that generally speaking witnesses in litigation do not have any rights. In a prosecution of some person a witness is protected by the Crown and does not generally have a right of appearance. Nonetheless, in these complaints and these types of proceedings that witness may have a very considerable interest.</PARA>
<PARA> In the second report, which came about after the setting up of the Australian Federal Police, the Commission considered and then reported to the Attorney-General on the matter of complaints against police. In paragraph 115 of the report of 1978 the Commission stated:</PARA>
<PARA>The Complainant The complainant is not a party to proceedings before the tribunal. In the Commission's first report it was proposed that the complainant might, by leave of the tribunal, appear before it on the hearing of a charge arising out of his complaint. He might be represented but should only take such part in the proceedings as the tribunal permits. Normally, the carriage of the charge will remain with the police. Within the discretion of the tribunal, there may be good reasons why it should be possible for the complainant to be represented and otherwise to participate, where that is appropriate. The success of the adversary system depends in part upon vigorous, motivated adversaries. The facility to permit the complainant an active role will be a security against half-hearted prosecution on the part of police. In most cases the complainant will be simply one witness and the need for representation of his own would in such circumstances not be established without more. If leave to appear is granted provision should be made for financial assistance by the Commonwealth towards costs and expenses. </PARA>
<PARA>The amendment of which the Attorney-General has give notice today makes it clear that it should be only special circumstances that justify the Tribunal's allowing a person to be represented. To give that right and to enable the Tribunal thereby to judge the circumstances and grant that right under such limited terms as it may think fit is, I think, a useful amendment and one which I trust the Senate will support. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to refer to one other matter. Government members who were considering this matter had some doubt about the fact that there was no recognition in the Bill of the standard of proof that would be required before the Tribunal in its hearing of charges. It has been clearly pointed out that this matter has been fairly decisively determined by Mr Justice Fox in Scanes v. Wilson which is reported at page 262 of the 1974 Federal Law Reports. I would like to quote from that judgment because I think it is important to realise that in the hearing of these disciplinary charges the standard of proof is very clearly not the criminal standard of proof beyond reasonable doubt but the civil standard. The judge, in his judgment dealing with appearances before a board and the standard applying, said:</PARA>
<PARA> The proceedings were of course disciplinary and not criminal-</PARA>
<PARA>I will leave out the case to which he then referred. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>The standard of proof in disciplinary proceedings against legal practitioners is on a balance of probabilities . . . The board was of the view that it was following precedent established in the States, but I have made inquiries and I find that the Crown Employees' Appeal Board in New South Wales, which deals with police appeals, among others, applies the civil standard, of proof on a balance of probabilities . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The judge also said:</PARA>
<PARA> The gravity of a charge is of course always a matter which influences the mind when applying that standard. </PARA>
<PARA>He made reference to Mr Justice Dixon, as he then was, and his judgment in Briginshaw v. Briginshaw. That noted judge said:</PARA>
<PARA> Except upon criminal issues to be proved by the prosecution, it is enough that the affirmative of an allegation is made out to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal. But reasonable satisfaction is not a state of mind that is attained or established independently of the nature and consequence of the fact or facts to be proved. The seriousness of an allegation made, the inherent unlikelihood of an occurrence of a given description, or the gravity of the consequences flowing from a particular finding are considerations which must affect the answer to the question whether the issue has been proved to the reasonable satisfaction of the tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA>It appears fairly clear that the standard of proof of this Tribunal is reasonably fixed and does not require to be set out in the Bill. I believe that this Bill is an excellent contribution by the Government to the law reform program. It is important that we carry out, where possible, the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission. I hope that the same will apply to criminal investigation which is to some extent a neighbouring and very significant area. It is not that we see or have seen at present or in the past examples of mistakes or a great deal of objectionable action by Commonwealth Police. It is important that we have a system in operation which effectively deals with the area and which means that citizens can approach if they wish the Ombudsman, in this case, or sometimes the police, and make their complaints and know that they will be dealt with. They know that in making complaints-one has to be realistic-great dangers are involved. A policeman or other person against whom a charge is made can be vindictive and can do damage to the complainant. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important, therefore, that a proper system shall exist in our law which enables these complaints to be properly investigated. It may be that this particular system does not work perfectly and will need changes. No doubt those concerned with law reform will keep watching it. I believe that this will be a good system and will work effectively. Some of the States have experienced complaints, reports and detailed investigations. The Lucas reports about police activity in Queensland are one example. It has been stated that complaints have not been properly investigated. Judges also have complained in recent years. I do not pick that example out as one that is in any way unique. We know that proper methods do not exist in Queensland and other States for investigating complaints against police. </PARA>
<PARA> I trust that the proposals which the Government has put forward will be accepted by this Parliament. I trust that they will be used by all those concerned, including the police, the Ombudsmen and the public in a very reasonable and sensible way, and that they will be vigilant to see that their rights are used. I support this Bill and the amendment of which the Attorney-General has given notice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been an unconscionable time coming, but I welcome the introduction of this legislation very much. It is the first major set of recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission to be picked up and embodied in Commonwealth legislation. It amounts to an important set of institutional safeguards which will go a long way toward rebuilding public faith and confidence and maintaining that confidence in the conduct of our national police force. It must be said that confidence in the national police force and its components, the old Commonwealth Police and the Australian Capital Territory Police, has never been quite so lacking as it has been so conspicuously in respect of the Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australian and, on occasions, Northern Territory police forces. But, at the same time, there are instances and have been instances in recent times-I mention the Low affair in Western Australia and the conduct of the Commonwealth Police in the social security fraud case raids of not so long ago-where the conduct and credibility of our national police force and its component elements have been put in issue. It is crucially important for the maintenance, as I say, of community faith in the national police force for the future that there be a credible mechanism for the resolution of complaints of the kind that is embodied in this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The basic structure of the Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Bill, which is the major of the two Bills now before us, has been well articulated by the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) in his second reading speech and adverted to both by Senator Gietzelt and Senator Missen in their contributions. The Bill putting it simply creats a three-tier mechanism, each element in which has a significant component of independence. First of all, there is a more or less independent investigative unit established within the Australian Federal Police itself; secondly there is the Ombudsman and thirdly, there is an independent disciplinary tribunal presided over by a judge. Within that mechanism it is clear that the ombudsman's role is absolutely central and crucial to the success and credibility of the whole institutional structure. </PARA>
<PARA> The Ombudsman constitutes neutral territory for the receipt of complaints if a potential complainant should be intimidated, as is so often the case in practice, from going to the police themselves with the complaint. The Ombudsman monitors the role of the internal investigative squad, and in this sense is also an investigator of last resort if he, himself, is not satisfied with the conduct of the investigation by that internal unit. I am pleased that the Ombudsman's jurisdiction has ended up in this Bill now before us, after what has obviously been a fairly extended period of negotiation in almost the original form recommended by the Australian Law Reform Commission. It is in this respect that I cannot help noticing-more it is true in sorrow rather than anger, because this is the only State where the Law Reform Commission recommendations have been taken seriously at all-that the New South Wales Government, in picking up and purporting to apply the Law Reform Commission model to the development of its own complaints resolution machinery, has not gone as far as has the Commonwealth in accepting the terms of the Law Reform Commission's recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Commonwealth Legislation, but regrettably not elsewhere, the Ombudsman does have the power to investigate, at the point of receiving complaints, and the general authority to monitor the conduct of the internal investigative unit. Furthermore, again unlike New South Wales, there is a procedure in this Bill by which the Commissioner can be directed to institute disciplinary proceedings even if he disagrees with the Ombudsman as to the merits of such proceedings. This latter point, however, in the form in which it appears in the Bill, amounts to a variation from the precise letter of the Law Reform Commission's recommendation. It appears to be perhaps the only significant looking variation from the recommendations of the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission's recommendation, it will be recalled-this has been mentioned both by Senators Gietzelt and Missen-was that in extreme or exceptional cases where the Commissioner of Police and the Ombudsman disagreed as to whether a disciplinary charge should be brought, the Ombudsman's views should prevail. The Commission recommended that the Ombudsman should be empowered to make a formal recommendation which would, in fact, institute such a proceeding. What has been adopted in this Bill is not that, but a variation upon it in which, in a situation of conflict between the Ombudsman and the Commissioner of Police, the Attorney-General comes into the picture and plays referee to determine whether or not the charge shall be instituted. On balance, this seems to me to be a fairly sensible accommodation of the differing interests involved in what is obviously a very sensitive and potentially quite difficult area. I accept it on the basis that the Attorney-General is, under these circumstances, accountable to Parliament for his actions should he misconstrue the nature of his duties in these situations or misapply them. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also moved by the consideration that the Minister involved here, namely the Attorney-General, is not the Minister otherwise involved in the day to day administration of the Act; that remains with the Minister for Administrative Services. The latter Minister could perhaps be expected to have a close, perhaps too close, relationship with the police to be able to exercise proper judgment in these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> Another variation which has attracted attention on both sides of this chamber as amounting to a variation from the strict letter of the Commission's recommendations is that concerning the attendance or role of the complainant at proceedings of the Disciplinary Tribunal and in particular, the role of the complainant as a party, in a sense, to those proceedings. I note the terms of the amendment circulated by the Attorney-General and, like my colleague Senator Gietzelt, have no objections to the terms in which a compromise seems finally to have been effected on this matter. Indeed, I congratulate the Government for again showing some sensitivity to the substance, if not in every respect the form, of the Commission's recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some other variations from the Law Reform Commission's report but essentially they are of a minor or technical character and will not attract my critical attention in any way. I say all these things because I am used, in this place, to attracting some very critical remarks periodically from the Attorney about my obsession with the observance of the letter of these Commission reports. I want to indicate to him that I do, deep down inside, have a largeness of spirit about these matters which sometimes makes itself evident. However, I cannot let the Attorney-General off the hook entirely in respect of this legislation because there are some matters of which I am highly critical. They relate to the time it has taken to get this legislation enacted. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us recall for just a moment the saga involved here. Back in 1975 the Australian Labor Government decided for the most rational of reasons, which clearly subsequently were accepted by the present Government, to amalgamate the Commonwealth Police, the Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory forces and the ill-starred Narcotics Bureau into a single national police force-Australia Police. It was in the context of that amalgamation proposal and the concern quite legitimately felt on our side of government that there was a necessity to accompany such a move by equally significant moves to delimit and identify and codify the powers of the new police force and to create the machinery for the resolution of complaints made about it. For those reasons we did send the reference to the Law Reform Commission which resulted in the first two reports of the Commission on complaints against police and criminal investigation generally. That was in 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1976, of course, after the change of government, a decision was made to abandon the amalgamation proposal and with it, unfortunately, for the moment the Law Reform Commission's reports went into limbo. However, in 1977 the Government, with the then Attorney-General, Mr Ellicott, determined to reactivate both the criminal investigation and the complaints reports and in respect of the latter directed the Law Reform Commission to reconsider and rewrite as necessary its recommendations about complaints so as to make them applicable to a force still divided into its original components. The Law Reform Commission duly did that in its ninth report which is the one on which, clearly, the current legislation is based. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1978, however, at roughly the same time as the Law Reform Commission was reporting an appropriate structure for a disaggregated police force, the Government, in one of its more spectacular changes of mind which have characterised its progress since 1975, decided that amalgamation was not such a bad idea after all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator uses the word 'flexibility' but there are other words and descriptions that spring more readily to mind. However, I do not think they are appropriate ones to deploy in a chamber of the gentlemanly character that the honourable senator is contributing to. So, particularly in the light of the grotesque character of the opposition that was expressed to the almost identical Labor Government proposals in 1975, hypocrisy seems to be an indispensible concomitant to this Government's decision making, even when it is heading in the right direction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1979, the decision having been made to amalgamate the Commonwealth Police and the Australian territorial forces into what is now the Australian Federal Police, a Bill, of course, was introduced to accomplish this and it came before this Parliament in June 1979. The Bill lacked any accompanying set of provisions about complaint resolution machinery. In an endeavour to rectify that manifest deficiency the Opposition moved what may be remembered as one of the longest sets of amendments ever moved in this place, which amounted in effect to a proposal to embody within the parent Australian Federal Police Act the complaints resolution procedures specified and recommended by the Law Reform Commission. The Government rejected those amendments. Senator Chaney, then the relevant Minister, said that a separate complaints Bill would be brought before the Parliament 'later this year'-that was in June 1979. </PARA>
<PARA> On 6 November 1979 I rather churlishly asked Senator Chaney in this place what had happened to his promise to bring forward a separate complaints Bill by the end of the year. Senator Chaney's reply on 6 November was that he did not recall having made any such commitment but that he would let me have a reply in due course, which reply, in fact, was never forthcoming. In July 1980 a Press release issued by the present Attorney-General stated that he would in fact introduce a complaints Bill in the Budget session; that was the Budget session last year. Not until this year, on 26 February 1981, did we at last get such a Bill. This was five years after the basic draft was done by the Law Reform Commission; two and three-quarters years after the second draft of the re-write of that basic model was prepared by the Law Reform Commission in its subsequent report; 21 months after the Opposition introduced into this Parliament amendments which in their substance, if not in their actual form, were almost identical in every significant respect with the legislation brought on for debate today. I make the point that there is just no excuse for this kind of delay. This Government's commitment to lethargy in government seems to be almost ideological in character. It is a disappointing state of affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> I will make just two further points, both of which pick up matters mentioned very much in passing by Senator Missen. The first of them is simply this: I hope that this legislation will prove to be model legislation for the police forces of the Australian States and, indeed, for the Northern Territory as well. I have noted that its terms, embodying as they do the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission, have been adopted in part by New South Wales. I hope that New South Wales will now go the rest of the distance. Even more fervently I hope that the other States which have not adopted this essential model with its tripartite components of an internal unit, an Ombudsman and an independent tribunal will pick it up and apply it to their own circumstances. As I have already indicated I hope that this is done particularly in Queensland as was demonstrated by the Lucas report, particularly in Victoria, as was demonstrated by the Beach report, and particularly in Western Australia where there have been no official reports but where there has been ample demonstration in newspaper accounts of the character of police misbehaviour. Indeed, in almost every other jurisdiction in Australia there is a need for formal, sensitive and sensible machinery of the kind contained in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The other and remaining point that I make is simply this: The complaints legislation before us today represents only half of the job. Back in 1975, as I have already indicated, when a new national police force was set in train and an amalgamation proposal was advanced, the then Government always envisaged it as being necessarily a two-pronged exercise so far as the accompanying legislation was concerned. It was envisaged that there would have to be complaints resolution machinery establishing effective disciplinary procedures and it was envisaged also that inextricably connected with it there would need to be legislation laying out a code of conduct in relation to criminal investigation powers generally-that is, the powers of police with respect to such things as arrest, interrogation, the right to silence, search and seizure, electronic surveillance, identification procedures and entrapment. In fact, as I have mentioned, the Law Reform Commission produced in its second report in 1975 not just a complaints model which was the subject of its first report but also a very detailed set of recommendations governing all these matters. I refer of course to the report on criminal investigation. </PARA>
<PARA> That report not only set out a code of behaviour under all those various heads and others as well but also indicated the kind of sanctions that were appropriate for breaches of that code of behaviour. One such sanction was an evidentiary one, that is to say, the potential loss of evidence illegally obtained by police when they brought their case to court. The other accompanying sanction related to disciplinary procedures being applicable to police officers who breached the basic ground rules. It was with that in mind that the disciplinary procedures involved in the independent police tribunal that is being created by this legislation was originally foreshadowed. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the saddest chapters in the application of what I have described elsewhere as Durack's law, that is the law that the affirmative response to reports of bodies such as the Law Reform Commission varies in inverse proportion to the importance of the subject matter and the quality of their supporting argument, has been in respect of that very same criminal investigation report. A Bill was introduced by Senator Durack's predecessor, Mr Ellicott, back in 1977. I do not seek to speak ill of the politically dead. In fact, I congratulate Mr Ellicott on producing that Bill, which did bring forward in very substantial part the recommendations of the Commission even though, in the Labor Party's view, there were spectacular inadequacies in respect of at least one part of that Bill. That Bill was subsequently withdrawn without ever being properly debated. </PARA>

I hope that now there will be at last some sign of energy and enthusiasm on the part of this Government for bringing forward proper criminal investigation legislation. I understand that the mills have been grinding slowly, that there is some redrafted version of this Bill now in existence deep within the bowels of the Attorney-General's Department and that it will perhaps appear at some future stage. I ask the Attorney-General, in his reply to the second reading debate, to give a clear and accurate indication of when we might expect that Bill to be brought forward. I urge him most strenuously to get on and complete the job that has been at last so splendidly begun with this legislation here today.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to relate to the Senate some of the things that are happening in the Australian Federal Police at present. As an introduction let me say that at the time the Labor Government introduced into the Parliament a Bill for the purpose of amalgamating the police forces of the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory and the Commonwealth Police. I was the Minister for Police and Customs. I was transferred from another ministerial portfolio, I think, only for the purpose of trying to stop some of the opposition in Australia to the proposed Australian Police Bill. The Bill was introduced as a result of one of Whitlam's policies in the 1972 general election. One body which was in opposition to the Australian Police Bill was the Council for Civil Liberties, which is an Australia-wide organisation. The Council was firmly of the belief that the Government intended to set up a type of Federal Bureau of Investigation in Australia which would inquire and pry into the private life of every citizen in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It was never our intention to do that. I had been a member of the Council's New South Wales branch before the South Australian Council was formed and I had been a member of the Council since its formation in my State. It was thought that, because of my record with the Council for Civil Liberties, this charge could not be sustained and would not be proceeded with. At the time of considering the Bill we had before us a report by Alan Carmody, who at that time was the head of the Department of Police and Customs. He had travelled the world on a government assignment to study the various police forces around the world. He came back with the suggestion of an Australian police force along the lines of the Canadian Mounted Police Force, which is not a mounted police force at present. There was also a proposal for the introduction of what was called Division 10, which was a Scotland Yard innovation, for the purpose of inquiring into complaints against the police. Of course a special division of men would have needed training for the purpose of inquiring into complaints. That would have been their main job. </PARA>
<PARA> At that time we had before us the report of an outside investigation and Mr Justice Kirby's report, one feature of which was that there was a role for the Commonwealth Ombudsman. From those reports we formulated the Australian Police Bill which was presented to the Parliament. Immediately the Bill was made known together with the results an outside investigation, the complaints of the Council for Civil Liberties ceased and the complaints of all Australian police forces commenced. I had deputations daily from both the Australian Capital Territory police and the Commonwealth Police, protesting about that legislation. A protest was made that there was some snobbery in the Australian Capital Territory Police and that because they were professional policemen they did not want to be associated with the Commonwealth Police. They did not want to be associated with those who guarded embassies and whom they called night watchmen. The Australian Capital Territory Police did not want to be associated because their opportunities for promotion in a bigger force would be fewer. </PARA>
<PARA> There was condemnation from both forces. All State police forces, through the federation of police, voiced opposition to the proposal that an investigation into complaints against the police be carried out by an outsider. Their argument was that there would be an investigation carried out by unqualified people who did not possess the investigative capabilities of a uniformed policeman or a detective. I received an invitation to speak to policemen in a club at Canberra where there was plenty to drink. The police were hostile and I had to be brave in standing up against most of the policemen of Canberra when I had to implement something to which they were opposed. However, because of the action in 1975 when the Government was dismissed, the legislation was never passed. In that election campaign an assurance was given to the Canberra police by the Liberal Party that it would not amalgamate the two forces, and for some years it did not. I believe it was some time after the Hilton Hotel bombing that an expert from England dealing with terrorism recommended that there should be one police force. Then the Government acted. </PARA>
<PARA> To stop the opposition of the police, no investigation provisions were incorporated in the enabling Bill. The Bill was introduced for the purpose of amalgamating the police forces, with promises of advantages to the police. My information is that those advantages were not provided. There are two sections and two wage rates within the police force today. Some personnel in the police force, who do exactly the same job as others, are on a lower rate of pay on some occasions. Examples can be seen at Adelaide airport. An officer who begins work at 4 o'clock to take over the duties of an officer who has been on duty all day may get paid a lower rate. The morale in the Australian Federal Police in the capital cities is very low. The members feel dissatisfied and disgruntled. There is the belief that there are still two police forces. The members of the Australian Federal Police, who perform and are paid for protective services, are not accepted by members of the old Australian Capital Territory police. There is a feeling amongst the officers of those forces that they are not getting the same treatment. There is a different rate of pay and there are different interpretations of the relevant Acts by deputy commissioners throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> After two years, the Australian Federal Police still do not have adequate uniforms. If one goes to Adelaide airport one will see three uniforms-for instance, three different hats. There is no insignia which indicates rank; stripes cannot be provided. Many uniforms do not fit and there is no possibility of obtaining more uniforms in the foreseeable future. Australian Capital Territory police get a higher rate of pay than those in the capital cities. Woomera is identified in the policemen's industrial award as an isolated area, and that entitles officers serving there to an extra day's pay. The deputy commissioner in South Australia has taken away that extra day's pay, without an alteration being made to the award, because a sealed road to Woomera has been built. How one can convert an isolated area into an area which is not isolated by building a road is hard to visualise. Whether there is justification that the award rate should not be paid, nevertheless it is in the award and it should be paid; but it is not. This, apparently, was the decision of the Deputy Commissioner of Police in Adelaide. Whilst policemen are now permitted to wear beards, provided they have three weeks growth-that was the stipulation of the Commonwealth Commissioner-the deputy commissioner in South Australia has insisted that they sport a beard only if it is five weeks old. Therefore, those who desire to grow a beard during their holiday period are prevented from doing so. </PARA>
<PARA> At Pimba, the station leading to Woomera, there is a guard house which is manned by Commonwealth police. The guard house is built, I think, of timber from islands north of Australia. This timber is so full of wood lice that they fall onto the tables in the canteen where the men dine. They lie so thickly on the floor that they are tramped over every time somebody goes in or out. They have been sprayed a couple of times but it has achieved nothing. There is nothing to indicate that a guard house will be built from some other materials that do not attract these wood lice. Those are the conditions that the police officers are working in at Pimba, with no extra pay and with no extra consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> There are complaints amongst the police against their seniors. They are concerned at being called before disciplinary tribunals, having no representation and being compelled to answer questions which may or may not be incriminatory. This legislation does not alter that practice. Whilst the legislation provides that an answer which may incriminate a person cannot be used in a court of law against that person, nevertheless he is forced to answer. His future may depend on the results of that investigation. He may be disciplined, demoted or dismissed. Therefore, he would at all times be in the position of a defendant facing the possibility of some penalty if the investigation finds that his service was not satisfactory. The only proof of a complaint may be the confession of the accused. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not wish to be accused of wasting 20 minutes of the time of the Committee-I am not as bad as Senator Evans-but let me say that complaints are made. Corruption may exist in some sections of any large body of people. It happens in all big groups or organisations. The police associations recognise that this corruption exists and are greatly desirous of cleaning it up. In the main the police do a valuable and thankless job. One cannot avoid acknowledging that there is ample evidence of justifiable complaints that nothing eventuated from the previous investigation, the police having kept the inquiry within their own ranks. When I was Minister for Aboriginal Affairs there were allegations of serious action, unlawful action, by the police at Skull Creek in northern Western Australia. Sir Charles Court called for a police inquiry, and all the police involved were exonerated. After pressure was placed upon Sir Charles Court a royal commission was established. Sir Charles selected two of the commissioners which suggests that he, having made the decision, knew there was no need for the Commission, which would support the police. The royal commission found that, as had been alleged to me, there had been serious, improper conduct by the police. I think the result of that finding was that one policeman received a promotion and another policeman had his promotion deferred. Nobody cared. </PARA>
<PARA> When I became Minister for Aboriginal Affairs I appointed an ex-policeman from Victoria to travel Australia to inquire into accusations of police brutality. His report, although it finally came to me, was never published. As he went from State to State he found that the policemen would not talk to him, as he had no standing. In his finding he could only repeat the accusations that the Aboriginals had made to him about police behaviour. I thought it would do more harm than good in the relationship we were trying to establish with the police to publish the report. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst there is justification for such an inquiry, as is provided for in this Bill, into allegations against police and-I hope the Bill will rectify the present situation-there is also a case for the policemen. They are not all corrupt. They have a difficult job to do. There are occasions when the bad handling of a person by a policeman may be justified. I refer to an incident at the Exchange Hotel at Port Adelaide when a large number of Aboriginal people resented the action of a policeman over three seamen who had assaulted an Aboriginal, and they immediately ganged up. The situation appeared to be very serious. </PARA>
<PARA> When I was Minister I received many complaints about police brutality. One such complaint involved an inspector who attended a riotous situation which could have got out of hand at any time. The crowd was told over the loud hailer to disperse and go home, but they did not. The policemen were instructed to break the crowd up into small groups. One cannot break up an angry demonstration by a large number of people into small groups without some innocent people among them perhaps being pushed aside and suffering a mishap. </PARA>
<PARA> These matters should all be considered. I hope that the tribunals will be reasonable in their considerations. At least we will not have another situation like the one at Skull Creek when not only the police were exonerated but also after the establishment of the royal commission the Government supported the police and allowed to continue the action which the royal commission found was unlawful and brutal to the Aboriginals at Skull Creek. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats strongly support these Bills and, equally strongly, commend the Government, particularly the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) and his Department, for introducing the Bills and for following so closely the Australian Law Reform Commission's recommendations. I have never been a champion of the Australian Federal Police, nor could I be accused of ever having said too many good things about the former Commonwealth Police. In fact I believe quite often I had good reason to be highly critical of them. Indeed, at the time the most effective, insidious, internecine knife job ever done on a group during my time in Parliament was done against the Federal Narcotics Bureau, I had some rather cruel things to say about certain people, certain departments, particularly one former senior officer of the Commonwealth Police. That is past now and, happily, those people who head or are involved in million dollar illegal activities in the narcotics or cannabis trades and in illegal gambling have as their main opponents at a federal level the newly formed Australian Federal Police. I wish the force well in the enormous task that it has in front of it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have not been accused of praising the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) too often, but I do so now. In the last several months Mr Newman has, to my mind, achieved several significant breakthroughs in this area for which he should be commended. I commend him now. I give notice, without rancour, that the question of the involvement of the Federal Narcotics Bureau and its alleged leaking of documents concerning the Wilsons and the criminal role played by certain members of the Queensland police force in that incident is not over. I know that several members of the Senate-Liberal, Labor and Democrat-have been persuaded that the full truth was not told. It will be told. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, I am particularly impressed by and pleased with the Attorney-General, his Department and the Government with regard to these Bills. I am very pleased, for example, that they give the Ombudsman the right of separate investigation of complaints against the Federal Police. Without taking away from the Attorney-General or any members of his Department in any way, I believe the Bills are also a tribute to the open-mindedness of Sir Colin Woods, the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, who over the years in former capacities has shown a genuine concern for the public image of the police and has not been prepared, and, quite obviously, is not now prepared to protect them at all costs from the results of their own misbehaviour. The attitude of Sir Colin Woods and the Federal Government with regard to this matter makes the mind boggle when one looks at the similar behaviour of the Queensland police, its police commissioner, its senior officers and the politicians in the Queensland Government who control the Queensland police. Therefore, it gives me great pleasure to commend the Government and Sir Colin Woods on this issue. I will read into the Hansard two quotations which, I think, represent the whole of the spirit of these two Bills. The first quotation comes from the report of the Law Reform Commission on complaints against police. It stated that the purpose of the legislation:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . is to establish a system which permits just and thorough investigation of complaints against police, while at the same time upholding morale and discipline in the difficult work police have to do. </PARA>
<PARA>Although those are simple words they eloquently describe what the proper situation ought to be. The second quotation is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The second element is establishment by statute of a special unit of the Police Force titled the 'Internal Investigation Division' with a specialised and independent function of investigating complaints by members of the public against police. Investigation of complaints against police will normally be carried out by this unit . . . a unit of this nature has already been established by the Commissioner by administrative action. </PARA>
<PARA>That is another commendable act by Sir Colin Woods and the Attorney-General and his Department. These Bills are the first part of a two-part package recommended to the Parliament by the Law Reform Commission. I hope that the Government will take a similarly enlightened view to the second part, which relates to police investigation procedures. The rumours that I have heard are that the Government has looked at those recommendations favourably and that there is every likelihood that the Commission's recommendations will be accepted. I hope that the rumours are true. I commend the Bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I thank the Senate and in particular those honourable senators who have participated in this debate for the support they have given to this measure. I listened very carefully to what those honourable senators who have spoken had to say, and I really do not think I have ever had such a short list of notes for a reply. However, I do not propose just to sit down after having thanked the Senate, as I usually do in such cases, because this is a very important measure. There are one or two matters that I would like to add to the debate although I do not propose to detain the Senate for any length of time. First of all, I take up the final point that Senator Chipp made. I think he very properly made reference to the Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police, Sir Colin Woods. Sir Colin Woods has made an outstanding contribution and impact, and I think he has already overcome many of the matters about which Senator Cavanagh expressed concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Cavanagh" NAMEID="757">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="757">Senator Cavanagh</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He is no quicker than the Government; that's the complaint.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No doubt he needs some co-operation as well, but I think he has already made a mark and will continue to enhance the morale of the Force greatly. The only subject to which I need reply is the time which this legislation has taken to come into the Senate. The fact is that the processes of consultation and the efforts to meet very firmly held and differing points of view take time. It is all very well to complain, as Senator Evans did, about delays and about the time the Government has taken, but this legislation, and legislation of this kind, is such that it will benefit from consideration, discussion and compromise. The fact that this legislation has been so well received in the Senate is a very good example of the benefits to be derived from that approach, but the price one has to pay is delay. To my mind that is a very small price to pay for the very large benefits that are derived from obtaining a broad consensus.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are conflicting interests. As Senator Cavanagh said, one must have regard to the job the police have to do. They are not always in the wrong. These days when one sees on television incidents in which the police are involved a good deal of sympathy is engendered for the person being arrested and perhaps in many cases a lot of unnecessary concern is engendered about the way the police proceed. But the police have a very difficult job to do. They do not always get the sympathy and support they deserve. Therefore, it is always very important, when looking at these sorts of measures, to make sure that the police, and the citizens, are given a fair go. </PARA>
<PARA> In the course of the development of this legislation a major report of the Law Reform Commission had to be looked at by an interdepartmental committee and the police had to be heard so that weight could be given to their views. The very important role recommended by the Law Reform Commission for the Commonwealth Ombudsman is now enshrined in this legislation, and the Ombudsman himself has been prepared to make some compromise as well to get a broad consensus. I commend the Ombudsman for the way in which he participated in the discussions in an attempt to obtain the broad consensus which has now resulted in very strong support for this measure. The Administrative Review Council was also asked to comment on it and did so. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, of course, as Senators Missen and Lewis have mentioned, the draft Bill was considered by the Government's law and government committee which also made a valuable contribution. I turn now to what has been called the other part of the package of reform measures in this area, namely, the proposed criminal investigation Bill. With regard to that proposal there are similar divisions of opinion, and questions have to be faced wherever strongly differing views are held. I came to the conclusion that it would not be possible to obtain a consensus in relation to the measure introduced by my predecessor and that it was worth while having another go and starting again, so to speak. That is why I asked the consultant draftsman, the former First Parliamentary Counsel, Mr Comans, whether he would redraft the Bill. Mr Comans, as a consultant, was very busily engaged on behalf of the Government with other major pieces of legislation and it took him some time to do the job that I asked him to do. However, he completed that draft just before he retired from the consultancy that he had been engaged in. I have that draft and I am considering it. There has been a good deal of discussion about the whole matter within another interdepartmental committee, so I hope that in due course we will be able to obtain a measure of consensus. I do not know whether we can get a complete consensus, but we might get a much better measure of consensus about this proposal than we thought was possible. I am not prepared to give any undertakings as to when the Bill will be completed or when it will be brought forward, but I am able to assure the Senate, as I have done on a number of occasions, that I have not by any means shelved the proposal. I am seriously pursuing it and I will continue to do so, but I cannot give any guarantee as to when it will be brought forward. I am aware of the very strong views that are held in relation to some aspects of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Lewis, although he did not raise this in his speech in the second reading debate, asked me what the additional cost to government of the proposals that are before the Senate will be. It is very difficult to put a figure on it because the members of the Investigation Division are already members of the force. Those who will serve on the tribunal, whether they be judges or magistrates, will be doing so as part of their ordinary judicial work. The figure of about $100,000 per annum is the best estimate that I can make. </PARA>
<PARA> I again thank honourable senators for the very great interest they have shown in this measure, for their recognition of its importance and for the most encouraging support which they have all given to it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) for his reply to the questions that I raised but I point out that in my speech I made a lot of allegations about the bad treatment of policemen themselves, particularly in Adelaide; and I am familiar only with the situation in South Australia. The Attorney-General said that the police commissioner was trying to clean up the problem. I would like some assurance from the Attorney-General that the complaints raised in my speech will be looked into and that we will get some information on whether an early attempt will be made to try to rectify the problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another matter I raised concerned a member of the police force being investigated by the Investigation Division. Clause 7 (5) of the Bill states:</PARA>
<PARA> A member of the Investigation Division may, for the purposes of the investigation, direct a member of the Australian Federal Police to furnish information, produce a document or other record or answer a question, being information, a document or record or a question that is relevant to the investigation. </PARA>
<PARA>It appears to me that there may be an occasion when the defendant in a case, the person being investigated, is asked to give the only source which can provide information which will prove him guilty of the complaint, and suffer a penalty as a result. Whilst provision is made that his answer cannot be used in a court of law-he can seek privilege on the grounds of incrimination-the investigating officer reports to the Commissioner who takes the appropriate action. I think it is against the system of justice that a man can be penalised for an offence which can be proved only on his own evidence. I would like the Attorney's opinion in this regard. </PARA>

Under this legislation, when he answers a question from the investigating officer, the effect of his answering that question is to make him subject to discipline-the penalty imposed by the Bill. Therefore he is convicted. He is found guilty by no other evidence and no other proof than his own statement.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Attorney-General) (4.31)-I apologise to Senator Cavanagh for not having mentioned matters raised by him during the second reading debate concerning complaints by members in the force. I will draw the attention of the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) to the speech made by Senator Cavanagh. I do not, of course, administer the force and I am not in a position to answer queries in regard to it. As matters of fairly specific character have been raised in some cases I will draw the appropriate Minister's attention to them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Cavanagh also referred to clause 7(5) of the Bill. The position is that the investigations to which this clause refers are in regard to possible breaches of a disciplinary code. Senator Cavanagh will recognise that such evidence would not be relevant or admissible in proceedings for any breach of the criminal law or any other illegal proceedings. As I understand it, under the police disciplinary code it has always been part of the duties of police officers to provide information in investigations of this kind. This clause is doing no more than giving effect to what has always been the rule within the police force. The justification of it, the rationale behind it, is that the force is a disciplined force and the requirement to observe this frank conduct and to provide assistance to those in authority is all part of the code of conduct and attitude of mind of such a force. As I have said, it is all part of the disciplined nature of the force. This was, of course, recognised by the Law Reform Commission in its report and this provision is in line with the recommendations of that Commission. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> Page 54, clause 75, add the following sub-clause:</PARA>
<PARA> '(6) At the hearing of a proceeding before the Disciplinary Tribunal in relation to a matter in respect of which there was made a complaint to which section 6 or 22 applied, the Tribunal may, if it is satisfied that there are special circumstances that justify it in so doing, grant leave to the complainant to appear in person before the Tribunal in the proceeding or be represented before the Tribunal in the proceeding by a legal practitioner or by some other person, and where leave is so granted, the complainant or his representative may take such part in the proceeding as the Tribunal permits.'.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Once again, I hesitate to introduce a mildly discordant note into the proceedings particularly after we have had such a happy second reading debate, but I do think that this is a significant point. The amendment that the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) has just moved is totally acceptable to the Australian Democrats and, I am sure, totally acceptable to the Committee. It, at least in my view, is sensible and desirable. But I first learnt of it when I came into this chamber, took my place and saw it on my desk. I do not know whether other senators were given prior notice of it. No doubt Senator Missen and other Government senators would have had some indication of it because they may have been responsible for it in their own committee. But those people on this side of the chamber have known nothing about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not know whether Senator Gietzelt had been informed before he entered the chamber, but with great respect I say good manneredly but with some force that it is not good enough now for members on this side of the chamber to be fronted with an amendment when a second reading debate has commenced when the Government side no doubt has known about it for some time. I would have thought that even normal courtesies would have demanded that the Leader of the Opposition in this place, the Leader of the Australian Democrats and the Independent senator be personally informed by the Minister, his secretary or department that the Government proposed to move an amendment to this legislation. I am not singling out the Attorney-General. I am speaking generally. As I have said, it is bad enough now but it will not be good enough after 30 June. If the Government wants co-operation from this side of the chamber, which the Australian Democrats are anxious to give, I do not think the co-operation can be expected if we are to be treated in this way. I make the point very strongly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is just one question I would like cleared up in relation to clause 4 of the Bill, which proposes to insert into the Act new section 64A. (1) providing for a penalty of $500. Proposed new section 64A. (1) reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A member who holds a rank declared by the regulations to be a rank to which this section applies shall, at all times when he is wearing his police uniform, wear his identification number on, or attached to, the front of his uniform. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators are aware of the importance of such a provision, but there is a defence to a prosecution for such an offence. Proposed new section 64A. (2) reads:</PARA>
<PARA> It is a defence to a prosecution for an offence against sub-section (1) if the defendant proves that his identification number was not worn on, or attached to, the front of his uniform in consequence of-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the act of another person (not being a member) done without the consent of the defendant;</PARA>
<PARA>I wonder why this provision is restricted to a person 'not being a member'. If a member's identification number is removed by another member of the force without the consent of the defendant surely that is a defence. It seems to be of some significance that the words 'not being a member' have been included. This takes away what may be a reasonable defence. I concede that there may be a situation in which the identification number is torn off a uniform accidentally. If a member can prove that it was removed without his consent. I think his defence should not be restricted to proving it was someone other than a member of the police force. </PARA>

<PARA> In supporting the amendment moved by my colleague, Senator Button, I would like to confine my remarks this afternoon to this year, 1981, which is the International Year of Disabled Persons. I think it is the most appropriate time that I can find in the parliamentary timetable to talk about my ideas and the Opposition's view on what should happen this year and some of the trends that should occur in the development of the legislation for disabled persons in the future. IYDP, as it is known, is a potential turning point in the lives of disabled people in this country. It should not be so much a year I believe, as the beginning of an era. Even the cynics are hopeful that this international year will set in motion a process that will continue long after the end of 1981. The Honourable Alf Morris, who introduced the Chronically Sick and Disabled Persons Act in Britain and who was, later, the first Minister in the world who had specific responsibility for the disabled, when introducing the legislation, talked of a society in which there is a genuine respect for the handicapped, where understanding is sincere and unostentatious. If this is the goal in Australia I suggest that we have a long way to go. </PARA>
<PARA> The International Year of Disabled Persons is essentially about coming to terms first with the sheer size of the disabled population in this country; nearly 1.5 million Australians are chronically disabled in some way. Secondly, it is about coming to terms with the unpalatable fact that their lives are different, separate and more restricted than those of the rest of the community. Above all it is about coming to terms with the fact that there is no real justification for their relegation to second class citizenship. Having come to terms with all of this, we are, of course, obliged to do something about it. But I believe that it would be a mistake to underestimate the magnitude of this first step. </PARA>
<PARA> Rethinking our collective and individual attitudes to disabled people will involve many awkward questions and uncomfortable truths. Above all, it means that we must consult with the disabled in a practical way. If we believe, to quote a United Nations document, that disabled people are 'not a special group with needs different from the rest of the community but ordinary citizens with special difficulties in getting their ordinary needs fulfilled,' how do we explain the way in which we have treated them until now? If I do not want to live in an institution, why should a disabled person have to? If I do not want to travel in a guard's van of a train or a labelled bus, why should a disabled person? If I want to go out for dinner or go to the theatre instead of watching television, does not this also apply to a disabled person? It is not good enough to answer these questions just in terms of disability, although I suggest that is what we have done for decades. </PARA>
<PARA> Simply because people are disabled we have made the fact of their disability the focus of all our thinking about them. In community planning this concentration on difference instead of similarity has resulted in separate and special education, separate and special employment, recreation and accommodation-what is being termed 'disabled apartheid'. This is not too strong a description of the situation which exists in many cases. We as a community have got away with it. We have got away with it because we did not want to get too close to a painful subject. We got away with it because many of the caring bodies in the community cared deeply and sincerely but did not question their methods enough. But more than anything, we got away with it because the consumers of all our programs and services-disabled people themselves-were silent and invisible. They were silent because they felt powerless, dependent and totally lacking in choice. They were invisible because the community was so full of barriers, physical and otherwise, that they could not get out and could not be seen. </PARA>
<PARA> The International Year of Disabled Persons should, and I believe will, change all this. One thing is certain; there is now a strong and identifi- able consumer movement and things will never be the same again. Disabled people are no longer prepared to be what Rob McNamara, a disabled Victorian, called in the recent Victorian Council of Social Services newsletter, 'the last significantly patronised group of adults living in the community'. They are telling us that our attitudes are wrong and that they want equal rights as citizens. Sympathy, pity, patronage, overprotection and low expectations are out. It is all summed up in the slogan 'your attitude is our greatest handicap'. IYDP is firstly about changing attitudes, about coming to grips with our own and taking a fresh look at disabled people, seeing what they can do and hearing what they want to do. Every time I use the phrase 'disabled people' as a short cut, I am conscious of the enormous diversity of disabilities that are involved. The point must be made that it will be easier to change attitudes to some disabilities than to others. </PARA>
<PARA> There is, I believe, a danger that IYDP will lead to great strides in accepting physical disabilities at the expense of mental handicaps and that, even among physically disabled people, those who are articulate, intelligent and attractive, will make progress while those who are not will be bypassed by this year of opportunity. Consider the human interest stories in the media and notice the tendency to highlight accident victims who are leading active lives minus this or that faculty. We hear much less from, or about, people who have been disabled from birth, who are disfigured or misshapen; people who have never developed the physical, mental or social confidence to stand up for themselves. Acceptance of these kinds of disabilities will be the real measure of change in our attitudes. IYDP is secondly about legislative change which can both stimulate and consolidate changes in attitudes. The importance of legislation was explained recently by Suzanne Jobson, a member of the New South Wales Anti-Discrimination Board. She said:</PARA>
<PARA> Past experience has shown that progress by minority groups in gaining the right to have their special needs recognised and met is slow and marginal without a legislative base. You cannot rely solely on the goodwill of the community. The very existence of legislation affects people's conduct in that it brings into focus the circumstances surrounding the lives of the people it aims to support, and encourages the community to more closely examine their attitudes and priorities in relation to those people. </PARA>
<PARA>Two States of the Commonwealth, South Australia and New South Wales, propose introducing or extending anti-discrimination legislation to include physical handicap. This legislation will outlaw the denial of equal rights and opportunities to physically handicapped people in employment, education and the giving of services and accommodation. Whilst the States are to be congratulated on their initiative, the nature of this legislation is, in itself, a comment on the state of community attitudes. It is essentially protective and designed to advance the situation of disabled people, only so far as equalising their chances alongside the non-disabled. Furthermore, despite its social significance, we should remember that this legislation is no more self-executing than any other. It merely provides a means of redress for those who are aware of its existence and prepared to engage in fighting for their rights. Legislation that takes account of the special needs arising from disability and provides for the development of programs is another matter. It is here that as legislators in the Commonwealth Parliament we have a direct responsibility for the quality of disabled peoples' lives. </PARA>
<PARA> This afternoon I want to concentrate on two major issues which should concern the Parliament and which, I have little doubt, would be considered central by the majority of disabled people. The first issue is income maintenance-how society should provide for people who are unable, by reason of their disabilities, to provide adequately for themselves. The second issue concerns the right of disabled people to independence and to management of their own lives. It has been said that the first defence for the disabled citizen against stigma is a guaranteed adequate income as a right. That sounds fine, but if we accept the implications of that statement and look at the Australian scene I suggest that there is little to be proud of. Here, as elsewhere, disability and poverty go hand in hand because of the double penalty of reduced earnings and extra costs. </PARA>
<PARA> In the words of Elizabeth Hastings, a disabled Victorian woman, disability is an expensive lifestyle. Yet we have done very little to acknowledge or tackle the financial problems of disabled people. I think one of the reasons for this, apart from the obvious one of concern with cost, is that until recently we have failed to understand that disabled people have special non-optional costs which distinguish their situation from that of other disadvantaged people in the community. Their costs can be broken down into, firstly, capital costs-for example, buying a wheelchair, modifying a house or a car-secondly, running costs to maintain the wheelchair, buying essential supplies for coping with things such as incontinence and for a special diet; and, thirdly, opportunity costs which are virtually impossible to quantify because they are made up of income lost and time given by others in assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> In the International Year of Disabled Persons especially it is absolutely vital that non-disabled people should stop and think about the reality of these inescapable expenses confronting disabled people. Valuable stimulus to this exercise has been provided by the Australian Council for Rehabilitation of Disabled in a recent discussion paper prepared by Mrs Becky Llewellyn from South Australia. This paper discusses the principles involved in income maintenance and examines seven alternative proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> The first proposal is to leave the invalid pension as it is at present. The second proposal is to have the invalid pension without an income test. The third proposal is to have a guaranteed minimum income scheme perhaps of the type suggested by Professor Henderson and the Commission of Inquiry into Poverty, but there are many models around. The fourth proposal is to have a disability pension as a substitute for the present invalid pension, sheltered workshop allowance, repatriation pension, et cetera. The fifth proposal is to have an attendant care allowance for people who need assistance at home or would need such assistance at home if they were to get out of institutions as they frequently want to do. The sixth proposal is to have a mobility allowance for those who have special transport needs-a common enough allowance overseas. The seventh proposal is to have a disability allowance as a supplement to other income which embraces attendant care and mobility as well as other needs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Council for Rehabilitation of Disabled paper discusses the advantages and disadvantages of these seven options and concludes that the last, a composite allowance that takes a range of needs such as attendant care and mobility into account, may be the most appropriate. This proposal is attractive because it is directly responsive to the extra costs of disabled living across a family-wide spectrum. However, it ignores, or perhaps it deliberately side-steps, the problem of the inequity which results from basing compensation on the cause rather than the severity of the disability. This may, in fact, be necessary in a conservative society in which any change is painfully difficult. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact remains that people with equally severe disablement receive dramatically different compensation depending on whether their disablement was caused in the workshop, on the road, in a theatre of war, in the kitchen or, indeed, in the womb. Accident victims who have access to damages through the legal system do immeasurably better than people disabled from birth or by disease who are dependent on the social security system, although the latter group comprises by far the greatest proportion of the disabled population. The only attempt in this country to devise a just and comprehensive scheme for compensating disabled people was, of course, the Woodhouse National Committee of Inquiry on Compensation and Rehabilitiation in Australia. It recommended replacement of the fault system of compensation with a single, earnings-related, automatic form of compensation for everyone. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, there were problems. The immensity of the administrative restructuring required by this proposal, not to mention the opposition of those who were doing nicely out of the existing structure, was at the heart of the failure to take action on the Woodhouse inquiry. The constitutional difficulties were added to that but could be overcome. We must remember that in New Zealand, in Justice Woodhouse's home country, such a system is in existence and was introduced by a conservative government. We should learn from New Zealand's experience and build on its experience. The increasing costs, for instance, of workers compensation in this country may be the greatest stimulus to this reform being introduced. It is a reform which is believed necessary by many on both sides of politics. </PARA>
<PARA> The income maintenance options now before us have an additional urgency in this International Year of Disabled Persons. Whilst they warrant wide and careful discussion I believe this discussion must not be used as a substitute for action. The Economist Intelligence Unit, in its 1978 publication entitled 'Whose Benefit?', stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . handicapped people should not be the ones called on to 'pay' for their own unavoidable extra needs . . . if they are not given the resources to pay, the cost will nevertheless be extracted from the community in some other way. </PARA>
<PARA>It is easy to give moral support to the right of disabled people to live independently and to manage their own lives just as non-disabled people do. It is another matter to give practical support by legislating to provide funds to facilitate that independence. In this country the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act is the corner-stone of the provision of services to handicapped people. It was introduced in 1974 by a Labor government and at that time it was a step forward. It consolidated previous legislation and incorporated many of the recommendations of the 1971 report of the Senate Standing Committee on Health and Welfare. </PARA>
<PARA> The Act is now in urgent need of review-a review that was always intended by its authors. The kernel of the criticism of the Act and of the program is that it encourages institutionalisation by funding organisations and physical facilities and discourages independence by making no provision whatever for assistance to self-help groups or individuals. Disabled people benefit under the Act only if they participate in programs run by organisations. If they want to go it alone, good luck to them, but there is no official assistance in any form. If we had had a proper consultation process in 1974 it may not have happened. I believe the main problem was that attitudes were different then. Attitudes have changed and will change now. A recent Victorian Council of Social Service draft report based on the views of disabled people, speaking of the Act, states:</PARA>
<PARA> It enshrines a vision that is still caught in the charity mentality-a board of benefactors with the assistance of paid workers providing for and caring for disabled people in a specialised environment. </PARA>
<PARA>This is merely one more addition to the existing pile of informed and often outspoken criticism. The National Advisory Council for the Handicapped undertook a comprehensive review of funding priorities and, in its third report in 1979, concluded:</PARA>
<PARA> The fundamental concern . . . is that the Handicapped Persons' Welfare Program has, to date, given undue emphasis to the funding of physical facilities rather than the provision of services responsive to the variety of needs of handicapped people. </PARA>
<PARA>The South Australian Committee on Rights of Persons with Handicaps, chaired by Mr Justice Bright, noted:</PARA>
<PARA> It is perhaps the Commonwealth Handicapped Person's Assistance Act that stands most formidably in the way of a move towards funding that encourages normalisation . . . only organisations that provide services on their premises are eligible . . . a self-help group which pools its resources and distributes profits is ineligible. An organisation which wishes to help handicapped persons in their own homes would be ineligible. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1980 the Tasmanian Board of Inquiry into the Needs of the Handicapped called for a review as a matter of urgency. I believe that the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) and the Government need no more evidence of the shortcomings of this Act than exists in this and other reports from disabled persons in the community. I believe that the Government should be prepared to honour the observance of IYDP by announcing the revision of the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act to incorporate assistance for disabled individuals and self-help groups. We can all help by informed debate and by informing ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I believe that even our colleagues in the Press can help. I believe that they should make a more enduring contribution to IYDP than through a series of news stories and personal profiles. There is an example where they can help. In the United Kingdom the readers service of a mass circulation newspaper, the People, devised a form in plain English to supplement a complicated application for a certain official allowance. This form is now widely used and has had a direct bearing on the success rate for application and the ease of application by those who need this benefit. Is there any reason why the Australian Press cannot match this? It is often accused of inadequately informing the population and of trivialising and sensationalising issues. No paper has been accused of this more than the People in the United Kingdom. Could the Press, in this case, not make a positive contribution to the welfare of this large group of disadvantaged citizens?</PARA>
<PARA> I began my speech by referring to the IYDP as a potential turning point in the lives of disabled people, and that is exactly what it will remain-a potential turning point-unless the community as a whole gets down to the business of turning rhetoric into reality. Disabled people are already well away doing their utmost to capitalise on this once in a lifetime opportunity and to influence, as much as possible, what is supposed to be their year. It is up to non-disabled people, sometimes called the temporarily able bodied people, to show that disability does not have to hit them personally before they are prepared to match their verbal compassion with action. Action is needed now and now that we have come so far in developing awareness and, I consider, in developing the political will, I think the International Year of Disabled Persons is surely the most appropriate time to make a start in developing that action. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking today to the Governor-General's Speech I should like to refer to the section in His Excellency's Speech dealing with unemployment and youth. The Governor-General said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> During the last five years over half a million Australians have received specific help through my Government's manpower and training programs. Nearly another quarter million will receive assistance during this year. </PARA>
<PARA> My Government has a clear and firm commitment to youth, exemplified by its announcement of new initiatives, including the introduction of a new allowance to encourage young unemployed persons to take advantage of training opportunities, the expansion of its work experience programs and the provision of improved counselling services. </PARA>
<PARA> All of these initiatives will be in place by February next year. </PARA>
<PARA> During 1981 my Government will take action to place increased emphasis on employment and training schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> A framework is being established within which the Government's training programs will provide a wide range of incentives and allowances to increase the supply of skills required for economic development, and to assist the unemployed, particularly the young and disadvantaged, to obtain employment. </PARA>
<PARA>Last year I spoke mainly on adult training and the limitations of intake due to the age limit. I also discussed the need for a continuous improvement of the knowledge and skills of the labour force due to the fast changes and new technological developments. I also mentioned the 1974 Australian Committee on Technical and Further Education-the so called Kangan Committee-and its criticism of the present apprenticeship courses. One of the problems highlighted in the report was the length of training. Today I would like to deal with that particular question and the way other industrial nations try to improve and facilitate training of young men and women. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian apprenticeship system derives from that of the United Kingdom but other English speaking countries, for example the United States and Canada, do not have a strongly developed apprenticeship system as such. It is a different matter in Europe where most of the Scandinavian countries, Germany, Austria and Switzerland, have strongly developed apprenticeship systems but these frequently cover occupations which are not apprenticeable in Australia. For instance, in Germany young persons who are entering an occupation such as retailing, banking and insurance and clerical and service occupations are generally required to undertake an apprenticeship before becoming established in those industries. This is a different system from what we have in our country. </PARA>
<PARA> Broadly, overseas trends are toward incorporating greater flexibility in the provision of training arrangements. This may be seen in the following ways: Most countries either have or are in the process of abolishing formal restrictions on age of entry into apprenticeships and do not specify when apprenticeships must be completed, a fact which I believe is of very important consequence to our system. Nevertheless, in most of them apprenticeships begin at 15 or 16 years of age and end in the latter teenage years. Few young people over 20 enter apprenticeships except in Canada and the United States. In most countries adult workers who were trained through apprenticeship and desire or need to bring their skills up to date are given such courses outside apprenticeship. Again, I believe that this is not happening in Australia or if it is, it is restricted to very few trades. </PARA>
<PARA> Although age restrictions have been set aside on occasions when labour market shortages appeared to warrant training of older entrants as apprentices, the major thrust in adult training and retraining has occurred outside the apprenticeship system. I believe that when soldiers returned after the war they were able to train and become tradesmen in a very short period. I believe that provisions then were quite flexible and made it possible for adult men and women to become tradesmen without going through four or five years of formal apprenticeship. </PARA>
<PARA> The duration of apprenticeship is another question. There are different durations throughout the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, but the shortening of the training period has been opposed on two points. Firstly, the employers feel they would not recover their training costs in a shorter period and, secondly, the trade unions argue that training would be inadequate and that wage structures for apprentices would be upset. Let us look again at what happened after the war. Why was it possible to train people after the war when we needed tradesmen? Why is it not possible to do so today when we need tradesmen and skilled people in our industries? One of the objectives of shortening the period of apprenticeship is to attract young people who have resisted the longer training period because of consequent delay in achieving full pay as skilled workers. </PARA>
<PARA> There are questions in most countries about co-ordination of practical work and theoretical exercises. Particular problems have arisen in Germany where responsibility for training is on a federal level while the States control education. That division hampers co-ordination in spite of the efforts of Federal-State commissions. The apprenticeship system in Britain relates more directly to specific employment possibilities than does the system in Germany. In Germany where offers of employers are not planned and do not attempt to correspond to the needs of the labour market, a recent study found marked discrepancies between the occupational distribution of apprenticeship occupations. Furthermore, in Germany research has been most explicit in revealing the adverse effects on the costs and convenience of offering training when enterprises adopt more automated techniques and sometimes need fewer skilled workers. We in this country are approaching that situation as fast as all other developed industrial countries. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look to Austria we find that adults over 21 years of age who have acquired skills through work experience and education may take the final apprenticeship examination without going through apprenticeship. On the other hand, in New Zealand the problems are identical to our own. Although the New Zealand Act provides for adult apprenticeships the system is very youth orientated and few people over the age of 20 years enter apprenticeship contracts. Hong Kong has an ordinance which does not prevent employers from taking on apprentices over the age of 19 or apprentices in non-designated trades. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at Japan we find that the system there is quite opposite to our own which I believe has become old fashioned because it was modelled on the trades and skills of 50 or 100 years ago. It is interesting to note that in Japan there is no period of formal training at the conclusion of which a person is regarded as a skilled tradesman. Persons may obtain training in vocational schools, public vocational training centres, company training centres, through on-the-job experience or a combination of these methods. A national trade skill test system provides the means by which persons trained by these various means can be assessed against a common standard and obtain formal certification of skilled status. In Japan there is also occupational capacity redevelopment training or job conversion training. Such a course, which is 6 months full time or one year part time, is designed to teach new basic skills to persons seeking to change their employment and to unemployed persons seeking employment. I feel that the Japanese system is the one which would be most suitable for our conditions and the demand for trade skills in our present boom. </PARA>
<PARA> In some trades in the Republic of Korea the upper age limit for an apprentice may be as high as 27 years. The Koreans have upgrading training courses designed to assist employed adult workers acquire higher skills. They have further refresher training courses designed to retrain workers by developing supplementary skills, and there is the possibility of undertaking change-of-trade courses designed to teach workers new skills necessary for taking on new jobs. Again, I feel that that kind of provision would be welcome in our economy at this stage of our development. It is interesting to note that in France teachers are divided on the issue of apprenticeships. For instance, those teachers allied to the Federation d'Education Nationale have called for the abolition of such schemes and most probably would favour something similar to what Japan has. </PARA>
<PARA> What is happening in Australia? At a conservative estimate Australia will need an additional 69,000 skilled people such as engineers, boiler makers, motor mechanics, tool makers, coppersmiths, sheet metal workers, fitters, instrument makers and so on. These skilled people will be required up to 1983. In the interim our present old fashioned apprenticeship system will have produced only about 47,000 additional skilled workers. Therefore, there will be a gap of around 20,000 workers. It is interesting also that the traditional training program provides 83 per cent of our tradesmen and only 2 per cent of the total requirement comes from migration and from Australian workers who have earned the title of tradesmen after six years' practical work. The Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr Viner) issued statistics which show that in 1980 46,152 young Australians took on apprenticeships; this figure is the highest since 1969-70. Mr Viner also said that there are now 136,628 apprentices in training, which is also a record. The number of newly indentured apprentices reached a record of 18,244 in New South Wales, showed a substantial growth in Queensland and a healthy growth in Victoria and Tasmania. It is interesting to note that if we add the figures relating to new indentures registered in the last three years the total number surpasses by 3.1 per cent the indentures taken out in the 1972-75 period. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention these facts for only one reason. Recently I read an article by the shadow spokesman on industrial relations in which he said that the socialists have a perfect plan to increase the training of young Australians. But in looking at the facts and figures for what happened under the socialist regime of 1972-75 we find that the Liberal Government has surpassed in the last three years the number of apprenticeships taken up under the Labor Government. For instance, in the electrical trades an increase of 9.1 per cent in the number of new indentures has been registered in the last three calendar years in comparison with those registered in the three years 1972-75. The total figure for all trades shows an increase of 18.6 per cent, which is a record figure for new indentures registered. There has also been a tremendous increase in the number of completed apprenticeships. During the period of the Whitlam Government there were 73,046 apprenticeship completions whilst during the last three years of the Fraser Government there have been 94,338. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been some encouraging developments in adult training in Australia. In Western Australia co-operation between the trade unions, employers and government authorities has enabled some redundant workers to be retrained in trades such as bricklaying and furnishings. This example was quoted by the Cochrane Committee of Inquiry into Labour Market Training as evidence for its argument that controlled access to properly regulated training courses administered under a tripartite authority was preferable to the practice of informal upgrading on the job. Limitations on training opportunities for semi-skilled workers, the Committee argued, presented a major obstacle to improving the standards of tradesmen in general. The Committee warned against the development of inflexible training programs for adults, however, which are sometimes associated with apprenticeship education. The Kangan Committee, which sat a few years ago, urged as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The acceptance of a mixed system in which the employer would transfer a greater part of his apprenticeship contract to the technical education authorities. If this approach was adopted it could mean a shift towards the European model of apprenticeship whereby there is an introductory period of full-time training off the job, to teach trainees the basic elements of their trade and proper working methods followed by a period of training and experience in industry. </PARA>
<PARA>The Kangan Committee also recommended that recurrent education be available to all individuals who wished to add to their knowledge and skills in order to upgrade their earlier education or change their occupation. I would say that in today's changing technology it is most important that a person who has been trained in one trade and one skill should be able to be retrained and learn a new trade even when he is 30 or 35 years of age and not precluded, as is the situation at the moment, because he is older than 16 or 17 years. If this system were adopted it would open the way for adults to enter not only the skilled trades but also other occupations. I feel that education in our system has to be changed in order to provide the situation in which young persons would be more inclined to take up skills and trades and not to have an academic goal as the be-all and end-all of their aims. I would like to quote from a newspaper article in which the views of the President of the Institute of Engineers, and Dean of the Engineering Faculty at Monash University, Professor Lance Endersby, were put forward. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA> He thinks the problem stems from the Australian education system and that it can be rectified-for the long term-in the education process. </PARA>
<PARA>The Schools Commission report which dealt with the schooling of 15 and 16-year-olds made a recommendation which was set out in a newspaper article. The article stated:</PARA>
<PARA> 'Schools underplay the role of work as an aspect of life, and ignore the way it might be made part of the central thrust of the curriculum. And yet it is essential for physical survival. Schools must help students to come to terms with work as a central element of society'. </PARA>
<PARA> The commission stressed that it was not saying it was the task of schools to teach specific work skills. </PARA>
<PARA> 'But rather (it is their task) to foster a general understanding of work in ways which will help students cope with the myriad problems of an unforseeable future'. </PARA>
<PARA>Therefore I feel that education could play a tremendous part in giving young people the opportunity to enter the trades and to become skilled tradesmen instead of going on to some course at university which is completely unsuitable for our conditions today. The Minister for Education (Mr Fife), in answer to a question upon notice, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> On the question of consultation between industry and schools regarding academic requirements for apprenticeship, this is essentially a matter for the education systems and schools in the States to take up. The basic academic requirements for entry to apprenticeship in terms of attainment in school courses are laid down by apprenticeship authorities in each State and territory and these requirements would generally be well known to counsellors advising students who are seeking apprenticeships. </PARA>
<PARA>Further, regarding the matter of educational problems, I would like to quote the following:</PARA>
<PARA> The system of institutional education at the secondary level still furnishes an academic education largely directed at providing matriculation candidates for the universities. The need to prepare youth for careers at levels below those served by universities and colleges of Advanced Education constitutes a significant gap in the structure of Australian education and training. </PARA>
<PARA>This quotation dealt with education and how education could help young people to become more involved in apprenticeships and skilled tradesmen's professions. Let us look at what is happening and what the Government has done to try to rectify a bad system, an old system, which exists in our country. A conference was held between Commonwealth and State Ministers for labour which endorsed a plan of action which would improve the apprenticeship system, making it more flexible and adaptable to the needs of Australia in the 1980s. The Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, Mr Viner, in his article regarding the conference stated:</PARA>
<PARA> That report is being followed up by me to ensure the implementation of its recommendations as quickly as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> These include:</PARA>
<PARA> Upgrading suitable semi-skilled workers in shorter periods than the normal apprenticeship indentures. </PARA>
<PARA> Expansion and introduction of pre-apprenticeship courses leading to trade occupations. </PARA>
<PARA> Encouragement of shorter indentures for people with appropriate education qualifications and experience. </PARA>
<PARA> Examination of awards to determine areas where greater flexibility should be introduced into trade training. </PARA>
<PARA> Support of group apprenticeship arrangements with industry associations. </PARA>
<PARA> Identification of spare training capacity in Government departments and instrumentalities for use in training workers in key occupations. </PARA>
<PARA>It is interesting to note that the South Australian Government has already changed some laws in regard to trades training. The South Australian Government introduced a new Bill to repeal the Apprentices Act and to establish an industrial and commercial training commission designed to oversee all aspects of training and to develop policies to meet demands for skilled workers. An article from the Australian of 13 February 1981 states:</PARA>
<PARA> One of the purposes of this bill is to co-ordinate the administration of all areas of commercial and industrial training, including apprenticeships, into an intergrated whole and to ensure that training opportunities will be available to men and women of all ages. </PARA>
<PARA>The fact is that there are moves underway by the Fraser Government to improve and to facilitate the apprenticeship system as such. I now refer to different ideas and thoughts which were expressed in regard to this system of apprentices. An article in the Australian states:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia's antique apprenticeship machinery needs an overhaul and quickly . . . it is virtually obsolete. </PARA>
<PARA>Further, it states:</PARA>
<PARA> There has been substantial growth in full-time vocational training outside the apprenticeship system in State technical and further education colleges. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is 15 September 1980. Ten years ago it was impossible to find enough apprentices to fill the vacancies. Today the situation has changed dramatically. By 1978 there were 36 apprentices for every registered unfilled vacancy. The 1980 ratio eased somewhat to 19 for every job. The responsibility for the administration of apprenticeships lies with individual State and Territory governments resulting, of course, in the usual patchwork quilt of different laws, different standards and different rates. It is therefore necessary that something be done on a nation- wide basis and that action be taken by the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs calling a conference of all State labour Ministers. The achieving of a standard or a united approach to the apprenticeship system is of great value. I hope that it is only the first step which will help to achieve something which is much more adaptable and much more attuned to this age and not to an age which has long passed. Co-ordinated national programs must be introduced to encourage further apprenticeship and manpower development and to improve education and training facilities. Finally, Mr Acting Deputy President, I congratulate the Government on a splendid program, as outlined by His Excellency the Governor-General.

<PARA> (c) reduced and falling family living standards;</PARA>
<PARA>That is borne out by the cost of living. I will refer to that matter later, particularly in regard to my own State of South Australia. The amendment reads further:</PARA>

<PARA> (3) Makes no long-term provision for assistance to manufacturing industry and farming industries, which are likely to be severely disadvantaged as a result of successive exchange rate revaluations and substantially increased imports in the context of resources development. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Lajovic, in his speech, and Government speakers before, made very little attempt to try to rebut the words of that amendment. They resorted to statistics, some of which caught out Senator Lajovic when he was referring to the apprenticeship training scheme. Near the end of his speech he quoted an article from the Australian of 15 September 1980. He stated that apprenticeship needs a massive overhaul. He spent about 10 minutes or more telling us what the Government has done during its term of office to provide a better apprenticeship training scheme in Australia. The Government having been in office for nearly five years, Senator Lajovic tried to bolster his argument and quoted an article from the Australian which states that apprenticeship matters need a massive overhaul. Of course, he is defeating his own argument by saying that, and the figures prove it. </PARA>
<PARA> He talked about South Australia, too, and about some apprenticeship scheme which the Tonkin Government has introduced or proposes to introduce. It is beyond my comprehension to know how Senator Lajovic would be fully informed on what the Tonkin Government is doing, particularly in regard to apprenticeship schemes. He may not be fully informed of what it is doing in regard to other measures. I invite Senator Lajovic to remain in the chamber while I tell him, during the course of my speech, what the Tonkin Government has done to South Australia during the 18 months that it has been in office. It has done a terrible thing to the State. I now refer back to the apprenticeship training scheme, in case Senator Lajovic leaves the chamber and does not want to learn something about the tragedy of South Australia. I shall quote from a list for apprenticeships full time training in South Australia. This was brought to my attention by a person who has conducted a panel beating business in my home town of Murray Bridge for as long as I have been there, and that is over 30 years. Just recently he employed two apprentice panel beaters. He applied, under the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-time Training Scheme, for a rebate for the employment of these apprentices. </PARA>
<PARA> This scheme has been greatly publicised over the length and breadth of Australia. Senator Lajovic has repeated today what the Federal Government is doing to encourage employers to take on apprentices. When this man applied for the rebate to assist him in the employment of these two apprentices in his small business he could not get a cent. I went to the Commonwealth Employment Service office to get a full list of all the occcupations for which eligibility under the CRAFT $1,000 rebate scheme may be established in South Australia. It is a massive list which deals particularly with the motor industry. It lists motor fitter, motor cycle maintenance, motor mechanic, motor mechanics-diesels, and all these types of things, but nothing is mentioned regarding an employer who runs a panel beating business. </PARA>
<PARA> With the massive increase in the number of motor cars on the roads-although the number is rapidly declining in South Australia because of the new registration procedures enforced by the Tonkin Government, about which I will speak later-and with the very poor drivers we have and the massive increase in the accident rate, I should think that the first thing the Government should do is to look at giving some assistance to people who conduct panel beating businesses so that they can train apprentices. But no, it has overlooked that. Yet it gives money to employers in other areas which, in my view, although they may be important in the Government's view, are not as important as panel beating. It gives money to employers to train locksmiths, brass finishers, coppersmiths, electroplaters, hand engravers and such occupations which a country, if it is in dire straits, does not need, but it needs people who are trained to service the motor industry in all spheres. This Government is not prepared to do anything to help such people, despite the fact that it has put out all these glossy brochures to fool the employers about the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-time Training Scheme stating: '$1,000 now prevents skilled shortages later'. </PARA>
<PARA> This is what Senator Lajovic has been talking about. He says that the apprenticeship training scheme, under his Government, is in a mess. This Government has been in office for five years. The scheme needs a massive overhaul because the Government has done nothing about it since it came into office. I refer also to job training. The Government says to employers: 'You send employees to trade school and we will help with the Bill'. Is it helping the man about whom I have spoken? He would not be the only one in that position. I know about him only because he lives at Murray Bridge and runs his business there. He has run a successful business for over 30 years that I know of and has trained some very good people, but because of the recession some years ago he did not take on apprentices. Now, the people he has trained, the skilled people in his workshop, will reach retiring age in a few years. He wants to train young lads to take their places, but he cannot get a cent from the Government. The Government's policy is to let these lads go on the dole. For how long will they be on the dole before they soak up $1,000 of taxpayers' money? The Government has arranged nothing. This happened only a couple of weeks ago. The Government cannot be a bit concerned. Otherwise, why did this Australian, Mr Murdoch, who supports the Government in every election, take the Government to task? He wrote an article, from which the honourable senator quoted, about the apprenticeship training scheme's needing a massive overhaul. The Government has been criticised by its own supporters. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to refer also to some comments made by Senator Teague. He spoke very gloatingly of the results in the recent by-elections. Anyone would have thought--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the amendment is very far reaching. I expect that I can speak about that matter, Mr Deputy President, but if you rule against me, I guess I will have to take cognisance of your ruling. I shall quote from Hansard the remarks made by Senator Teague when he spoke about some of the matters which concerned him. He stated that the Government was very successful in the recent by-elections and gave some of the figures. I think we all know the reason for the low turnout of voters. Two of the by-elections were for blue ribbon Liberal seats. A similar result would have pertained had there been a by-election in Port Adelaide, Banks, Sydney or any such electorate. There would have been a very poor turnout of Liberal voters because they knew that they had no chance and they would not have bothered to vote. We might see a difference if our case in the High Court to contest the electorates of Kingston, Lowe and another in in Western Australia, where the result was much closer, is successful. Then Senator Teague might have a different story altogether to tell. We cannot take much notice of what Senator Teague says in this place. I am reminded of his maiden speech when, in speaking about the brandy excise, he said that he would not be a credible Liberal if he supported what the Government was doing. Yet when it came to the crucial issue what did he do? He voted against the amendment that I moved on behalf of the Opposition to delete certain clauses from the excise Bill so that the brandy excise would remain at the same level.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is in the Hansard. As a consequence there has been a massive increase in unemployment in the Riverland area in South Australia because the distilleries are not buying brandy grapes. It has had a repercussion through the Riverland in South Australia. The living standards of the families of many of the small grape growers has been reduced and is falling. That is referred to in part of the Opposition's amendment. These are some of the things that come home to roost when a senator speaks in this place about his principles and his standards. When he is put to the test he goes to water.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Teague also stated that he did not agree with his colleagues about their move to have no senators in the ministry. This is another illustration of the split in the Government parties that is becoming more evident every day. I remind the Senate that on 22 March 1979 Senator Rae gave notice of a motion-I will not read all of it because it is in the Notice Paper for everybody to see-that senators should no longer hold office as Ministers of State. We read in the speech of the honourable member for Wilmot (Mr Burr) in a debate on the same matter in the other House the other day that he supports Senator Rae, but he certainly does not support Senator Teague. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4L7">Senator McLAREN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There were. I will refer to some of them. Senators often speak in this place about the freedom in their party. They say that they do not have to abide by party policy, that they are free agents and that they can vote as they like on all issues. They criticise members of the Labor Party because we are bound by our policy, but they do not seem to understand that the policy of the Labor Party is determined by the rank and file of the party through its branches, its states councils, its state conventions and its federal conference. We all agree that once a majority vote is taken we will abide by the policy. That is the policy on which we go to the electors and if we are elected we are duty bound to support that policy. I do not think anybody in the Labor Party wants to depart from the policy on which we are elected. We do not make any claims to be free agents, but honourable senators on the other side continually claim how free they are to vote as they wish. Of course, that claim is completely false. I think Max Burr, the honourable member for Wilmot, exploded that myth in the other House. I shall remind honourable senators about that matter later in my speech. I return to what Senator Teague had to say in his speech. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that had we been better at campaigning our policy strengths we would have been better supported and perhaps my colleagues would not have lost their seats. </PARA>
<PARA>That is an admittance that even though a filthy campaign was conducted in South Australia, and no doubt in the other States, it did not benefit the Government. He said that the Government ought to be better at campaigning. I hope that he meant by that statement that the Liberal Party in the future will conduct a cleaner and more honest campaign and will not get no-hopers to sign election advertisements depicting all sorts of terrible things that would happen to the electorate at large if the Labor Party were elected to government, as did Mr Buick from Kangaroo Island. He is a non-entity, but he seems to have any amount of money to pay for massive advertisements. People in Kalgoorlie and all over Australia were authorising advertisements on behalf of the Liberal Party, frightening people away from the Labor Party. Senator Teague went on:</PARA>
<PARA> Another contributing factor was the very real success of the Tonkin Liberal Government in its first 12 months in office. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know in which way he meant that that was a contributing factor. Perhaps he meant that it contributed to the fact that the Labor Party held all its seats in South Australia. We did not win any and we did not lose any. Neither did the Liberal Party, but one seat is in very grave doubt. That case is now before the courts for a decision. There may even be a by-election for that seat. I shall supply quite extensive quotations about the Tonkin Liberal Government later on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I invite honourable senators opposite to turn back the Hansard record and to see what Senator Young, in particular, Senator Withers and Senator Jessop said on some occasions about former Senator Steele Hall and what Steele Hall said about the Liberal Party as a whole and about Senator Withers. It is all recorded in Hansard. If people care to read a speech I made here on one occasion they will find that I tabulated it all in that one speech. They do not have to turn back all the Hansard records to find a complete reference to that division between them. We have now heard Senator Teague say what a great bloke Steele Hall is and that he is welcome back into the party. I think the party members might rue the day they let him back, as they did in South Australia. That was one of the disappointments for Mr Fraser after the pre-selections. Another was the fact that his pea did not get up in the preselection for the seat of Curtin in Western Australia. He might rue the day that those things happened.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Teague went on to talk about an increase in the Liberal-National Country Party Ministry and said that in the not too distant future one-third of the Ministry could be members of this chamber. I do not think we will ever see that happen because if Senator's Rae's motion is ever brought back on for debate and is supported we will not see any Ministers here at all. That will also happen if Mr Max Burr has his way. In view of what Senator Teague said, it is very revealing to look at what was said in the other place by Mr Burr, the honorable member for Wilmot. I quote from page 158 of the House of Representatives Hansard for 25 February 1981 where Mr Burr is reported to have said:</PARA>
<PARA> Parliament is dominated by the all pervading party political interests and by the selfish ambition to have and to exercise power. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what we on this side of the Senate have always said. It was borne out by the actions taken by present Government members when they were in Opposition in 1974-75. All they thought about was power, not the good of the country or the welfare of the people-just power. Now we find that members of their own parties in the other place are actually criticising the Fraser Government for what it has done. Mr Burr continued:</PARA>
<PARA> I have suggested that all Ministers be appointed from the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA>That is completely contrary to what Senator Teague said. It would be very interesting to be a fly on the wall in the Government's party rooms and to listen to some of the arguments members must have on these issues, now that they publicly vent their spleens on their colleagues. Mr Burr went on:</PARA>
<PARA> It seems incongruous that the Senate is expected to be a House of review while at the same time some of its members form part of the Executive Government. In reality, the Senate is not a proper House of review but rather an extension of the House of government and equally dominated by party allegiances. Surely the Senate could better fill its review role if none of its members were Ministers and there was no ambition on the part of others to become Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> I have suggested also that there should be a one-line appropriation in the annual Budget for Parliament and that its expenditure should be controlled by the Presiding Officers. Parliament cannot properly scrutinise the Executive while the funding of parliamentary operations is controlled by the Executive. </PARA>
<PARA>How true that is. I will refer, firstly, to those last remarks. We have advocated in this place that there should be a one-line appropriation for the Parliament. There are many reasons for that; they are to be found in the reports of the Estimates committees of this Parliament. I hope that before I leave this place I will see the day when there is a one-line appropriation so that the Parliament can control its own destiny and run its own affairs, and not have severe monetary and staff ceiling restrictions placed on it so that members are unable to get sufficient staff to carry out their duties. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter with which I am mostly concerned is this: I have been ridiculed by honourable senators opposite for saying here on many occasions that this is not a House of review when the Liberal Party is in Government. Of course it is not. When it has the numbers here it is a rubber stamp. It was a House of frustration when we were in government and the Liberal Party had the numbers here. It would not let us govern. Yet we heard Senator Lajovic, back on his hobby horse, trying to make excuses. He is a good pupil of Senator Carrick who, every time he is in trouble, blames all the ills of the country on the Whitlam Government. It is now five years since the Whitlam Government went out of office and it is taking this Government a jolly long time to rectify those ills, if in fact they were ills. I have yet to be convinced that we created any ills. What we did was to create better living standards for everybody who needed help. We were not neglecting the underprivileged and handing out massive amounts of support for the wealthy. </PARA>

<PARA>That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Acting Deputy President, I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators will recall that on 15 September 1976, and 26 October 1978, I introduced this Bill into this chamber and that, as a result of the Parliament's being prorogued, the Bills lapsed. Now I again present it in its original form without any amendment. It is sufficient to say that since those dates a lot of water has passed under the bridge and, to the shame of this nation, a lot more Aborigines and Islanders have gone to prison. Their only crime, in the majority of cases, is ignorance-ignorance of a judicial system which they do not understand. It is a judicial system which is based entirely on European values, customs and culture; and one which is heavily weighted against my people and my Islander brothers and sisters. Therefore, it is my belief, shared by countless thousands of caring white Australians, that this present imbalance within our society must not be permitted to continue. It must be excised, like some deadly cancer that is sapping the very life blood of my people. </PARA>
<PARA> For the many years that I have been privileged to sit in this chamber, I have listened attentively, if somewhat cynically, to the many debates concerning my race. This cynicism has of late, I believe, been reinforced by events with which all honourable senators should be familiar and concerned. However, I now call upon honourable senators to do some soul searching, to exercise their minds, to put their fine words into some definite, direct action. This chamber has been deluged by noble words and sentiments which have hung heavily on my ears and then dissipated and blown away on the winds of indifference. Today I am issuing a challenge to all senators to put these thoughts and expressions of concern for the Aboriginal and Island people into positive and effective action. </PARA>
<PARA> Do we, as senators, have the necessary intestinal fortitude to initiate innovative and far reaching legislation, or are we to give truth to the fallacy that we are a chamber of stoic old men and women, deaf to the voice of the people, a mere rubber stamp of that other place? I look around and see youth and vitality on both sides of the chamber. I see the wisdom of years, and I pray to God that I also see men and women of principle; men and women of vision, men and women who are not the mere minions of government and bureaucracy, but men and women who are now prepared to stand up and be counted, and are in tune with the song of freedom that is presently resounding throughout this nation. I trust that I have gained the Senate's attention, rattled a few skeletons in the closet and extracted some emotion from honourable senators. I do not care whether it be sympathy, resentment, or criticism, as long as it is some emotive force. For I believe that for far too long the welfare of my people has been treated with mere apathy within this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> Not long ago in this chamber, I echoed the plaintive plea of that great Aborigine and Australian, Albert Namatjira. They were words which embodied, I believe, his utter despair and disillusionment with the dominant white society and its judicial system. It was a cry which even today is applicable to my people and one which demands to be answered in this very chamber today. Those prophetic words were not delivered from the pulpit, or from any public forum, but from the very source itself-the steps of a white man's much vaunted hall of justice, after Namatjira had felt the cruel barbs of his white brother's brand of justice. Sadly, the position remains unchanged in this so-called enlightened era of so-called reform. The indigene still finds himself today an outcast and pariah in his own land, a land which was given him by Almighty God at Dreamtime, which is creation. </PARA>
<PARA> I am aware that perhaps I have traversed this ground before, and although it needs to be reiterated time and time again, perhaps I can condense this with the words of two white scholars to whom my race will be eternally grateful. Firstly, I quote C. D. Rowley's The Destruction of Aboriginal Society from the Australian National University Press 1970. At page 23 these words appear:</PARA>
<PARA> What were left were not conquered tribes, but dispirited remnants lacking in the kind of leadership with which an administration might negotiate. Lacking even a place of their own, which from the European point of view, was an axiomatic basis for any kind of civilised or ordered life. </PARA>
<PARA>Secondly, I quote Emeritus Professor W. E. H. Stanner's After the Dreaming from the 1968 Boyer Lectures. These words appear at page 46:</PARA>
<PARA> In a hundred patterns they drifted into a vicious circle of poverty, dependence and acceptance of paternalism. Every act of paternalism deepened the poverty into pauperism and the dependence into inertia. The situation was self-perpetuating and self-reinforcing. </PARA>
<PARA>If honourable senators choose to ignore this lone Aborigine's words, dare they cast aside the words of these two men of learning? To further reinforce the need for the provisions of this Bill, I quote directly from Aborigines, A Statement of Concern prepared by the Catholic Commission for Justice and Peace, for the Catholic Bishops of Australia. I quote from page 14:</PARA>
<PARA> The Law and the Police. Not only does our legal system reflect values and priorities alien to Aboriginal culture, but it has by and large sanctioned the dispossessions of Aboriginal people of their land and violence that accompanied it. Many laws discriminated against them. Indeed, the Australian Government was for a time unable to ratify the 'International Convention on the elimination of All Forms of Discrimination' of the United Nations because of the Queensland Aborigines' and Torres Strait Islanders' Acts. </PARA>
<PARA> The law has offered little protection to Aborigines. Rarely have they sought justice through civil courts. In the criminal courts, they have been disadvantaged at every stage of the proceedings-the chances of being arrested, the nature of charges, the granting and the level of bail, having legal representation in court, the chances of conviction and the severity of sentence. </PARA>
<PARA> The end result is that Senator Bonner has been able to claim that Aborigines are the most imprisoned people in the world. </PARA>
<PARA>My claim, which is mentioned in the report, is still as valid today as it was then or when I first introduced the Bill. I would like to record some further figures which are now available. In 1974 Aborigines comprised between 6 per cent and 9 per cent of the prison population in New South Wales. Their rate of imprisonment was at least 17 times that of non-Aborigines. Each year from 1973 to 1975 magistrates courts in Western Australia sentenced more Aborigines than non-Aborigines to imprisonment. Aborigines comprise 2.1 per cent of the population of that State. In July 1972 Aborigines made up 15.3 per cent of the total daily average prison population in South Australia and 51.33 per cent of the female prison population. Only 0.75 per cent of the State's population are Aborigine. </PARA>
<PARA> To give some indication of the validity of the consensus of the objections, with the concurrence of honourable senators I incorporate in Hansard a letter to the Right Honourable Malcolm Fraser, Prime Minister, from the Queensland Police Union of Employees. </PARA>
<PARA> The letter read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>269 Main Street, Kangaroo Point, Brisbane 4169 28 January 1977 The Rt Hon. M. Fraser Esq.,</PARA>
<PARA>Prime Minister of Australia,</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House,</PARA>
<PARA>Canberra 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Sir,</PARA>
<PARA> On behalf of the Queensland Police Union of Employees I bring to your notice details of Private Member's Bill as proposed by Senator Bonner such Bill being entitled 'Aborigines and Islanders (Admissibility of Confessions) Bill 1976'. </PARA>
<PARA> My members have at considerable length examined the contents of this Bill which seems to restrict alarmingly Police powers in the State of Queensland and would render virtually impossible the upholding of law and order amongst the coloured members of our community. </PARA>
<PARA> An examination of statistics available to this Union indicates that in 1976 the present situation existed with respect to the population of coloured people in the various states of the Commonwealth of Australia. It will be seen that in each state the numbers of Aborigines are recorded together with the percentage of the total population added to which are figures in respect to the Torres Strait Islanders who also may be found amongst our coloured community. </PARA>

<PARA> We earnestly request that you as Chief Executive Officer of the Federal Parliament should ensure that this Bill does not become Law until every aspect of the Bill is thoroughly and conscientiously examined and that the continuation of justice to all should be viewed with paramount importance. </PARA>
<PARA> Far too frequently in recent years Queenslanders have been described as being racist and oppressive of the Aborigine community, a statement which is completely lacking in fact and totally and completely unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> Over a long period of time the Queensland Police Union has had considerable dealings with the coloured community of this State and we have always found that the Law as it is presently framed particularly with respect to the 'Aborigine questioning' leaves nothing to be desired in guaranteeing the community of Queensland a proper and complete law enforcement program. </PARA>
<PARA> I am taking the liberty of forwarding a copy of this communication to each of your Cabinet colleagues, to all members of Cabinet in Queensland and further to all members of the Police Federation of Australia who will be discussing this problem at their Federation's Conference in Adelaide from 13 March onwards. </PARA>
<PARA> We would appreciate receiving advice from you that you will delay if possible the passage of this Bill until a complete inquiry may be carried out in respect of the contents of this letter. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours faithfully, Queensland Police Union of Employees,</PARA>
<PARA>M. J. CALLAGHAN, General Secretary</PARA>
<PARA>I particularly draw honourable senators' attention to the sixth paragraph, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Far too frequently in recent years, Queenslanders have been described as being racist and oppressive of the Aboriginal community, a statement which is completely lacking in fact, and totally and completely unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA>I feel that perhaps it would have been more correct to attribute that statement as reflecting the opinion of the Queensland Government, and we all know that it is not truly representative of all Queenslanders. Honourable senators will also note that this letter was written prior to the criminal law inquiry held in Queensland, and this inquiry did in fact vindicate my argument that my people and the Islanders need additional protection in the investigatory process. The report of this inquiry, which boasted as its members a senior judge of the Supreme Court, a senior counsel and a retired police inspector, has been ignored and is no doubt gathering dust in some State archive-along with other such reports which dare to challenge the omnipotence of the Queensland Government. This report also recommended the use of tape recorders, but this proposal was rubbished as being too complex for the police to operate, and readily subject to falsification. The report made the following recommendations in relation to Aborigines:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Tape recording must be used when interrogating such persons for an indictable offence; failure to perform this duty will render any evidence so obtained completely inadmissible;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Administrative directives should be drawn up clearly indicating to the police the manner in which such persons should be treated. </PARA>
<PARA>On the one hand the Government praises its inforcement officers, and than as quickly denigrates their competence, intelligence and integrity. As an example of its double standards, the Government has given the officers the right to operate breath analysing equipment which, to my way of thinking, is as equally difficult to operate and more open to abuse than a tape recorder. </PARA>
<PARA> Another major objection to the use of tape recorders and compliance with other provisions of this Bill was that such would be expensive and time consuming. We are dealing with the rights of the individual and matters such as expense and inconvenience should never be given consideration when the liberty and good name of the individual is at stake. I, for one, respect the integrity and intelligence of the Queensland police force and would give to its members the duty to use tape recording devices. Another example of duplicity is that the Queensland Government can readily reel off figures for its Aboriginal and Islander population, but cannot give similar figures on their incarceration. I have been told that to differentiate in this matter would be racist and discriminatory. I leave it to honourable senators to guess the real motive behind the Government's reticence to keep these statistics. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask honourable senators again to read my second reading speech delivered in this chamber on 26 October 1978 which, together with what I have said today, reinforces the urgency of this Bill becoming law at the earliest possible time. I submit that we have the power to enact this legislation-in fact I believe we have the duty to do so. The power was given to the Commonwealth in the referendum in 1967 by 89 per cent of the Australian voting population. Therefore, I demand, on behalf of Aboriginal Australians, that honourable senators be fearless and forthright and move to enact this legislation, and not let us have another Dunkirk, as occurred at Aurukun and Mornington Island.</PARA>
<PARA> I leave honourable senators to ponder a statement made by an unknown Aborigine man:</PARA>
<PARA> The Bible said God made us in his own image and likeness, but the white man tries to make us in his image and likeness. </PARA>
<PARA>For this reason alone, I commend the Bill to the Senate and submit that it merits universal support of all senators. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Acting Deputy Speaker, I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>It is necessary in speaking to this Bill to summarise the events which led ultimately to its introduction. Always Aboriginal people have faced impediments to exercising effectively the right to vote. Adult franchise as it has applied for all other Australian-born citizens, at least for the lower houses of our parliaments, has never existed for Aborigines. Sometimes discrimination was overt-Aborigines had to be granted citizen rights before they could enrol. Even now under Commonwealth law and the law of most States Aborigines, though entitled to enrol and vote, are not compelled to do so as are other native-born or naturalised Australians. Even without deliberate legal impediments, the economic and cultural gap between many Aborigines and the mainstream of Australian society imposes a barrier between them and the effective use of the franchise. Other minority groups, as the former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Chaney, mentioned on 6 June 1979, may face similar difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill applies only to Aborigines, not because we are indifferent to these other groups, but because the only Commonwealth power relevant in this context is a restricted power-restricted, that is, to making laws pertaining to Aborigines. The Bill's scope is further restricted to enrolment to vote. It does not encompass actual voting procedures. The reasons I will detail later. The absence of overt legislative discrimination, though a prerequisite to equality of opportunity to vote, does not of itself guarantee equal opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> Difficulties in oral, written or physical communication arising from a different cultural and geographic background constitute an impediment for some groups even if the letter of the law grants equality. Specifically, complex or restrictive enrolment requirements present greater problems for people whose background and experience is outside the mainstream of our society. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments to the Electoral Act of Western Australia, in 1979, imposed more restrictive enrolment procedures than those of the Commonwealth or any other State with which Aborigines, especially, will have problems in complying. Whether that was the intention or not, that is the result. This Bill seeks to exempt Aborigines from complying with these restrictive procedures. It will require the State electoral registrar in Western Australia to enrol all Aborigines who are on the Commonwealth roll. </PARA>
<PARA> The chain of events leading to this Bill's introduction starts from the Western Australia State election in February 1977. Polling day in the electoral division of Kimberley was turbulent. I will not detail those events, but ultimately an appeal was lodged with a Court of Disputed Returns by the Australian Labor Party candidate, Ernie Bridge, who had been defeated by 93 votes. After prolonged hearings, judgement was given in favour of Bridge with costs against the defendant, Liberal candidate Alan Ridge, then a Minister in the Court Government. Justice Smith ordered a new election. When the appeal was first lodged the Court Government was asked to cover legal costs. It refused. Shortly before the judgement was given it magnanimously offered to pay the costs of both parties. By that time it was apparent that judgement would almost certainly be given in favour of Bridge. In such partisan manner was and is the law administered in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Justice Smith found that 96 people had been improperly deprived of their right to vote for Ernie Bridge and for that reason declared the election void-the winning margin having been only 93 votes. The Premier, when confronted with the judgement, dismissed it as 'one man's opinion'. The improprieties found by Justice Smith were those of a group of Perth lawyers who were briefed by the Liberal Party in obstructive scrutineering tactics to be used in polling booths. The objective was to prevent Aborigines from recording votes, or if that failed, from recording valid votes. In one instance, the Liberal scrutineer told the presiding officer that he had telephoned the returning officer, who had told him that 'how to vote' cards were not to be accepted as evidence of voting intentions. The court found that the alleged conversation did not occur. </PARA>
<PARA> Numerous allegations were made by Western Australian Government members that Aborigines had been manipulated by Ernie Bridge or his supporters. One of those allegations, in the form of a letter by John Tozer, MLC, to the West Australian, was the subject of a libel action by Bridge against Tozer and the newspaper. Judgement ultimately was given in favour of Bridge and $20,000 damages were awarded. The Smith judgment explicitly noted that no evidence of manipulation or malpractice, other than on polling day, had been presented to the court. Notwithstanding that fact, the State Government proceeded with a program based on the assertion that Aborigines were being manipulated and that irregularities were rife in postal voting. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments to the Electoral Act were brought into the Western Australian Parliament's 1977 spring session. So discriminatory against Aborigines were these amendments that they were opposed in the Legislative Assembly not only by the Labor Opposition, but by half the Country Party, and a Liberal back bencher, and were defeated by the casting vote of the Liberal Speaker. The Government's next move was to establish an electoral inquiry under Magistrate Kay. </PARA>
<PARA> The rationale for that inquiry was alleged malpractice by the manipulation of Aboriginal voters. The allegations of manipulation were not upheld by Justice Smith, by the Kay inquiry or in subsequent court proceedings. However, undeterred by the dearth of evidence, Magistrate Kay found that the potential for malpractice did exist and made recommendations on changes to enrolment and voting procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> The Western Australian Government introduced a second Bill in 1979 which adopted most-not all-of the Kay recommendations. It was passed by the Parliament early in October. The major amendment which is the target of this Bill-clause 8 in the Western Australian amendment-is that which requires applications for enrolment to be witnessed by either a justice of the peace, a police officer, a clerk of courts or an electoral officer. Previously applications could be witnessed by any elector, the same as the Commonwealth Act. That amendment, for which we and evidently every other Government in Australia can see no need, is obviously irksome to anyone wanting to enrol or change enrolment. To people with language or other communications problems it is a difficulty. For Aborigines, especially those living in remote areas like the Kimberleys, it is a major deterrent. Except for electoral officers, all the people permitted to witness applications represent authority in Aboriginal eyes. The probability is high that an Aborigine's only previous contact with justices of the peace, policemen or clerks of the court would have been as a victim of the punitive or disciplinary arm of the law. It is no overstatement to say the Aborigines are apprehensive about approaching people in these positions. They are frightened of them. There are Aboriginal justices of the peace at some settlements, but that is far from ubiquitous. </PARA>
<PARA> The Court Government's motive for taking the action it did was telegraphed in a letter written by the then member for Kimberley, Alan Ridge, to one of his supporters, John Fletcher, after the 1977 State election. The letter read:</PARA>
<PARA>I am hopeful that at some time in the future the Electoral Act will be amended with a view to overcoming some of the difficulties which were experienced on polling day. I can foresee that unless this is done, there could be anything up to 4,000 Aborigines on the roll at the next election and, under these circumstances, the Liberal Party would probably be fighting a lost cause. </PARA>
<PARA>The Court of Disputed Returns in 1977 forced the letter to be made public. Needless to say, Alan Ridge had not intended it to become public. The Court Government complied with Mr Ridge's desire to amend the Electoral Act, hoping thereby to prevent Aborigines enrolling in sufficient numbers to defeat the Liberal Party in Kimberley. No doubt some Aborigines have been deterred or otherwise prevented from enrolling but Alan Ridge was defeated by Ernie Bridge in the 1980 State election. </PARA>
<PARA> The harassment of Aborigines at the direction of the then Police Commissioner with at least the tacit approval of Premier Court and Police Minister Hassell continued after the 1980 State election. Ninety charges for alleged breaches of the Electoral Act, relating to postal voting, were laid against three Labor Party campaign workers in Kimberley. These people were arrested and incarcerated on charges for which normally summonses would be issued-a procedure publicly defended by Commissioner Leitch on the grounds that the Western Australian Trades and Labor Council President had once refused to answer a summons. Ultimately all the charges were either thrown out of court or withdrawn by the Crown. </PARA>
<PARA> The three Labor Party workers were white but in an attempt to obtain evidence against them every Aborigine in Kimberley who had applied for a postal vote was interrogated by the police. Some were bundled into paddy waggons, driven to the Wyndham Police Station and questioned, inter alia, about how they had voted, in the presence of Alma Low, President of the Liberal Party's Wyndham branch. </PARA>
<PARA> Some charges were thrown out of court in July. Most were left in limbo till the end of September when Commissioner Leitch announced they would be pressed in court. Just before the 1980 Federal election he announced all charges would be dropped. There is little doubt that Leitch's late September announcement was designed to deter by intimidation, Aborigines from applying for postal votes. None of his partisan actions have been criticised by the Government of Western Australia, many have been explicitly supported. </PARA>
<PARA> The intention of my Bill is to remove the deterrents and impediments to Aboriginal enrolment imposed by clause 8 of the Bill amending the Western Australian Electoral Act in 1979. It effectively ensures that all Aborigines who have complied with Commonwealth Electoral Act procedures will be included in the State roll for the appropriate district and province. The first two clauses are formal only, and clauses 3 to 8 provide:</PARA>
<PARA>Clause 3 'Aboriginal' defined as in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act 1975,</PARA>
<PARA>Other definitions taken from Western Australian Electoral Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 4 Act binds Western Australia and Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 5 states that an Aboriginal who is enrolled to vote in Commonwealth elections shall be entitled to enrol as an elector for Western Australian elections. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 6 supplements clause 5 by stating that a Western Australian Registrar shall not refuse to enrol an Aboriginal for a Western Australian election if that Aboriginal is enrolled as a Commonwealth elector. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 7. Is a machinery clause that provides that where an Aboriginal is enrolled at a particular address for Commonwealth elections then he shall be enrolled for State elections for a division and province appropriate to that address. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 8. Supplements the general purpose of the Act by stating that conditions or restrictions other than those set out in the Commonwealth Electoral Act shall apply to an Aboriginal enrolling for elections in Western Australia and in particular states that no requirement as to witnessing shall be placed on an Aboriginal seeking to enrol in Western Australian elections unless the Aboriginal chooses to comply with any general provisions that may exist. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, therefore, the Bill does no more than guarantee that Aborigines in Western Australia when enrolling for State elections will receive the same treatment under State electoral law as under Commonwealth law. It allows the State to continue to have its own electoral rolls and does not seek to interfere in the manner the State organises its own elections other than to the extent noted above. </PARA>
<PARA> An identical Bill was introduced in the Senate in 1979. Two weeks before it was introduced, I supplied a copy to the office of the then Minister, Senator Chaney. I spoke to his private secretary asking him to tell the Minister that if he or his Department believed the Bill had technical defects or was impractical, I and others who had helped to prepare it would change it accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister did not suggest any changes. I assume the Bill is not technically deficient, and will not be opposed by Government members on technical grounds. Several attempts by the Opposition to take the Bill through its later stages during the last Parliament were defeated by the Government. I intend to take the same action during the Budget session this year, and hope it is not again kept on the shelf. </PARA>
<PARA> I have little doubt that many Government senators, including the former Minister, would support the Bill in a free vote. I also realise, given the condition of the Liberal Party in Western Australia, that overt support by Senator Chaney as Minister could have cost him his preselection. I would expect the present Minister to have similar views on question on aboriginal rights. He would therefore also be persona non grata to the cabal of Northern extremists and fast money men, hiding their sleazy objectives behind a smokescreen of States rights, who control the Western Australian Liberal Party. Senator Baume however, is not subject to their discipline. </PARA>
<PARA> On 6 June, 1979 the following urgency motion was moved in the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA>That Aborigines should have the same opportunity to enrol and vote in State Elections as in Federal Elections. </PARA>
<PARA>It received the support of the Government and was carried without dissent. In the debate Senator Chaney said:</PARA>
<PARA> I have indicated that the Government will support the resolution-it does, subject to the qualifications I am making in this speech. </PARA>
<PARA>The qualifications were of three kinds. Firstly, Senator Chaney said he separated what he called the 'general abuse' from the substance of the motion. The Government, he said, supported the latter but not the former. That qualification should not preclude Government members from supporting this motion. Secondly, he drew attention to a number of practical problems associated with voting and in particular the potential for malpractice associated with illiterate voters. All these qualifications, however, applied to voting practices. The Bill deals only with enrolment. Thirdly, Senator Chaney expressed a somewhat equivocal attitude to a question of Commonwealth power to control State electoral procedures. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>I do not argue that the power does not exist. I say that it is a matter which will almost certainly lead to legal disputation and about which I think one could mount arguments either way. </PARA>
<PARA>If the Commonwealth eschewed all legislation which could conceivably be successfully challenged in the High Court, given that court's notorious record of both political and capricious judgements, the Commonwealth would scarcely legislate at all. None of the qualifications added by Senator Chaney on 6 June provide adequate grounds for opposing the Bill. Indeed, apart from the general support he expressed on behalf of the Government, he pointed out that all disadvantaged people-and most Aborigines are disadvantaged-being without other power, have a special interest in the political power conferred by the franchise. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>But the Government is absolutely committed to the idea that it is of great importance to Aboriginal people that they should be able to exercise their vote;</PARA>
<PARA>These people, being in greater need of assistance, have a particular interest in who forms the Government of the country. For that reason, it is important that they have some say in who should govern the country, or indeed their State. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope that the Government support for the principle of Aboriginal voting given on behalf of the Government by Senator Chaney on that occasion and the hostility to racially based discrimination articulated abroad by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) will ensure that this Bill becomes an Act before the end of this year. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Acting Deputy President, I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to make an alteration to section 44 of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia. The alteration will enable persons holding an office of profit under the Crown to be chosen as senators or as members of the House of Representatives. Before discussing the purpose of this Bill, it is pertinent to examine the provisions of section 44 of the Constitution. Under the heading of 'disqualification', section 44 reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Any person who-</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Is under any acknowledgement of allegiance, obedience, or adherence to a foreign power, or is a subject or a citizen or entitled to the rights or privileges of a subject or a citizen of a foreign power: or</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Is attainted of treason, or has been convicted and is under sentence, or subject to be sentenced, for any offence punishable under the law of the Commonwealth or of a State by imprisonment for one year or longer: or</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) Is an undischarged bankrupt or insolvent; or</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) Holds any office of profit under the Crown, or any pension payable during the pleasure of the Crown out of any of the revenues of the Commonwealth; or</PARA>
<PARA> (v) Has any direct or indirect pecuniary interest in any agreement with the Public Service of the Commonwealth otherwise than as a member and in common with the other members of an incorporated company consisting of more than twenty-five persons:</PARA>
<PARA>shall be incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a senator or a member of the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> But sub-section (iv) does not apply to the office of any of the Queen's Ministers of State for the Commonwealth, or of any of the Queen's Ministers for a State, or to the receipt of pay, half pay, or a pension, by any person as an officer or member of the Queen's navy or army, or to the receipt of pay as an officer or member of the naval or military forces of the Commonwealth by any person whose services are not wholly employed by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>The Constitution Alteration (Holders of Offices of Profit) Bill 1981 relates to sub-section (iv) of section 44. An effect of sub-section (iv) is that any member of the Commonwealth or State public service who seeks election to the Federal Parliament must resign his Public Service appointment prior to nomination. If the public servant does not resign, he continues, of course, to hold an office of profit under the Crown. Thus, if he is successful in the election, he runs the risk of being declared ineligible to sit in the Senate or in the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> Very few would argue that a public servant should be eligible to sit in either the Senate or the House of Representatives. Under the Westminster system, the holding of an office of profit under the Crown is a traditional form of disqualification for parliamentary membership. It is quite conceivable that employment in the Public Service could affect the independence of a member of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> On one hand, the practice that a public servant should not be eligible to sit in the Senate or House of Representatives is a sound one. It prevents a degree of potential conflict of interest from arising. On the other hand, it does restrict the ability of the public servant to contest a Federal election. Other Australian adults enjoy the freedom of nominating for political office without being required, by virtue of constitutional provisions, to resign from their current employment. The public servant, however, is required to resign his position before contesting a Federal election. Thus one of the basic tenets of Australian democracy, namely, the freedom of the individual to offer himself for public service in the Parliament, is severely limited for public servants. </PARA>
<PARA> One important consequence of this situation is that there are probably many highly qualified public servants who could make a significant contribution to this Parliament but who choose not to seek election because of the possiblity of losing their livelihood in merely attempting to enter Parliament. It is all too easy to say that the public servant who desires to serve his country in Parliament should accept the risk of losing his employment. But responsibility tugs hard at the person with a family and spouse to support. The prospect of throwing away job security and all that means for one's family must be too daunting for many public servants even to contemplate a possible parliamentary career. </PARA>
<PARA> I have previously outlined in this Parliament the limited opportunities for re-appointment to the Commonwealth and State public services for public servants who have resigned to contest a Federal election. For a more detailed discussion of this topic, I refer honourable senators to the Senate Hansard of 29 May 1978, pages 2019 and 2020. At this stage, it is simply sufficient to say that in the Commonwealth Public Service or the Public Service of any State or Territory there is at present no right of re-appointment. Certainly the public servant in Australia who unsuccessfully contests a Federal election may be re-appointed but it is important that the word 'may' be stressed. It is clear that there is no automatic right of re-appointment. I am convinced that this Parliament is all the poorer because many highly capable public servants do not, due to the restrictions of section 44 of the Constitution, even consider the prospect of standing for Federal Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> In a submission to the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, the Commonwealth Public Service Board in April 1980 said that amendments would be made to the Commonwealth Public Service Act. These amendments, which have not yet been introduced into the Parliament, were to include:</PARA>
<PARA> Replacing the provision for discretionary reinstatement of unsuccessful candidates in the Public Service by a clear entitlement to reinstatement;</PARA>
<PARA> Amending Public Service General Orders to indicate the legislative position in respect of Commonwealth laws, and to advise public servants to ascertain the provisions of any relevant State laws. </PARA>
<PARA>The Board in its submission admitted that these amendments did not alter the position with regard to State public servants who nominate for Commonwealth seats. For that reason, even if the proposed legislation in relation to the Commonwealth Public Service Act is presented to the Federal Parliament and is subsequently passed, an amendment to section 44 of the Constitution is still necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> In terms of justice for public servants both State and Federal, it is necessary to do something about a system which fetters their rights to nominate for Federal Parliament. In terms of the contribution that Parliament can make to the democratic process, it is important that each person in Australia should, as far as humanly possible, be able to contest a place in the national legislature. Thus we must ensure that public servants are not deterred by unnecessary constraints from offering themselves for parliamentary service. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is aimed towards that end. It allows a person who holds an office of profit under the Crown to be chosen as a senator or a member of the House of Representatives. The Bill further provides, however, that a person who holds an office of profit under the Crown and who has been chosen as a senator or member is not able to receive any allowances or to sit in the Parliament. In other words, he must resign his public service appointment before becoming eligible to take a seat in the Parliament and to draw salary and allowances as a member of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The question could be raised about what would happen if a public servant were elected and did not resign his public service appointment. It appears that sections 20 and 38 of the Constitution would cover such a situation. Under these sections, the place of a senator or member becomes vacant if, without the permission of his house of the Parliament, he fails for two consecutive months to attend Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The alteration of the Constitution as outlined by this Bill would require amendments to some existing Commonwealth and State legislation. These amendments will be necessary because some existing legislation is based on the assumption that public servants cannot be elected to the Federal Parliament whilst still holding their public service appointment. These amendments, however, may be made readily by the Commonwealth and State parliaments. No further constitutional changes are required to allow the necessary complementary legislative amendments to be made. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was speaking to the amendment moved by Senator Button to the Address-in-Reply to the Governor-General's Speech and I was making some comment on the speech made by Mr Burr, the honourable member for Wilmot. I concluded my remarks by saying that I agreed with what he had said in relation to a one line appropriation for the Parliament, and I do not need to go over that. I was also pointing out that he was voicing the same view that I had voiced in this Parliament on many occasions, that the Senate is not a House of review in the true sense. It is a House of frustration when the Liberal-National Country Party Government has the numbers in here and it is just a rubber stamp when it has the numbers in both places.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is one other matter on which I would like to comment and which was referred to by Mr Burr. I quote from page 158 of the House of Representatives Hansard of 25 February 1981. Mr Burr said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Liberal Party of Australia maintains that elected members are free to make their own judgment. However, the reality is vastly different. If a member steps out of line or rocks the boat in any way, he can be subjected to the most intense pressure, from both the parliamentary executive and the party organisation. On the other hand, members who passively toe the line often are rewarded with overseas trips or junior portfolios. </PARA>
<PARA> Rank and file members of the Liberal Party complain that the Public Service has too much power and influence, yet the discipline that they, through their organisation, exert entrenches the Public Service power. If a member suggests that a department is inefficient or that a matter of government operation should be scrutinised, he is accused of disloyalty to the Minister, to the government and to his party, with a covert threat to withdraw endorsement. </PARA>
<PARA>They are fine words coming from a member of the Government because they completely support the view of members of the Labor Party over the years that members of the Liberal and National Country parties, and in particular, the Liberal Party, do not have that privilege which they so often boast they do have, and that is the right of a free vote on issues, the right to cross the floor. We often get catcalls from the other side of the chamber that we on this side of the chamber are bound by our party policy. We make no secret of that. As I explained before the suspension of the sitting for dinner, we support the policy of the party which every financial member of the Labor Party and every affiliate has a hand in making. That is what we go to the people on. But members of the Liberal Party and the National Country Party go out on to the hustings and say: 'We will vote according to our conscience; never mind about the Government. We are not under pressure from anybody'. </PARA>
<PARA> Members of the Labor Party are often accused of being under the thumb of the trade union movement-the people who are not elected to the Parliament. What did Mr Burr say? He said that the Liberal Party was under pressure not only from the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and other Ministers but also from the party organisation. Of course we saw that borne out this week when the position of the Leader of the the Opposition in New South Wales, Mr Mason, came under threat. If we can believe what was said in the daily Press, pressure was brought to bear on his party colleagues from the party organisation that they had to support him and not rock the boat. So, we can see that Mr Burr has blown the cover of the Liberal Party with this famous speech. I am sure it will go down in history. That brings me to the reason that Senator Teague in his maiden speech was so virtuous when he said he would not be a creditable Liberal if he supported the 83 per cent increase in the brandy excise. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have just done that and I did it before, Mr Acting Deputy President. If I am going to be interrupted all the time I will take my full hour to deliver my speech whereas I might have been able to make it in much less time. Nearly five minutes has already been taken out of my speaking time by Senator Maunsell when he was in the chair and now you are trying to sidetrack me, but I will get back to what I was saying.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Burr, the honourable member for Wilmot, has now given the reason that Senator Teague changed his mind and did not vote against the brandy excise that imposed a great taxation burden on the people in the Riverland of South Australia. As you well know, Mr Acting Deputy President, that has reduced the family living standards of many people who live in the Riverland of South Australia. That is what I am referring to in speaking to the amendment that has been put down by my leader, Senator Button. I refer again to what Mr Burr said is the real reason Senator Teague did not have the courage of his convictions after he made his statement not only in this House but also had it published in the Murray Pioneer. Mr Burr has blown the cover of the Liberal Party members. When they come under pressure they back off and all their great scruples and so called right to vote as they please go out the door. There we have it. </PARA>

I am sure that when Mr Burr talked about these pressures he had in mind what befell the late Senator Eric Bessell and Senator Marriott. Because they would not toe the party line if it came to a vote on the Budget-they were not going to vote against the Budget; they would have voted to pass it-they got the chopper when preselection time came and we had the double dissolution. They are no longer in this House. That is on the record for all to see. We have these people opposite who are so free in telling us that they are free agents.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I will come back to it because I want to talk about unemployment and the high and worsening level of inflation. These things have been brought about because your party, Mr Acting Deputy President, has been able to fool the electors into believing that the party allows its members to have a free vote on matters which concern the electorate. As Mr Burr points out, you are shackled hand and foot; you are not allowed to do so. So let us have no more of the nonsense of people coming in here and accusing the Labor Party of being bound by party policy. As I have said, we are proud to be bound to it because we are party to the making of that policy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Teague also in his speech-and I referred to this before dinner-talked about the Tonkin Government. He said that in the last 12 months the State of South Australia had benefited. I point out to the House that the South Australian people under Tonkin have not benefited; they are going down the drain. I predicted this in a speech that I made here on 14 November 1979 when I said that Tonkin's promises that South Australia would be better off under him were empty. I went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that the real truth will hit home to the people of South Australia when their jobs are gone and when the economy of their State runs down under the government that is not able to manage its affairs . . . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not talking about wishful thinking, Senator Bonner. I am going to give you the facts about what has happened in the 18 months. What have we got in South Australia at present? Mr Tonkin coined the phrase 'It's our State, mate'. I put out a pamphlet to say, 'But Tonkin's making it so hard to live here'. What do we see happening in that State which is causing high unemployment and the lowering of living standards? It is the State with the highest petrol prices in Australia; there have been huge increases in State charges; it has the worst unemployment of the mainland States; building works are slowing down; bankruptcies and the crime rates are up; there is inadequate funding for the police; and people are leaving the State in thousands. In fact 5,800 people left South Australia last year under the Tonkin Liberal Government. This is all that has happened.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me deal with the price rises in detail. The Tonkin Government has already hit us with a round of increases-a 25 per cent rise in bus, train and tram fares and a 12.5 per cent rise in the price of water. Where does this money go? It goes to pay for Tonkin's bad management. When Mr Tonkin won a lot of votes from a lot of workers who thought they were going to benefit from his policy of abolishing death duties and gift duties he said that it would cost the State about $11m. What is it costing now? The Budget Papers brought down by the Tonkin Government reveal that the cost is at least $22.4m. The South Australian Liberal Government has to raise that money from somewhere because it made this magnificent gift to the wealthy people of the State and it is raising it by imposing these charges to which I have just referred-the increased charges for electricity, buses and trams and water; all of the things that the poor people use. These are the people who have to pay to try to balance the Budget. We have a record deficit in South Australia-I repeat, a record deficit in South Australia-under the Tonkin Liberal Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You are dead right, Senator Mulvihill; he did. He now has to bear the brunt of it. He is coming under criticism from every quarter in South Australia, even the people who supported him in his election campaign. Even the Master Builders Association is finding there is a rundown in the building sector. Let me refer to an article that was published in the Adelaide Advertiser-which is the Liberal Party bible in South Australia-on 3 March this year. It is headlined 'Food Prices up 10.8 p.c. on last year'. That is over the whole of Australia. But how much did they go up in South Australia? They went up much more than that. They rose by 1.2 per cent in January, making an annual increase of 11.1 per cent. The increase was 0.3 per cent higher than the Australian average. Only one State had a higher increase than South Australia and that is Victoria, which also has a Liberal Government. The increase there was about 12 per cent. The price of fruit and vegetables in South Australia rose by 7.4 per cent for the month to be a staggering 43.2 per cent higher than in January 1980. The Labor Party went out of office in South Australia in October 1979. What has happened since that time? Compared with the 1980 figures there has been a massive increase to January of this year of 43.2 per cent in the price of fruit and vegetables to people who depend on them for their staple diet. These are the people who cannot afford to go to the high priced hotels and cafes for a meal as the people who support the Tonkin Liberal Government do. It is the workers who have to foot the bill. This is the problem with which we are faced and which I predicted when I spoke in this place in 1979 after the Tonkin Government was elected. Of course I do not suggest that I am a person who can gaze into a crystal ball and come up with answers on every occasion but on this occasion I predicted very accurately that South Australia would go down the drain under the Tonkin Liberal Government. Senator Lajovic spoke at length about unemployment and how this Government with which he is proud to be associated was doing something to create more jobs.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Lajovic spoke about the creation of more jobs for apprentices and he also mentioned unemployment. I wish to cite figures from Commonwealth Employment Service statistics. This Government has decided not to use the CES figures for its unemployment statistics because they do not show it up in as good a light as the Australian Bureau of Statistics figures do. There is a good reason. In the CES publication Monthly Review of the Employment Situation it is stated on page 14:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> They exclude persons who work for one hour or more during the survey week, although they may have been registered with the CES, e.g. because they become unemployed during the week or worked for only short periods;</PARA>
<PARA>The CES is talking about how the ABS does its surveys. If a person says in an interview that he had a job for one hour of one week then he is put down as having had a job. No one in this community could exist on the amount of money he could earn in one hour in any one week. Yet that is the way the CES figures are compiled. In Estimates committees when we have had officers from the Bureau of Statistics before us I have complained that this is not the fair way to conduct a survey. The CES figures are the only fair figures. It has the only fair way of compiling figures for unemployed people, employed people or job vacancies. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4L7">Senator McLAREN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am talking about the comparison between the two. The CES figures I am talking about do not include people who already have a job. They include people who are registered for employment and people who would be getting the unemployment benefit at the time this bulletin was compiled. Let us have a look at the figures in South Australia. I wish to quote again from the CES publication in which Mr Viner has a hand because he is the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs. The publication states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In South Australia the number of unemployed persons . . . rose by 3061 or 6.0 per cent to 53,941 or 8.8 per cent of the South Australian total labour force during January 1981 (compared with a rise of 2555 or 5.4 per cent to 49,531-an unemployment rate of 8.3 per cent-during January 1980). </PARA>
<PARA>There we have it. The figures have gone from 8.3 per cent in January 1980 to 8.8 per cent in January 1981. So there has been an increase. Yet these people on the opposite side of the chamber maintain that the Government is creating jobs for the people. It is not creating jobs; it is putting more people out of work. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The rise over the year to January 1981 was 4410 or 8.9 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>There was an increase of 8.8 per cent in the number of unemployed people in South Australia during 12 months. They are the figures for the first 12 months that the Liberal Government was in office in South Australia. These are the figures that we have to take cognisance of. It is all very well for people to get up here and to go out in public and say that the Fraser Government is doing a wonderful thing for the economy of this country by decreasing unemployment and by creating more jobs. But publications which the Government has put out, which are authorised by the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, give figures which prove otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA> I have an office in the same building as does the Department of Social Security. There is a continuous stream of people going into that office all the time that it is open. There are times when they have to wait nearly an hour, because there are so many people there, to get an interview in order to apply for the dole because they cannot find jobs. Yet the people sitting opposite say: 'Oh well, they will not work, they do not want a job'. Those people want a job all right. I have pointed out here tonight one instance of a man with a dent knocking business in my home town. He employed two apprentices thinking that he would be able to qualify for some of the grant money. Of course he cannot get a cent. I pointed that out to Senator Lajovic before the suspension of the sitting for dinner. This is a case in which a person who wants to employ people cannot get assistance from the Government. I showed Senator Lajovic the pamphlets that the Government puts out which lead employers to think they will get assistance. In all good faith they employ apprentices, but when they apply for the grant under the Commonwealth Rebate for Apprentice Full-time Training scheme they cannot get a cent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know why. Senator Watson should know because he is a Government senator. He ought to be able to tell me why. Perhaps somebody on the Government side can tell me why these people cannot get this grant if the Government wants to train people. I agree with Senator Lajovic that we ought to be training more young people. The Government is now talking about a resources boom. There is no resources boom. It is using that claim as a ploy to import skilled people because it does not want to spend the money on training Australians. It wants to bring people who have certain skills into this country and put them to work at the expense of our own work force. My colleague, Senator McIntosh, pointed out to me during the dinner recess that the last census figures show that about 300,000 qualified tradesmen in this country have left their jobs because they cannot get proper remuneration for the work that they have been trained to do. Now the Government is bringing in skilled workers from overseas who will probably accept a lesser rate of pay and lower working conditions than our tradesmen would accept. That is something that the Government must look at very quickly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another thing that concerns many of my constituents in South Australia is that the Government is allowing so-called refugees into this country, finding accommodation for them and giving them the same rights as Australian citizens immediately they come ashore. Immediately some of them arrive-I am talking about the Vietnamese refugees-many are able to buy motor cars. They have plenty of money, yet they come here as so-called political refugees and are welcomed with open arms because the Government knows that they will not be bothered about working standards when they get jobs. They will be prepared to toe the line in the same way as members of the Liberal Party are prepared to toe the line when the people at the top raise the fist. They will not stick up for the working conditions of the residents of Australia. When members of the Australian work force go on strike because they cannot obtain justice, Government members say that they are holding the country to ransom. </PARA>

<PARA> The other matter to which I refer is a matter of great concern to the people in South Australia and it is causing a lot of disquiet. On Tuesday when I was speaking to the tabling of the Australian Water Resources Council report I said that I would be making some further inquiries as to why the South Australian Minister of Water Resources had not raised the matter of salinity in the River Murray at the Council's meeting. I want to correct the record now and say that my inquiries have revealed that at the Australian Water Resources Council meetings it is generally accepted that the matters for discussion are to be of a mutual interest. Of course, it is only common sense to realise, after being told that, that the River Murray would not be of mutual interest to States such as Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory. I am informed that is the reason why that matter would not have been raised at the meetings, but there are other avenues at which the matter can be raised. </PARA>
<PARA> I am greatly concerned about the attitude the South Australian Minister has adopted to the proposed amendments to the River Murray Waters Agreement. He has whipped up some enthusiasm among some irrigators in South Australia. They, in turn, are writing to us. No doubt members on the other side, particularly South Australian members, have received letters from these organisations asking us to support what the South Australian Government is doing. I shall quote from a letter I received from the South Australian Murray irrigators at Waikerie. These people, unfortunately, are not very well informed. I would have thought that the Minister, who lives in that area and represents those people, would have informed them that public protests will not assist in any way to secure satisfactory amendments to the River Murray Waters Agreement. The letter stated:</PARA>
<PARA> At the present time the South Australian Government is engaged in a strenuous campaign to protect South Australia's rights under the River Murray Waters Agreement and at the same time to have the powers of the River Murray Commission extended to cover control over water quality. </PARA>
<PARA> This campaign is more likely to succeed if it has the full support of the Senators and House of Representative members from South Australia all of whom represent people whose future will be jeopardised if action is not taken immediately to protect their interests. </PARA>
<PARA> We therefore ask you to support the South Australian Government in its efforts to safeguard the State's water resources and that you impress upon the Minister for National Development and the Government the urgency and importance of the negotiations which are at present being conducted between the three State governments and the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>I am quite prepared to do that. As a matter of fact, I have done that. I support the negotiations, but I do not support what the present Minister has been doing. When he can he has been speaking on the radio, and he has been reported in the Press, criticising the New South Wales Government and stirring up no end of trouble. As I have said in this Parliament before, the only result he will get from those actions is perhaps the antagonisation of both other governments involved, the New South Wales Government and the Victorian Government, which stand to gain nothing at all from a River Murray agreement because those States have first use of the river. The people of South Australia stand to lose the most if he jeopardises these discussions. I have pleaded in the Parliament and I have written to these people and told them that he ought to back off and have a bit of common sense. I was informed today by sources which I do not want to reveal that he may at last be taking a conciliatory attitude rather than continuing his confrontation. I only hope, as I said in a speech I made in this place the other day, that he has not gone too far with his criticism of the other two States and that they will be prepared to sit down and renegotiate matters concerning the River Murray Commission in a rational way so that we in South Australia can be protected. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have pointed out to these people, Mr Arnold was the member for Chaffey when the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources conducted a public inquiry into Australia's water resources and the Commonwealth's role in that area. I told many people in the Riverland, and it was advertised in the daily Press, that public inquiries were being held. Nobody in the Riverland of South Australia made a submission, not even the Minister, who was at the time of the inquiry a member of the South Australian Opposition. Nothing was wrong. Everything was okay. That was a couple of years ago. About four years ago we commenced our inquiry and the report was tabled in this Parliament in 1978. Neither Mr Arnold nor any other people in the Riverland made a submission to our Committee about the problem of salinity which existed in the Riverland of South Australia. As I pointed out to them, we could have heard their submissions and probably said something about the problem in South Australia in the report. We did not hear a word. We had many representations from people in south-west New South Wales, particularly in the Wakool area. We were able to see at first hand the magnificent work that was being done there to try to control salinity and the massive amount of money that was being expended on putting down tube well bores to try to get rid of the salinity to help to give us better quality water. </PARA>
<PARA> The Dunstan and Corcoran governments were criticised by somebody in this place a while ago. The Dunstan Government, when Des Corcoran was Minister of Works, was especially criticised. He went about negotiating this new agreement in a very workman-like manner. He did not try to score political kudos from Mr Askin and Mr Lewis when they were Premiers of a Liberal government in New South Wales as Mr Arnold is doing now against Mr Wran. Mr Corcoran knew that there was no mileage in it. He treated those people fairly and talked to them in a common-sense manner. To try to score some cheap political kudos in the Riverland Mr Arnold is shouting from the roof tops that the New South Wales Government has to come to the party and give us better quality water. The New South Wales Government does not have to if it does not want to. Senator Jessop, a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment, would know that. He would know that the only way to reach some agreement is to sit down and talk about these matters rationally and not try to score political points as Mr Arnold has been doing. </PARA>
<PARA> I have also had a similar representation from the Lower Murray Private Irrigators Association at Tailem Bend in South Australia. They are the matters that I wanted to mention. I hope that Senator Jessop will be able to tell his South Australian colleague that what his colleague has been doing is only doing damage to the negotiations that are going on and that he ought to cool his heels and have a bit of common sense. The proof is there that he was not concerned about salinity in the River Murray a few years ago when we were holding the inquiry, but he is very concerned now when he thinks he can score some cheap political points from the New South Wales Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to mention another matter. Honourable senators opposite might have thought I have been very critical of them tonight. I want to give some credit to the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) for the letter I received from him today. I do not know whether he was the person who invented the little social security card I received, but whoever it was in his Department, I think it is a great innovation. Members of parliament can now carry this little card with them and when they are asked questions about the pension-whether it be the widow's pension, the aged pension, the invalid pension-or the unemployment benefit or whatever, they can just take out that card and see at a glance what the amount is. No member can keep in his head all the benefits to which people are entitled. I think Senator Chaney ought to be commended for circulating that card to members of parliament and making the statement in his letter dated 4 March, which I received today, that it will be updated in May. No doubt somebody in his Department has thought up this idea and, whoever it is, I give him due credit for thinking of that innovation. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter I mention was raised in the Parliament today by Senator Lewis. It was raised in the other House last night by Mr Fraser. Of course, it was followed up in this place by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Carrick) denigrating the Soviet Union and implying all sorts of improper motives to the Soviet Ambassador in Australia which are quite unfounded. It is just a political ball game. Honourable senators opposite are engaged in trying to belittle the Soviet Union and saying what a great danger that country is to us. Of course, their memories are very short. If they looked back in history they would find that the Soviet Union and its people have never been an enemy of the Allies. In the last two world wars the Russians fought on the side of the Allies. </PARA>

<PARA> I point out that despite the fact that the Government continually criticises the Soviet Union it is prepared to trade with it. The trade amounts to large sums of money. The Government is interested in the Soviet Union's money and nothing else. All the Government wants to do is to criticise the Soviets. Woe betide the primary industry in this country if suddenly the Soviet Union finds another source of supply for wheat and wool and those other commodities which the Soviet Union buys from this country. The way members of the Government are carrying on under their leader it could well bring that about. I give the Government a warning that it ought to be more careful. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us have a look at the answer given yesterday, 4 March, by Mr Anthony to Mr Kerin who is our spokesman on primary industry. It related to the amount of trade between Australia and the Soviet Union which is in our favour by a massive amount. I refer firstly to mutton. In 1976-77 some $9,826,000 worth of mutton was sold to the Soviet Union. The latest figures which Mr Anthony gives for the year 1979-80 show that mutton to the value of $36,674,000-a massive increase-was exported. In 1978-79 some $15,261,000 worth of wheat was sold to the Soviets. The figure to the end of June last year was $432m. Let us take a look at rice exports to the Soviet Union. In the year 1977-78, the total value was $3,152,000. Last year, to 30 June, the figure was $37,282,000-a massive increase. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me now turn to barley, of which South Australia grows a lot. We are very interested in the welfare of our barley growers. A total of $9,126,000 worth of barley was sold to the Soviet Union in 1976-77. For the year ended 30 June last the figure was $139,738,000. This is a massive increase in the sales of barley to the Soviet Union. Let us have a look at wool. Most of the wool growers support the people who sit opposite. In the year 1978-79, $185,973,000 worth of wool was sold to the Soviet Union. The amount last year to June 30th was $203,886,000. How much of that wool was Mr Fraser's wool? The man who stands up in his place and denigrates the Soviet Union is quite prepared to sell Nareen Wool to the Soviet Union. He does his best in this Parliament to embarrass the ambassador who resides here in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us have a look at the total value of primary products which are sold to the Soviet Union. The total value of agricultural commodity exports to the Soviet Union in 1978-79 was $221,521,000. To the end of June last year it was $897,837,000. So the figures are quadrupled. We hear talk about putting embargoes on the Soviet Union and that Australia can live without Soviet trade. Australia cannot do so. Not one person opposite, if he spoke the truth, would be prepared to stand up and say that Australia should cease trading with the Soviet Union. If Senator Lajovic, who is trying to interject, was prepared to do that the coalition would not have a country seat in the Parliament. As I have said, the Soviet Union's money is good but its socialist policies are not. That is the very thing Senator Lajovic hinged his speech on tonight. All Government members were talking anti-socialist. I have pointed out to Senator Lajovic that he is waxing fat on the exports of the primary producers of this country to the Soviet Union. He does not get up and protest about that. When he is prepared to say that we ought to put an embargo on the sale of agricultural products to the Soviet Union I will have a little more respect for him but will not agree with him. While he is talking with a forked tongue I have no respect for him. Government members can attempt to rebut me if they like. I will be prepared to hear their rebuttal. I fully support the amendment moved by my colleague, Senator Button. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know about that. It is not for me to answer that question. I am pleased to stand behind Senator Messner and support him in any way I can. I refer now to one or two matters mentioned by Senator McLaren from South Australia. I think he referred to the record of the South Australian Liberal Government. I was very interested to see the results of a recent gallup poll in South Australia concerning an electoral assessment of the Premier of South Australia. His rating was extremely high compared with other leaders in this country. That seems to me to be significant of the regard in which he is held in South Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The South Australian Government's development program, I believe, has encouraged people in South Australia to be somewhat more optimistic than they were in the last decade of Labor government in that State. All the Labor Government did seemed to me to be associated with the provision of arts and all the frivolous sorts of policies that we all enjoy but which contribute nothing or very little to the development of the State. Since the Liberal Party has been in government in South Australia there seems to me to have been a feeling of optimism. I suggest that this optimism ought to be encouraged even by the Labor Party because we have a potential for development in South Australia that is quite remarkable. We have mineral resources in the north eastern part of the State and coal deposits. Those resources give me and many other people in South Australia a feeling of optimism. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things I regret is that the attitude of the Labor Party to mining uranium has tended to retard the progress of South Australia. I raised this matter in the Senate last week when I expressed some gratitute for and some sort of hope at a statement made by Mr John Bannon, the Leader of the Opposition in South Australia. He was reported to have said that the Labor Party had changed its attitude with respect to the development of uranium. In the Senate I learned by way of interjection or from some common opposite that this was not so. I regret that very much because, having studied the uranium mining issue, I believe it is as safe as, if not safer than, any other mining. All mining operations are hazardous. Coal mining operations have claimed the lives of far more people than most other mining operations in the world. It seems to me that the Opposition has some sort of veil drawn across its eyes when it comes to recognising the advantages of mining uranium in a State like South Australia. I believe John Bannon was right in what he was reported to have said. I think some members of the Labor Party believe that what Mr Bannon was reported to have said is quite right, that the party should change its attitude to the development of the uranium in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Another point I want to take up concerns the criticism levelled at Mr Peter Arnold, the Minister of Water Resources in South Australia. I am glad to say that Senator McLaren admitted that the Australian Water Resources Council was not really an appropriate forum in which to raise the question of salinity as far as the three states of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia are concerned. However, Mr Arnold at the meeting in question in Brisbane on 25 June raised a matter in an informal sense, with the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Carrick). He got his message through on that occasion. The Minister is on record as commenting on salinity at the twenty-second meeting of the Council held on 23 November 1979. He identified salinity as a major problem in South Australia and stressed that an increase in the availability of funds for this purpose would allow greater effort in mitigating the problem. The matter did not arise on the occasion that Senator McLaren referred to. </PARA>

I refer to the need for a national approach to our water resources. I have said that time and again and I repeat it here tonight. This matter has been the subject of several reports.

I cannot see anything wrong with that. I took over the chairmanship of my committee from Senator Keeffe. I believe that Senator Keeffe's committee-it was known as the Keeffe Committee in those days-did some valuable work. I do not regard that as being anything other than a compliment to the committee of which Senator Keeffe was chairman. Let me refer to the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources, of which Senator McLaren is a very hard-working member. I pay a tribute to him. Senator Thomas has told me how reliable Senator McLaren happens to be on that committee. I endorse that. I believe, despite the honourable senator's dulcet tones and his praiseworthy attitude that he expresses frequently towards honourable senators on this side of the House, he is a genuinely hard-working member of that Committee. The National Resources Committee presented a report which really endorsed the conclusions of the Committee chaired by Senator Davidson in 1970, as did the committee of which I am proud to have been chairman and on which Senators Mulvihill and Melzer were representatives of the Opposition. I pay tribute to their efforts because I could not wish for more reliable, more faithful or more earnest members of a committee than were those two honourable senators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Our committee made the comment that it believed that the Government was evading-we did not use those terms but that is what we meant; I am sure that would be endorsed by the honourable senators on my committee-taking a national approach to water resources in this country. I have said time and again that our most important resource in this country is water. Without water we cannot develop our country properly. Without high quality water, South Australia and some parts of Western Australia would suffer because of an increase in salinity or because of a decrease in nutrients resulting perhaps from indiscriminate agricultural practices or some unfortunate forestry practices in some areas. We believe it is important that the national Government pay more attention to this problem. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2G7">Senator JESSOP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I intended to refer to that subject a little later but now that the honourable senator has interjected I will say something about it now. As a result of the visit to trouble spots along the River Murray the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment discovered that irresponsible irrigation practices were being carried out. I think that occurs largely because in many instances people are provided with an amount of water to use and they use it irrespective of whether they need it. I believe it would be wise, in the interests of responsible management of irrigated properties, for all governments to introduce regulations or legislation requiring people to pay for the water they use rather than give them an amount of water to use carte blanche. It is human nature for people to say: 'The water is here; let us use it'. The result of that action happens to be quite unfortunate to the neighbour who lives in a lower terrain. We saw evidence of this in Kerang-it was quite a case in point-where an irrigator was flooding his property to the detriment of his neighbour. I think that is a good point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment we stated that more attention ought to be given to more responsible irrigation management. I reiterate that our view was an endorsement of the suggestion made by the Senate Select Committee on Water Pollution, of which my colleague Senator Davidson was Chairman, that there ought to be a national approach. On page 9 of the report of the Standing Committee on Science and the Environment relating to the continuing scrutiny of pollution in the River Murray under the heading 'A National Approach' it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee concluded that the whole task of water resources management could best be undertaken on a national scale. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that is the way we should approach it. It is quite unacceptable that the governments concerned with the River Murray Commission have been dilly-dallying about taking action to ensure that the River Murray Commission is given control over water quality. I believe people on both sides of this House would endorse that point. In this respect we made a point of mentioning that there was a need for a co-ordinated approach to management. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee strongly believes that as a first step towards better management, the River Murray Waters Agreement should be amended to allow the Commission:</PARA>

<PARA> Water Quality</PARA>
<PARA> Flood Mitigation</PARA>
<PARA> Flood plain management</PARA>

<PARA>Until we do that sort of thing and until the States concerned recognise that this matter transcends individual States' interests and becomes a problem of national importance, I do not think we will get anywhere.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2G7">Senator JESSOP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know. I am merely suggesting that there have been too many reports and it is about time for action. We have been going on since 1970 when the Senate Select Committee on Water Pollution report was put down and we are still messing around with arguments about the River Murray Agreement which should have been rectified a decade ago. We should be further along the road to establishing some sort of responsible attitude to water quality and quantity in Australia. I think that the amount of money that the Government has spent on water quality and conservation has been miserable. The matter ought to be rectified because without water we cannot do anything. I regard it as being a top priority. I suggest that the Government ought to move in concert with the States to establish a national water authority. It may well be that the River Murray Commission could be expanded to adopt that role. I do not know, but I am making what I regard to be a positive suggestion. Within that authority there ought to be gathered together a number of biologists, hydrologists, engineers and other people concerned with preserving the quality of water to form a centre of excellence with respect to salinity control and other pollution control. Until we do that and until we come to grips with the need for massive funding to achieve it I believe it will retard the development of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to raise another matter about which I have been worried. I know that Senator Mulvihill and other members of the Committee on Science and the Environment were also worried that the salinity level in many of the streams in Australia exceeds the World Health Organisation's standards for potable water. I am glad to see that Senator Melzer is in the chair because she has some concern about this matter. I have already referred to the way in which she supported the Committee so well. We are worried that insufficient research is being done in Australia with respect to the effects on hypertension of this high level of salt in our drinking water. What effect does this have on hypertension? Does Senator Cavanagh's blood pressure suffer because he has been drinking water in South Australia? Does my blood pressure suffer because of the high salinity level in the water that we drink in copious quantities in that State? What effect has this saline level in the waters of Australia on renal disease among adults? What effect does it have on renal disease among children? What effect does it have on the unborn child? If I were asked how much research has been carried out in Australia on those questions I would say: 'Practically nothing'. I believe there is a need for far more funding to be provided for research into these very important public health issues. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter that would be of concern, I believe, to South Australians in particular but to all other Australians is the virus which causes amoebic meningitis. This matter has been given a lot of public airing in South Australia in recent times since the unfortunate death of a young boy in January after contracting a water-borne virus. I think we have to come to grips with the need to ensure that these water supplies are filtered and that they are properly chlorinated and dealt with in a way that will remove the fear and alarm that have been caused in recent times in my State. </PARA>

I am concerned about the salinity level in the water of South Australia, having listened to what he said tonight. I am merely stating that there are many people in my State who are quite concerned about it, not the least being a gentleman called Professor Williams, who was in my office recently. He is the Professor of Zoology at the University of Adelaide. In May 1980, at a symposium organised by ANZUS, he presented a paper entitled 'Biology Problems in the Management of Australian Water Resources'. I should like to refer to some passages of his paper, if I may. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Water quality in Australia as much as elsewhere, has become an important matter in water resource management. </PARA>
<PARA> We are abysmally ignorant in many areas of fresh water ecology. The miniscule extent of our scientific knowledge of the biology of the River Murray, for example, never ceases to amaze me. </PARA>
<PARA> Whole groups of the freshwater fauna-if not flora-have been badly researched, and remain so. </PARA>
<PARA> We lack any cohesive national organisation specifically charged to undertake water resource investigations in the broad sense. We do not have, as do the South Africans, a national institute for water research, or as do the Brits-</PARA>
<PARA>As he puts it-</PARA>
<PARA>A water research centre. The Australian Water Resources Council does not fill that niche, and nor has, at least so far, CSIRO. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian waters are different in so many ways-physically, chemically and biologically-from those on other continents, that the results of many biological investigations undertaken elsewhere cannot be directly used by us. </PARA>
<PARA> Our waters are frequently more turbid, more saline and more erratic-. </PARA>

<PARA> Our waters are frequently more turbid, more saline, more erratic in flow, or inhabited by animals and plants peculiar to them. </PARA>
<PARA> If we ask the River Murray to serve as a source of domestic water supplies, as a natural sewer and drain, and as a biological treatment mechanism for wastes discharged to it, we would be wise to attempt to define its limits to perform these tasks adequately: We would be wise to learn more of its ecology than we have. </PARA>
<PARA> Another major water resource problem of a general sort which at least indirectly has a biological basis is that of rising salinities in rivers. That problem is of special concern for us in Adelaide, for about two thirds of our water comes from the Murray, a river which is becoming inexorably saltier. </PARA>
<PARA> A key factor implicated here is irrigation. The management of irrigated crops to minimise environmental damage is scarcely a problem for aquatic biologists, but it is certainly a problem for biologists nonetheless. </PARA>

I pointed out recently that the annual average salt load entering South Australia from upstream is 1.1m tonnes a year, the ground water inflows comprise 0.25m tonnes, drainage inflows comprise 0.25m tonnes, and tributary inflows comprise 600,000 tonnes. </PARA>

I suggest that they go further and adopt the recommendations that the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment has made with respect to flood plain management and recreational activities. I believe these things transcend State interest, although work ought to be done in a co-operative sense with the States.

Before I refer to that matter, I wish to chime in on some of the remarks of Senator Jessop. I noticed that he rightly mentioned that the salinity problem of the River Murray is a national one. I think you, Madam Acting Deputy President, would agree that one cannot help making a contrast between our policy in this matter and the adventuresome policy of the post-war Prime Minister, Ben Chifley, when he threatened to use defence powers to create the magnificent Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Scheme. In subsequent years we have created the idea that 'centralism' in government is a dirty word. We have put too much of a premium on whether people are Victorians, South Australians, New South Welshmen or people from one of the other States. This is one of the reasons disunity exists in regard to the Murray River problem. Of course it is an enormous problem.

<PARA> A fortnight ago I was with a number of people at a ceremony to pay tribute to the 119 men killed on the Snowy Mountains Scheme, the vast majority of whom came here from other lands to work. I like to believe that they were not working for New South Wales, Victoria or South Australia but for Australia. I believe that on this whole Murray question, the sooner we ride roughshod over every State Premier, irrespective of his political affinities, and use defence powers the sooner we will solve this problem. In World War I and World War II-independent of the war effort-and in the immediate post-war era there were major developments. I suppose Trans-Australia Airlines would not have been established if it had not been for the high morale boosting attitude of a new nation after World War II. There is a host of other projects I could mention. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the manpower policy. Senator Lajovic referred to various overseas trade practices, and I agree with much of what he said. As a matter of fact about four years ago a tripartite mission went overseas. In fact, I think the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Mr Cliff Dolan, was a member. One of the places that took top honours, as he would well know, was Litostroy in Slovenia, which provides excellent training for tradesmen and has well laid out workshops-everything. I do not think we can act as if we are wearing blinkers. On the other hand, many tradesmen from overseas have credentials. I do not have a racist attitude, but I know that all honourable senators have had people from overseas making representations to them. One fellow had a diploma from New Delhi or one of the other Indian cities stating that he was a fitter and turner. I do not doubt that such a person had some fairly good technical training, but when he arrived here he was not competent to go on a workshop floor. He would not have had the necessary training. </PARA>
<PARA> When we talk about our apprenticeship system it must be remembered that the first man to sound the tocsin about anticipated apprenticeship loss or wastage was none other than Mr Clyde Cameron in the 1972-74 era when he first advanced the theory of giving incentives to employers to take on apprentices. In New South Wales it was usually the railways, the Broken Hill Co. Pty Ltd and Qantas Airways Ltd that provided the bulk of the apprenticeships. Other firms waited until a person became a journeyman and then grabbed him. They ought to have woken up a little earlier. Senator Lajovic referred to the particular mix that we get among apprentices and gave statistics. I concede that it must be remembered that the facts of life are such that we have a fair mix of Labor and non-Labor State governments. I suppose that the Premier of the premier State, Neville Wran, and his Minister for Industrial Relations, the Honourable P. D. Hills, have played their part in encouraging apprenticeships. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the problems relates to the interval between two wards. That does not apply only in Australia. Some honourable senators have heard the famous story of the town that was murdered. The author was Ellen Wilkinson, a very fine socialist member of the House of Commons. She wrote the story of the town of Jarrow, a shipyard town, in the early 1930s. It was a dead town. By 1937 when Hitlerism was on the march the authorities suddenly tried to reconstruct the city. They tried to entice boilermakers, shipwrights and fitters away from their jobs in Britain. A similar situation has occurred in Australia. Many people, including my father, who was not a craftsman but who worked in the gas industry, although they were not sacked, were rationed to work for one week in six. It is that broad panorama that I am trying to sketch tonight to show why there was so much reluctance, and rightly so, to look at the long term. When we bring in people from overseas as tradesmen we have to consider our capacity to put them all into work and keep them there for their working lives. Rightly, Australia has never had a bar of the guest worker system. The fat cat countries such as Germany and Belgium bring in foreign workers and throw them out when they no longer need them. Yet they are the same countries that requested martial aid in the early post-war years. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleagues Senator Tate and Senator Bishop frequently ask questions at Estimates committees as to why Australia does not have an updated computerisation system that gives a proper picture of our actual occupation needs in the various categories. In the last three days there has been a series of articles in the Australian Financial Review by Rod Wise indicating some sceptical attitudes to the broad figures that are often pulled out. I do not doubt that there will be a sort of mini-bonanza in relation to the North West Shelf, but people talk in lofty terms of employing 4,000 boilermakers and 5,000 fitters. Even if a job lasts for five years, we must return to the theme that people come here on a permanent basis. We must look forward. I do not think this Government has fully appreciated that fact. </PARA>
<PARA> I took representatives of the Australian Railways Union to see Michael Hodgman the other week about the extension of a long term lease on a holiday camp. We discussed the economies of union members from the western part of New South Wales having cheap holidays at Jervis Bay. In relation to costs, they pointed out to the Minister, that as a result of the new technology the number of signalmen operating from Newcastle to the Queensland border will be reduced to 10 or 12 men. The total number of members of the union will be compressed from 20,000 to 13,000. That is the general situation confronting most unions. We can be quite overcome by the prospect of job training schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> The same situation would apply to an olympic training squad. I suppose I am pretty close to the truth when I say that some of our athletes train assiduously for three or four years, but they did not get to the Moscow Olympic Games. I will not canvass why some went and some did not. Generally there has to be something beyond the idea of a massive retraining scheme. That is why I take the Senate beyond these dimensions. A combination of attitudes and postures are presented by Mr Viner, Mr Peacock and the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street). This is why I bring him in. Whilst this is not primarily a high wage area there are 50,000 jobs on the line and we dither about our relations with all these member countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations. How much are we supposed to take from these ASEAN countries in relation to clothing, textiles and tyres in order to have stable relations? Politicians, particularly members of the National Country Party, talk about the relativity of wages between tyre builders employed by the Goodyear tyre company or the Dunlop rubber company in Victoria and somebody working in Hong Kong or South Korea. People try to argue that every job in that industry is subsidised. The fact is that a person, if he is subsidised-I do not accept the idea completely-is an Australian taxpayer. That is how the revenue is returned. People talk about slicing off, giving unlimited taxation and cutting back on government grants. The fallacy in this thesis is that the people in the Welsh valleys where the steel industry was cut back have become statistics. They become people receiving unemployment relief. The relief payments rise as a result. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to Milton Friedman's theories and President Reagan's policy. President Reagan is hedging already. Let us take the shipbuilding industry. It is possibly true that Poland and Japan can build ships more cheaply than any other country can. The budget of the conservative Reagan Government does not interfere with shipbuilding subsidies on the West Coast. He realises that the industry there is different from the steel industry in Wales which has not got Mrs Thatcher what she sought. In the Australian context I am worried about the cost of 50,000 or 60,000 jobs in the industry being the price for alleged stability in Asia. We talk about peace in Asia. In South Korea there was a war in the 1950s. I do not argue with the United Nations policy; it was probably correct. I do not put South Korea in the same category as Vietnam. It is a different ball game. What have we got out of the Korean War? Can anybody tell me that there is more democracy in South Korea than there is in North Korea? We send aid to those people and what do we see for it? Some people say: 'Look at the communists. What are they doing to the clergymen of all beliefs?' The clergymen tell the worker on the workshop floor of the textile industry in Korea that he has been exploited, and he has. If he is not born in Korea he is deported. Can anyone tell me that the so-called parliamentary democracy in Pakistan, where Opposition leaders are gunned down, is any different from any country that has a totalitarian policy leaning to the Left?</PARA>
<PARA> As fare as foreign relations are concerned, Australia is so easy going in relation to United Nations relief. I make no apology for saying that countries of that character would receive no relief at all from me. I suppose that as Australians we are proud of the fact that we pay our dues to the United Nations. There has been a botch job. I have before me an article from the London Guardian by Victoria Brittain in Nairobi. She reports on the situation in Uganda where there has been a complete botch between the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and kindred organisations on logistics and their inability to provide lorries to take food to Nairobi. There has been too much of this sort of thing. There was another scandal in Cambodia. I just wonder whether our foreign affairs people who attend meetings of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and auxiliary bodies that deal with food supplies ever ask any questions about what rorts are going on. </PARA>
<PARA> The United States voiced a grievance at the International Labor Organisation-I did not agree with its action in any way-and did not pay any subscriptions for a few years. I wonder whether we should not do the same in relation to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. I say this for a different reason. About 12 months ago I had occasion at a seminar to talk to a Brazilian who was here as a representative of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. He was justifying to me why we had a prime responsibility to take refugees from South East Asia-the Vietnamese and other people. He said that there was no need for us to worry about Latin America. Then he said to me: 'Anyway, many of those Latin Americans are disgruntled trade unionists'. If ever a man had an ideological bias, he did. He was well paid for that job. </PARA>
<PARA> I can never get any worthwhile information in this area. With the change to our Estimates committees I will be awaiting with glee-and rolling up my sleeves-an opportunity to grill the Foreign Affairs people as to why we are so gutless when dealing with foreign aid. It is time we were a little more even-handed. We should reward our friends and punish our enemies, and I say that in the diplomatic sense. I am talking about some of these fascit and neo-fascist countries that we never admonish. Before Christmas my colleagues Senator Evans and Senator Chipp asked a series of questions in this respect, and I marry that matter to Senator McLaren's asking whether we should have admonished the Soviet Ambassador. Whether we did right or wrong in that respect, I do not know of any occasions when we ever took up with the various Latin American ambassadors. I speak with some feeling on that. </PARA>
<PARA> Two years ago there was the case of Anna Maria Mohaded who was in a penitentiary in Cordoba in Argentina. I took her sister to see the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs about this matter and, to the credit of the Government, we were told we would give her political asylum. Andrew Peacock said 'Talk to the ambassador', and I saw him. I did not go the Press. It was a reasonable approach. He said: 'Oh yes, you have made out a good case', and she was let out. She had 48 hours to get out of the country. After 46 hours, just as she had her bags packed, they took her off to gaol again. People can talk to me about those sorts of cat and mouse techniques practised by fascist countries or about Stalinism at its worst, but when we get down to the lowest common denominator, and if there is an infringement of liberty, is there any difference between those fascist countries in Latin America and some of those countries which are fairly much dominated by the Moscow line? Our Foreign Affairs people have double standards, and those are epitomised by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). He never takes on these people. Frankly, we could be militant with them because our trade with them does not mean anything. Senator McLaren made a point about trade in other areas, and I suppose that we have to pull our punches to some degree. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no question that our manpower policy is a very vital one. What hope is there for teenagers today in so many areas? Leaving aside the question of apprentices, the great danger is that in instrumentalities such as Telecom Australia or Australia Post fewer people are needed each year to fill semi-skilled grades because of new equipment which is brought in. I know that some people hope that by 1984-I am not thinking in terms of George Orwell's Nineteen Eighty-four-the number of school leavers will rapidly drop. But the working life is usually from age 20 to 60. </PARA>
<PARA> This brings me to a final tapering-off point. This Government has had a bit of a brawl with the Public Service unions about the right to retire at age 55. This Government has done a lot of exercises about our work force, but if it wants stability and wage agreements with the trade union movement there are many things it can learn from Europe, about which Senator Lajovic spoke. One of those things is that European workers have more stable health coverage schemes. Of course, I know that they are paid for by some form of tax. But if the workers of Australia knew that they were to pay 1.35 per cent-I just pluck that figure out of the air-of their annual incomes on health coverage, at least the process worker would not be paying the same amount as the production manager. The great rub today is that even if people get a wage rise of $10 or $15, every six months there is a dramatic rise in contributions to all the health funds. There is no reason why that component of the basic wage could not be stabilised, because people would pay that 1.35 per cent of their taxes every 12 months and would not have to pay a weekly slug. There would be a better understanding with the trade union movement. I hark back to what Senator Lajovic said: Right across Europe and Britain stabilised health coverage schemes are a vital factor in wages policy. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to the dispute between the Government and the Public Service about possible retirements at age 55. Nobody has said what the bill would be as a result of earlier eligibility for the age pension of people who retire at 59 so that the slack can be taken up by younger people. I do not know the figure, but the Government has never come up with a figure in that respect. Another matter I wish to raise is the whole question of the 35-hour week. The 40-hour week came in only 1947, and 1947 to 1980 is a long span of years. We all see documentaries and read publications about all the technological changes that have happened in the interim. We can see the work that is done today by a forklift truck in a wool store. Previously that work would have been done by a group of storemen and packers. Yet the Government keeps resisting. It talks about trade unions and Luddites. Members of the Government know in their hearts that such agreements will come about when people get over the fear of the 40-hour week. They will probably work a nine day fortnight. It will not be the end of the world. I concede the point about productivity, and nobody runs away from that question. But I like to believe that promises will be kept. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to go over the past, but in this place there used to be a very aggressive honourable senator from Tasmania-Senator Wright. It used to be an annual thing for him to abuse the Waterside Workers Federation. His main enemy was Charlie FitzGibbon. Senator Elstob, who used to work in the industry, would know that Charlie FitzGibbon was a very long-serving official of that union. When the waterside workers struck agreements in relation to apples and perishable cargoes in Tasmania, of course they got a reasonable agreement; the union kept its word. But Senator Wright could not see that. If an agreement was offered to unions which had officials of the calibre of Charlie FitzGibbon, they delivered the goods. If we are to get this across-the-board respect, the employers must show manifestly that technical changes mean benefit to people in the workforce. Of course, it will be a race against time as to whether the lower birthrate after 1984 will make all those situations null and void. I cite the tragic example of a woman over age 35 in the non-trades section of the printing union who operates a small guillotine. She cuts up small pages of books and stacks them. I am aware of instances of a boss looking upon such women, when they get into their 40s, as though they are stock. If she has a few varicose veins on the calves of her legs she does not get re-employed in a few months time. When one talks to some employers they will say that when they go to the Mount Madeline administrative college to learn how to be a good manager and personnel officer they get points for showing how such people can be culled out. That may be a cruel assessment. I am not harking back to Jack London and the Chicago stockyards, but it is a highly competitive field. If we are to improve industrial relations we have to get incentive from the top. </PARA>
<PARA> I feel, first of all, that with the money we spend for defence purposes-and I am not completely against that-we should emulate Sweden and have a modern computer system which will tell us accurately what our labour demands will be. Secondly, if we want industrial peace we must have a good hard look at health coverage being a vital component of our wage structure. Thirdly, we can urge some employers to do a little more in relation to apprentices generally. In relation to our immigration policy, I simply say this: A component of overseas tradesmen will be needed but they will have to be people who meet reasonable conditions and not people from the bogus training colleges that I mentioned. Finally, of course, we must not bring people here as chattels which is what guest workers in the fat cat EEC countries are. I leave for the Government that wisdom which is embodied in the amendment which has been moved by the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to the amendment to the Address-in-Reply moved on 25 February by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Button. Senator Button speaks so well that I enjoy his speeches. He has a dexterous use of the language and a wry sense of humour and, as I say, I always enjoy listening to him. But, unfortunately, in his speech on 25 February he saw fit to, shall I say, regurgitate a number of Labor dogmas and shibboleths which, I think, it is about time were put to rest. So, I must respond to his speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Button, in his speech, attacked a speech delivered by Senator Fred Chaney on behalf of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in Adelaide on 5 December of last year. The subject of that speech was 'Liberalism, The Philosophy that Shapes Government Policies and Actions'. Senator Button took that speech and, with his usual marvellous ability to speak, tried to pull it to pieces. His language was delightful but it was full of exaggeration, drew illogical conclusions and, in many respects, had all the hallmarks of the socialist left for whom, on that occasion, he appeared to be the reluctant spokesman. He said of the principle in the Prime Minister's speech:</PARA>
<PARA> I have a lot of agreement with the principle. I think it is a very sound one . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it is absolute hogwash to say that this Government was bent in any real way on carrying out that principle in its legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>That accusation is totally untrue. The Liberal Party will continue to develop its policies based on that philosophy of liberalism. I think Senator Button knows that but perhaps he has been forced to lay a trail of red herrings in order to obscure the real issues of the Governor-General's Speech and Senator Button's amendment, both of which involve economic policy rather than the shibboleths to which he was referring. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button questioned the claim of the Prime Minister that 'private enterprise is responsible for unprecedented improvements in human conditions over the last 30 years'. He said that that proposition would be difficult to sell in the People's Republic of China. I agree with Senator Button that there has been considerable progress in China. Much has been done and certainly many of the ills of that nation have been overcome by its present Government. One must admire the changes which it has managed to make. But what of the human tragedy and the waste of the Cultural Revolution? Let us look at the growth of Taiwan which is inhabited by an equally industrious people of the same race. In Taiwan, under the free enterprise system, income per head of population increased from $US1,421 in 1978 to $US2,100 in 1980-a rise of 48 per cent in two years. However, in Communist China it is expected that it will take another 20 years before the per capita income rises to half that amount-to $US1,000 per person per annum. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the communist system of the Soviet Union. It has failed to provide any comparable standards of living for either its own nationals or for people in those countries under its protection. Let us look at the standard of living in Poland. Apparently its standard of living is better than that of the Soviet Union but its citizens are still required to queue for basic foods such as bread and meat. Its economic policies have resulted in massive foreign debts that have required a moratorium-in other words, there is national bankruptcy. I refer to an article in the Canberra Times of Friday, 27 February of this year by Gay Davidson, not a supporter of this Government. Accompanying the article is a photograph showing Polish women queuing for food in Warsaw. Under the photograph, there are these words:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . in the opinion of one Western diplomat the Poles do not really appreciate that, in order to pull the country out of its economic difficulties, 'they must accept a reduction in their living standards, which are certainly higher in Warsaw than in Moscow'. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Button said of the Prime Minister's speech:</PARA>
<PARA> There are thinly veiled references to the grey socialist societies of the Northern Hemisphere. </PARA>
<PARA>Later, he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the social democratic societies of the Western world are completely ignored. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask: Is it appropriate in a speech or document dealing with liberal philosophy to argue the merits or otherwise of social systems? Of course it is not. Senator Button raised the red herring of Sweden. Senator Mulvihill also raised the question of Sweden in his speech tonight. It has become dogma for the socialists of Australia to tell us what a great country Sweden is, so I think it is time that we had a good look at Sweden. I will not talk about the matters Senator Button raised as an aside to Senator Puplick about the suicides and the problems in the social sphere in Sweden brought about by Sweden's policies; I will just look at the economic situation in Sweden because the socialists keep pouring Sweden down our throats. I think it is about time the rose tinted glasses were removed so that we can see what a disaster has been the Swedish socialist laboratory of the 1970s. </PARA>
<PARA> What is happening in Sweden at present? Income tax is running so high that further increases would raise no extra revenue, but just push the economy backwards. Government spending has been rising by 6 per cent to 7 per cent per annum in real terms for most of the decade, pushing the Government's share of the economy from 43 per cent in 1970 to 66 per cent in 1979. Sweden's Budget deficit for 1980-81 was equivalent to $A12 billion or 11 per cent of national output. Even in Mr Whitlam's most extravagant years Australia's deficit did not exceed more than about 5 per cent of national output. The low productivity performance of Swedish industry has been exacerbated by labour support schemes. Sweden's much vaunted industrial policies have put on to government subsidised jobs three workers for each two workers officially counted as unemployed, thus keeping unemployment figures at an apparently artificial figure of 2.1 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Sweden's doomed shipbuilding industry has been gobbled up by costs of $A80,000 per employee. Morale is sagging in the Swedish work force, which is plagued by absenteeism. Industry still has not digested the 21 per cent real wage rise of the 1975-76 period. The private sector as a whole has been suffering losses since 1973 after allowing for the inflationary effects, with shareholders getting a negative return for their investments since 1974. Between 1970 and 1978 public employment rose by 414,000 compared with an increase in totat employment of only 261,000, implying a net fall in private employment of 153,000 people. </PARA>
<PARA>I think it is about time that some publicity is given to these figures so that these people, these socialists, who keep throwing at us this 'great economy of Sweden' can have a look at the facts. What in fact has happened to the Swedish economy? It is simply that the socialist policy makers failed to realise and recognise the fact that there are no free lunches in the economy. They failed to recognise the implications of the energy crisis and by increased deficit budgeting back in the early 1970s they in fact slowed up the adjustment process and they sucked into the public sector the resources of the nation that could and should have been used in the adjustment of the private sector. The growth in the size of the Budget deficit, the associated acceleration in inflation, a large current account deficit and private capital outflow are now major problems. Economists both inside and outside Sweden agree that to retrieve the economic situation there should be a reduction in private and public consumption. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice that Senator Button has left the chamber because he does not want to hear the facts about Sweden. Simply put, the people of Sweden got used to handouts. They got used to industry being propped up by the Government and they got used to the nation living beyond its means. No government can go on spending more than its revenue. It is like entering into an overly expensive hire purchase agreement. I notice that Senator Button has returned to the Senate. He may have had a legitimate cause for moving out of the chamber; I do not doubt that. As I said, no government can go on spending more than its revenue. It is like entering into an overly expensive hire purchase agreement. Payments cannot be maintained and the goods are repossessed. The great socialist laboratory of Sweden is in the process of collapsing. Britain went down a similar path--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NG4">Senator LEWIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has fallen to pieces. Britain went down a similar path with a similar philosophy and that nation, once the world's greatest trading nation, is now reeling under the excesses of the social democratic system. Britain has an ailing motor industry losing about $A2m a day, and uncompetitive nationalised coal and steel industries that are neither economic nor competitive. Fortunately both countries now have governments that have been given the task, as we were in 1975, of trying to repair the damage done by the thoroughly discredited economic philosophy of social democracy. Yet Senator Button criticised the Prime Minister for not comparing Australia with Sweden. We are so far ahead that there is just no comparison. What better case could be put for the Liberal principle than the following quotation:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It rejects the notion that the relationship between the people and the State should be like that between customers and the supermarket-that because something is considered desirable it should be assumed automatically that the States should provide it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government rejects that notion for two reasons: First, the State is likely to be in many ways an inefficient and wasteful provider and because many services can be better provided in other ways-by voluntary action on the part of individuals joining together freely, and by mechanism of the market. </PARA>
<PARA> Second, and fundamentally, the more you ask of the State, the more power you must give it. If your demands on it are unlimited then you must logically give it unlimited power. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not understand why a person who believes in freedom, as Senator Button professes that he does, should also follow a philosophy which gives to the state more and more power. Surely he must realise that the more power given to the state the more freedom is taken away from the people. Many years ago President Woodrow Wilson said:</PARA>
<PARA> Liberty has never come from the Government . . . The history of liberty is the history of the limitation of governmental power, not the increase of it. </PARA>
<PARA>I am sure that Senator Button is well aware of the history of the free movements throughout the world being the limitation of governmental power. If he cares to look at the history of the Soviet Union he will see that with unlimited power, freedom is taken away from the people. I do not understand how philosophically he can reconcile his desire for freedom for the people with an increase in the power of the government because an increase in power must reduce the people's freedom. The Prime Minister's speech also stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It follows that as part of its liberalism, the Government is fundamentally committed to a private enterprise system . . . a system which, while recognising the necessity for restraint and a degree of government intervention, is premised on the belief that what produces the best economic and political results is an economy based on private property and income, in which normal economic activity consists of commercial transactions voluntarily entered into by individuals and groups. </PARA>
<PARA>By abolishing the handout syndrome and paying our way, Australia is again becoming prosperous. The December 1980 edition of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development publication Economic Outlook, in relation to Australia, said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the forecast is dominated by strong growth in business investment associated with the development of resource-based industries. This in turn is expected to lead to a strengthening of employment, personal incomes and private consumption. In total, GDP-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the gross domestic product-</PARA>
<PARA> Is expected to accelerate from 2 1/4 per cent in 1980 to around 4 per cent in 1981. The unemployment rate is expected to fall, unlike that of most other countries. </PARA>
<PARA>Compare that statement with the views of the OECD on Sweden. It said:</PARA>
<PARA> During the second half of 1980 private domestic demand and exports recovered from the effects of earlier strikes, but thereafter the prospects are for a substantial weakening of the economy. The inflation outlook is unfavourable, even though external cost pressures are forecast to ease substantially. Sweden's competitive position is likely to deteriorate. </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, Sweden has failed to control inflation. After all, how could it control inflation with a budgeted deficit of $12 billion? If you keep on spending more money than you have got, if you keep on spending more money than you collect in revenue you must go bankrupt. New York went bankrupt when it spent more money than it received in revenue. It kept spending money it did not have and it kept trying to borrow money to meet future bills. It ended up borrowing money to meet the interest charges on the money which it had borrowed. Unfortunately governments are able to print money. Therefore, their bankruptcy is not so obvious. But if governments go on budgeting for deficits of the like of $12 billion inevitably they will go bankrupt. That is the sort of policy that these people in the Opposition promote to us all of the time. All that the Leader of the Opposition in the other House, Mr Hayden, could say about the last Budget Speech was: 'Well, the Government's policy was not too bad, but if I had been the Prime Minister I would have increased the budgeted deficit'. As I have said, all that does is to lead to inflation, unemployment and the destruction of the economy. </PARA>
<PARA> In Australia the consumer price index increased by only 2.1 per cent for December 1980 and by 9.3 per cent for the year-a significant achievement. There was an increase of 169,600 in the number of employed people over the 12 months to December 1980 and employment growth remained strong. Both retail sales and new passenger vehicle registrations showed strong growth in the December 1980 quarter; private dwelling approvals rose further and the combination of a steady current account deficit and stronger private capital inflow resulted in an overall balance of payments surplus of $288m in January this year. These figures speak for themselves. They demonstrate the wisdom of not adopting stop-gap solutions that have been suggested by the Australian Labor Party which only add to inflationary pressures. Certainly I do not deny that unemployment remains Australia's greatest single social problem but it will not be overcome by deficit budgeting; on the contrary that will increase it. All the evidence overseas points to the soundness of the Government's present policies developed from Liberal philosophy. The Liberal philosophy is summarised by the Prime Minister in that speech which was so criticised by Senator Button. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is concerned to maximise the degree to which people have control over their own lives and their own resources, to ensure that it is their choices which are decisive, not those of politicians, of bureaucrats or union officials or corporations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is concerned to limit the role and reduce the power of the state, and as part of that to restrain taxes and to contain public expenditure. The state must remain the servant, not the master, of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA>One could only wish that the Opposition would look at some of the facts instead of regurgitating knee-jerk dogmas. For example, Senator Button criticised my colleague Senator Jessop for his admiration of the United States. That is a typical knee-jerk reaction if ever I have heard one. The simple truth is that the free enterprise system of the United States has produced the highest material levels of living ever known in any nation of the world and it keeps doubling those levels every 40 years. That is a fact which cannot be denied. I ask honourable senators to compare that with the communist systems of the world and the social democratic systems of the world and to acknowledge that there is nothing to compare with the United States and its free enterprise system. </PARA>
<PARA> I am glad that my other Victorian colleague in the Opposition, Senator Evans, has been so involved with his party in trying to discover a new philosophy for the Australian Labor Party because clearly the principles of socialism have, in fact, defeated themselves. I commend to Senator Button and to Senator Evans the principles of liberalism so ably expounded by the Prime Minister. I oppose the amendment moved by Senator Button and support the motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I wish to make a personal explanation as I claim to have been misrepresented. I was misrepresented about 400 times by Senator Lewis in the course of his speech but there is a particular misrepresentation to which I wish to refer. Senator Lewis, early in his speech, having insufficient capacity to read Hansard lucidly apparently, said that I had, in the course of a speech made last week, said that I approved the principle of Mr Fraser' speech. What I in fact said was that I approved, in that speech, the enunciation of what was described as the principle of conservatism. That is a very different thing from saying that I approved the principle of the speech. I approved the principle of conservatism and I then went on to point our how the principle of conservatism, described as it was as a principle of order and continuity, had at no time been applied by this Fraser Government. I single that out as the most vivid misrepresentation in Senator Lewis's speech.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to address myself to the Address-in-Reply-I have not spoken to it before-and to support the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate (Senator Button). In my comments as usual I will stress those aspects of the Governor-General's speech which had particular reference to the Northern Territory. Speaking of the Government's foreign policy, the Governor-General said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The foreign policy priorities of my Government are clear. It is very conscious of the need for a strong and united Western stance towards the Soviet Union and to this end it will work to maintain its already strong ties with its traditional allies, and in particular with the United States. It should be clearly understood that it will do so out of an appreciation of Australia's needs and interests and for no other reason. </PARA>
<PARA>The maintenance of this strong tie has particular relevance to the Northern Territory. Firstly, it means that we will allow Pine Gap-that is the Joint Defence Space Research Facility-to continue to operate. That is the first obvious corollary to the maintenance of these strong ties. We will allow it to continue even though we know that the Joint Defence Space Research Facility is controlled by the Central Intelligence Agency. This is despite the rather surprised stance taken by Senator Carrick recently. It is common knowledge that this is so and it appears in published documents. It also means that we will support and allow Pine Gap to continue although the Government is not aware of its real purpose. I quote from a book written by Ball. At page 22 it states:</PARA>
<PARA> More directly, three of Australia's last four Prime Ministers-the only ones to address the issue-have specifically stated that, at the least, they were ignorant of major aspects of the operations of the satellite ground stations in central Australia. In December 1978, John Gorton stated: 'I don't even know what Pine Gap is all about. I didn't then (1969). I could have asked but it didn't arise. I didn't ask about it'. In May 1977, William McMahon stated that although he thought he knew the true functions of Pine Gap and Nurrungar at the time he was Prime Minister, he was not now so sure: 'I have increasing doubts that the Australian Government knows the entire truth'. And Whitlam has revealed on a number of occasions that there were several critical aspects relating to Pine Gap and Nurrungar that he was never told about. </PARA>
<PARA>We will allow Pine Gap to continue operating and will support it although we know that private information gathered by it is given to the United States commercial organisations. Ball continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Whitlam told parliament on 4 May 1977 that the Australian government had been unaware-</PARA>
<PARA>I quote from Hansard:</PARA>
<PARA>that the information obtained by these facilities would be shared with, or made available to, private corporations (under CIA contract) such as TRW Systems Incorporated. Knowledge of that company's access to this information has emerged quite fortuitously because one of its employees has been convicted of espionage. What other contractors to the CIA, who may or may not employ Russian spies, are privileged to receive/analyse and transmit data from facilities on Australian soil?</PARA>
<PARA>That is the end of the quote taken from Hansard. Ball continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Whitlam had not even been told that the American officer-in-charge of Pine Gap, Richard Stallings, was an employee of the CIA, or that Pine Gap was in fact a CIA operation. Certainly the United States has not kept Australia informed about all activities at these and some of the other installations. </PARA>
<PARA>We are going to allow Pine Gap to continue even though the activities there make it a prime nuclear target in the event of any conflict between the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. This maintenance of strong ties also means that we will be offering Darwin as a stop-over base for B52s. There has been a good deal of opposition to the establishment of a stop-over base for B52s. Again, it will make Darwin a prime target. That means that the two major centres of the Northern Territory, Alice Springs and Darwin, will be prime targets. </PARA>
<PARA> The Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Carrick) this morning addressed himself to comments made by the Soviet Ambassador. Let us recall that the Soviet Ambassador warned that Australia could become a nuclear target because of its close friendship with the United States. Dr Soudarikov said that the decision to upgrade United States bases and to allow B52s to pass through Australia could make Australia a target in any nuclear war. I have further objections to the basing of the B52s there. I will run through these fairly quickly. The first is the possibility of an accident if nuclear weapons are carried. The other objection is that it ties us into American policy and removes our independence. Let us look at each of those in turn. Let us firstly consider the prime target aspect. If Darwin becomes a fuelling place for B52s then Darwin would obviously be knocked out in any conflict between the United States and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the scenario for the possible use of B52s. They are based in Guam. They would leave from there, go to Diego Garcia and pick up their warheads and then go on to Darwin to refuel. Then, because the line is direct, they would move to the Middle East. That is the scenario if there is a conflict. It is quite clear that one does not have to know a great deal about foreign policy to see that that will be the area of conflict should there be conflict between the two major powers in the next few years. Let me remind honourable senators of what Mr Bowen said in the other place. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Far from being delighted all Australians should be alarmed that the Prime Minister intends to allow Americans to use Australia for a base for their B52 bombers. B52s carry nuclear weapons and if B52s are based in Australia these bases will be certain nuclear targets. This will be the first time that nuclear weapons will be stationed on Australian soil. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposals . . . pose the same sort of risk to Australia's capacity for independent action and control over its foreign policy as the earlier request this year by the United States that Australia should provide troops for a rapid deployment force intended to operate in the Middle East oil fields. </PARA>
<PARA>Some Government members who have spoken on this matter outside the chamber and made public statements have said that everything will be okay as long as the B52s are not carrying nuclear warheads; of course we will know this because the United States will tell us. This is naive in the extreme. Firstly, of course, the B52s will carry nuclear warheads. They are designed to carry them. They are too expensive to use as surveillance aircraft alone. Let us be quite honest: We cannot trust the United States to tell us what it will do. It did not tell Whitlam in 1973 when all the bases in Australia were put on red alert. It made no comment to the Prime Minister of Australia that all the American bases in Australia had been put on their final alert. The United States deluded successive Australian governments over Pine Gap, North West Cape and other bases in Australia. I have already made some reference to this matter which was mentioned in Ball, and there is ample evidence elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point that concerns me particularly relates to the sort of people who are now in the White House and who are advising people in the White House. I do not believe we can rely on those people to exercise a good deal of caution. Honourable senators will remember that Haig, when he was in front of a Senate committee-this is the man who is now Secretary of State-said to the Senate committee that it was not immoral to have bombed Cambodia for five years without telling the legislature. He felt that there was no necessity for him, as a General, to tell the legislature that for five years America had been bombing Cambodia. If he will not tell his own legislature what he is doing he is certainly not likely to tell us. This man is now Secretary of State to Ronald Reagan. This same man blew his cool in front of a Senate committee because the questions became a bit hot. I challenge whether he or the President of the United States at present would not plunge us by this sort of action into a conflict in which we should not be involved. </PARA>
<PARA> The second area I wanted to mention was the possibility of accident. We know that nuclear accidents are referred to as broken arrows. Although the details of any of these incidents or accidents are obscured we have some detail-not a great deal because the United States policy is that it will neither confirm nor deny accidents or broken arrows. Let me give a few examples. Firstly, in January 1961 a B52 dropped a 24-megaton bomb in North Carolina. When this 24-megaton bomb was found, five of the six safety catches had been triggered off. There was one left. Had that safety catch been triggered off the whole city of Goldsboro would have been wiped out. Five of the six safety catches had gone and it was purely by chance that the last one had not been activated. In January 1966 a B52 and a refuelling tanker collided in Spain. The B52 crashed and four bombs separated. The first one landed inactive in a river bed. The second and third released radioactive material in a populated area. The fourth was retrieved from the sea after an intensive search lasting for three months. </PARA>
<PARA> In January 1968 a B52 crashed in Greenland and all the four bombs on board were lost under the ice. To the best of our knowledge, they are still there. In September 1980 a B52 caught fire. This matter has already been mentioned in this place. The bombs did not detonate, but there was a good deal of concern that they would. Nobody knew whether the bombs would actually detonate with the heat of a fire of the character which would be produced when a B52 crashed. We can do without these sorts of incidents. I have a deal more to say, but as it is 10.15 p.m. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA>Bounty (Polyester-Cotton Yarn) Amendment Bill 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the Government's decision to extend the operation of the Bounty (Polyester-Cotton Yarn) Act 1978 until 31 December 1981. The existing Act expires on 31 August 1981. The Bounty (Polyester-Cotton Yarn) Act 1978 provides assistance to the manufacture in Australia of polyester-cotton yarn by means of a bounty scheme. This scheme provides for the payment to eligible manufacturers of a bounty of $1.15 per kilogram on the bountiable yarn which during the period to which the Act applies, is spun at registered premises for use in the knitting or weaving of textiles in Australia. There is a current annual limit of $600,000 on the amount available for payment of bounty. </PARA>
<PARA> The extension of the operation of this scheme is being made as an interim measure pending commencement on 1 January 1982 of new bounty arrangements for polyester cotton yarns. The new arrangements form part of the Government's proposed program of assistance for the textiles, clothing and footwear industries beyond 1981. From 1 January 1982 the bounty rate for polyester-cotton yarns will be calculated as 52 per cent of factory cost value added. The amount available for payment of bounty during the extended period of the current scheme will be $200,000. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA>Bounty (Non-Adjustable Wrenches) Bill 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the Government's decision to provide temporary assistance to the industry in Australia producing non-adjustable wrenches. This assistance arrangement follows the Government's consideration of the advice and recommendations by the Temporary Assistance Authority contained in its report No. 50 of 14 August 1980 entitled: 'Non-Adjustable Spanners'. The Government has accepted the Temporary Assistance Authority's recommendation that temporary assistance, in the form of a production bounty, be accorded to this industry in Australia. The Bill provides for the bounty to be payable at the rate of 11c on each bountiable implement having a local content exceeding 50 per cent. This scheme is to operate for a period of one year and bounty payments during that period are limited to a maximum of $620,000. </PARA>
<PARA> During its inquiry the Temporary Assistance Authority found that the local industry's overall activity has declined over the past four or five years while imports of competing products had increased. In the past three years the total domestic market share held by the major Australian manufacturer Siddons Industries Ltd, has declined from 25 per cent to 16 per cent. However in this same period the local market for the tools increased from 16.5 million to 20 million units and imports also increased from 12.5 million to 16 million units. In recommending the bounty assistance for this industry the Temporary Assistance Authority was concerned to ensure that the assistance provided will have an immediate effect but will only affect those areas of the market supplied by the local industry. The Government expects that the assistance as proposed by this Bill will restore previous activity levels and thus enable the local industry to more adequately compete against the imported products. An assessment of the need for the continuation of the bounty assistance beyond 12 months will be undertaken by the Industries Assistance Commission as part of its report on cutlery, industrial knives and hand tools due to be submitted to the Government by 30 June 1981. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA>Coal Excise Amendment Bill 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Coal Excise Act 1949. The proposed amendment will extend to 28 days the period within which entries of home consumption may be made for coal removed from a coal mine during a period approved by a collector of customs. The Coal Excise Act 1949 contains the machinery provisions to enforce the collection of excise duties imposed on coal for the purposes of financing long service leave benefits granted to certain employees in the coal mining industry and for the funding of the Coal Research Trust Account. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 24 (2) of this Act permits coal to be removed from a coal mine during a period, usually a calendar month, approved by a collector of customs without entry if a deposit of money or a guarantee in respect of the duty on the coal has been given by the coal producer. However, section 24 (4) requires that an entry in respect of coal removed from a coal mine during the approved period shall be made not later than seven working days after the expiration of that period. The Government has decided to extend this period to 28 days as seven days has proven to be unnecessarily restrictive. This is particularly so in cases where coal producers do not possess their own weighing facilities and need to obtain production figures from accumulated weighbridge certificates issued by State railway authorities. Unavoidable delays also occur when centralised payments of duty are made by parent companies which have widespread subsidiary collieries. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The main purpose of this Bill is to amend the Currency Act 1965 to empower the Treasurer to issue a $10 silver coin. On 2 May 1980, the then Acting Treasurer announced that the Government had decided to issue three coins with special designs to commemorate the occasion of the XII Commonwealth Games to be held in Brisbane in 1982. He further stated that the 1982 commemorative coins would be a $200 face value 'collector' gold coin, a 50 cent cupro-nickel coin, and, subject to the passage of the necessary authorising legislation, a $10 cupro-nickel coin. </PARA>
<PARA> It has now been decided that the proposed $10 Commonwealth Games coin be struck in 92.5 per cent silver, that is, sterling silver. The Commonwealth Games Foundation had originally proposed that the $10 coin be in silver. At the time the very high and volatile price of silver suggested that a $10 silver coin would not be practicable and it was then proposed that the coin be in cupro-nickel. Since the announcement last May, the extreme speculative influences on the price of silver have been removed. In addition, the practice has been established with the $200 collector gold coin of setting the price of a collector coin well above its face value. It is intended that this practice will be followed in the case of the silver coin. It is envisaged that the $10 silver coin will have a diameter of about 34 millimetres-that is, slightly larger than the 50 cent coin-and that it will weigh about 20 grams. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Bill is enacted in the current sittings of Parliament, it is expected that the Royal Australian Mint will commence minting the $10 Commonwealth Games coin in the second half of this year. The special designs for the reverse sides of the Commonwealth Games coins have not yet been selected. Further details of these coins, including arrangements for their release, will be announced at a later date. In view of the ever-present legislative burden on Parliament, the opportunity is also being taken to provide in this Bill for greater flexibility in the types of coins that can be issued in the future without the need for additional legislation. Accordingly, the Bill provides for the issue of new denominations of coins and their standard compositions to be prescribed by regulation and will authorise the Treasurer of the day to cause any such coins to be made and issued. These amendments do not, of course, affect the Parliament's power to veto any such regulations that may be brought forward. </PARA>
<PARA> I now outline the main provisions of the Bill. Clauses 3 and 4 of the Bill will amend sections 13 and 14 of the Currency Act to provide for the composition of existing coins to be varied by regulation and for the denominations and composition of new coins to be prescribed by regulation. At present the denominations and standard compositions of coins are specified in the Act. These amendments will avoid the need to amend the Act each time a new denomination of coin is to be introduced or the composition of an existing coin is to be varied. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 5 will amend section 14A of the Act to allow the issue price of the proposed $10 coin, that is to be issued in the first instance as a silver commemorative coin for the 1982 Commonwealth Games to be determined by the Treasurer in the same way as he is at present authorised to determine the issue price for gold coins. Because of the potential volatility in the price of silver and production and marketing factors it is not practicable to set in advance of the legislation the price at which the $10 coin is to be issued. For similar reasons, this amendment will also empower the Treasurer to determine the issue price of any new coins of a denomination exceeding $10 that may be prescribed. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 16 of the present Act provides that the tender of coins up to certain values is a legal tender in discharge of a debt. Clause 6 will amend that section to place a limit of $100 on the legal tendering of coins of the proposed denomination of $10 and, in the case of any new coin of a denomination exceeding 50c but under $10, a limit of 10 times the face value of the coin. Any new coin of a denomination exceeding $10 will be a legal tender for payment of any amount. This clause complements the proposed amendment of section 14 by providing for appropriate legal tender values to be accorded coins of any new denomination that may be prescribed by regulation without the need for a further amendment of the Act. Clause 7 will amend the schedule to the principal Act to provide for the introduction of the $10 coin and to specify its standard composition as 92.5 per cent silver and 7.5 per cent other metal. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Dairying Research Act 1972 in recognition of changing circumstances in the dairy industry and to conform with current practice in other similar rural research legislation. The Dairying Research Act established the Dairying Research Trust Account and the Dairying Research Committee. The Research Account receives income from the industry research levy, Commonwealth Government matching contributions and other minor sources. Expenditure on research is approved by the Minister on the recommendation of the Research Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Three of the amendments proposed in the Bill have been sought by the Dairying Research Committee and the Australian Dairy Farmers Federation. These changes are expressed in clauses 5 and 6 of the Bill. The Dairying Research Committee is frequently referred to by name in international journals and research papers. Renaming it as the Australian Dairy Research Committee will clearly establish its national identity. </PARA>
<PARA> At present three members of the Research Committee represent producers of milk for manufacturing purposes and one member represents producers for the liquid milk market. In view of changed circumstances in the industry this distinction is no longer appropriate and the Bill provides for the four producer members to represent all dairy farmers. To allow casual vacancies on the Research Committee to be filled for the remainder of the term of the member being replaced, the mandatory three year term will be changed to a period not exceeding three years. Further consequential amendments are necessary to accommodate these changes. Clause 12 provides for transitional arrangements in respect of the renamed Research Committee and its members and their deputies. Clause 11 will amend the Dairying Industry Research and Promotion Levy Act 1972 to reflect the change in the Research Committee's name. </PARA>
<PARA> Other amendments have been drafted to bring the Dairying Research Act into conformity with recent rural research legislation and government policy. Clause 3 will have the effect of bringing the wording of the provisions for payments into the Research Account into line with similar recent legislation. The original intent of the Act is not changed. </PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with established practice clause 7 amends the arrangements for removal and resignation of Committee members and deputies, while clause 9 provides for the Remuneration Tribunal to determine the remuneration of members and deputies. Clause 10 will enable the Minister to approve fees, et cetera, payable to persons appointed to advise the Committee. Finally clause 8 of the Bill introduces the requirement that Research Committee members and their deputies shall disclose direct or indirect pecuniary interests.

<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to terminate the operation of the present Dried Vine Fruits Stabilisation Scheme.

<PARA> Growers contributed approximately $1.2m to the fund in respect of the 1978 season, and it has been assessed that further significant payments would also be the ultimate result of the 1979 and 1980 seasons accounting if the scheme were permitted to run its full course. This would be of no advantage to the industry, and would in fact deny growers the use of substantial moneys, which under the legislation would have to be collected from them in due course for these two seasons, as grower contributions to the fund. Growers would then have to wait for the winding up of the fund at the end of the stabilisation term before these moneys would be refunded to them. Such refunds could probably not be made before well into 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has therefore accepted a request from the industry that legislation be introduced to terminate the scheme and to authorise refund to the contributing growers of the moneys presently in the sultanas stabilisation fund. The moneys contributed by growers in respect of 1978 season have been invested, the last maturity date of such investments being 1 October 1981. After consultation with the growers' organisation-The Australian Dried Fruits Association-the Government has made provision in the Bill for the investments to continue until their maturity. In this way a considerable amount of interest will be earned, and no risk will be incurred of loss of capital value through early redemption. After all investments have matured, all moneys standing to the credit of the fund are to be distributed among growers in proportion to each grower's share of the total contributed by growers. A formula is set out in the Bill for the purpose of establishing the amount payable to each grower. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also makes provision to enable the payments to growers to be made through the system already established for the making of stabilisation payments. It is expected that payments to growers will be completed about the end of 1981. In anticipation of inquiry by honourable senators as to possible on-going price support arrangements for this industry, I point out that discussions are proceeding with the industry designed to conclude mutually acceptable provisions for an underwriting scheme commencing with the 1982 season. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA>Apple and Pear Export Underwriting Bill 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>This Bill provides for the underwriting of returns from all export market sales of apples and pears over the five seasons 1981 to 1985. The Bill, together with the associated Apple and Pear Stabilisation Amendment Bill 1981 and the Australian Apple and Pear Corporation Amendment Bill 1981 implement the Government's decision to vary the market support arrangements for export apples and pears following the inquiry last year by the Industries Assistance Commission into the assistance needs of the apple and pear industry beyond 1980. The Government accepted the IAC's recommendation that continuing price support assistance for apple and pear exports should in future be related to actual price experience on export markets, but that the existing cost of production based price support under the stabilisation scheme for apple exports be phased out gradually to avoid undue disruption in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will be aware that the existing Apple and Pear Stabilisation Scheme was introduced in 1971. The then Minister for Primary Industry's second reading speech indicated that the intention of the stabilisation scheme was to give a measure of stability to the industry to assist it to examine and take steps to meet the adjustment problems then confronting it. In the ten years that the scheme has operated, payments to growers have totalled $22.6m of which the Commonwealth contributed $22.3m. Nearly all the assistance has been paid in respect of apples. It has always been acknowledged that the stabilisation scheme would not provide solutions to all the industry's problems. Honourable senators will also be aware that the industry had the advantage of the Fruitgrowing Reconstruction Scheme which operated from 1973 to 1978. </PARA>
<PARA> During the 1970s the industry has gone a long way to meeting its adjustment needs. Total Australian apple and pear production had declined by about 30 and 40 per cent respectively; exports now account for some 15 per cent of production instead of about 30 per cent; a bigger share of the exports go to the more profitable 'forward sale' markets in South West Asia and the Middle East; and there is less dependence on the relatively unprofitable 'at risk' markets in Europe. Further adjustment is expected to take place in the next few years. However, with the development of alternative export outlets outside Europe, continued growth in domestic demand and the development of processing outlets, future adjustment is unlikely to be as great or of the same nature as the adjustment of the past ten years. </PARA>
<PARA> Looking back, I can confidently state that the stabilisation scheme has met its objective of providing a measure of 'breathing space' to growers facing difficult adjustment problems. However, as observed by the IAC, the stabilisation scheme has also had the effect of distorting market signals for export fruit and continuation of the scheme on an unchanged basis could now prejudice the successful completion of the necessary adjustment process. The changes which the Government will be introducing to the existing stabilisation scheme will be dealt with in more detail in my second reading speech on the associated Apple and Pear Stabilisation Amendment Bill 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one further aspect of the package of assistance arrangements which will apply to the apple and pear industry to which I should refer. In addition to the underwriting arrangements for apples and pears and continuance of the stabilisation scheme for apples on a phasing-out basis for four years to 1984, the Commonwealth is to continue to provide supplementary assistance on a dollar for dollar basis with participating States over that 4-year period. The Commonwealth commitment is for a maximum of $3m to be provided over this period in respect of apples and $800,000 for pears. The use of the assistance is to be flexible and available to fund orchard reconstruction and related adjustment measures for growers particularly affected by the changed market support arrangements for 'at risk' exports. It may also be used to provide additional 'at risk' export price support assistance for apples but not for pears. The Government has placed a ceiling of $750,000 of Commonwealth funds and a maximum pay-out per box of $2.20 that may be used to supplement export price support for apples in 1981, these maxima to be reduced by one-quarter in each of the three succeeding years. The Commonwealth is currently discussing with the States proposals on the form and the amount of supplementary assistance to be provided. </PARA>
<PARA> I should now like to deal briefly with the specific provisions of the Export Underwriting Bill. For each of the 1981 to 1985 export seasons, separate guaranteed minimum return levels will be established by this Bill for apple exports and for pear exports. The guaranteed minimum returns will be determined by calculating 95 per cent of the weighted average per box free on board return for all apple exports, and for all pear exports, over the immediately preceding four export seasons. At the close of each export season, the Bill provides for the determination of the average per box f.o.b. returns falls below the relevant guaranteed minimum return, then this Bill provides that an underwriting payment is made, such payment being the difference between the guaranteed minimum return and the relevant average per box f.o.b. return. Underwriting payments shall be made, in the case of fruit exported 'at risk', to the owner of the fruit at the time of export, and in the case of fruit sold before export, to the owners of the fruit prior to that sale. Unlike the Stabilisation legislation this Bill does not provide for payments into the scheme by growers; the underwriting arrangements are to be financed solely by the Commonwealth. As with the Stabilisation scheme, assistance payments under the underwriting scheme will be made through the Australian Apple and Pear Corporation. Mr President, the package of market support measures decided upon by the Government will provide a good basis on which the industry can develop to meet the changing marketing circumstances confronting it. As part of that package I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA>Apple and Pear Stabilization Amendment Bill 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>This Bill introduces amendments to the Apple and Pear Stabilization Act 1971 as part of the package of market support measures for the industry that I have just outlined in my speech on the Apple and Pear Export Underwriting Bill 1981. The principal stabilisation Act is extended by this Bill to cover apple exports for the four export seasons 1981 to 1984. The stabilisation scheme for pears is not to be extended. Stabilisation assistance for apples will continue to apply only to exports shipped at some degree of risk to markets in Europe, including the United Kingdom. The maximum rate of stabilisation assistance for apples for the 1981 export season is to be $2.20 per box, the same as applied in both the 1979 and 1980 export seasons. In 1982 the maximum is to be reduced to $1.65 per box, in 1983 $1.10 and in 1984 55c. This maximum rate is to be payable on a maximum of 1.5 million boxes of apples in each session. In the event that more than 1.5 million boxes of apples are exported 'at risk' to Europe in any year then the maximum per box payout is to be reduced proportionately. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill provides that in the event that both a stabilisation payment and an underwriting payment become payable then the stabilisation payment is reduced by the amount of the underwriting payment. The principal stabilisation Act is further amended to terminate the grower 'pay-in' provisions and to allow for winding up the varietal trust funds. The Bill also provides for the updating of the levels of penalties provided under the Act so as to bring them into line with those provided under the Apple and Pear Export Underwriting Bill 1981. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA>Australian Apple and Pear Corporation Amendment Bill 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>This Bill introduces an amendment to the Australian Apple and Pear Corporation Act 1973 consequential to the Apple and Pear Export Underwriting Bill 1981 to allow the Corporation to incur expenses in operating the underwriting arrangements. The opportunity is also being taken to bring the taxation liability of the Australian Apple and Pear Corporation into line with that of other statutory commodity authorities in the primary industry area, and to make a few technical amendments to the Corporation Act. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Mr Brown,</PARA>
<PARA> I have been contacted by residents of Acacia Ridge in relation to the proposed closure of the post office agency in Oxley Street. The residents have been informed that the agency is to be closed in March. </PARA>
<PARA> I am informed that the Acacia Ridge North Post Office is being shifted just across the street from its present site in the Elizabeth Street Shopping Centre. Local residents believe that the shifting of this post office will bring it within a two kilometre radius of the agency in Oxley Street and this fact will be used to justify its closure. However, the new position of the Acacia Ridge North Post Office in no way lessens the inconvenience which will be suffered by those residents who currently use the agency. I am informed that many of these people are pensioners and it will cause them great difficulty to travel to the Post Office in Elizabeth Street. </PARA>
<PARA> I am enclosing photocopies of some petitions from Acacia Ridge residents who are opposed to the closure of the agency. The original petitions are available for your inspection if you wish to see them. The number of signatories indicates the strength of feeling about this issue. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Senator Colston</PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge your representations of 17 February together with a petition on behalf of the residents of Acacia Ridge concerning the proposed closure of the Acacia Ridge North Non Official Post Office in Oxley Street. </PARA>
<PARA> A new building is being constructed at a cost in excess of $85,000 at the corner of Amhurst and Mitchell Streets, Acacia Ridge, and the Official Post Office will be relocated there on 10 April 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the policy of Australia Post not to provide Post Offices, except in special circumstances, within a distance of two kilometres from another. As the Acacia Ridge North Post Office is situated less than 1.3 km radial distance from the Acacia Ridge Official Office and less than 1.7 km radial distance from the Rocklea Official Office, it was decided to close the Acacia Ridge North Post Office in conjunction with the opening of the new office. Indeed, the closing of the nearby Non Official Post Office formed part of the justification for spending the capital on a new Post Office building. </PARA>
<PARA> However, in view of your representations the earlier decision is being reviewed and I will write to you again as soon as possible. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Senator Colston</PARA>
<PARA> I refer again to your representations of 17 February together with a petition on behalf of the residents of Acacia Ridge concerning the proposed closure of the Acacia Ridge North Non Official Post Office in Oxley Street. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the terms of the Postal Services Act 1975, Australia Post is required to price its services so as to recover all of its operating costs and at least half of its capital expenditure from revenue. Against this background, Australia Post is continually reviewing its services and methods of operation to ensure that the facilities provided are adequate to meet the reasonable needs of the community and that the resources available are used to the best advantage. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure you will realise that historically many post offices were established to cater for needs which no longer exist. Social security pensions, repatriation pensions and defence allotments were once paid in cash at post offices but now these are paid by cheque or into a bank account. Broadcast and television licences are no longer issued. In addition, the community has alternatives to many services previously provided only at a post office. For instance, the number of telephone subscribers is continually increasing and providing more people with an alternative to letters and telegrams. Additionally, private savings bank agencies operate in many areas where previously the post office agency was the only such facility. Cheque accounts are now used by a large proportion of the community as an alternative to money orders, parcel services are provided by other operators and many businessmen sell stamps under licence. </PARA>
<PARA> Community shopping habits have changed too. As motor car ownership has become more widespread, there has been a tendency to by-pass the local store for the greater range and cheaper prices of major shopping centres and people usually do their postal business where they shop. </PARA>
<PARA> The level of postal business transacted at the Acacia Ridge North Post Office is significantly below that which would justify the retention of a post office in an urban area and comprises less than 30 percent of the total workload. The remainder is made up of Commonwealth Savings Bank transactions. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia Post considers that when the Acacia Ridge North Non Official Post Office is withdrawn, residents and business houses in the area will still have reasonable access to postal facilities. Arrangements will be made for a stamp vendor's licence to be issued to the proprietor of a business in the area and the street posting box will be retained outside the existing post office. Also, the Commonwealth Bank has been approached regarding the provision of a Private Savings Bank Agency in the Acacia Ridge North area. </PARA>
<PARA> As promised, I have reviewed the earlier decision but having regard to all the circumstances it is proposed to proceed with the closure of the Acacia Ridge North Post Office on 10 April 1981. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall not keep the Senate long. I would like to give a couple of matters an airing in the chamber this evening. The first one concerns the situation in the South American country of Uruguay as it relates to political prisoners. I raised this matter some time late last year in this chamber and at that stage referred to a description by a United States congressional committee of Uruguay wherein that committee described it as being the torture chamber of South America. Before I spoke on this matter previously I wrote to the country's representative here in Canberra in civil tones asking questions and requesting certain information. I received no reply. I had occasion later on last year to write to the same gentleman again. Again I have not even received any reply or any recognition that I have even written to him. I do not quite know what he is afraid of, or whether he is afraid of something, but it is a little strange when representatives of other countries in our country are not prepared to write a letter in answer to a request for information made in a very civil manner. I make that point. The situation in Uruguay apparently has not improved despite the attempts that have been made by this and other governments and groups throughout the world. On 14 February the Committee of Solidarity with the Uruguayan People based in Melbourne wrote to the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon. A. A. Street. The letter states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Dear Minister,</PARA>
<PARA> There has been widespread condemnation of the regime in Uruguay and its abuse of human rights. This criticism has been world-wide. We enclose a selection of documents giving background information to the debate in Australia relative to this. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed the Australian Government has also expressed its concern. Unfortunately the situation has not improved and we feel that the Australian Government has not done enough to promote the respect of human rights in Uruguay. We suggest that the following concrete actions, if taken at the Human Rights Commission presently being held in Geneva would be effective in reducing the abuse of human rights in Uruguay. </PARA>
<PARA> (1) That the Commision initiate an in-depth study of the situation in Uruguay and that a Special Rapporteur be appointed to document this. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) That the secret, confidential nature of the treatment of the Uruguayan case be lifted, and that the matter be debated in public (as was done last year for the cases of Bolivia and Guatemala). </PARA>
<PARA>We ask you to urgently contact the Australian Delegation to the Human Rights Committee to request that these propositions be supported by the Australian Delegation. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely,</PARA>
<PARA>Tomas Weisz Per CO.S.P.U.</PARA>
<PARA>I had hoped this week to raise this matter in Question Time but unfortunately, Mr Deputy President, I was unable to get the call. I wonder whether the Minister has taken the action that has been requested and whether or not he has replied to that group of people in Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter I wish to raise again has come to my attention in a letter addressed to me by the same people-the Committee of Solidarity with the Uruguayan People. The letter is undated but I received it about a week ago. That letter states in part:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator Primmer,</PARA>
<PARA> We write to you to express our concern at the imprisonment in Argentina of Mr Alberto Marinelli during November of last year. Alberto is an Australian citizen, and up until October 1979, when he left for a trip to Argentina, he had been a resident of this country for five years. The information we have about the circumstances leading to his arrest are at present rather sketchy. We do know that he was arrested by the 8th Mountain Infantry Brigade in Las Quevas, Mendoza, on November 26th, 1980. The law under which he was detained was article 21460, the intent of which is to 'protect the state'. Under this vague and imprecise concept broad powers can be evoked. It is a law reserved almost exclusively for the detaining of 'political prisoners'. </PARA>
<PARA>I will skip the second paragraph which has no great bearing on the story. The third paragraph reads:</PARA>
<PARA> In each case such as Alberto's there is a sense of desperation, for he is one among thousands of political prisoners in Latin America. However, he is one of whom we know personally, and one who we believe can be assisted by concerned members of the Australian community. The fact that all political prisoners in Latin America are subjected to some form of torture adds to the urgency of our appeal. </PARA>
<PARA> In line with our concern about the rights of individuals, political, social, and economic, we are in the process of sending an Australian lawyer to Uruguay and Argentina. Peter McMullin is a member of the International Committee of Jurists, and he will accompany the President and two other members of that organisation to the two countries we have mentioned. During the time that Peter is in Argentina we hope that he will be able to see Alberto. </PARA>
<PARA>As I read the recent history of political action in Argentina it seems that the Argentinian Government has a great ability to pick up refugees fleeing political persecution in other South American countries. Argentina has a sorry record in relation to human rights. I am certainly worried by the fact that there is an Australian citizen in Argentine hands. I ask the Minister whether he can make some inquiries through the Department of Foreign Affairs as to what charges have been laid against Mr Marinelli and whether any of our consular representatives in that country have been in touch with Mr Marinelli or are aware that he is imprisoned somewhere in Argentina. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Trade and Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The then Commonwealth Government did not require that an environmental impact statement be prepared at the time decisions were being taken to recommission the Mary Kathleen uranium mine. I understand that Mary Kathleen Uranium Ltd at that time submitted a document to the relevant Queensland authorities on environmental aspects of the recommissioning of the mine.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Mary Kathleen mine is expected to continue operations for a few years yet. Nevertheless I understand that Mary Kathleen Uranium Ltd is in the process of preparing detailed plans for the rehabilitation of the Mary Kathleen mine. Responsibility for regulation of all mining operations within Queensland rests with the State Government.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="409" SPEAKER="Baume Sen The Hon P.E." NAMEID="ME4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="SA" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator Peter Baume</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Commonwealth legislative provisions on interference with the mail relate only to interference with articles in the course of postal transmission. The type of interference referred to in the Question would occur after mail had been delivered. State and Territory laws in the place of delivery could possibly be relevant in some cases of interference, depending on circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Postal legislation does not require that a postal article be handed to the addressee. Such a requirement could be quite unworkable in providing a national postal service.</PARA>
<PARA> As stated above, there are no Commonwealth laws which relate to interception of or interference with mail after delivery.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Australian Federal Police, as a law enforcement agency, has powers of investigation and prosecution in respect of any offences against Commonwealth law, including postal legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia Post's security officers investigate and prosecute offences against the Postal Services Act but, in relation to interference with postal articles, their involvement would be limited to interference occurring in the course of postal transmission.</PARA>
<PARA> Complaints involving interception after delivery would be a matter for State police investigation or for civil proceedings between the parties involved.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Over the years, Australia Post has received occasional complaints of interference with mail after delivery has been effected. However, we have no record of any such complaints which related to matters within the jurisdiction of Commonwealth law.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The Australian Broadcasting Tribunal has no record itself of any instance in which a religious organisation or cult, when soliciting donations in a television program, has falsely advised viewers that these donations were tax deductible.</PARA>
<PARA> In response to the Tribunal's request, the General Manager of the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations has provided the following information:</PARA>
<PARA> 'Of those Commercial Television Stations which televise programs on behalf of religious cults or organisations in which donations are solicited, only one Station has any recollection of a claim being made to the effect that a donation would be tax deductible.</PARA>
<PARA> The particular incident occurred within a program 'Good News' televised by GTV9, Melbourne on behalf of Full Gospel Businessman's Fellowship, Australian National Division. The program is recorded in the USA.</PARA>
<PARA> Management of GTV9 advises that it has since taken the precaution of editing the program, where necessary, to ensure that a similar situation will not recur. I am advised that other Stations take similar precautions.'</PARA>
<PARA> (6) I propose to discuss with the Chairman of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal the incidence of the use of television for fraudulent purposes by religious organisations, and the possible need for some controls in this area.</PARA>
<PARA> The provisions of the Broadcasting and Television Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1980, which provided for partial self-regulation for broadcasters, are currently being reviewed in the light of public representations received. The need for regulatory controls in this area could be considered as part of this review.</PARA>

<QUESTION.NUMBER QON.NUMBER="207">(Question No. 207)</QUESTION.NUMBER><QUESTION PAGE="410" SPEAKER="Button Sen J.N." NAMEID="4F4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator Button</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, upon notice, on 3 December 1980:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Are there many telephone subscribers who, in the absence of STD, leave their telephone openly available to visitors, staff members, flatmates, etc. and are quite willing to bear the cost of local calls, knowing that trunk calls have to be booked with the operator, with a reasonable chance of identifying the persons concerned.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) With the advent of STD, are subscribers whose telephones are 'relatively accessible' running the risk of substantial losses from use of STD by people who take advantage of knowing that no record is available of such calls.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) If such subscribers decided to bar the service from STD, do they face the prospect of trunk calls being subjected to additional charges, which are so great in some cases as to represent a real deterrent to making such calls.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Would a subscriber who considered it necessary to have STD barred and who regularly called a town to which the new 'Community Call' rate applied have to pay 79c for each call which by STD would have only been 9c, a surcharge of 777 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) If an STD barred subscriber who regularly made daytime calls which might cost, say $7.00 still be charged only 70c extra representing a fairly innocuous 10 per cent surcharge.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) If a subscriber accepts a reverse charge call from a person calling from a nearby town, who, say, may be stranded without any coins, would the charge be $1.19 instead of the STD public telephone cost of 10c and would this extra charge still apply if the reason the call was made 'reverse charge' was that the coin telephone appeared to be out of order and a Telecom operator suggested reversing the charges.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="410" SPEAKER="Baume Sen The Hon P.E." NAMEID="ME4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="VIC">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator Peter Baume</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Telecom Australia has advised that it has no data on the subject.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Telecom Australia believes that most subscribers would take appropriate action to guard against unauthorised use of their services.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) An additional service charge is applied for a telephone trunk call booked with an exchange operator where the subscriber has access to STD facilities but elects not to use the facilities and day rates apply at all times.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) and (5) Yes. Standard equipment does not permit the barring of STD calls and at the same time allow community calls to be unbarred.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The Reverse Charge Service is available on trunk calls only. In the case of a local call from a nearby town, the caller stranded without coins who required an urgent call would be connected without charge. Similarly, if the coin mechanism were faulty and there was not another coin telephone nearby, the caller would be put through without charge.</PARA>
