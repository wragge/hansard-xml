<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA>That your petitioners are gravely concerned at the prospect of any legislation regarding Plant Variety Rights.</PARA>
<PARA> The reasons are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. We believe it would transfer control, the key aspect of agriculture in this country, to overseas interests not responsible to the Australian Government.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. We believe it would restrict the growing and trading of many seeds.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. We believe it would cause a decline in the genetic diversity of crops making them more subject to destruction by pests and diseases.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. We believe thorough investigation of the effect of similar legislation overseas and a full public debate is required before any decision is made.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that Parliament refrains from enacting any legislation on Plant Variety Rights.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to Senator Chaney, though I am not sure in what capacity. Has the Minister been given the task of supervising the Government's publicity committee as reported in Monday's Age? Does this function involve determining how public money can be spent on improving the electoral standing of the Fraser Government? Does the Minister see any conflict arising when he and the committee approve an allocation of public funds to market research by advertising firms which are retained by the Liberal or National Country parties in the performance of their functions as political parties? If so, how does he reconcile these decisions with the sentiments he expressed when reading a statement or a speech on behalf of the Prime Minister at a Liberal Party gathering in Adelaide on 5 December last year?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Any duties that I have are not related to matters of the electoral standing of the Government but rather the need to ensure that accurate information is available to the Australian people. This is something which sometimes governments find hard to do. I would have thought that, on any comparison of the expenditure of the present Government with the expenditure of the previous Labor Government on matters such as the employment of journalists and people who are there to ensure that information is available to the public, this Government is extremely modest in the amount of public funds that it devotes to that purpose.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government Information Unit has a very small number of journalists here in Canberra-I think it has two with a third to be appointed. It has also one journalist in each State capital. In fact, the Commonwealth Government would have one of the smallest and most modest information services of any comparable government. I suggest that if Senator Button is seriously worried about the amounts of money which might be expended in making information available to the public, he examine the position in New South Wales with its Labor Government and do a comparison between the resources devoted to this area by that Government and by this Government and let me know the results of his inquiries.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator asks a question relating to the introduction of cable television in Australia. I think that decision is a fair way off. Approximately 60 submissions already have been received by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal for its inquiry into cable television, but it is anticipated that a further 80 submissions are yet to be lodged. So I imagine it will be some considerable time before those submissions are lodged, examined and assessed. The closing date for these submissions was about one week ago. The honourable senator seeks an assurance that, when cable television is introduced, it will contain appropriate safeguards against the unrestricted showing of pornographic material. I think that the honourable senator has raised an important matter and I will undertake to refer it to my colleague, the Minister for Communications.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. Is it a fact that the Department of Social Security makes available to various organisations subsidies under the provisions of the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act, but refuses to disclose details of such subsidies? Is it a fact that the Department takes no interest in the services made available to people from these subsidies and, in particular, to the eligibility criteria used by such organisations?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All the funds administered in the subsidy programs of my Department are, of course, appropriated by this Department and are subject to public examination both in the Parliament and in the committees of this Senate. I have no information that suggests that the Department is refusing to provide information about subsidies paid under the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act. I certainly will inquire into the matter which has been raised by Senator Grimes and see whether any difficulty exists about it. It would not be true to say that the Department takes no interest in the people who are beneficiaries of these programs. It is a fact that, in our subsidy programs generally, we are providing moneys to organisations which have the responsibility of providing services to the handicapped-the very purpose for which they were formed. My Department does, however, become involved from time to time in providing assistance and consultants to organisations which may be having difficulties. It does not directly provide the services. If Senator Grimes believes that there are areas of neglect of the interests of the beneficiaries by organisations which receive subsidy funding from the Commonwealth, I suggest that he draw those matters to my attention and I will see what action needs to be taken and can be taken.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know exactly the state of hospitals in Tasmania, but I am advised that instructions have gone out that the hospitals have to truncate or limit some of their activities, certainly in hiring. It is quite clear to honourable senators that the Commonwealth presently shares 50 per cent of the net operating cost of each State's public hospitals and that each State is responsible for meeting the other 50 per cent of the cost. If, in fact, Tasmania has decided its hospital system is in disarray, I think it must look to its record of management of its economy to find the answer. That is where the answer rests. I imagine that there has been a record of mismanagement if, in fact, the hospitals in Tasmania are in that situation.</PARA></TALK.START>

Are there any records of a higher than normal rate of terminal illness of naval personnel, or ex-naval personnel, who served in HMAS Karanji, on the staff of the naval officer in charge in Western Australia, or in HMAS Boom Depot, Fremantle, at the time of the Monte Bello atomic trials? What ships were employed in monitoring the radiation levels at the Monte Bello Islands in the three years following the tests in question? Is there a record of any unusual illness among ships' company, in particular among the monitoring team? Also, what equipment was returned by HMAS Karanji to HMAS Boom Depot after the Monte Bello Islands trials? Was it checked for radiation and how was it ultimately disposed of?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As honourable senators will know, at this moment my Department is conducting a very intensive investigation specifically into the Maralinga tests and any effects of radiation upon those who served there during the 1950s and 1960s when nuclear explosions occurred. That investigation can readily encompass those who served in areas where atomic tests took place, including the Monte Belle Islands. I repeat my exhortation of the public that any person who has any information relating to adverse effects of nuclear testing in Australia or off-shore Australia or any person who believes that an acquaintance may have suffered such effects should come forward. We are anxious to contact every person who may have been involved. We are searching the records that exist. Records do exist, of course, but people have moved, gone abroad or died. Specifically, I am making a general appeal in terms of the substance and meaning of Senator Mulvihill's question. Although I am not aware of the details of the particular Royal Australian Navy officers and personnel or of the particular vessel or vessels involved, I will seek those details and let Senator Mulvihill have them. Let me make it perfectly clear that my Government, my Department and I want every person who has any information that could help in a thorough investigation of the effects of the nuclear explosions in the 1950s and 1960s to contact my Department or me.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know of no such difficulty. Only recently I wanted to reassure myself of that problem in relation to Maralinga. Therefore I sought out the confidential scientific information that was available, read it and studied it. I then went to Maralinga and inspected the various sites. On the basis of the information in the documents and on the assumption that that material existed in the pits concerned, I was able to satisfy myself that very considerable steps had been taken to dispose of waste materials that might be radioactive. I was able to satisfy myself that the safeguards of pits, sealed concrete caps, fences and Federal police patrols were all there. My recollection-I would need to check it-is that I have similar information as to the Monte Bello Islands. I have not been there. It is, in fact, upon my list of places to visit in the near future. I will check. It may well be that because of secrecy all I can do is to say that I have inspected the site and am able to give assurances.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. What is the Federal Government's position concerning the proposed makarrata or Aboriginal treaty? What action has been taken in regard to the proposed treaty? Can the Minister advise what representations, if any, have been made to the States regarding the treaty? If approaches have been made, were they made by the Federal Government or some other authority?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="712" SPEAKER="Baume Sen The Hon P.E." NAMEID="ME4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Makarrata is an Aboriginal word meaning, in general terms, a resumption of normal relationships at the end of a period of disagreement. The word is being used in relation to a move to develop an understanding between Aboriginal people and other Australians. I will answer the last part of the question first. The discussions to develop a makarrata will involve both the Commonwealth Government, which will deal with national Aboriginal bodies, and also State governments which will deal with those areas which relate to their own activities. The meeting last week between State and Commonwealth Ministers responsible for Aboriginal affairs was attended by representatives of the National Aboriginal Conference who asked the States whether they would open up discussions on the question of a makarrata. So, the direct approach has come from the elected representatives of the Aboriginal people to the States regarding the makarrata. I must say to the honourable senator that I do not use the word treaty for reasons which have to do with the precise legal meaning of the word. The approach came from Aboriginal people and was taken up by most of the States and the Northern Territory. At this stage no State has indicated that it will not discuss the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government proposes, with the help of the National Aboriginal Conference, to pursue the concept of a makarrata and also to provide assistance to the NAC to research and develop the proposal. In doing so, the Government is prepared to acknowledge prior occupation of Australia by Aboriginals. We are not prepared to act unilaterally in those areas where the States have an interest. I have indicated to the NAC in a number of particular matters that the Government cannot negotiate a treaty which implies an internationally recognised agreement between two nations. I have indicated to the NAC that the Government cannot agree to any fixed financial commitment into the future. I have also indicated to the NAC that the Government cannot support the proposal for reserved seats in the Parliament for Aboriginals. I have also indicated in response to a particular recommendation from the NAC, that the Government does not believe that a system where Aboriginal employment is subject to a rigidly fixed formula is appropriate. Nevertheless, the Government has indicated a position from which it will negotiate. The Aboriginal representatives have now opened up the matter further with the State governments. It is up to them to take the next step.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct a question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Have there, as yet, been any discussions or proposals involving some or all of the States for a rebate system of power charging as an incentive to the installation of solar or other supplementary alternatives to the present power supply? If not, can this be proposed at either a Premiers Conference or at State energy Minister level? Does the cost and availability of existing power in Australia justify such an action?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="713" SPEAKER="Carrick Sen The Hon J.L." NAMEID="2U4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The introduction of a system of rebates on electricity charges to provide an incentive for the installation of solar energy units essentially involves the pricing policies of State electricity authorities and, as such, falls outside the Commonwealth's responsibilities, as Senator Archer would acknowledge. The situation faced by each electricity authority would no doubt determine the economics of such a proposal. Without being aware of the relevant costs and other matters, it is difficult to say what the economics would be. However, such a proposal would be likely to be less attractive in Australia with its coal-fired electricity generation than it might be in countries in which such schemes have been introduced-for example, in some parts of the United States of America-and which rely on oil-fired electricity generation to a large extent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are signs that, even without special concessions, many people are finding it economically attractive to install solar units, especially for hot water systems. For example, in Western Australia some 22 per cent of new home owners chose a solar water heater in 1979. In excess of 80,000 solar units are now installed in dwellings in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> No discussions have been held between the Commonwealth and the States on a system of power charging rebates for having solar systems installed. As the matter is primarily one for the States, it would be appropriate for any discussion to be initiated by a State, but this discussion could occur between Commonwealth and State Ministers and at meetings of the Australian Minerals and Energy Council. Nevertheless, I will bring the honourable senator's question to the notice of my State colleagues.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I refer to the statement of the Prime Minister made last week contrasting the Federal reduction in the number of public servants with a large increase that had taken place in State and local government employment. Is it the intention of the Fraser Government to force State governments to reduce the size of their public services and to curtail community services by cutting the allocation of Federal funds to the States at the forthcoming Premiers Conference? Does the Minister acknowledge that the Prime Minister's attitude makes a mockery of his so-called co-operative federalism policy which was a feature of his 1977 election campaign?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="714" SPEAKER="Carrick Sen The Hon J.L." NAMEID="2U4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If there is any mockery, it is a mockery of the wrong claim by members of the Australian Labor Party that the States have been short of funds. The figures indicate that whereas the Commonwealth Government, over the last five years, has reduced its Public Service numbers by approximately 10,000-do not hold me to that figure; that is in indicative figures-State Public Service numbers have increased by 100,000. A little calculation will show that to do that they would need approximately an extra $2,000m a year just to maintain that kind of growth. So the first dolly that goes over is that argument that the States have been short of funds.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second point is this: There will be a Premiers Conference, I think, within the next month. At that conference, there will be discussion about any new arrangements that there may be with regard to income tax sharing or other matters. I am not able to forecast what will arise from that conference. All I can say is that the test of federalism has been that, in the course of the five or six years that it has run, the States have been able to increase their services and to reduce taxation. Quite clearly, the States have had an abundance of funds during that time.</PARA>
<PARA> What the Prime Minister has said is this: It is clearly in the interest of the welfare and the living standards of all Australians that we should keep inflation down, and certainly below that of our trading partners. Since the States and local government handle and spend some 52 per cent of all public funds, they have as much responsibility towards the proper control of finance as has the Commonwealth. If indeed the Commonwealth, under its economic policies, is operating restraint, so should the States if we are to maintain the position that we have been restored to in terms of inflation and of our trading partners in the rest of the world.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the Minister representing the Minister for Science and Technology noticed the depressing frequency with which 24-hour weather forecasts bear no relation to what actually happens? For instance, in Canberra yesterday there was supposed to be developing rain. There was no developing rain and in fact it was a hot fine day. Whilst accepting that weather forecasters can usually tell us what the weather is and perhaps make a useful two-hour route forecast for an aircraft, I should like to ask the Minister: How much does the Commonwealth Bureau of Meteorology cost each year? Is there any statistical evidence that expensive and sophisticated aids such as satellite photographs have significantly improved the accuracy of 24-hour and longer forecasts? If so, how great has been the improvement?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it might be even more depressing if we were able to forecast the weather too accurately. A major point of discussion and complaint which we have all the time about the weather would be removed. The cost of operating the Bureau of Meteorology in 1979-80 was $40m. That covers forecasting, warning and consultative services provided for aviation, defence, shipping and the general community. The main technological aids available to assist weather forecasting are satellite data, computers, radar and communications facilities. Any evaluation of the accuracy of weather forecasting is largely subjective, as I am sure Senator Hamer will agree.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The indications are that the various aids mentioned by Senator Hamer have resulted in the following: Little improvement in forecasts beyond two days; approximately a 10 per cent improvement in 24-hour forecasts in the last 10 years-we are getting somewhere-but significant improvements in shorter term forecasts. I add as a general point that since satellites have been available there has been a 170 per cent increase in the number of tropical cyclones detected in northern Australia and adjacent oceans and an hourly location system of cyclones is now available everywhere off Australia because of radar and satellites.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8T7">Senator TOWNLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I preface my question, which is directed to the Minister for National Development and Energy, by saying that I well recognise the Minister's interest in decentralisation. I refer to a statement in today's Press which indicates that Australia's first silicon wafer fabrication plant is to be built in Canberra at a cost of some $100m and may eventually employ, I believe, about 2,000 people. Is the Minister aware that for many reasons this is exactly the type of industry that should be located in Tasmania? As an electronic engineer I recognise that the growing of silicon chips requires pure air. Surely the air in Tasmania is purer than that in Canberra. I think that is proved by the fact that one of the world's air monitoring stations was established in the north-west of Tasmania because of the air purity there. Is the Minister further aware that the silicon chip industry is suitable for Tasmania because of the ease of air freighting the small but very valuable chips and that it is an industry which employs many people without huge demands for energy-a fact which conservationists would appreciate? I ask: Why was Canberra chosen? Was the Tasmanian Government asked whether it could offer a suitable site for the plant? Does the establishment of this plant mean that, as well as making Canberra the bureaucratic centre of Australia, there will be an attempt to make it the small industry centre and particularly the electronic centre of the country as well? Finally, will the Government re-examine the decision to establish this plant and any others like it in Canberra?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The choice of Canberra as a potential site for the National Semiconductor company silicon wafer plant was made by the company itself. That was its choice. I make it clear that what the Government has announced is that an agreement for a feasibility study should be made to ensure that all aspects of the feasibility of this undertaking will be capable of fulfilment. There is no doubt in the world that if Australia can get a silicon wafer plant which would be of very high technology-technology that is rapidly changing and increasing-this will be of significance to Australia. I repeat that a feasibility study is being undertaken. Of course, I am aware that those kinds of industries would be ideal for Tasmania. Indeed, one would want not the derision of the Opposition but a constructive approach to seeking such industries and attracting them to Tasmania. I think it can be said without whimsy that Tasmania does have purer air than most parts of the community. Equally, it is possible for such an industry which produces small, lightweight commodities to operate from Tasmania because air freight costs would be very small. The answer is that Canberra was selected as the centre by the National Semiconductor company itself. That must be, I take it, the free choice of commerce and industry. It was nothing to do with bureaucracy as such.

I ask the Minister: Did he say, as was reported in the article, that he had been assured by the British authorities that all Australian personnel had been properly decontaminated? Has the Minister followed up this British assurance with any checking of Australian Service and police personnel records? If not, will he check on these records?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have never made any complacent statements on this matter. I have read that article. I read it with deep interest and sympathy for the persons concerned. My Department had prior contact with the two persons named in the article and we have received information about them. It is true that I have said that I had been assured that various precautions had been taken, but I have also said that those matters occurred 20 or 30 years ago when knowledge of the handling of radioactivity may have been more imperfect. As Senator O'Byrne will know, servicemen also have a habit of not always sticking to the regulations. Let me make it perfectly clear that I am not being complacent about the matter. I am seeking to do a number of things. Basically I am seeking to find out the circumstances of every person who served in those areas and to identify whether such persons have had a health problem and whether that health problem could have been a result of radiation. If there is some pattern between the radioactivity of nuclear testing of the 1950s and 1960s and the morbidity and mortality of our people, we want to know about it as to both the generality and the particularity of the individual or member of his family who will need help.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have made widely a number of statements inviting people to come forward. As far as I know, about 2,000 civilians and servicemen were at Maralinga, Emu Plains and the area generally over a period of 10 years or more. About 160 people have come forward. This is a small but significant sample. We have sought from them information on the existence of their friends and associates. I have talked about the Service network, which, I think, the honourable senator will understand. We are combing through the records for two reasons: Firstly, to find out what happened at every specific place so that when a claim is made we will know the circumstances and, secondly, to try if we can, even from very old records, to track down individuals who do not come forward. Senator O'Byrne will understand that after 25 years it is unlikely that the records will hold the key to the situation. So it is better to invite people to come forward and track from them while we are going through the very tedious process of searching through old records, some of which, I think, are in England.</PARA>
<PARA> We have also invited the Australian Nuclear Veterans Association to give us its lists of people who have come forward to it. The Association would be a rallying point. I believe that the Association is inviting its members to give us the names and addresses of people who were involved. Whenever I get the opportunity publicly I will make an appeal for people to come forward. I thank the honourable senator for this opportunity. The only way we will know is by getting the largest possible sample of information that we can from those 2,000 people, some of whom will be dead and some of whom will be overseas, and checking whether the mortality and morbidity is atypical of the population and, if so, whether it could relate to radioactivity. As we proceed we must keep in mind that we are not just after some scientific information; it is important only if it relates to individuals and their sufferings. I would welcome any information that anyone brought to me. My door is open to any honourable senators who have such information.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today Senator Walters asked me a question concerning hospital financing in Tasmania. I have a little extra information for the honourable senator. The Commonwealth approved Budget for hospital funding in Tasmania for 1980-81 was $83,149,000, of which the Commonwealth's share of 50 per cent was $41,575,000. This is an increase of 10.6 per cent on last year's funding. Unfortunately, Tasmania has continued to expand its hospital services outside the Commonwealth's guidelines for hospital funding. The Commonwealth's funding formula includes a factor for expected increases in the cost of goods and services as well as wages and salaries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commonwealth naturally requests the States to adhere to the broad escalation factors utilised in calculating the amount of public hospital funding in the ensuing year. However, if States can document and substantiate price increases in excess of the provisional escalation factors and demonstrate that efforts have been made to minimise or offset the rises, consideration can be given to the provision of additional funds under the cost-sharing arrangements. Examples of this have been the cost of fuel oil and the adjustments for wage and salary increases within wage indexation guidelines. These are made as a matter of course. At the recent Health Ministers conference in Perth the Minister for Health advised all States and the Northern Territory that the Commonwealth is prepared to consider and respond to as best it can any special difficulties that they may be experiencing. The Minister feels that if variations from a State's approved Budget are required they would best be considered at the next meeting of the standing committee of officers established to consider and review public hospital funding. The next series of meetings is scheduled to take place in April.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Honourable senators will be aware that in recent days considerable media attention has been given to matters related to problems suffered by Vietnam veterans. On Sunday last I issued a statement which had three aims. The first was to allay unnecessary anxieties which may have been generated by the rather sensational nature of the media coverage of these matters. The second aim was to indicate that there is a growing feeling that the problems of Vietnam veterans may have a much broader aspect than the narrow focus on whether or not there is a causal link with certain defoliants. As I indicated, a body of evidence is emerging which suggests that veterans' physical, psychological and social problems could be related to the experience of the Vietnam war and to community attitudes within Australia towards that war.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My third aim was to repeat the offer I made on behalf of the Government earlier this year that any veteran who felt that he was suffering from problems which required urgent attention could avail himself of the full facilities of the repatriation treatment system. Amongst the general Press comments made since then is one particularly significant misrepresentation, namely, the report in today's Australian, which quotes me as saying that claims of the chemical effects have been 'overstated'. I have never used this word in the context of the whole discussion; nor would I. I invite that newspaper and any other which may have interpreted my remarks of recent days in this way to examine carefully not only the statements of recent days but also my record on the matter since being appointed to the Ministry. In particular, I draw attention to my public statement of 14 January this year. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my chief concern that the concentration of attention on the question of herbicides by the media, commentators and others does not preclude rational discussion in the community on the possible broader effects of war service in Vietnam.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter of public importance proposed to the Senate by the Australian Labor Party is designed to create some public interest in what we consider to be the inadequacies of our present electoral laws as they relate to political campaigning and political advertising. It is not to be construed as expressing any strong views about the recent case involving the High Court of Australia and certain candidates in the 1980 Federal election; rather, it is to analyse the deficiencies that we believe exist in the present Commonwealth Electoral Act. The purpose, after all, of any electoral system is to bring about a result whereby the party which polls 50 per cent or more of the votes should win the election. Of course, an analysis shows that if that system had been operating in the post-War years, the Australian Labor Party would have won the elections in 1954, 1961 and 1969 in addition to the two elections in 1972 and 1974.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We believe the present electoral system is loaded. It is unfair, inequitable and undemocratic. Yet on the occasions when attempts have been made to remedy these matters in the Parliament, the conservative parties have failed to take any legislative steps to make political campaigning more equitable and democratic. The issue that we want to discuss today drags into the daylight all the hypocrisy, cynicism and outright duplicity of the Liberal and National Country parties. I can remember in 1975, for example, when we were debating an electoral Bill that had passed the House of Representatives, Senator Withers interjecting: 'It is fair to us; just awful to you'. Then he just chuckled. Of course the obstructionist attitude of the Senate placed that Bill aside. What cynicism did that represent? It only highlighted the same attitude that was found in the debate in the House of Representatives. For example, we can recall Mr Killen, then the shadow Minister for Defence, piously calling for the establishment of a joint committee to consider the matters after his party had already stated publicly that it was going to reject the Electoral Act. He called for the establishment of a joint committee. Similarly, in this place Senator Guilfoyle called for the establishment of a joint committee to consider the current Senate debate. Nearly six years later we can surely ask: Why did not the Fraser Government set up such a joint committee to consider electoral matters, electoral deficiencies and electoral expenditure?</PARA>
<PARA> We all recognise that there are such deficiencies in the Electoral Act. We can ask the question: Why does not the current Minister for Administrative Services, Mr Newman, set up a joint committee to overhaul the electoral system instead of carrying on as he has been behind doors in secrecy sitting on a report prepared by his predecessor in the Australian Electoral Office? Why the secrecy? Is it because that report highlights these deficiencies and is critical of the Government's attitude to the matter? I challenge the Government-indeed I have asked two questions on this subject of Mr Newman-to make that report available. The issues of electoral reform are substantial and important. They are not unique to Australia. They are being raised in many other countries. Other democratic countries are taking steps when confronted with similar problems on matters of the electoral sytem, electoral expenditure, public accountability and electoral justice. Canada is currently carrying out such an examination. It is looking at different approaches and solutions. In some cases such conditions have already made the appropriate changes to the legislation. But what attitude has been adopted after reports in Australia have been investigated? The reports are kept under double wraps. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition believes-as indeed most of the other democratic countries and democratic parties believe-that there should be a limit to electoral funding and expenditure and that there should be a public disclosure of sources of funding. Surely a government that has nothing to hide should not be afraid to accept these basic principles. Surely they are basic principles for the maintenance of a functioning democracy. Surely it has to be accepted that the way in which election campaigns are financed is fundamental to the whole way in which the electoral process should operate. If parties do not have equal access to resources and adequate access to funds, the system is clearly lop-sided. In this country it is clear that the conservative parties have unlimited access and unlimited funds and resources. We should recall the question asked of the Government by Senator Button today. Despite the advantages the Government parties have in the political climate of Australia, this Government uses taxpayers' money to establish a communication unit, and extra units, in order to popularise and publicise its day to day policies. Of course, that gives it an edge on every other political party. Therefore it is able to exercise excessive influence in the moulding of public opinion and in the functioning of the whole parliamentary process. </PARA>
<PARA> The conservative parties also have the added advantage of greater access to the media. In fact, the media comprise one of the institutions that prop up this Government, its philosophy and its ideology. One has only to refer to the role that has been played in the media by the Murdoch Press. It is primarily because of that position in our society that this Government is able to win majority support. Those who want to put up a different political philosophy, a different policy and an alternative suffer as a result of the substantial use of resources by the conservative parties. The Opposition party is at a disadvantage. How much more at a disadvantage in this whole political process are the smaller parties in our society? What a travesty it is that in our society we have several processes and structures by which some relief is offered to our community-the Trade Practices Act, for example, is designed to protect consumers from the misuse of power in the market place itself and in respect of the media a Press council is designed to provide relief from the excesses that occur from time to time in the dissemination of information and so on-yet absolutely no relief is provided in our present Electoral Act so far as elections are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> What has been the Government's response to the problems of electoral expenditure and campaigns? It set up a committee to try to establish a means of examining this problem. But the guidelines of that committee are so restrictive, so narrow, that in fact it has actually very little purpose at all when the question of public expenditure or funding or electoral expenditure has been raised from time to time. The terms of reference of the current inquiry being carried out are hopelessly loaded and restrictive. I would like to draw attention to just how restrictive the terms of reference are. In the first place, they exclude the question of disclosure of donations to candidates and parties. The Australian Labor Party is firmly of the view that giving money to a party to assist it in its pursuit of its public office responsibilities is an involvement in the electoral process. No privacy should be attached to this involvement. The electorate has a right to know who is providing funds for parties and candidates seeking their votes. The same principles apply to parties and candidates spending funds, whether public or private and whatever the source. We all recall how in the last session of Parliament, before the 1980 general election, this Government brought in legislation which even abolished the restriction on the limit of $1,000 per candidate for election expenses which previously existed in the Act, thereby removing completely any limitation in regard to the funding processes for elections. Arguments that such disclosures endanger the secret ballot system are specious and are rejected. An individual is certainly entitled to his or her privacy up to and until the moment he or she engages in public behaviour, but giving funds to a party or a candidate is a public act and, accordingly, no privacy should be attached to that act. </PARA>
<PARA> Although no firm statistics are available on this matter, most funding of election campaigns obviously comes from private corporations. When we consider that the conservative parties spend about three or four times that which is spent by the Labor Party and probably some 50 or 60 times that which is spent by the Australian Democrats, we can see that there is a need for some examination of this issue. The employees of those companies that give such substantial donations to the conservative parties or, indeed, the shareholders of those companies, are rarely consulted, if ever, about these donations and neither are the consumers who, after all, make up the profit given to conservative parties in the form of higher prices. </PARA>
<PARA> Anyone who knows anything about politics in this country would know that the conservative parties are the most corrupt of all political parties, corrupt in the sense that there is no disclosure of funds and no indication of how they are able to raise such large sums of money. Obviously these funds are from sources that are associated with them in commercial enterprises and in commercial arrangements. We have only to look at the end result to know that funds flow into the conservative parties in greater volume than they flow into any of the other political parties in our country. Nobody knows about the deals, the subsidies or slush funds which clearly find their way to the conservative parties for election purposes. Even the conservatives in Queensland have raised criticism about the Bjelke-Petersen Foundation and the means by which that enterprise has an advantage over the other conservative party. I do not suggest that individual members of the conservative parties are corrupt, but I do suggest that the conservative parties are corrupt insofar as they receive funds form unnamed sources and are not prepared, as the 1975 debates show and as the inquiry which is now proceeding shows, to have public disclosure of donations. Everyone knows that big spenders can win because they are the big spenders. Everyone knows that it is the Liberal Party and the National Country Party which are the big spenders in the whole political process. We are currently spending $100 for every man, woman and child in this country on commodity production exposure and sales in the market place. That shows, of course, how valuable it is to have a process of advertising. Therefore, those who have more money to spend on advertising obviously enjoy advantages. </PARA>
<PARA> Those of us who are involved in the political processes are aware that the very avaricious sections of our economy, such as the multinationals and the big mining sectors, have been and are involved in funding the conservative parties. We do not have to look at the situation in many countries to appreciate that the big corporations and the big business sectors have been involved in political scandals. In Italy, Japan and many other countries funds have actually flowed into political coffers as a result of commercial deals involving the government parties in power in those countries. We would be foolish unto ourselves if we did not realise that this is happening in our own country. For example, I know, but I cannot prove it because the arrangements that are made between corporations and parties are secret, that for years and years the Shell Oil Co financed the political activities of the Australian Democratic Labor Party. What we have is a democracy for the rich and the powerful, a democracy which assists those who have the hegemonic position in our society. We have an electoral system which is incredibly valuable to outside influence. That, for all we know, could extend even to foreign intelligence agencies and to centres of financial power. Basically, we need guidelines. We need to establish a process in our electoral laws that gives us the same sort of relief, the same sort of processes which would equalise and democratise the whole principle of electioneering in our country, if indeed we found the need to do it, as the Trade Practices Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that if this Government were really concerned about this problem it would have applied itself to the major amendments which the Australian Labor Party formulated in 1975. Such formulations were passed by the House of Representatives following a debate in which all of these matters were adequately canvassed. They contained all the considerations which I have suggested need to be examined in the Parliament. It was the obstinacy, the dogmatism, the ruthless use of numbers and the authoritarianism of the Government parties, which then held a majority in this place, which prevented the implementation of the 1975 legislation. These amendments were aimed solely at eliminating some of the injustices and the inequalities of the present system, but after five years of the Fraser Government the need for reform is even more important and even more necessary than it was in those days. The reforms will have to be seen as radical and necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> The Electoral Act as interpreted allows those who control enormous financial resources to manipulate election campaigns at their pleasure while the ordinary person struggles to participate in the electoral processes at an unequal level. There is no equality in the system, either in the disclosure of the source of donations, the restraints on campaign spending, the control of the media and the structure of our electoral system, or in the power exercised by the upper houses of the various parliaments. The Government is already operating and has continued to operate on a system which favours it. The Government has taken the extraordinary step, in addition to the inequities to which I have referred, of establishing yet another unit to sell itself more successfully to the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> The way in which we could overcome the infamous situation which this High Court decision has brought home to us would be to set up the mechanics for an independent control of the administration of a new and reformed Electoral Act and system-the establishment, for example, of an electoral commission which should be permanent, independent, public and acceptable to all parties involved in the parliamentary process. It could be responsible within the guidelines of the Parliament for the regular redistribution of electorates. It could be responsible for overseeing all aspects of the Electoral Act, including those parts dealing with misleading advertising. It could be responsible for monitoring donations to political parties and electoral expenditure. The other speakers in this debate will deal with those matters in much more detail. </PARA>
<PARA> I well recall, for example, what happened at the booths for which I had some responsibility in the 1980 election. Big signs were placed in those booths which stated that a vote for Labor was a vote for higher taxes whereas in that election the Australian Labor Party was in fact specifically advocating a reduction in petrol prices and a reduction in taxation. Nowhere in any of the election propaganda or of statements of parliamentary candidates or of our leader was it ever suggested that there would be any increase in taxation. Those matters will be dealt with by other speakers. Here we are concerned about the way in which misleading advertising has an effect upon an election during the campaign and not subsequent to it. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be necessary, because of the potential dissension involved, for such an electoral commission that I have recommended to consist of members acceptable to the Parliament. Although by no means it should be legalistic in outlook, it would need to have expertise in law. For example, such a commission could probably include an eminent legal person from the Commonwealth Ombudsman's Office-maybe the Commonwealth Ombudsman himself-representatives of the Government and of the Opposition and the Commonwealth Chief Electoral Officer operating under a more broadly defined, popular and democratic electoral Act. In any case, its members would need to be acceptable to all parties and be of high standing in the community if their decisions were to be mandatory. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that the current Electoral Act is inefficient, deficient, discriminatory, undemocratic and biased. To the extent that we will have opportunities to debate those matters in this place in the next two or three years, we will be setting out to have established by the Senate an electoral committee to examine the weaknesses of our existing system and to make to the Parliament recommendations that would have the effect of putting into legislation the way in which elections should be conducted. Such a system would enable the party receiving the majority of votes to hold a majority in both houses of Parliament. We will be setting out to create equity in respect of public expenditure. We will be setting out to bring about a more equitable electoral system. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The Senate is debating a matter of public importance, as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The inadequacy of the law relating to political campaigning and advertising. </PARA>
<PARA>I was disappointed that Senator Gietzelt in his rather rapid cover of the subject did not specifically sheet home, prove or make good his assertions on a whole range of matters. Australia is one of the handful of 20 or so countries which can claim to be democracies. Our democratic system is a fair one. It is fairer, for example, than the system in the United Kingdom. Under that system many members are elected by a minority of votes, and I consider it to be a grossly inferior system. Of course, in this country no one can gain election to a single member constituency for the House of Representatives unless he or she achieves 50 per cent of the votes cast in that election. If we look at global votes it is quite possible to determine that one party may have marginally more or less votes than the party which won the election. But if we count the number of members who represent single member electorates we can see that our system is fair and that it is well administered. We have an electoral office which is non-corrupt. We have officers who are dedicated, who do their jobs and who administer the Act fairly and without fear or favour. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the things that Senator Gietzelt asserted are very serious things, and it is up to him to try to prove them and to sheet them home. I am looking forward to the contributions which numerous honourable senators will make to this debate. If there are some kinds of problems in relation to the Act or its administration, I hope that they will bring them out. We know that at present an examination of the Electoral Act is in progress. The Minister responsible announced on 4 December last year that an examination was to be made. Therefore, this is quite an appropriate time for those who have substantial matters they wish to bring to the attention of the Government to put them before the Senate. But when they do so, I think they have to do so in a calm and measured way and not in the rather florid and extravagant way we have just heard of putting matters which are non-testable, the truth of which cannot be proven or disproven and which really are ideological statements-polemics, shall we say-and not really of much help. </PARA>
<PARA> However, a number of subjects were referred to by Senator Gietzelt and I would like to respond to a couple of them because I think they need some kind of airing in public. He referred to election advertising. If it is his wish, some of my colleagues who will take part in this debate will give him chapter and verse, word for word, from the election advertising from his side-what was said publicly by some of his colleagues, including Senator Walsh-in relation to some of the matters which became contentious at election time. We will bring out this material because it is very clear that what comes out in public debate is the stuff of politics. What goes on in this Parliament is a continuous review and evaluation operation. Election advertising material is not like a bar of soap. If we want to advertise soap we have to adhere to certain testable qualities about the product under certain Acts, including the trade practices legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> But in the Parliament we have a unique system whereby day by day the ideas which make up the stuff of politics are examined, tested, questioned, assessed and evaluated. Every day we have Question Time. We have matters of public importance. We have adjournment debates. Every issue and every proposition that comes up can be tested here publicly. We have the Fourth Estate which exists to report, to evaluate and to interpret what is said and to indicate what it sees as the weaknesses and strengths of different people's cases. In the end people put together all the material they get from the Parliament, from public debate and from the media quite separately from the question of advertising, and they make their judgments. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the sour grapes of Senator Gietzelt result from the fact that they do not decide in favour of his side of politics. It must be understood that at the centre of his concern and his disquiet is the fact that his side is not winning. It is true that his side recommended a number of changes to the Electoral Act in 1975. I remember the Act introduced by the Honourable Fred Daly. It proposed, inter alia, not to count electors for the purpose of drawing up electoral boundaries. He was going to count population. He was going to count children. </PARA>

However one goes about changing the Act, and however the Labor Party went about changing the Act, it is a matter requiring the closest examination and the most careful scrutiny. I look forward with great interest to what Senator Chipp has to say because, as I said, a review of the Electoral Act is in progress now and I would like to hear all kinds of inputs that people have relating to this Act and its operation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The subject of misleading election advertising was referred to briefly, and I think Senator Gietzelt was correct when he said that there was no intention on his part to reactivate or to open up again the recent High Court ruling. But it is worth putting down that the Court, when it made its judgment on 18 March, affirmed the long standing advice to the Attorney-General's Department on the subject. The actions really were not necessary. I think honourable senators should remember that the Attorney-General's Department's most recent advice was in relation to a complaint from Senator Chipp about a National Country Party advertisement dated 15 October 1980. At that time the Attorney-General's Department included earlier advisings by Sir Robert Garran dated 1919 and by Sir George Knowles dated October 1934. On 5 September 1980 I incorporated those advisings in Hansard. They set out the position as it applied. They set out advisings which have been upheld by the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator might wish to argue that the law is inadequate. But the law has been applied on this occasion, as it has been applied before, and it is in accord with all the advisings that have been available to us on this matter. We tried to make known to the honourable senator what the situation was to avoid what would be costly and pointless challenges. People talk about changing the law in relation to some of these matters. It is very difficult to know whether they would increase the situation in equity. It is very difficult to know whether they would create an efficient system or whether the proposed changes which have been suggested would be workable. Considerable practical difficulties could arise if certain changes were made along the lines suggested, for example, by the Australian Democrats. It is a fact that many of the issues which may arise during election campaigns in relation to political speeches or political advertising may be issues not really suitable for testing in the courts. </PARA>
<PARA> Suppose we want to argue about the provision of housing in Australia. The argument becomes very difficult unless we can agree upon the definition of what is a house, what is a flat or what is a home unit. For the purpose of the argument, we might assume a certain amount of housing provision but someone might challenge our figures. It would be very difficult to argue in a court that one person was wrong and another person right or to argue the extent of the provision in one year or another. Some of these things are very difficult to test. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Gietzelt raised the matter of public disclosure of donations to candidates in political parties. It is necessary again to advise the Senate, and to make clear to the Australian public, that this is another matter at present being investigated. The examination is being carried out by an eminent Australian, Sir Clarrie Harders, former head of the Attorney-General's Department. He is now carrying out an inquiry into public disclosure of electoral expenditure. I must advise the Senate that there are a number of arguments which can be made in a general way against requiring the public disclosure of political contributions. I thought it rather disingenuous of Senator Gietzelt to fulminate against the contributions to political parties and omit mention of the funding basis of the Australian Labor Party from the trade union movement often by way of compulsory levies which people cannot avoid if they wish to continue carrying out their occupation. These people find it very difficult to avoid contributing to a political party which may not be the party of their choice. </PARA>
<PARA> I will state some of the arguments that could be made against public disclosure of such political donations. First of all, the disclosure of donations to political parties denies people the right to support privately the party of their choice. This amounts in effect, to a violation of the secrecy of the ballot. Many people wish to make their donations privately-for example, small people who just wish to give money. Donors, if forced to disclose donations, may face-let us not put too fine a point on it-retaliation, threats or harassment because of their campaign gifts. For example, there may be trade union intimidation of companies making donations to the Liberal or National Country parties. There could be harassment of contributors to minor parties or parties which want to promote unpopular causes-for example, the Marihuana Party. People who support that party may not wish to declare publicly that they are so doing because they fear retaliation or harassment. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that at least there is a respectable argument that we should acknowledge the problem and acknowledge the rights of donors in this matter. The disclosure of the names of donors to political parties might lead to a substantial decline in the voluntary contributions to campaign funds, not only from individuals or organisations fearing harassment, but also from donors simply wishing to remain anonymous. There are many people in many areas of public life who remain anonymous in respect of the donations they make. Disclosure might also inhibit donors who wish to support an individual candidate and not necessarily a political party that person is standing for. There are occasions when people who are not members of a political party and who would not join a political party will support a candidate who has merit or who they like for some other reason. The other reason that I think should be raised as one in favour of not publicly disclosing donations is that it would be extremely difficult to enforce prohibitions against anonymous contributions. I am not really aware of the administrative arrangements which might be brought in to effect such a procedure. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other reasons which would make me unwilling to endorse public disclosure of campaign funding. Again I will come back to a point I have made all the way through my speech. An inquiry on this subject is in progress at present. People who want to make a reasoned and careful case and have something to say on this subject should get in touch with the person conducting this inquiry, a person of the highest integrity, Sir Clarrie Harders O.B.E. Their thoughts on the matter will be valuable. The other matter referred to by Senator Gietzelt concerns public funding of election campaigns. Senator Gietzelt raised this as one of the things which his party favours. I will not go into the matter at any great length but simply point out to the honourable senator that a joint committee of the New South Wales Parliament is at present conducting an inquiry into public funding of election campaigns. That inquiry is incomplete. The terms of reference have been drawn in such a way that the inquiry will not determine whether such funding is a good idea but will simply make recommendations on the introduction of a system to allow public funding. This is a situation we are watching with some interest but we have to offset that because there are other committees looking into the question of public funding. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, there is the Piggott committee report from Tasmania. That committee was established by the Tasmanian Government in October 1979 to inquire into the Tasmanian Electoral Act, particularly the electoral expense provisions. The report was tabled in the Tasmanian Parliament in March last year. The Piggott report expressed no support at this stage for public funding of electoral campaigns. That State report left open the determination of the threshold matter. In New South Wales we are talking about merely the determination of the subject of matters. The threshold matter for the proposition that there should be public funding of election campaigns elicited no support in Tasmania. Of course, this matter of the terms of reference is difficult and I acknowledge, in relation to the matter I raised earlier, that Sir Clarrie Harders has limited terms of reference in relation to the reporting of expenditure. I note that an honourable senator attempted to interject on this point earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> I come back to what I was saying before: This Parliament is a means of evaluating what goes on both in the electoral atmosphere and in relation to the policy promises of individual political parties. To listen to the Opposition, one would think that the only element of an election campaign and the only basis on which people decided how to vote was the political advertising, the way that advertising is funded and the way the financial support of parties is derived. It would be thought from what we heard from the Opposition that the Australian people would believe anything they were told. It could be believed, listening to Opposition senators, that the performance of political parties in the Parliament, the performance of candidates on the hustings and at meetings, the presentation of policies through the public media and the philosophical approaches, reputations and standing of party leaders had nothing whatsoever to do with the way people vote. </PARA>
<PARA> Well, their performances do have something to do with the way people vote and it is because they have something to do with the way people vote that the Australian Labor Party continues to lose elections. It is because people are concerned with the performance of the parties. It is because they are concerned with the performance of candidates. It is because they are concerned with the record in government, which is a public record. It is because they are concerned with the record of Oppositions, and that is also a public record. It is because they are concerned with the philosophical approaches which are adopted. It is because they are concerned with the reputation of a Prime Minister and a Leader of the Opposition. It is for these reasons that the Australian people make up their minds. It is for these reasons that the Australian people have on three occasions elected, very handsomely, a Liberal-National Party Government. It is for this reason that on three occasions the ALP has been rejected. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me repeat that, at the present time, this Government is examining the Commonwealth Electoral Act from a number of points of view. The examination announced by Mr Newman last November is incomplete. I hope that the contributions made in this debate will provide a useful input into the work that is being done by Mr Newman's Department and to the amendments which he might want to bring forward to the Act in due course. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;(Victoria-Leader of the Australian Democrats) (4.6)-The Senate is debating as a matter of public importance the inadequacy of the law relating to political campaigning and advertising. We have just heard from Senator Peter Baume, who is leading for the Government in this debate, a 20-minute speech which I describe as a reasonable kind of defence of the right of politicians and political parties to lie, to deceive, to mislead and to traduce. As I understood Senator Baume's speech, that is precisely what it was-a defence of the right of politicians to do those things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Next up was a piece of gratuitous advice that he gave to the Democrats and the Labor Party, that is, that we should not have initiated the action in the High Court of Australia which alleged that the Liberal Party won seats in this Parliament by telling lies-by telling blatant lies. We had an admonition from Senator Baume that we should not have done it, wasted so much money, taken up the High Court's time and inconvenienced political parties because the Liberal Party had warned us before we took the action that it would fail. As Senator Baume said, he brought down a statement on 5 November telling us that we would fail. That statement relied on advice of a Solicitor-General 60 years ago and, on the basis of that advice we should never had had the temerity to go to the High Court, sitting as a Court of Disputed Returns, and asking it to disallow election results because blatant, palpable and provable lies were told by the Liberal Party. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In answer to the interjection, I say that the Liberals were spot on in the way in which they suggested the seven highly paid people on the Bench of the High Court would interpret the section; and I will have more to say about that in a moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> First, I refer to the High Court judgment of 18 March and the Government's reaction to it. Simply put, the Australian Democrats asked, so far as the result for Western Australian representation in the Senate was concerned, the High Court sitting as a Court of Disputed Returns to say that section 161 (e) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act should be applied. That section of the Act says, inter alia, that it is an illegal practice to print an electoral advertisement containing any untrue or incorrect statement intended or likely to mislead or improperly interfere with any elector in or in relation to the casting of his vote. For the benefit of the people who are listening to the broadcast of this debate, I repeat that under the Act it is an offence to print an electoral advertisement containing any untrue or incorrect statement-that covers lies-intended or likely to mislead or improperly interfere with any elector in relation to the casting of his vote. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought that the advertisement, among many others, which I now hold up and which was inserted by the Liberal Party-authorised by some person called Porter in Western Australia and on which hundreds of thousands of dollars was spent in the last week before the election and which reads: 'If you vote Democrat it might be your first Labor vote and could give Labor control of the Senate'-is a blatant, palpable, provable lie. Then followed this bald, naked statement: 'Democrats voted with Labor eight times out of 10 in the last Parliament'. That is a blatant, provable, palpable lie. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But the advertisement does not give the number of votes in that period. The record will show that there were something like 2,500 votes in this chamber and on about 100 of them we voted with the Labor Party. On 2,400, the Democrats supported the Government. Out of that set of statistics, we get this filth, this lie, printed by the Liberal Party, authorised by the Liberal Party, on which the Liberals won the fifth Senate seat in Western Australia by a handful of votes-100 or 200 votes. That is why it is important for Senator Baume, Mr Newman and Mr Fraser to cheer the High Court judgment. The High Court judgment has preserved the right of the Liberal Party or any other party which has unlimited funds-non-disclosable unlimited funds-to hire the slickest advertising agency in the business to tell the most outrageous lies in the most clever and despicable form. That is the big danger of this High Court judgment. The High Court has made the strictest possible interpretation of section 161 (e).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What did the High Court say those words in paragraph (e) mean? Why did the High Court not say that that advertisement was a lie, an untrue statement and that it did mislead? Why did the High Court not find that this advertisement which I have just read out improperly interfered with an elector in or in relation to the casting of his vote? The reason is that the High Court says it does not matter how much one lies, it does not matter how much one interferes with an elector in the forming of his judgment on how to vote. The High Court has said that this section simply means interfering with the physical casting of a person's vote. If one were to put out a how-to-vote card with the words: 'Vote Australian Labor Party-Don Chipp No. 1' that would be the mischief caught by this section. Some kind of action like that would contravene the section. In other words, the High Court has taken an extraordinary interpretation of simple words and has said that the words in this section mean interference with an elector actually recording his vote, that is, going into the polling booth with a pencil and putting numbers in squares rather than the formation of a judgment on how he or she is to vote. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It certainly is literal. I thank you for your indigestion-I am sorry, your interjection. It is the High Court that gives me indigestion, not Senator Missen. The Court's view is obviously far too narrow and unduly legalistic. There is no real chance that any elector can be genuinely interfered with in the physical process of casting his vote. As the Canberra Times in a magnificent editorial yesterday correctly stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The obtaining and marking and depositing of papers in the ballot box is entirely presided over by employees of the electoral office. </PARA>
<PARA>They are capable employees, as Senator Baume says, and dedicated employees. There is no chance that an elector can be interfered with in the mechanical process of the casting of his vote. The judgment has dealt a severe and heavy blow to Australians who wanted to see a return to clean and honest election campaigning. No one denies that campaigns have been tough in the past and will be in the future, but the amount of misrepresentation and outright lying achieved in the 1980 election by the Government parties in particular was completely unprecedented. The High Court has effectively said by its judgment that in future it will be highly desirable, if not essential, for political parties to lie their heads off in order to gain votes. A party which sticks to the truth will find itself at a savage disadvantage. In the name of freedom of speech-I almost felt sick when I read the High Court judgment-the High Court has given its stamp of approval to future election campaigns in which unfettered lying will be the order of the day. Instead of preserving freedom of speech, the High Court gave political parties the legal freedom to spread the most mischievous and malicious lies about each other. It was rather quaint that the High Court at least had the conscience to include in its judgment a statement by Mr Justice Isaacs. Senator Baume quoted a Solicitor-General. I will quote a statement by Mr Justice Isaacs which was incorporated in the judgment. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The vote of every elector is a matter of concern to the whole Commonwealth and all are interested in endeavouring to secure not merely that the vote shall be formally recorded in accordance with the opinion which the voter actually holds, free from intimidation, coercion, and bribery--</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise the next portion of Mr Justice Isaacs' quote-</PARA>
<PARA>but that the voter shall not be led by misrepresentation or concealment of any material circumstance into forming and consequently registering a political judgment different from that which he would have formed and registered had he known the real circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA>The High Court has the gall to say: 'We hold that as a general principle', and then to give a judgment that goes 180 degrees against that sort of principle. It says: 'That is a fine principle; people should not be misled by untrue advertising; but we must preserve the freedom of speech at all costs.' What rot! What hypocrisy!</PARA>

I will not resile one inch from what I have said about the judgment made by the High Court. The High Court, by this judgment, has not given freedom of speech; it has given freedom to lie. From now on it is open season and the party with the most money and the most able to tell lies will win the elections. The Melbourne Age of 20 March described as spurious Mr Newman's suggestion that laws to counter the effect of the High Court's judgment might inhibit free speech. If Senator Baume and Senator Martin, who will follow me in this debate, are suggesting that it might limit free speech if one stops politicians from telling lies in election campaigns, why not go the full shot? Why not abolish the laws of defamation or libel? The fact that one cannot say what one likes about a person certainly limits free speech. Why not do away with the laws of libel? I think that exposes the hypocrisy of any person who holds that view. The Court's decision has given the green light to any of the weirdos or the manic or subversive groups who want to interfere in Australian elections. Provided they have the money to hire some slick advertising firm to take out full page newspaper advertisements at the last moment and book all available space, thereby not allowing other political parties to reply, they can do anything they want. I will say-if it is necessary for me to withdraw this I will, but I do not think it is beyond the bounds of where I should go-that the few vestiges of respect I had for the seven men of this institution have now totally disappeared.</PARA></TALK.START>

I would be the first to admit that this sort of discussion is a discussion of prime importance in any true democracy. As Senator Baume said earlier, Australia has the honour of being one of the world's few real democracies. Before I concentrate on the few remarks I intend to make referable to this matter, I must say that Senator Chipp delivered a somewhat emotional speech, which is not unusual for him. He began with the suggestion that Senator Baume, who led in this debate for the Government, had been defending the right to lie.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I take objection to that. I do not believe that anyone on this side of the Senate chamber or, indeed, on the other side of the Senate chamber would want to defend the right to lie. I believe that that is a totally unfortunate and irresponsible statement to make. Indeed, there are many tens of thousands of Australians who spent the years between 1939 and 1945 defending the sort of society we live in against a circumstance that had been built out of a legacy of lies. I hope that in future Senator Chipp and those who think along his lines will pay a little bit more attention to what they are implying when they suggest that A, B or C is defending the right to lie. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought that Senator Chipp and his party had done extremely well out of the electoral system he now abuses. I am quite surprised that he should be so abusive of a system in which he finds himself, for good or for ill, likely to be in significant control of the government of this country. That is quite a system. His party received 6 per cent of the votes and has five members of the total of 180 odd for the two Houses and yet he can control the Government. Indeed, in justification of the existence of that sort of circumstance, Senator Chipp and the men he leads will have a magnificent opportunity to vindicate the enormous responsibility they hold by still aligning themselves with the Government as against the Opposition in the proportion, I believe he said, of something like 2,400 to 100. If that is so, the post-July period will be a fine opportunity for Senator Chipp to prove the sort of responsibility that I know he will be so anxious to prove. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that however far we may range in this discussion this afternoon, the catalyst of this proposition was the turning out by the High Court of Australia of the petitions of the Australian Democrats and the Australian Labor Party to the High Court relating to misleading election advertisements. It is worthy to recall that that decision was unusual in that it was a unanimous decision-seven to nil-and that it included, of course, at least one justice who had significant experience in the political field and consequently in the field of political advertisements and in the promotion of political ideologies. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MQ7">Senator SCOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I certainly shall give his judgment that respect. I thought it was worthy of comment that he should have seen fit to have come to the conclusions that he did. I suggest to the Senate this afternoon that we are making a little too much of this proposition. Unfair and unrealistic emphasis is being placed on political advertisement. But I believe that the Australian people are a practical people and that the judgment observed this fact. I believe that the Australian people are interested in basic political, philosophical positions and that they will not be taken one way or another by a lot of gimmicks. They will not be side tracked down this way or that because of an unfortunate tendency, wilful or not, in the presentation of a matter. If the sort of thing we are talking about this afternoon were to resolve itself and there was a massive attempt to make a lot of tight, legal bands to control political advertisement then election results might be found in the judgment and jurisdiction of the courts, rather than in the electorate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Surely the very meaning of a democracy is that the decisions are made by the people and not by the courts. I suggest that it is almost impossible for this Government, or for any government, to devise sets of rules which are so watertight and so neat, that they can clearly define those areas which, in the promotion of a political party and philosophy, are unfair or untrue. So many things can be taken out of context and so many things can be distorted that the law that would control this would cover an inestimable measure of paper and be subject to goodness knows how many interpretations. So conceivably there could be an almost impossible situation in which election results were constantly before the courts and in which the people might well ask themselves whether they had any capacity to make a decision. To design laws to prevent misinterpretation may be a total impossibility and an impingement, in the final resort, on freedom of speech which is one of the basic elements of the society in which we live. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, of course, it is a fact that in a democracy like Australia there are an enormous variety of issues in an election campaign. As one moves from one area to another naturally different emphases are placed on different elements of that situation. Senator Baume has referred to controlling the sale of soap. He suggested that no similarity existed between that and selling a political philosophy. I reiterate that circumstance. We are not selling toothpaste; we are selling a political philosophy and to bind that down by a lot of tightly conceived laws is a virtual impossibility. I think that Australians would recognise-certainly I recognise-that they have the capacity to determine the credibility of this or that policy. Surely that is the very basis of the educational system in which we grow. Not only is it to develop a measure of technical excellence, and to produce engineers, lawyers and doctors but also hopefully, it is to produce people who have a desire and a capacity to amass and analyse facts and to come to logical conclusions. If that is the objective and the ulitmate result of education, then we do not have to fear the capacity of Australians to analyse the propositions that are put in front of them. I believe it is very little less than an insult to the intelligence of the average Australian to suggest that a whole embroidering of tiny, minute legal situations should be developed to control the way in which a philosophy is put to the people in the political circumstance of an election. </PARA>
<PARA> The media in this country is another safeguard against distortion. It is, of course, not always responsible and not always totally constructive in its attitude to many things but at least it creates an inquisitiveness in the Australian community which is in itself a very great safeguard. In this circumstance I think we might well remember that point. I am not entirely certain whether this debate has been engendered by hysterical reaction to a court decision, whether it is a sour grapes situation or whether it is, as I hope, a genuine attempt to indentify a need to look constantly and consistently at the electoral system and at the Act under which we operate. If that is the program then the Government has, at this time, that very matter of analysing the Commonwealth Electoral Act in hand. </PARA>
<PARA> So far as I can ascertain there are no provisions for controlling misleading advertisements in a political circumstance in countries such as Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom or the United States of America. It has been suggested that some advertisements in some States were misleading, but at this stage I will not enter into whether or not that is so. I merely suggest that that sort of misleading circumstance is one of which the socialist parties are certainly guilty. For instance, Mr Hayden as Leader of the Labor Party at the last election, said on 5 October that, quite clearly, by mid-1981 the price of petrol would be 45c a litre. On 6 October, the next day, he said that by the end of the year inflation would be about 12 or 13 per cent. In fact it was 9.1 per cent. Are we to regard that as dishonest or misleading? I think that the electorate would have analysed that suggestion and come to some very sensible conclusions. In mid-October, on two days running, in relation to the unemployment situation, he made the rather extraordinary claim that by the New Year half a million people in Australia would be unemployed. That proved to be an insufficient stab and the next day he said that one million people in Australia would be unemployed. If we look at the sort of circumstances that have been promoted by the socialist parties, it can be suggested that there has been a real measure of distortion. I conclude on this point-The sense of the Australian community is such that it can analyse and does analyse the situations that arise. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are debating the inadequacy of the law relating to political campaigning and advertising. It is a big topic, but I focus solely on the nature and extent of the problem of dishonest and misleading advertising and what might be done about it. In that respect I will follow the example set by Senator Chipp, but in deference to the sensitivities of Senator Scott, and no doubt because of my own more desiccated legal personality, I will be a little less emotional in the way I put the argument.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no doubt that the problem of deception in political advertising is big and getting bigger. Politicians of all kinds are rarely averse to stretching and bending the truth to suit their party advantage. That fact must be acknowledged. It must also be acknowledged that election campaigns are never chivalrous affairs. But I believe that it has only really been during the 1977 election campaign, and in particular the 1980 campaign, that the technique of the 'Big Lie' can be said to have become, at least for one side of politics, the political norm. There have been many examples of this phenomenon. Some of them have been canvassed by Senator Chipp, others by Senator Gietzelt. But I believe that the most clear cut and absolutely unarguable example of this phenomenon, and also unquestionably the most politically devastating in its effect on the ground, was the wealth tax advertisements with which the Liberal Party peppered the media, especially the print media, in which it outspent the Australian Labor Party by at least 30 to 1, on our estimates, during the last federal election campaign. The particular statements that were contained in the most familiar of these advertisements are describable in no other terms than those that I have used. One such advertisement states:</PARA>
<PARA> Labor's 'Wealth' Tax threatens the unwealthy family. </PARA>
<PARA> Labor is committed to a new tax which would hit middle-income earners just as violently as the wealthy. This so-called 'Wealth' tax would steal the savings of people who, through superannuation, insurance policies and small investments, have attempted to provide for their old age or their children. </PARA>
<PARA>The advertisement states further:</PARA>
<PARA> If you sell your house to buy another, even if your house has only increased by the value of inflation, then you would pay a Capital Gains Tax on that. </PARA>
<PARA>This is an absolutely unambiguous example of the blatantly dishonest political lie. In an editorial in the Australian of 19 March it was stated that in politics there is no such thing as the absolute truth. That may be so, but in politics there is such a thing as an absolute unambiguous lie. The advertisement from which I have quoted is a classic example. The truth of the matter-this needs to be put on record because there is still some misunderstanding about it-is that the commitment, if there is any, written in the 1979 federal platform of the Labor Party is in quite different terms. It states that the party's commitment is to:</PARA>
<PARA> Enhance the equity of the tax system by taxing large accumulations of personal capital above a floor level that is reviewed regularly and takes into account the special circumstances of farmers, small businessmen and aged people, and excludes the normal holdings assembled over a lifetime by persons and family units. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very different proposition, which speaks for itself, from that advanced in the text of that advertisement. Moreover, during the course of that campaign, in the series of statements and announcements of the actual election platform on which we were fighting and which would govern our actual behaviour, and which commitments in the platform we would introduce over the life of this Parliament, there were, of course, numerous statements from the leader of the Labor Party that we would not introduce in the life of this Parliament a wealth tax in any form whatsoever because, among other things, we saw the necessity for data to be gathered and equity considerations to be pondered by an appropriate commission or committee of inquiry. No one was in any doubt as to the foundations, in terms of the truth or lack of it, of that particular Liberal Party advertisement. In an editorial in the Age of 14 October it was stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . there is no excuse for outright dishonesty in election advertising and speeches. </PARA>
<PARA>and</PARA>
<PARA> These advertisements . . . are unworthy of a party seeking to govern the country. </PARA>
<PARA>On the same day in the Australian Financial Review it was stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the Government-</PARA>
<PARA>has attempted to pin on the Labor Party proposals which it simply is not putting forward . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I dwell on these matters because I think it is important to appreciate when we are debating this topic the nature of the claims that we are making about what needs to be curbed in the public interest. We are not talking about statements of belief, opinion or intention; we are talking about statements of fact which are demonstrably untrue. This advertisement is just one example of them. </PARA>
<PARA> The question before us is whether the present law is adequate or inadequate to deal with misstatements of this kind. In short, the position is that the law is simply not adequate. That much was amply revealed in the context of section 161(e) of the Commonwealth Electoral Act by the High Court decision a few days ago. Unlike Senator Chipp, I do not impugn the High Court for that decision. I happen to think that it was correct as a matter of law. The decision was that because of the way in which that particular section was drafted, it had no application to advertisements designed to influence a voter's choice as between parties and candidates, and that the only application it had was to advertisements designed to mislead voters in giving effect to that judgment or choice-in the way in which they recorded their vote when it came to the business of voting. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Chipp says that the Western Australians fall within that narrow definition.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He may do so. That is a matter for argument. On my own analysis of the Court's decision, I think it was probably right in reaching the conclusion it did, not on the basis of a consideration of the actual advertisements put before it by either the Labor Party or the Australian Democrats, but simply as an abstract question of law. But the significance of this decision is to point up what is a spectacular vacuum in the law as a result of that, I think legitimate, interpretation. The vacuum is partly filled, perhaps, by section 52 of the Trade Practices Act which has some application to misleading or deceptive advertising but only when it is at the instance of corporations which, of course, political parties usually are not, and only when it is in the course of trade or commerce. That means that advertising agencies or media corporations could themselves be liable for publishing misleading political advertisements. But there are other defences in the Trade Practices Act, and it is obvious that this is not a terribly satisfactory vehicle for any direct attack on the real root cause of the malaise-that is, the activities of the political parties which sponsor this misleading nonsense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Similarly, the law on libel, which is often called in aid in this sort of debate, is simply not appropriate, not apt to deal with what can be described as advertisements impugning the integrity of, or misstating questions of fact in relation to, political parties or groups of people as distinct from particular individuals. The libel law does have a particular application when it is individuals who are misquoted or misrepresented but it does not usually apply to political parties or larger groups as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> The big question to which I think we have to address ourselves-it has been raised over and over again in the Government senators' remarks-is not just whether there is a gap in the law, because I think that would be acknowledged, but rather whether there should be a law at all in this area and, if so, of what kind. Of course, the Fraser Government-the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), his ministerial echo, Mr Newman and his various acolytes who have spoken here today all say no. They call in aid the principle of free speech. They say that that principle is entitled to be given and especially robust application in the political context. They also call in aid the intelligence of the Australian voter, who they say is perfectly able to distinguish between truth and falsity in political advertising. Indeed, they say, it is an insult to the intelligence of the voter to suggest otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not surprising that the Fraser Government feels rather self-satisfied, even smug, on this issue. It is no wonder that Senator Peter Baume and Senator Scott find it convenient to accuse the Opposition of sour grapes on this question when one considers that the conservative parties are able to outspend their opponents by about three and one-half to one and that in the process they have demonstrated that they have only about one-tenth of the scruples of their opponents. When they have had a successful election result by applying those particular tactics and expenditure, they are not likely to acknowledge in this forum or any other that there are very many deficiencies in the electoral system. </PARA>
<PARA> But their protestations in principle, of the kind I have mentioned, ring rather hollow. Free speech, for one, has never been regarded as an absolute value any more than civil liberty values such as freedom of assembly have been regarded as absolute and unqualified by any other consideration. The High Court of Australia said in the James case in 1936, for example, that free speech does not mean absolute free speech; it means free speech qualified by considerations of the law of defamation, sedition and matters of that kind. The law of fraud is another obvious example that springs to mind. As the Age put it rather succinctly in its editorial recently, there is no threat to free speech here. The only people to be threatened are those who resort to trickery and lies to get their votes. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, I do not see any legitimate ground for saying that consumer protection principles which are acknowledged to be appropriate elsewhere are inappropriate or indeed insulting to be talked about in this context. The truth of the matter is that sophisticated advertising packaging can mislead not only the gullible and the naive but also those of ordinary or above average intelligence and information. That is particularly the case when one side is able to saturate media outlets completely with its particular point of view. I make the further point that the absence of law in this area does not mean that there will be in fact an absence of regulation. One of the phenomena that we have had to contend with in the past is that even without going to court there has been the question of media proprietors themselves imposing their own often rather double standards on the advertisements submitted to them. I think in particular in this respect of Mr Murdoch who in 1975 demanded the withdrawal of a series of Labor Party advertisements. One stated: 'We know that a Liberal Government will dismantle Medibank. What about the things we don't know?'. Another read: 'We know the Liberals are going to dismantle the Australian Legal Aid Office. What about the things we don't know?'. We were forced to withdraw those advertisements until we could produce detailed documentation to support those assertions. It is not treatment, I suspect, which was meted out to the Liberals in the context of their wealth tax advertisements of the last campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> The question is not whether there should be some kind of law. I think that is unarguable. The really difficult question is what kind of law there should be in this area. In the very short time available to me, I have no more opportunity here and now than to offer anything more than a simple checklist of what I would regard as the relevant elements in an appropriate law in this area. I suggest five such elements as a basis for future debates, and there will be future debate on this topic. In the first place I think any such law should be confined in its operation to the pre-election campaign period. A breach of the prohibition should enable an action to be taken in the course of the campaign to stop dishonest advertisements-but not after the votes are in. That is mainly for practical reasons relating to the management of this kind of litigation which were I think at the heart of the recent High Court decision in the section 161 case. The difficulty here lies in testing the truth of the assertion that the effect of an advertisement was to influence 600, 900 or 300 votes, as the case may be. That is-I think I agree with Senator Peter Baume's suggestions to this effect-an almost impossible task. I do not think that is an appropriate business for the courts to be looking at. So, the law should be confined to the pre-election period. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point is that the prohibition should operate only against advertisements and those in the electronic media as well as the print media; there is uncertainty in some of these areas at the moment. It certainly should not apply to speeches, comments and statements of the kind that are delivered in the course of a campaign by politicians and reported as such. Thirdly, the prohibition should apply only to statements of fact and not to statements of belief, opinion or intention. It should apply to those statements of fact which are untrue or incorrect and are intended, or likely, to mislead or deceive voters. The fourth point is that the enforcement mechanism should be by way of injunction, if court orders are necessary to stop offensive advertisements in this way, or orders to compel the publication of corrective advertisements. A further appropriate remedy might be a declaration by the court or tribunal in question as to what is or is not permissible, a declaration which might be sought by media proprietors in advance when they are uncertain as to the propriety of a particular advertisement. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, while to the extent that judicial orders might be necessary in particular cases, and might be constitutionally required if judicial-type orders like injunctions are to be made, and while the federal court to that extent should have some jurisdiction in this area, I believe that there ought to be a permanent electoral commission which would have the basic task of making determinations in this area, a commission with a composition agreed upon by all parties, as Senator Gietzelt and others have said, and which might, in addition, have a series of other functions in relation to public funding and disclosure in election campaigns. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition this afternoon has raised in the Senate as a matter of public importance the question of the adequacy of the law relating to political campaigning and advertising. I think the debate has been very valuable for a number of reasons. It has enabled the airing of a number of issues and I think it has given us all an opportunity to put our view on a very wide number of topics. It has also been revealing by showing the attitude of some of the speakers. A large number of subjects has been covered. Senator Evans confined himself virtually to the subject of misleading advertising, but a number of other issues have been raised by speakers and notably by Senator Gietzelt who proposed for discussion this matter of public importance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Gietzelt's speech raises a number of questions as to intentions and what is desirable in political campaigning and advertising. I would like to move, in the limited time available to speakers in a debate such as this, through a number of the points that were raised. I will try to cover as many of them as I can. It is not possible to cover all of them. It is certainly not possible to cover, in detail, the five points raised by Senator Evans, the immediately previous speaker, in just two minutes at the end of his 15 minute speech. Therefore, if I do not address myself to all of the issues he raised it is not that they cannot be debated or there is not some value in debating them and in looking for what might be positive aspects; it is simply that he raised so many points so quickly that time will not permit for them all to be dealt with. That is not to say that there is not something to be said about them. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to deal first of all not with the subject of misleading advertising but with two other major isues which were raised initially by Senator Gietzelt. I shall come to the subject of misleading advertising later. The two major issues raised by Senator Gietzelt related to the establishment for certain purposes of a joint parliamentary committee on electoral reform and to the subject of disclosure of donations to political campaigns. Senator Gietzelt was very critical of the Government for not having set up a joint committee on electoral reform in view of the fact that it is known and has been announced by the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) that a comprehensive review of the Commonwealth Electoral Act is currently under way. One hopes it is nearing completion. A joint committee is one way of reviewing the situation. It is always the prerogative of the Government to move to review any sort of Act including an electoral Act. I have to admit to some disquiet and a little jaundice in my views on what Senator Gietzelt proposed. Firstly, Senator Gietzelt was a member of a Labor government for three years. I do not recall his advocating when his party was in government that it ought to set up a joint committee in which members on both sides would have the opportunity to comment on electoral reform. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3E4">Senator MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator. I am not suggesting nobody did. I am suggesting that Senator Gietzelt, who thinks that it is such a good idea today and that somehow this Government is reprehensible for not setting up such a committee, had an opportunity which he did not choose to rise to. The fact is that the Labor Party's actions on this matter are not very good. I refer to the New South Wales Labor Government's activities on the subject of inquiries by parliamentary committees. A joint committee was set up by the New South Wales Parliament to conduct an inquiry into the public funding of election campaigns. Its terms of reference were pre-emptive. The terms of reference were:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To inquire into and make recommendations on the introduction of a system involving public funding of campaigns for elections to the Partliament of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA>As has already been mentioned by a previous speaker, the Opposition in the New South Wales Parliament initially participated in, but eventually boycotted, the sittings of that joint parliamentary committee set up by the Labor Government because the terms of reference were being interpreted by the committee as a means of determining the type of scheme that should be set up and not whether such a scheme should be set up. In fact, there is evidence in the form of public opinion polls that there are massive objections by the public to public funding of election campaigns. The latest Australia-wide gallup poll on this subject showed that 70 per cent of those interviewed opposed public funding of election campaigns. In New South Wales 71 per cent opposed it. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless that parliamentary committee has now reported, having conducted what the Opposition in New South Wales alleged was a biased inquiry. The Wran Government has announced that it intends to legislate, regardless of public opinion on that subject. So Senator Gietzelt's protestations, as a Labor senator from New South Wales, on the subject of how public opinion ought to be being sought through joint committees ring a little hollow. His own party's performance on the issue in both the federal sphere and the State sphere is not good. I think that must be the kindest comment one can make. </PARA>
<PARA> On the subject of the disclosure of donations, Senator Gietzelt did indeed wax loquacious and make some dramatic statements. He certainly conveyed to the Senate, and I am sure to anyone who was listening to his speech, the feeling that he considered this to be a very important matter and that donations should be disclosed. He referred to scandals-that was his word-in other countries, such as Italy and Japan, that have been brought to light because of a link between funding of political parties at election campaigns and policies pursued by governments in office. I must admit that at that stage I was waiting to hear about an Australian scandal. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Gietzelt said that we would be foolish to believe that the fact that private individuals, groups and so on can donate to political parties and political campaigns does not lead to corruption in Australia. He said that he knew of some instances but, unfortunately, could not prove them. He raised one issue that he said he knew had happened. Unfortunately, he could not produce the proof. Of course, one always has to treat with some discretion the raising of issues under parliamentary privilege in the Senate on matters one knows but cannot prove. One would be making an allegation one cannot substantiate. On occasions there may be good reasons for using parliamentary privilege but the use of parliamentary privilege should be treated with caution. </PARA>
<PARA> What was this enormous scandal that so agitated Senator Gietzelt and exercised his mind to such a degree? It was the fact that he knows but cannot prove that the Shell oil company used to fund the Australian Democratic Labour Party. That is some scandal! I was shocked and dismayed when I heard that. Really that is not a scandal at all. I do not know about and I certainly could not prove anything in favour of or to the contrary about the funding of the DLP by any oil companies, but it does not amount to a scandal. That was the only example Senator Gietzelt could give. If he claims that there are reasons to believe that private funding of political parties and campaigns in Australia leads to corruption, to use his own words, he ought to substantiate his claims in some way. But even the example he gave in no way goes towards substantiating an allegation of corruption by government in Australia; that is, the donation to a minor political party for whatever reason the donor may have had. </PARA>
<PARA> One remembers, however, that the ALP derives a large part of its funds from trade unions. One also remembers a promise made by the ALP to certain trade unions in 1972 when accepting campaign donations not to have penal clauses in industrial legislation. It is up to the ALP to decide whether it is going to be open or secret about what are its promises to trade unions and what sort of favoured treatment it will give to trade unions in general or to a particular trade union when the Labor Party is in government. I do not think anyone who votes for the Labor Party is under any illusions about its close links with the trade union movement. Nobody would be surprised if in general terms it favours the trade union movement in some way. However, it seems that direct promises in relation to campaign funds are not all on one side of the fence. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we ought not to be at all shy about the reason for the Labor Party's suggestion that there should be a disclosure of public funding. Of course, this is not necessarily to argue against public funding but we should not be shy about the reason why the Labor Party has done so. Far from uncovering these corruptions that are alleged-not one scintilla, word or even opinion is forwarded to substantiate that allegation of corruption-the Labor Party's aim is to reduce the funds available to the Liberal Party and the National Country Party. The Labor Party is certain of base funding from trade unions. It is known as a trade union party, so it does not have to worry about any sort of connection. The Labor Party is only concerned to make sure that fewer funds are available to other parties. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Baume, in leading for the Government on this subject, pointed out that there are a number of good reasons why one ought to take care on this subject of the disclosure of public donations or proposals for it. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that there are donors who could face retaliation, threats or harassment on account of campaign gifts. It is also clear that disclosures of names of donors to parties could lead to a substantial decline in voluntary contributions to campaign funds. Some people might just wish to remain anonymous for reasons that are in no way sinister because they like to preserve the anonymity of their own political views. They have to live in the community and they have to live with a variety of people with a variety of beliefs. To force people to declare that they are prepared to make some sort of financial contribution to one party or the other is not a solution to any problem at all. I still remain to be persuaded that the problem exists. Certainly Senator Gietzelt, who was advocating this line most forcibly, did not persuade me that the problem existed. </PARA>
<PARA> In the very small amount of time left to me today I will spend some time looking at the subject of misleading advertising and what it is claimed may or may not be able to be done in that regard. Of course, the great difficulty lies in determining what types of amendments could ever take place. The High Court of Australia, in its decision, recognised that some issues are not proper for adjudication by the courts and are matters for adjudication by the electorate. That is the present situation. It is certainly a safe way to leave the matters to the good sense of the Australian people to determine for themselves. What would such an amendment cover? Would it cover facts, opinions and beliefs? Senator Evans said that in his opinion it would not. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out to the honourable senator that there was an occasion on which a certain advertisement was used in support of a candidate of his party against Mr Jack Birney, a Liberal member of parliament. All that was necessary was to reprint an extract from Hansard and put a suitable political caption on that extract. People cannot be prevented from showing beliefs, intentions, opinions or whatever in the Parliament. As long as Hansard can be reprinted-it can be reprinted quite freely; I am sure Senator Evans would not want to suggest that it cannot-and can be used in that way one cannot effectively give the safeguard that Senator Evans said he would like to see. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, there were some complaints about the way the Labor Party was dealt with in relation to the wealth tax. I shall run through very quickly some of the public statements that were made over a period by the Labor Party on the subject of capital gains taxes and wealth taxes-subjects about which it was very distressed and about which Senator Evans was so distressed this afternoon-in relation to the last election campaign. In December 1979, the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Hayden, said:</PARA>
<PARA> Unequivocally, I have committed my organisation to a capital gains tax, a resource rental tax, a levy on domestic oil producers, a number of initiatives in the taxation area and other measures of that nature. </PARA>
<PARA>In March 1979 he said:</PARA>
<PARA> This tax-on 'capital gains'-would be levied on the difference between the amount the asset was bought for and what it was sold for. </PARA>
<PARA>In a speech to the National Press Club in March 1979 Mr Hayden said:</PARA>
<PARA> We're in the process of refining this proposal, but I say quite bluntly that we won't retreat from it. </PARA>
<PARA>Even though further things about inquiries and so on were added, together with what was a clear statement of policy by the Labor Party in relation to capital gains, stated over and over again by key spokesmen of the Labor Party, it was not until the election campaign that they said that the measure to which they were committed would not be introduced before 1983. It is a case of the truth hurting the Labor Party. It did not like the debate on its policies, and it squealed when the Australian people clearly indicated that they did not like the Labor Party's policies. Mr President, the time for debate has concluded, and I therefore move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unlike the previous debate, this Bill is largely uncontroversial, and the Opposition states from the outset that it does not oppose the legislation. However, there are some comments we want to make as there is a difference between the legislation and the views of the Public Works Committee. The Bill seeks to make certain changes to the Public Works Committee Act enabling the Joint Statutory Committee on Public Works of the Parliament to undertake a wider range of inquiries. It will also extend the ambit of the Committee to include statutory authorities, with a group of exceptions which are set out in the Bill. I think it is proper that the statutory authorities should come under the jurisdiction of the Public Works Committee Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is probable that, at least to some extent, works of the National Capital Development Commission could have been brought within the ambit of this Committee for selective inquiry. I am not suggesting that every work carried out by the NCDC should be examined in this way but, given the nature of the Committee's work, some authority ought to be given to it to indicate which works it would like to examine. The NCDC carries out substantial works, and it would not be unreasonable for the Committee to examine such works as it determines. As an example I point to the High Court building in Canberra, which could well have done with some parliamentary scrutiny before it was built. I do not wish to enter the debate about whether it is a good design or a bad design, or even about its location. However, I think it would have been of some value if the Committee had had some input into the project before construction began. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also extends the Committee's ambit to work overseas but not to overseas aid works, and I am not sure of the wisdom of that. Given that the Committee's work load is extremely heavy, it is probable that it would not be able to carry out inquiries on such aid works. I think we ought to pay tribute to the Public Works Committee because it undertakes with great diligence an onerous task. I am concerned, however, that in respect of overseas constructions the legislation limits scrutiny to that which can be carried out within Australia and does not allow any form of site inspections, even on major projects overseas. In recent years at least two projects were the subject of considerable controversy and extreme expense, and I point to two embassies, one in Tokyo and one in Paris. I saw the embassy in Paris when I was in France some three years ago, and I agree with the comments that considerable improvement could have been effected had a proper scrutiny of the design and construction been carried out and had a site inspection been properly conducted. I am not suggesting, of course, that the whole Committee would necessarily be sent on a jaunt to do that, but means could have been found whereby an inspection team could have been delegated to make the necessary comments upon such a major construction work. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that public scrutiny should be extended, and it is my belief that the Public Works Committee is a valuable mechanism for airing publicly issues of government policy. Far too often the Fraser Government likes to keep things hidden from the Parliament and, most importantly, from the public. In that context I quote from an editorial in the Canberra Times on 13 December 1979, which stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Parliamentary Committee system, whatever governments might think about it, provides the only method by which thorough public scrutiny can be brought to bear on the activities of the Government . . . In committees, Members are able to give the most workmanlike examination of the proposals before them and have the opportunity to examine relevant experts in the fields of inquiry as well as testing the basics of the propositions put before them. Such examinations are among the major guarantees of the electorate that Parliament does not become a mere rubber stamp for the Executive Government. </PARA>
<PARA>All of us who have been involved in the committee work of the Parliament would attest to the veracity and importance of that editorial. We want to see more of that work, not less. To the extent that this legislation extends the range upon which the Public Works Committee can operate, obviously it enjoys the support of the Senate. I mention the matter of this Government's deliberate and calculated slashing of public works expenditure. A table prepared by the Parliamentary Library shows how expenditure has fallen since 1974-75. Both capital works and services expenditures, based on 1974-75 values, have fallen by about three-quarters from $1,200m to $272m in the last six years. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the table prepared by the Parliamentary Library. </PARA>

<PARA>The hypocrisy of the Government's policy becomes clear when it is realised that, just as the Government is reducing its own expenditure, it is pushing the States into providing massive infrastructure facilities for the resource development that is taking place in Australia. In effect, the Government, while cutting back on its own expenditures, is transferring the economic responsibility to the States at a time when I and the members of the Australian Labor Party believe that a strong central co-ordinating hand is needed. There are grave consequences in the way this is operating. </PARA>
<PARA> I now return to the Bill. Another area about which the Opposition is concerned is the ability to exempt certain bodies. I am not saying whether they should be exempt by regulation. I think whether organisations are in fact to be exempt should be spelt out in the Act. The examples given in the notes are Trans-Australia Airlines and Qantas Airways Ltd. I wonder whether that ability extends to Australia Post and to Telecom Australia. I draw attention to some activities in that area because organisations and statutory authorities are specifically exempt. We have had debates ad nauseum on industrial disputation in the Parliament. Such disputes are not all caused by pig-headedness or by such other causes to which Government members often refer in parliamentary debates. Some buildings, however, so I am advised, expecially exchanges for Telecom built over recent years, will be, if they are not already, causes of industrial problems. They are built without any consideration of the effect that a lack of proper amenities can have. This is an aspect about which I believe, if we are concerned about improving industrial relations, the Public Works Committee could well have some investigative powers. The most important feature of the Bill is that works undertaken by statutory authorities are, as defined, to come under the jurisdiction of the Public Works Committee. It was obviously an absurd situation that the Government could circumvent a proper parliamentary examination of works progress by setting up a statutory authority. To the extent that we have extended the work of the Committee, that is to be supported. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter I wish to deal with is the Government's rejection of a proposal contained in the latest annual report of the Committee. This proposal-I have discussed this matter with my party's representatives on the Committee-specifically calls for the extension of the powers of the Committee to enable it to inquire into much of the capital expenditure of the Commonwealth Government, especially that of the National Capital Development Commission. The Minister for Administrative Services, Mr Newman, or his representative in this place, has a duty to explain in detail the reasons why the Government has rejected this recommendation, as I am led to believe that it was the unanimous view of the Committee. I can see no good reason why the National Capital Development Commission should not be included in the provisions of this Act, as has been proposed by the Public Works Committee. There has been no rational or suitable explanation given to the Parliament, either in the House of Representatives or in the second reading debate in this place. Here in Canberra we have a model developmental project taking place on a continuing basis. It is the only place in Australia where we can say that we have a planned and the best endowed city in the whole of Australia so far as financial resources and technology are concerned. We should be looking at this body very carefully. It should be under the influence and the surveillance of parliamentarians because many other forms of development emulate the pattern set in the Australian Capital Territory. One therefore can wonder why there is this exception to the rule. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I wish to say a few words about the rejection of the Committee's findings. It is clear that the Committee's recommendations should not be dismissed without reason by the Government. This rejection occurred. I remind the Senate that in respect of the $40m Australian Defence Force Academy, the Committee, again in the non-partisan way in which it operates, was prompted to state that in this case the Government's action 'appears to disregard the Parliament, and indeed appears to attack the basis of the parliamentary committee system'. How pious was the Minister's rhetoric when he spoke in the Parliament when introducing this Bill in the House of Representatives. Honourable senators should bear in mind that I realise that the Minister in this place in fact only restates the original Minister's words. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation continues a policy of strengthening the parliamentary system. The Government has yet to explain why it is prepared to spend some $40m on the Academy against the recommendations of the Committee. I think the Public Works Committee, therefore, should continue to express its views on these matters and try to persuade the Government to its point of view. The Public Works Committee Act therefore should contain a provision to ensure that when a government is inclined to reject recommendations of the Committee full and adequate explanation should be given to both Houses of Parliament. The Public Works Committee has played a valuable role and I hope that role will continue and will be expanded in the future. I hope the Committee can take some consolation from the fact that it has made some progress in persuading the Government to enact this piece of legislation. The Opposition supports it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The Senate is dealing with the Public Works Committee Amendment Bill which will introduce many amendments to the Public Works Committee Act. I was pleased to hear Senator Gietzelt say today that he and his party support these amendments, even though he expressed some concern about some areas. I will express concern about some of these areas also. These amendments will give the Public Works Committee greater flexibilty-if I may put it that way-and greater effectiveness than it has had in the past because it will take on a much expanded role with regard to scrutiny of public expenditure and of public projects. This is something which the Public Works Committee has been requesting for quite some time. I commend the Government and the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) for at last bringing in amendments to this Act and expanding the activities of the Committee because the Bill will now bring the works of statutory authorities, which in the past were exempt, instrumentalities, and other bodies as well as overseas works into scrutiny.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having said that, I must say that scrutiny of overseas works will be done in Australia. The Committee will be limited to some extent with regard to its inquiries, but nevertheless this limitation upon an inquiry will not adversely affect the Committee in the sense that it will not be able to look at proper expenditure in relation to projects. Perhaps I should give an explanation of the activities and the structure of the Public Works Committee. It is a committee which has been set up for many years within the Federal Parliament. It was established, as I have said earlier, to have public scrutiny and to allow the public to give evidence to the Committee on any projects above a certain costing which were to be established throughout Australia, and until New Guinea became independent it also included Commonwealth expenditure in Papua New Guinea. The Committee is made up of members from both parties of the House of Representatives and likewise of senators from both parties within the Senate. So there is a joint parliamentary committee made up of senators and members of the House of Representatives from the major parties represented in the Federal Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Gietzelt has said today that the Committee is non-political, and I agree with what he has said. It is a committee made up of politicians, but from the time I have been a member of this Committee I have been impressed by how non-political that Committee has been. There are many occasions on which people from the Opposition may have been opposed to some matters and they have had the support of certain Government members of the Committee. I think one great example of that was in relation to the Australian Defence Force Academy, when, after a long inquiry, the Committee brought down a unanimous decision opposing the establishment of a defence force academy. I mentioned earlier that any projects estimated to cost a certain amount would have to come before the Public Works Committee. In 1969 the ceiling was raised to $2m for any project, but of course with inflation and erosion, today we find many more projects are coming to the Public Works Committee than in the early 1970s. One of these days, with the expanded activities and the limitations of time which the Committee has, it may be necessary to reconsider this $2m figure. I hope that that will not be in the immediate future. Of course, the Committee has been extremely busy in the last two or three years in particular because of the greater number of proposed works which may have cost $1m in the past but which may cost $2m or $3m today. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also pleased to see that by this legislation the Minister has given the Public Works Committee some control over another type of expenditure over which scrutiny by the Public Works Committee was by-passed. I refer to projects for which the initial expenditure is less than an estimated $2m but which, because of more and more of the project being phased in over a period, finish up costing well in excess of $2m. Such projects never came under the scrutiny of the Public Works Committee. I am delighted to see that the Minister has made provision for that in the Bill. I quote verbatim from the Minister's second reading speech:</PARA>
<PARA> It is understood that the Committee was particularly concerned with cases where major works costing over $2m have been phased in over several years with small projects, that is below $2m. These projects have either escaped committee scrutiny, or if referred to the Committee, have been referred at a stage where proper Committee investigation has been pre-empted by the work already done . . . I have assured the Committee that should it wish to examine any work below $2m the Government would treat any request sympathetically, and would facilitate Committee investigation of any such work. </PARA>
<PARA>I agree that that is only an assurance given by a Minister on behalf of a government. I would like to have seen it spelt out clearly in black and white in the legislation. It is one of those very difficult areas because there are occasions when a project starts with an estimated cost of $2m, but within two years, because of circumstances, there may need to be additions to it. To try to cover every aspect in the legislation can cause many mechanical problems. In view of the Minister's statement and with the watchful eye of the Public Works Committee, I hope that when a justifiable request is made to the Minister, he in turn will treat that request sympathetically and facilitate Committee investigations of such work. There has certainly been a need for that in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> The question might be raised as to why the Public Works Committee becomes so concerned about the need for scrutiny of certain public works. As a South Australian I can give you, Mr Acting Deputy President, an example of the need for such scrutiny of projects. At present, extensions are being undertaken to the navigational facilities for Adelaide airport, including a new control tower. I knew the area and I knew of the need for a certain type of building. As a member of the Committee, I became very concerned about not only the type of material proposed to be used in the building but also about the design of the building. I raised strong objection to the materials as well as to the design. Fortunately, I had some support from members of the Public Works Committee. I must mention one senator in particular who gave me magnificent support. I refer to Senator Jean Melzer, who stood by me. We fought and we delayed that project for six months before finally the departments agreed that our design was right and that we had every right to stand up for what we thought was the right type of material. I have no regrets about that delay other than wishing the departments had been quicker with their response so that we could have avoided the delay. Our demands were justified, which was clearly seen later. I mentioned that as an aside to give one example of the effect that the Public Works Committee can have upon certain projects. One could give many such examples, but this is not the place to give a history of the Public Works Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pleased that the Bill makes reference to statutory authorities, which in the past have avoided public scrutiny. Now many of them will come within the ambit of this legislation. As Senator Gietzelt said, some authorities which are concerned with trade or which compete with private enterprise will be exempted from the provisions of the proposed Act. I accept that. There are reasons for many of the exemptions. Nevertheless, all of those exemptions will still be subject to parliamentary inquiry because they will be made by regulation. The Parliament will still have control over the exemption of any authority. I accept that the Parliament House Construction Authority should be exempted because it has parliamentary representation on it. It is the Authority responsible for the new and permanent parliament house for Australia. I accept that exemption because the Authority has parliamentary input and involves parliamentary responsibility and discussions. But I am concerned that the National Capital Development Commission has been exempted, firstly, because it does not allow for any inquiry by the Canberra community. It does not allow any input whatsoever. I think it essential that the citizens of this fair city should be allowed to have some input into the various projects that are being undertaken in Canberra. I am certain that if that had happened in the past, Canberra would be a much better place today. I am certain that some of the mistakes of the NCDC would not have been made if, firstly, its operations had come under the scrutiny of the Public Works Committee and, secondly, the citizens of this city had been given an opportunity to have their say as to what they thought certain buildings should be and the reasons they should or should not be in certain positions. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to refer now to former Senator Reg Wright. When he was a member of this place he expressed concern that the NCDC saw fit to put a ring road around Capital Hill. Many honourable senators expressed a lot of concern about that. Through the initiative of former Senator Wright, legislation was eventually introduced. We now have what is known as the parliamentary triangle which flows out from the peak of Capital Hill and over which the Parliament has control. Until that legislation was passed, the Parliament had no control; only the NCDC had control. Certain steps were taken only when the scarring for the new road appeared around Capital Hill. Many feared that the road would affect a new parliament house. I am concerned about that aspect although I am aware that new section 6B of the Act will enable the Government to prescribe certain works of the NCDC as public works which will come under the scrutiny of the Public Works Committee. Of course, those works could be very limited, and their scope depends upon what the Minister and the Government see as public works within the ambit of the operations of the NCDC. I think that the assurance given by the Minister in his second reading speech should be read into Hansard. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government can assure the House and the Committee that should the Committee wish to examine any specific work of the NCDC, the Government would treat any such request sympathetically and would facilitate Committee investigation of any work. </PARA>
<PARA>I am pleased that the Minister was prepared to make that statement which is now recorded in the Hansard record of this Parliament. If there are times when I feel that the Public Works Committee should be inquiring into certain projects, I can assure the Senate that while I am a member of the Committee I will make sure that it makes requests to the Minister to enable it to undertake such an inquiry. If the Minister refuses to give us this facility, I hope there will be enough members of the Public Works Committee prepared to stand in their places and let their displeasure be known. I think there is a need for this Parliament and the people of Canberra to have some say in the building projects taking place. I will not refer to certain buildings in Canberra although I could refer to buildings which I think are very poor. One does not have to go very far from Parliament House into a satellite area to find buildings, not very old, that already are showing rust from reinforcement rods. To me there is a question mark over why such buildings were allowed to be placed as they have been. One questions whether quality control was as strictly adhered to as should have been. I do not know. There has been no inquiry so one can only see the stains on walls. I mention this to express some of my concern. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned earlier that the Committee can look at overseas projects. While dealing with that matter I will refer to Norfolk Island where the Committee inquired into the proposed new airport. In the terms of this legislation, many of the works on Norfolk Island undertaken by the administration itself will be exempt from this legislation. I agree with that. As is the case with the Government, these administrative bodies should be given responsibility for their own areas. Nevertheless, any of the Commonwealth buildings to be built in those areas will still come under the responsibility of the Federal Parliament and the scrutiny of the Public Works Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to say that I am very pleased also that the Minister has seen fit to include in the legislation power for the Committee to sit in private if it considers that action necessary. I do not like the habit of committees just willy-nilly sitting in private; I think that committees should operate in public as much as possible. But there are occasions when a committee to be fully effective needs to close the doors, even for half an hour, to give witnesses an opportunity to expand on very sensitive subjects. I am glad we had this provision in the Act. I hope that as we go along future public works committees will not abuse this facility but will use it to become more effective. I am concerned that, sometimes, in camera sittings can be counterproductive and detrimental to the full purpose of a committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very pleased to support this Bill. I am very pleased that the Opposition has given its full support. The Opposition, through Senator Gietzelt today, has expressed some concern at the legislation. Likewise, I express some concern. I myself would have liked to have seen a few more matters included in the legislation. Having said that, I am thankful that at last we have made quite a deal of progress with regard to the powers of the Public Works Committee within this Act. We cannot expect to get everything at once. I only hope that, with the co-operation of the Ministers, the Bill will now allow us to become a more effective committee than was possible in the past because of the limitations under the Act. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Amendment Bill 1981, associated with which is the proposal to disallow a determination of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission or, in the initial instance, of the Public Service Arbitrator. This is yet another piece of Fraser Government legislation dealing with industrial relations. The Government has had many pieces of legislation dealing with industrial relations since it came to power. None of this legislation can be pointed to as having any particular demonstrable success in solving the industrial relations problems of this country. One would have thought that after six years the Government would be able to point to what it might call the milestones in its policy development in an area as important as industrial relations. In this area the Government can only point to a series of tombstones which have made the situation much worse.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What the Government sought to make as an area of importance for its own policy development and was concerned to develop as a bandwagon has in fact turned out to be a hearse. This legislation is yet another example of that fact. I do not want to dwell too much on the funereal analogies which I have drawn today. I wish to point out some of the basic inconsistencies in the Government's attitude on these matters and to indicate the Opposition's strong rejection of the legislation, for some of the reasons I will indicate in detail. I have often said in this place that confusion over industrial relations in the Fraser Government goes back a long way. It has always been recognised by the present Government that there are certain things which are effective in industrial relations. They were described by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) as Leader of the Opposition in 1975. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Our view is that satisfactory industrial relations depend ultimately upon the attitudes of mind of people in industry. </PARA>
<PARA>I might say that sort of statement applies to the Australian Public Service as well as anybody else. The Prime Minister then stressed the importance of what he described by stating:</PARA>
<PARA> Attitudes of mutual respect, of willingness to listen, to understand, to reason and discuss in an informed way, are essential. These attitudes cannot be created by any party's industrial relations policy. </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister is quite right about the latter statement. </PARA>
<PARA> What this legislation is all about is who shall determine the salaries and conditions of employment and so on for members of the Australian Public Service. More particularly it questions the legislation as it fits in with the existing Determination 509. It also concerns matters of reallocation of staff and the termination of employment in the Australian Public Service. The question of the termination of employment is always a delicate subject to handle in relation to employee-employer relations. It is a question which should be handled, one would think, with a good deal of sensitivity. However, one of the great tragedies of this Government's industrial relations policy is that in the context of chronic community concern about the tenure of employment, the method of termination of employment and the sort of recommendations contained in the report of the Myer Committee of Inquiry into Technological Change in Australia, whatever one thinks about the merits of that report in a more general sense and the recommendations which the Committee described as the social safety net recommendations, there is not a chink of light from this Government about its willingness to deal with those issues which are of fundamental importance to employment relations. </PARA>
<PARA> No one can argue fairly against the fact that ultimately it is the Government's right to lay down the broad parameters of the way in which the Australian Public Service will be administered and the way in which changes will be made in the Public Service. The sad fact is that very few changes have been made in the Public Service, very few new directions have been given to the Public Service by the Government, and very few new visions, if I may be so bold as to use that word, have been given to the Public Service in respect of the way in which it might perform its work. So there is a sort of vacuum in the whole of the industrial relations scene about, particularly, the question of the termination of employment. </PARA>
<PARA> The debate which took place in the House of Representatives centred very much on the attitudes and comments of the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr Viner), who was responsible for the passage of the Bill. It is interesting to note that what the Minister did in that debate was to pretend that the disallowance, as has happened on this occasion, by the Government of a determination of this kind was something which happened with almost monotonous regularity in Australia and was not a matter to which great importance could be attached. The Minister said that there was a similar disallowance as recently as 1973-more than seven years ago. Clearly if it is in fact seven years since there was a similar disallowance this sort of action is not something which should be taken lightly. In 1973 the then Opposition opposed a four-week annual leave determination which had the support of the government of the time. That piece of enlightenment by an Opposition which in this place sought to be a sort of Bonnie Prince Charlie Government in exile and pass judgment on the existing Government's decisions about those matters has been aborted, as it were, by the passing of events and four weeks leave is now accepted in Australia as a standard for employees generally. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has cited on several occasions the frequency with which the power to disallow determinations or ordinances has been exercised. It is instructive to look at how often this has in fact been done. It has in fact been done on three occasions since the legislation was enacted-in 1927, in 1929 and in 1932. Those occasions were prior to the incident to which I referred a moment ago. The last time the Government disallowed a determination of an arbitrator was in fact nearly 50 years ago and it was during the Great Depression. There is no doubt about the powers of the Government to take the action but the powers have laid in abeyance unused by governments since the Depression. It is interesting to note that the power to disallow was the subject of a recommendation in the report of the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration, which is known as the Coombs Commission. Recommendation 245 states that the Government's power to disallow a tribunal's determination should be removed. I take it that the main reason for that recommendation was one of certainty. The report of the Commission states:</PARA>
<PARA> Disallowance has occurred on four occasions only and the procedures in meeting the provisions under this section involve an unwarranted use of resources. But, more importantly, it seems to us to be wrong in principle for an arbitration procedure, whether in the public or the private sector, to be qualified in this way and it is at variance with the way arbitration awards are viewed in the private sector where the employer has no right of veto on arbitration awards. </PARA>
<PARA>Although recommendation 245 was said in May 1980 to be under consideration by the Government, clearly it is no longer under consideration. What the Royal Commission is really saying is that society is best served by a system which provides some certainty for employees in respect of terms and conditions of employment. In pointing to the private sector it acknowledged, as it has always acknowledged, that an employer has a right of appeal from an arbitral decision to an appeal bench of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and so on. But the Royal Commission was pointing out that an employer has no power to change the decision of an arbitration tribunal once it has been given. The consequence of what has happened on this occasion is that the employer, the Australian Government, having allowed the matter to go to arbitration, has then said: 'We do not like the decision and we as the employer are going to change that'. </PARA>
<PARA> The real issue is not the Government's power to take the action. It clearly has the power and it is clear that the Government could at any time use its numbers in both chambers to disallow an award, for example, by amending legislation, as it is in fact doing in this legislation with a resolution accompanying it from the House of Representatives to disallow Determination No. 503. What really is in issue here is why the Government seeks to overthrow the decision of an arbitrator which the Government supported until it found itself in disagreement with the determination. Once again that goes to a basic question of certainty in relation to the development of a system; certainty in relation to the determination of rights. The Minister sought to justify the Government's view that it could overthrow the decision of an arbitrator-clearly it can; however, with some degree of industrial morality-by saying that the Government's disapproval of the determination must be seen 'against a long history of irresponsible and persistent union activity opposing the CERR Act'-the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act. It is extraordinary justification for the Government to say, on the one hand, that because there has been union activity opposed to legislation which the union movement really was not consulted about and does not like and, on the other, because of some quite different action against the substantive legislation, there is reason for rejecting the arbitrator's decision in this matter, as the Government is doing. It is pretty sloppy logic. Union activity in this regard clearly is relevant. The simple fact is that the Government is not disallowing some union determination. It is disallowing the determination of a supposedly independent tribunal; a decision which the union movement clearly accepted and a tribunal which it is usually enjoined to go before. I refer, of course, to the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, a body which the Prime Minister has always been keen to refer to as the umpire. Many honourable senators will remember those passionate appeals for 'A fair go in Australia', 'Take your decision to the umpire', 'Come on, Aussie'; and all that sort of stuff which one gets from the Prime Minister from time to time. What happened, of course, was that following union dissatisfaction with existing determinations, in this case and in respect of these matters, the Prime Minister specifically exhorted the unions to go to the umpire. I want to quote to honourable senators what was said in one of his famous Sunday fireside chats in his Address to the Nation on 22 July 1979. He made this great rhetorical appeal:</PARA>
<PARA> I again ask all working men and women to stand up for your own rights. You can support arbitration-that is your right. You and your workmates can see that the union also supports arbitration. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no need to strike. No need to disrupt work. No need to damage yourselves, your industry or Australia. There is a better way-conciliation and arbitration-the way of the umpire. Australia needs your support. </PARA>
<PARA>That is an extraordinarily colourful and flamboyant injunction by the Prime Minister, if I may say so. It is a very eloquent expression, if not almost somewhat inflammatory, I suppose one could say. The slogan, of course, is: 'Do not strike. Go to the umpire'. But, in this case, sad to relate to people who may be asked to listen to those sorts of words again from the Prime Minister, when the umpire gives its verdict the Prime Minister and the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs say that the tribunal's determination is no good because of union activity and therefore has to be rejected. So, if I can put it in simple terms, which an old footballer like Senator Bonner who is sitting over there will understand, you play a game, play it according to the rules, the umpire gives a decision and then, if I may use a colloquialism, you drop him. That is precisely what has happened in relation to this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, Senator. Let me put it this way: The considered deliberations of an independent and highly respected body, deliberations which took place over 31 days of proceedings and producing 1,500 pages of transcript before the Arbitrator, are overturned summarily because the Government does not like the decision, because of the Government's reaction to the union claims.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's expressed rationale for disallowing Determination No. 503 and for removing power from the Public Service Arbitrator to make determinations under the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act is simply to be found in the Prime Minister's words. Determination 503, he says, has the effect of altering Parliament's intention. I must say that Parliament's intention when the Act was passed was pretty vague on the particular subject matters involved. Of course the Senate will recall the very long time which elapsed before it was indicated by proclaiming the legislation that Parliament had any intention at all. As I said, the view of the Prime Minister is that the determination had the effect of altering Parliament's intention. The Full Bench of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission-the umpire; the Prime Minister's umpire-considered this point at some length. The Public Service Board put the same submission to the Commission as the Prime Minister made in his defence of subsequent actions. It argued that union claims would render inoperable the Act's intentions. The Conciliation and Arbitration Commission rejected the arguments, as set out on page 8 of its decision, and said that the Determination would 'not be out of accord with the redeployment and retirement Act'. Not only are the Commissioners the umpires but also they are the experts in some ways. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting I had been speaking about the disallowance by the Government of the determination of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission relating to the Public Service. The point I had been making was that although the Government clearly has power to disallow determinations it is a power which has been very infrequently exercised in the past. But that is not the issue. To blame the disallowance of this particular determination-that is, by this piece of legislation-effectively on trade union activity generally, as if one can deliver a particular punishment in respect of conduct generally which one does not like, is spectacularly wide of the issue. What is at stake, of course, in these proceedings and in relation to the Government's action, is the question of the credibility of the Arbitration Commission as an effective agent for setting standards and having the confidence of both parties which appear before it in an industrial dispute situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Might I put it in these terms, that if one believes that the Arbitration Commission is not a credible agent for resolving disputes of this kind, then the parties to a dispute can appear before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission for many days in order to get a solution to a dispute and say: 'Well, we don't like the decision, so we will get rid of it'. That is not the way to deal with the general issue of the credibility of an Arbitration Commission decision. The real way in which a Government should handle this matter is to grasp the nettle and say: 'We do not believe that these sorts of proceedings are appropriate'. In a sense, of course, it has said that in respect of this particular matter, but the way in which it is being handled is by an attack on the whole system of arbitration which is something the Government so consistently seeks to uphold. </PARA>
<PARA> The confidence in that system is undermined when there is no commitment from the Government to the rulings of the Arbitration Commission in relation to the Public Service. Once again, the adventures of the Prime Minister in the area of political philosophy which were displayed in December last year stand in ironic contrast to his actions in respect of this matter. I repeat that the Prime Minister believes that society is healthier when responsibility, enterprise and power has spread widely throughout the community rather than concentrated in one or a few places. So he and this Government support the devolution of authority to an independent umpire in many ways. They support devolution as a matter of Government policy, as I understand it, and certainly that is a matter of much rhetoric in this Parliament. They support the devolution of authority to the Arbitration Commission as an organ to deal with industrial disputes. The tragedy is that the iron fist inside the velvet glove, if I can use that expression, is quick to reveal itself when the Government happens to disagree with the determination of an independent tribunal. We see the reality of the Prime Minister's belief as against the rhetoric when he uses numbers in Parliament to redirect power which has resided undisturbed in an independent tribunal for almost 50 years and redistributes that power back into the hands of the Cabinet. We have heard numerous instances of the sorts of things in which the Government says it believes in relation to these matters. In summary, let me say this, that the action of the Government in relation to this legislation and to the determination undermines the principle of the arbitration system in the sense that it shows that when the principle which is so much espoused does not suit, we can resort to total expediency as a way of getting around the principle. It is an extraordinary proposition for a Government which indulges in so much high sounding waffle about its philosophical commitments to principle. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall illustrate this in another way. I think it is unkindly said of Scotsmen that they never let principles interfere with their purse. This Government never lets principles interfere with anything which it particularly wants to do. I said earlier that the whole question relates to purported changes in the Public Service. We, as an Opposition are not against change in the Public Service. There are many things which need to be done with the Australian Public Service in terms of flexibility and the capacity of people to move in and out of the Service to gain fresh experience and fresh insights. There needs to be a capacity for people to move between departments and instrumentalities of the Government. Tragically, none of those things have happened under this Government. Australia is now moving into a period where, more than ever before, there will be demands on the Public Service in terms of rapid social change and rapid change in employment relationships and conditions in the work force such as we have never known before. Great demands will be made on the Public Service in relation to those matters. There is no evidence of the Government having done anything about these questions. Instead of introducing the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) legislation and so on-there is no evidence of this-the Government should be giving serious attention to the questions of portability of superannuation in and out of the Public Service and to questions of flexibility of movement of people within the Public Service and other Government instrumentalities and outside into industry and back again. Very little attention has been given to these most important considerations and very little attention is being given to the matter of introducing methods of voluntary retirement in the Australian Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned earlier the Myers Report on Technological Change in Australia. In the view of many people this is not a satisfactory report about that particular question. The one matter in that report which bears close examination in a time of rapid social change and changes in the work force is the notion of the social safety net which the Myers committee discussed at length in terms of provision of adequate pay, severance pay for people who are forced out of work by technological change and so on. None of these issues have been dealt with either in relation to private industry or in relation to the Australian Public Service in respect of which the Government is the responsible employer. These are the sorts of matters one would look for as coming from a Government which was prepared to face the future. When I say 'face the future', I do not mean next week or the next by-election or something of that kind which is what this Government understands by future. I am speaking of the future as the remaining years of this century. These are the things which a Government ought to be doing and ought to be considering rather than the sort of proposal which is before the Senate now. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, may I reiterate that the greatest iniquity, if I can use that very moral term, about this piece of legislation and about the disallowance, is simply that a Government and a Prime Minister can say to people and particularly members of the Australian work force: 'Look, you must not disrupt this country in any way. You must not disrupt this country by strikes and go slow campaigns and things of that kind. What you have to do is to go to the umpire which we are good enough to provide you with. The Arbitration Commission constitutes an umpire. You can go there and get a fair decision which will be in your interests and in the interests of society.' The Government's action in relation to this matter completely negates that principle. What will happen from now on will be similar to the occasion when the Prime Minister gave his pompous advice about going to the umpire, as he did in that famous July 1979 narration. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> There is no need . . . to disrupt work. No need to damage yourselves--</PARA>
<PARA>A patronising piece of advice, I would have thought-</PARA>
<PARA>your industry or Australia. There is a better way-conciliation and arbitration-the way of the umpire. Australia needs your support. </PARA>
<PARA>This is high sounding rhetoric, meaning nothing, out of the mouth of a man who, when it suits him, says: 'Look, I am sorry chaps, we do not like the umpire's decision. We are going to upset it.' That is precisely what has happened in relation to this particular matter. It happens to involve members of the Public Service who are employees of the Government in that sense. The fact of the matter is that the principle goes far beyond the Public Service. The principle, as it is developed under this Government, means that people who listen to that sort of advice can have no confidence or trust in it. That is very disrupting and very damaging to the fabric and morale of a society, particularly to the morale of a work force which is so frequently exhorted to work harder in the interests of Australia. That is the problem with the legislation. A basic criticism of it is its fundamental hypocrisy. It is for those reasons that we oppose it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -Late this afternoon I was not entirely sure whether the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Button) was totally convinced of what he was promoting, but since the resumption of the debate he has convinced me that he now shares a real conviction in what he is promoting. We are debating the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Amendment Bill 1981. It is a Bill which relates, as a number of Bills coming through this place do, to an area of industrial relations. As such, it is a Bill of great significance. In this country, if and when we succeed in solving significantly the problems that relate to industrial relations, then and only then will we move towards fulfilling the capacity that we have as Australians-as individuals, as organisations and associations in this country and last, but certainly not least, we will do so in the public and national interest. Until we recognise that the solution to these industrial relations problems and the smooth and co-operative working of industrial relations is basic to the achievement of success for all the people in this country, in some measure we are floundering.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Button referred to what he described as the confusion of the Fraser Government in industrial relations. Industrial relations is a difficult and in some measure confused area, but I guess that our predecessors in government had a more disastrous circumstance and achieved probably the greatest measure of industrial unrest in the history of this country. I hasten to say that I am absolutely tired of hearing talk about the level of industrial unrest, regardless of whether that talk comes from honourable senators on this side or on the other side of the chamber. It is about time that we became mature and responsible enough to recognise that the solutions to these problems are of absolute and total importance to all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe that this legislation contains anything of great horror or dynamic significance. Its purpose is to remove from the Public Service Arbitrator the power to make determinations in relation to matters covered by the Commonwealth Employees (Employment Provisions) Act 1979. That power covers determinations which are referable to the administration and the efficiency of the Public Service. I would have thought that that was a matter of interest and concern to all people within and without the Public Service. The catalyst or the starting point of this amendment perhaps came with the move to disallow Determination 503 which the Government believes unnecessarily protracts the working of the administrative process in the Public Service, it unnecessarily complicates a situation for redeployment and retirement which is clearly stated and I believe, as I shall attempt to demonstrate directly, is a reasonably generous and sensible approach to the problem which is relevant above all things to the efficient operation of that Service, a Service which has a long history and a good name in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Determination 503 was considered by the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) to frustrate the operations and intentions of the Act and since those operations and intentions are relevant to the efficient working of the Public Service, in this case it was seen fit that the Determination should be disallowed. It is not something, as Senator Button has demonstrated, that has been done commonly. It has been done five times since the Commonwealth acquired the power in, I think, 1922. What is the position in regard to redeployment and retirement? What is it all about? In the context of this legislation and in the context of the economy in which it operates, it is about the efficient operation of the Public Service. So it concerns in the first place the public interest. Surely, in the second place, the efficiency of the operation of this Service is in the public interest and it must be in the interest, I believe, of public servants because, after all, we are talking about the effective and efficient expenditure of taxpayers' money. Public servants, like the rest of the community, are significant contributors in the taxation field. It cannot satisfy them any more than it satisfies anyone else in the community to see government expenditure wastefully and ineffectively promoted. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, I think we must concern ourselves with the question of merit in the deployment of a service and in the operation of whatever industry or whatever operation that may be. It seems to me totally wrong that mere non-unionism, rather than merit, should be the yardstick, the guideline. It is blatantly impossible to establish the most efficient operation, the most efficient deployment of labour in whatever industry we may be talking of unless we pay full regard to the merit of those people available for and seeking to operate in that industry. One wonders, if merit is not to be considered, what is the position in regard to freedom? What is the meaning of freedom? What is the meaning of the right to work? Senator Hearn, in her initial address in this chamber a short while ago, referred to the basic importance of the right to work. Is the right to work under current circumstances, regulations and awards to be denied without reference to merit but purely on a question of union membership?</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to another matter that has arisen in the process of discussion of this legislation-a mischievous area in my view, an area in which Australians tend to describe other Australians in a way that creates the divisiveness which Mr Hawke, amongst others, is constantly talking about and perhaps, whether he knows it or not, is attempting to generate. It is mischievous to describe, as Mr Hawke did in front of this Parliament House some weeks ago, the public servants as second class employees. That is mischievous rubbish. Most Australians would agree with that description. Of course public servants are not second class employees, nor should they be. In fact, circumstances which apply to their engagement and work are in many areas of the economy the envy, rather than the opposite, of Australian working people. </PARA>
<PARA> Determination No. 503, the determination which has been disallowed, seeks to give preference to union members. I repeat what I asked earlier: What of merit in this circumstance? What is the relationship of merit to efficiency? Is it not to be considered--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We will be happy to listen to him. There is no shadow of doubt that Determination 503 tends to frustrate and lengthen the process of redeployment and retirement. The very object of the legislation is to allow generous terms of redeployment and retirement to apply in terms of time and remuneration so that the process of increasing the efficiency of the operation is carried out with the least possible damage to those who are directly involved. That is the object of the legislation. This Determination would involve something like 16 months instead of 13 months, at a maximum, and could extend to a significantly longer period-even beyond two years. Quite clearly, that sort of proscrastination, that sort of protraction of the operation, can only help to avoid the establishment of the sort of efficiency that the Government and the Parliament would want to establish and, indeed, that most Australians would want to see established.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Provisions for warning and appeal, which are basically generous provisions, do exist. After all, surely in this circumstance the Parliament has the right to be and, indeed, should be, the final arbiter in matters of administration. That, and only that, is what this legislation is all about. As I mentioned earlier, the pre-conditions for disapproval have been met. The opinion of the Attorney-General has been obtained. His opinion is that Determination 503 is not in accord with the purpose of the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Amendment Bill. Any future change from this point must be effected by legislation. Under this legislation, the Parliament will be, as indeed it must be, the final arbiter in relation to redeployment and retirement in the operation of the Service. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill dates back some years. Similar legislation was introduced in 1976. There intervened not only an election at the end of 1977 but also the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration, which concluded with some specific recommendations which have been adopted in this legislation. It is interesting that Mr Paul Munro, who is now the Federal Secretary of the Administrative and Clerical Officers' Association, was a member of the body that made those recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that it is worthwhile looking very briefly at what seemed to be the reasonable, fair and, indeed, generous recommendations of Determination No. 509, which remains in the legislation. That determination provides for consultation with relevant organisations on redundancy situations. That consultation is to be continuing, reasonable and responsible. It provides for six or 12 months' notice, during which time an employee remains on full pay, when a permanent office is excess to requirements of the Service. There again, I believe, is an obligation which is reasonable and responsible and which may well be described as generous. I believe that the 12 month period applies to people who have given some 20 years service or are beyond the age of 45 years, and a six months period applies to other permanent employees in the Service. So it can hardly be said that redeployment is a rough, savage or off-the-cuff action when that sort of notice and the maintenance of full pay are a pre-requisite of any action at all in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> The Public Service Board is requested continually to redeploy excess staff. That in itself makes the whole operation more gentle-a continuing or gradual circumstance. I believe that that is as it should be. That provision is written into Determination 509, which remains part of the Act. The object of that determination, as indeed it should be, is to minimise the measure of disruption that may occur when, for all sorts of good reasons, people have to be moved to other jobs or other places or even to be retired totally. A further final one month's notice is available to permanent officers who are transferred to a lower level or whose service, for reasons of efficiency or other appropriate and identified reasons, has to be terminated. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for appeals procedures and protection of employees against arbitrary and capricious action. Indeed, so it should. The ACOA sought determinations under the Public Service Arbitration Act to take out of the hands of management its rightful prerogatives for the efficient and economical management of the Public Service as provided under the Public Service Act. It is for that reason alone that we are debating and promoting this legislation at this time. It takes out of the hands of the Government, the Parliament and, in other words, the employer, the right fully to administer its own operation with a view to total efficiency. Of course, those areas of conciliation and arbitration that are referrable to salaries, the length of leave, hours of work and so forth, remain the province of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Much has been said tonight by Senator Button and by others in other places of the decision of the umpire. What fails to be said in this circumstance is that the umpire is the Parliament. In terms of identifying the best and most efficient distribution and administration of the Service, the umpire is the Parliament, the employer, the payer who uses the taxpayers' moneys. This is the umpire. It differs from the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission which, of course, is the umpire in cases of award wages, salaries, leave and so forth. I believe that there is really a misunderstanding or misinterpretation of that situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Act we are dealing with tonight, plus Determination No. 509, provide, as I believe I have indicated in this short time, fair and just provisions for management and staff. There is a proper measure of appeal, there is a proper gradualism and there is a proper capacity for management to achieve the best possible development or deployment of its work force. The Act also introduced the capacity to retire voluntarily at the age of 55 years. This is a useful contribution to the Public Service system. It enables people with perhaps 25, 30 or even 35 years service to move to other fields of their choice and to have a significant superannuation base at an age at which they are able to look forward to a significant and, I hope, enjoyable and different future. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude my remarks by making one or two comments to try to round off the promotion that I have been observing. I suggest that the question is one of administration, not wages and salaries or industrial matters as such. Consequently, the reference to the umpire becomes inappropriate if it is referred purely and simply, as it often is, to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, which of course, is the umpire in the appropriate and apt situations. Members of the Opposition in this chamber and in the House of Representatives are virtually saying that the responsibility for administering the laws of the Parliament should be with the Commission. Surely it is the function of the Parliament to do just that, and that is what this legislation promotes. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me briefly sum up the reasons that I believe apply. (Quorum formed). As I was saying as I approached the final remarks that I want to make tonight, this piece of legislation has developed over a long period in consultation with a wide range of people and with a view to the recommendations of the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration. Its objective clearly and absolutely is to advance the efficiency of the Public Service. I cannot see how Australians, whether public servants or others, can have any argument at all with that objective. It also seeks to cut out the delay-this is important-in implementing redeployment and retirement with a view to establishing a more efficient organism of the Public Service, and that should be an agreeable situation and a promotion which all Australians would want to follow. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is proper that the Parliament on behalf of the Australian taxpayers-as I said earlier, public servants are significant amongst the taxpayer group-should be the final arbiter in determining the objectives of the legislation. The possible frustration and distortion of the objectives could be the reason for this piece of legislation being introduced. The terms which apply to appeal provisions are generous and reasonable. In our view public servants are certainly not, as described by Mr Hawke some weeks ago, second class employees; nor should they be. Public servants are far from that. They are significant members of the Australian community. It only tends to increase, to use the word that Mr Hawke and others seem to love, divisiveness to refer continually to public servants as second class employees and, as many people in this country choose to describe those who wish to exercise the right to work, as scabs. If anything is more conducive to divisiveness than that sort of description, I have yet to hear it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -The Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Amendment Bill 1981, which is before the Parliament tonight, strikes a blow at the heart of the principles of conciliation and arbitration and undermines the authority of the Public Service Arbitrator, whose position was established by this Parliament to be the umpire in matters with which this Bill deals. The Bill is part and parcel of the Government's policies which slowly but surely are leading to the politicisation of the Public Service. I am gradually coming to the view that it is just not worth wasting words on this Government. I want members of the Government to bear that in mind. I am coming to the belief that, in the issues which matter to this country, apart from the issue of foreign affairs and defence, it is just not worth wasting words on this Government. I say that on behalf of the people who have elected me. Two of the issues upon which those people elected me were: Support for the family, and sensible industrial relations policies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Already we have had the promise that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) made in Launceston two days before the election was held that the additional revenues from the oil levy would, from 1 January, be returned to the family. Already we have had procrastination on that matter. On the figures of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) that would return $171m in this half year. The money is flowing in the back door but not out the front door. On the other vital issue of sensible industrial relations, it appears that again the Government is just not worth wasting words on. But action is required. </PARA>
<PARA> If Government members stay in the chamber long enough I will detail to them what I mean about this legislation. Of course, the test of what they think about this legislation lies in the fact that two quorums have had to be called. Let us see how this legislation strikes a blow at the heart of the principles of conciliation and arbitration and undermines the authority of the Public Service Arbitrator, that is the umpire who has been appointed to deal with these matters. Let us see how it does that. Sub-section (4) of this legislation precludes the making of any determination or award by the Public Service Arbitrator in respect of the important matters of redeployment or compulsory retirement of public servants. As Determination No. 503 of 1980 has been disallowed, Determination No. 509 of 1977 is to be read in conjunction with the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act. That is supposed to provide the code which is to be followed in the handling of redundancies and retirement issues. This code will be removed from the arbitration system and will be variable only by legislation. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) in his second reading speech said:</PARA>
<PARA> Its true effect--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the effect of this Bill-</PARA>
<PARA>will be that any future change which might be thought necessary to the code of practice and benefits applicable to the situations referred to will have to be brought about by the government of the day by legislation and thus it will, as it should, make the Parliament the ultimate arbiter on matters relating to redeployment, retirement, termination and other aspects covered by the Act and Determination No. 509 of 1977. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a joke. Does any honourable senator say that we ought to be the final arbiters and that we have greater expertise than the umpire who has been appointed to deal with these matters? Of course we do not. Does the legislation take into account the principles of conciliation that should go into discussions on these matters? Of course it does not. Unless we bring the parties before the bar of the Senate, before this chamber, and have the matters thrashed out here the final arbiter means the use of numbers and nothing else. That strikes at the heart of the principles of conciliation and arbitration. These are matters so fundamental to the future of industrial relations in this country that they deserve better treatment than they received in the House of Representatives and that they are receiving in this chamber. We should not be the umpires. We do not have the expertise for that task. Yet this legislation attempts to clothe us with that power. Of course parliament cannot have the power, but this legislation strips the Arbitrator of the power and attempts to give it to us. In reality what will that mean? It will mean giving the power in relation to these fundamental matters of redeployment and retirement to the Public Service Board or to the departments. I will read again from the second reading speech of the Minister in which he states:</PARA>
<PARA> An important responsibility of the Parliament and the Government is to ensure that the Public Service Board and departments have the appropriate powers to ensure that the services of staff are used efficiently and effectively. </PARA>
<PARA>But this is a matter of employment life and death to a number of public servants. It is the matter of their compulsory retirement. Should that be left solely in the hands of the boss or should that ultimately be left for consideration before an arbitrator and an umpire? I could give many examples but I have only 20 minutes to deal with this whole matter. I will again read from the Minister's second reading speech. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government considers that the provisions of Determination No. 509 of 1977 taken together with the provisions of the legislation are fair, just, adequate and appropriate to protect individuals and to see that they are fairly treated in relation to redeployment and retirement. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, you and other honourable senators must be convinced that that statement is true before we vote on this legislation. I just question whether that is a factual statement. In fact, it is not a factual statement. It is not adequate to deal with the situation. It certainly is not adequate in the opinion of a number of moderate trade union officials who are experienced in this field. That statement certainly is inadequate when one considers the situation of technological change. In no way is it adequate. I again read from the Minister's speech in which he states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Determination requires the Public Service Board to advise the relevant staff association immediately it appears that a surplus staff situation has occurred or is likely to occur, and to provide all relevant details and arrange discussions with union representatives. </PARA>
<PARA>Is that so? If it is, so what? That is why I asked Senator Scott whether he had in fact read Determination No. 503. I will guarantee that he has not read Determination No. 509. Let us see what Determination No. 509 says and let us look at these consultative procedures. Of course, what we are doing is accepting Determination No. 509 as being the ultimate guidelines until we change them. The House of Representatives has disallowed the variations to Determination No. 509 considered by the Full Bench of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission as being most important and worthy in these circumstances. Clause 3 of Determination No. 509 states:</PARA>
<PARA> Where, after the consultation referred to in clause 2 of this Determination the Public Service Board decides that redeployment of any excess staff is not feasible-</PARA>
<PARA>Then formal notice of a specified period is given to the officer or employee that he is excess to the requirements of the service. Nobody else but the Public Service Board has any effective final say over whether redeployment is feasible. That is the sort of consultation which takes place. Of course, there is provision in Determination No. 509 for agreements, but if there is no agreement, it is up to the Public Service Board to make the decision. There is a right of appeal, but it is stated that 'the Committee shall report its findings to the Public Service Board with a recommendation for action appropriate to the case'. The Public Service Board does not want that. It can do what it likes with the findings. So Determination No. 509 is not adequate, as is alleged by the Minister, to cover the situation. His statement is certainly less factual than it should have been in the circumstances I have outlined. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the fact that these procedures are inadequate for situations of automation and technological change which will be faced in many Public Service departments, where the Public Service Board is the final arbiter, not the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and not the Public Service Arbitrator. That is contrary to the express statement of Ministers for industrial relations-Mr Street, the former Commonwealth Minister, and others-in regard to the question of what should occur when technological change takes place. I refer to the National Labour Consultative Council and other bodies to which the Government was a party, and to my time on the Australian Council of Trade Unions' executive, as far back as Albert Monk's day. There were recommendations by successive Ministers for Labour that when technological change occurred three things ought to happen; there should be notification of future technological change, consultation about it, and, if there is no agreement, reference of the matter to the arbitrator. But what the Government is asking us to do in this legislation is to refuse that last step, to deny to the person who should be redeployed, who possibly could be redeployed because of technological change, or even compulsorily early retired, that last step. That is contrary to everything which Ministers for labour have said over the last 15 years. What has the Government to say about that? Let us have a look at the real reason why the Government has chosen to amend this legislation and has chosen to disallow Determination No. 503 which was recommended by the Full Bench of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. I again refer to the Minister's second reading speech in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill arises in connection with the Government's decision announced on 5 February, the day before the Act was proclaimed to come into operation, that the Government would move to disapprove under section 22 of the Public Service Arbitration Act 1920, Determination No. 503 of 1980. </PARA>
<PARA>I also refer to Mr Viner's statement in relation to this Bill which he made in the House of Representatives on 3 March 1981. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . my comments in relation to this Bill need to be seen in the context of remarks that I will be making in support of the motion for disallowance of Determination No. 503 of 1980. </PARA>
<PARA>So we have to turn to the Minister's remarks made during that debate. We did not have that debate here, honourable senators will recall, because the Government has the numbers in the House of Representatives. This is what the Government really said. After all of the hogwash that went on before, this is what it got down to. Senator Scott really admitted that when he spent so much time on this question of preference for unionists. The Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> The determination establishes preference for union members. Such preference is completely contrary to the objects of the Act and to the principle of merit, a principle which is the cornerstone of the personnel management system of the Service. Preference to union members is quite unacceptable to the Government . . . This Government also rejects the concept of union preference.</PARA>
<PARA>That is hypocrisy. In 1977 the Government introduced legislation which all honourable senators opposite voted for to amend the Conciliation and Arbitration Act in respect of waterside workers. On the very issue of retirement, the Government not only gave preference to members of the Waterside Workers' Federation of Australia but also made sure that before they got a brass razoo out of it they had to be members of the Waterside Workers' Federation. That was the Government's legislation. I refer, of course, to the definition of stevedoring operations in the Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Bill (No. 2), Bill No. 124 of 1977, wherein it is clearly stated:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . when that work is performed by a person who is a member, or who has applied for membership, of the Waterside Workers' Federation of Australia;</PARA>
<PARA>It is a case of double standards, is it not? It might be responded by the Minister that we are talking about the Public Service and that we are not talking about the Waterside Workers' Federation. I do not accept that argument, but even if that argument is to be advanced let us have a look at it to see whether the Government in fact is consistent on this matter. I now turn to Determination No. 769 of 1978 which was tabled in the Senate and with which every senator concurred. In other words, it was one of those determinations which nobody sought to disallow. This determination was similar to Determination No. 503 which was disallowed by the Government on the grounds of preference for unionists. This Determination, which was made by the same Arbitrator, Mr Watson, reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Determination 509 of 1977 made on 8 July 1977. </PARA>
<PARA> In the matter of</PARA>
<PARA>The Administrative and Clerical Officers' Association,</PARA>
<PARA>Commonwealth Public Service and others</PARA>
<PARA>Claimants</PARA>
<PARA>and</PARA>
<PARA> The Public Service Board and others</PARA>
<PARA> Respondents</PARA>
<PARA> As varied to date be further varied by inserting a new clause 4A as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Preference in retention, Health Insurance Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> 4A 1. If the Health Insurance Commission decides to retrench officers or employees covered by this determination it shall where practicable (a) as between officers give preference in the retention in employment to members of the Association concerned who are employed under the Determination in the particular area or locality. </PARA>
<PARA>How is that? What can the Government say to answer that? Double standards! The very reason the Government has given to disallow Determination No. 503, it agreed with in respect of the Health Insurance Commission. What double standards! As I said, the Government is not worth talking to. The Determination continues:</PARA>
<PARA>as between employees, give preference in the retention in employment to members of the association concerned employed under the determination in a particular area or locality;</PARA>
<PARA>It is precisely the same. It is of no use for the Minister to talk to the advisers; they will say that it is true. If honourable senators want it tabled, there it is-exactly the same. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Scott talked of efficiency and gave as a reason that Determination 503 should not be approved that it does not have regard to efficiency between a union member and a non-union member. That is untrue. That is why I asked Senator Scott in all fairness whether he had read Determination 503. Even Mr Viner, in his speech when moving for the disallowance of Determination 503, said:</PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the inequity of preference the operation of preference under the Determination would mean that the union member could be retained in employment in preference to a more efficient non-union member. </PARA>
<PARA>I noticed that by the time that got from the House of Representatives to here Senator Messner had omitted that sentence. Of course, he omitted it because clause 11 (3) of Determination 503 states:</PARA>
<PARA> The provisions of this clause--</PARA>
<PARA>That is the preference clause-</PARA>
<PARA>shall be applied in such a way as to ensure consistency with the objects of Part 2 of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>That Act is the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act which, in Part II, states:</PARA>
<PARA> The objects of this Part are-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) first, to ensure, to the greatest extent that is practicable, that each Department and each prescribed Commonwealth authority operates in such a manner as to make efficient and economical use of the services of the persons employed in the Department or by the authority;</PARA>
<PARA>Obviously Senator Scott had not read Determination 503; nor had he read the objects of the Act. I am afraid that we have come to the situation where the Government is burying itself by its industrial relations policies. That does not worry me much, but what does worry me is that it is burying the moderate elements within the trade union movement very quickly indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister, in his speech when moving for disapproval of Determination 503, said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is a great pity that the actions of a minority of public servants and of some of the present leaders of the ACOA have tarnished the proud history of a non-political public service in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>That is precisely what the Government is doing. I warned the Government two years ago that its actions within the Public Service were going to lead to the takeover of the Public Service unions by these elements. I warned the Government that its petty action in chopping off union deduction facilities was going to have the effect of forcing people to drop out of union membership. I warned the Government that its confrontationist attitude to the Public Service was going to throw together the moderates and the militants and was going to mean that the militants would come out on top. That is precisely what has happened-the moderates have been defeated in Victoria and at the Federal level. This Government contributed to that. By this sort of legislation it is continuing to contribute to it. </PARA>
<PARA> It talked about knocking off preference. That again will mean that more and more people will opt out of membership of the associations in the Public Service. That is good for the Government's public relations but it is not ultimately good for the Public Service. I quote from Arbitrator Watson's decision in Determination 769 of 1978:</PARA>
<PARA> It is reasonable to assume that since determinations of the Arbitrator can only apply to members of an organisation, the Public Service Arbitration Act is structured on an assumption of strong union membership. It is true that the Board can by regulation confer determination benefits on non-members, but in my view this is an administrative action which, when taken in respect of a determination, must be as a consequence of and therefore follow that determination . . . There is ample and appropriate precedent from the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and I find nothing in the Public Service Arbitration Act which would prevent the consideration of these claims--</PARA>
<PARA>Those are the ones I referred to previously-</PARA>
<PARA>nor, if they were granted, any inconsistency with either Act. </PARA>
<PARA>It is time the Government woke up to itself. I hope that it takes to heart what I have said because time is running out for it. Worse still, it is running out for the moderates within the trade union movement who are fighting the real battle. If there is a change of Government, or if other means are adopted by unions to ensure absolute preference for unionists in the Public Service, those people who have drifted away from the organisations will find when they come back that they are headed by people who want to politicise the Public Service and are being assisted in that task by this Government. Unfortunately I will have to remind the Government again in a couple of weeks of its lunacy with regard to industrial relations because I know that at the moment there are, in draft form, amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act in relation to amalgamations and other matters which will do the same thing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Bill before the chamber is to remove from the Public Service Arbitrator the right to make determinations in relation to matters covered by the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act. As has already been said, this amending legislation is the result of the Government's decision to disallow Determination 503 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The long debate in the House of Representatives hinged on just who should make these decisions in relation to the effective and economical administration of the Public Service. I believe that responsibility lies with the Government on behalf of the people who put us here. It lies not with outside influences, but with the Government. It relies on the philosophies of the Government of the day. Whichever Government is in power at any time, the philosophies of that Government are put forward. It also ties in with the Budgets of that Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Determinations have been disallowed on four separate occasions. I will go through them. In 1926, Determinations 47 and 48 were disallowed because of budgetary considerations. In 1928, just two years later, another Determination was disallowed because of philosophical as well as budgetary considerations. In 1932, yet another Determination was disallowed, that time because of budgetary and philosophical considerations. The disallowance in 1973 resulted from the philosophy on that occasion of the Senate. Disallowance of a determination is not something new, as has been put forward in this place today; it has been done on four separate occasions. If we look back at who introduced provisions for determinations to be disallowed we find that it was the Labor Party. It was done by the Fisher Labor Government of 1911. Admittedly, it was an old type Labor government which believed that governments-not unions-should run the country. The Opposition today appears to think that militant unions-I stress the words 'militant unions'-should have enough power to force the government of the day to fit in with their way of thinking. That is the attitude of the present Labor Party. The Fisher Labor Government of 1911 thought that governments should have some say in this regard and therefore introduced that provision. </PARA>
<PARA> Having dealt with the philosophy behind disallowances, I will now deal with budgetary considerations. Some of the disallowances were done because of budgetary considerations. I believe that a government should have power over its own Budget and that this should not be left to any outside influence. It is perhaps rare for the Opposition to have any consideration for or interest in budgetary matters because it showed when in government that its interest in budgetary matters lay in handing out money hand over fist. It was the last of the big spenders. The Opposition put forward the same philosophies in the last election, but the people of Australia had had enough and they threw out those ideas, as they threw out the Whitlam Government in 1975. Perhaps we should look at the consistencies underlying the disallowances. Until Senator Harradine spoke tonight, I was under the impression, as I said, that in 1973 the Liberal and Country parties had disallowed in the Senate a determination on the same grounds or similar grounds as the disallowance of this determination when they disallowed a determination that four weeks' annual leave be given only to union members. That was against the philosophy of the Liberal and Country parties. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Harradine put forward tonight a couple of determinations which he says have not been consistent with such a philosophy. I was surprised to find that what he said is apparently correct. I ask Senator Harradine whether the Arbitrator in fact put such determinations before the Parliament. The Arbitrator may, where he thinks it proper to do so, make a determination that, in his opinion, is not or may not be in accord with the law of the Commonwealth relating to conditions of employment of employees in the Public Service. If so, he brings it to the attention of the Parliament. On that occasion did the Arbitrator bring it to the attention of the Parliament? Did the Parliament have those determinations laid before it? I ask Senator Harradine that because I am not aware of their being laid before the Parliament. </PARA>

I am not aware of their being laid before the Parliament. If they were not laid before the Parliament, there is no way the Parliament could have done it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Attorney-General (Senator Durack) has abided by the rules of a disallowance by forming the opinion, and putting that opinion before the Parliament, that it does interfere with the legislation that the Commonwealth has passed. There is very little doubt that this is the fact. It has been mentioned several times tonight that it interferes with the economic aspect. Part II of the original Act states:</PARA>
<PARA> 7. (1) The objects of this Part are-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) first, to ensure, to the greatest extent that is practicable, that each Department and each prescribed Commonwealth authority operates in such a manner as to make efficient and economical use of the services of the persons employed in the Department or by the authority;</PARA>
<PARA>Determination No. 503 extends the periods of consultation and so eliminates, in the opinion of the Attorney-General and certainly in my opinion, the efficient and economic use of the Service. It has been stated previously and it was mentioned by Senator Harradine that unionists must have priority here in any redeployment. I believe that this is not in the best interests of the Public Service. It is certainly not conducive to efficient and economical use of labour. For example, a non-union employee may be far superior in every way to a union member but, as a result of this Determination, he must go for the sake of the union member. For this reason the Government decided to disallow the determination. If we compare Determination No. 509 and Determination No. 503 we find that there are only two areas that really concern the Government. We find that there is an additional three-month period for appeal. Senator Harradine did not mention this in his speech. Senator Button also did not mention it. Senator Harradine said that the Government and the Parliament are not experts in the arbitration area and that we should not even try to make any effort to look after our employees or to determine what is right and wrong. If members of this Parliament have no expertise in this area, if we cannot organise our own employees, we should not be here. If that is true, the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission should be running the place. </PARA>
<PARA> I feel that Senator Harradine has lost all his expertise in dealing with this area. He certainly did not mention the appeals provisions. If the Public Service Board makes any decision, there are areas for appeal in several places in Determination No. 509. Neither Senator Button nor Senator Harradine mentioned that appeal provision. For example, appeals can be made after the permanent head declares that staff are eligible for redeployment. If a person's appeal fails and the Public Service Board decides not only that the person is unable to be redeployed but also that that is not practical, that person has another six to 12 months in which to appeal. I believe that this is quite fair. It allows the members of the independent tribunal to look at the matter. The chairman of the tribunal is to be appointed by the Governor-General and employees are to be represented on the tribunal, as is the department. I believe that takes into account the area in which Senator Harradine believes that we lack any expertise. </PARA>

Let me come back to the main disagreement between the Opposition and the Government on the differences between Determination No. 503 and Determination No. 509. I believe that the crux of the matter is that this Government has disallowed Determination No. 503. I suppose it is a matter of who should bear the responsibility of introducing legislation to fit in with the Government's philosophy or its Budget. Should it be the Government or should it be some outside control whether it be the union or the arbitration system? We on this side of the House, as I said earlier, agree with the action of the Fisher Labor Government which originally introduced in 1911 the Bill that put the responsibility fair and square on the shoulders of the Government, not on outside organisations.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator ought to listen to what I have to say. I said that the last time a government disallowed a determination was in 1932. It was an Opposition that disallowed a determination in 1973. I also found it fascinating that Senator Walters had to go back to 1911 to try to justify the actions of the Government in 1981. I think this legislation has to be seen in the light of this Government's appalling industrial relations policy. The legislation before us tonight represents another low point in that policy-a policy of whatever the trouble, be it unemployment, or inflation, blame the trade union movement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think we should examine the record of this Government in industrial relations. When Fraser came to power in 1975 as the Prime Minister wage indexation was accepted by all parties. Fraser promised to support wage indexation. Two months later, after the election, he argued for partial indexation at the first national wage case in 1976 and the next three out of four decisions went the same way. Certainly this led to the erosion of living standards for trade unionists and their families. As to the Industrial Relations Bureau, I think we ought to ask ourselves what it has achieved. In the two years it has been in operation it has done nothing. It has cost $12.9m. It is a costly mistake. It ought to be scrapped. I suggest it will not be long before this Government scraps it. Section 45D of the Trade Practices Act is now seen by employers and by employees as an irritation and a mistake. I ask honourable senators just to look at the resolution of the Laidely dispute with the Transport Workers Union of Australia. That showed one thing. It showed that a dispute will be settled in the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, not by the Trade Practices Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> Then we had the Staples amendment which was an attempt to curb the independent jurisdiction of individual members of the Arbitration Commission. That was opposed not only by employers and employee organisations but also by members of the Commission themselves. We then saw the Government's attempt to impose a tax on workers' housing concessions which was an arrangement whereby workers who lived and worked in remote areas received a housing concession. This piece of industrial relations legislation, put up by this Government, was opposed by the Premier of Queensland who is not known as a strong supporter of the trade union movement. What happened was that this Government was forced into another humilating backdown. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has conducted a continuous campaign of denigration against the Arbitration Commission and the integrity of the Bench. It has also carried out a campaign against the integrity of the President of the Commission, Sir John Moore. We now have Government threats of secret ballot legislation despite the clear evidence that that will not solve strikes and will not solve industrial disputes. In the past we have been told by honourable senators on the Government side that we ought to have secret ballots for the election of trade union officials. We have been told that if we had secret ballots we would be able to get rid of the militants about whom Senator Walters always talks and that if we had properly supervised ballots then the rank and file would vote out the militants. I think one only has to look at the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia which has been referred to tonight by Senator Harradine. That Federation, I suggest, would have the fairest and most democratic electoral system for officials of any trade union in Australia. I think we all know the result of that and I sure that Senator Elstob would agree with me when I say that the rank and file members of that union do not elect supporters of this Government when there are secret ballots for the election of their officials. In the United Kingdom the Donovan Royal Commission in 1968 looked into trade unions and into employer organisations. That Commission rejected secret ballots. It said they would not work and of course they will not. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we have to look briefly at the facts in this dispute and at what caused this legislation to be before us now. Two unions were involved-the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association and the Australian Public Service Association. They are hardly the sort of hard line militant unions which Senator Walter's had described. They assumed-this was the mistake they made, of course-that the Public Service Board decisions would be adhered to by the Government. The unions involved acted in good faith. They thought that the Government could be trusted. In fact, they were urged by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) to take their case to the umpire, as Senator Button said this afternoon. In this case the umpire was the Public Service Arbitrator. The Arbitrator decided that the unions had a good case. He supported Determination No. 503. But we have the situation where the Government will not abide by the umpire's decision. The Government then turned around and gave the unions out. I think it is worth remembering what Senator Walters said this evening. She said that the last occasion that a government moved to disallow a determination of the Public Service Arbitrator was in September 1932. That was at the time of the Lyons Government. As Senator Button pointed out this afternoon, and as I reminded Senator Walters earlier in my speech it was a Liberal-Country Party Opposition not a government that moved in 1973 to disallow the determination on four weeks annual leave. Such leave, of course, is now enjoyed by practically all Australians. So it is 50 years since the Parliament has been asked to overthrow the convention that the umpire's decision, that is, the arbitrator under the Public Service Act, should not be interfered with. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we have to look at and ask ourselves what this Government is doing toward bringing about better industrial relations in Australia. What is it doing about, say, amalgamation of unions through which there are advantages? We all know that some of the most costly and irritating strikes in Australia today have to do with demarcation disputes; things that would not occur if there were a decent amalgamation of unions in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, if Senator Harradine would stop interjecting I would get to the point. I know he opposes the Labor Party's views on amalgamation. But let me present some statistics about the number of unions in Australia today. There are 147 employee organisations registered under the Federal Act, 117 having branches in one or more of the four States which have a separate industrial registration system. Most of those unions have registered branches operating as unions under State Acts. In my own State of New South Wales alone 124 employee organisations are registered under the Trade Union Act, 113 are registered under the New South Wales Industrial Arbitration Act, and 50 function as branches of Federal organisations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The large number of trade unions in this country does not assist in improving industrial relations, especially when the situation is compared with the contribution made by the 16 unions in the whole of West Germany. Prime Minister Fraser loves to quote statistics on West Germany. He is always lecturing us on the economic success of the Federal Republic. He is always talking about its great industrial record. What he does not say is that West Germany has one of the most sophisticated trade union movements in the world and that we in Australia have one of the most antiquated trade union movements in the world. For example, the Qantas management has to negotiate with 23 separate unions, Trans-Australia Airlines with 21 separate unions, the Australian National Railways Commission with 18 separate unions, and the Australian National Line with 12 separate unions. I had hoped that the Government would have learned a valuable lesson from the Qantas dispute about the benefits of amalgamating unions. I wonder how long that dispute would have dragged on if the management of Qantas had had to negotiate with one union instead of the 23 unions that are involved at the moment. </PARA>

I suggest to him that Lufthansa does not have to negotiate with 23 unions, as Qantas does in Australia. No government in the Western world relies more on union bashing as a tactic than does this Government. It is interesting to note, though, that the Government spokesmen stress this when they are at home, not when they are abroad. A former senator, Sir Robert Cotton, became our Consul-General in New York, and quite often one sees reports of speeches he makes to businessmen in the United States in which he is at pains to point out that Australia's industrial relations are good, that they are not as bad as they are painted in the Australian media.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Bishop reminds me, recently Mr Anthony has been in the Middle East and in Japan. I think it was only this week, in Saudi Arabia in the Middle East, that he said Australia had a good industrial relations record, that it was not as bad as that of the United States and it was not as bad as the industrial disputes record in Britain. The Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr Lynch, continually defends our Australian industrial record, but he does it when he is overseas talking to businessmen, not when he is in Australia. I stress that no government in the Western world uses union bashing tactics as this Government does. I use the words 'Western world' because I believe a free trade union movement is essential to any demoncracy. One of the first acts of any totalitarian government, whether it is a totalitarian government of the Left or of the Right, is to smash a free trade union movement. One has to look only at the events in Poland at the present time to prove that point. It is a wonder to me that the Central Committee of the Polish Communist Party has not called in Prime Minister Fraser in an attempt to put down the efforts of Solidarity in Poland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It would be better for Australia if this Government concentrated on improving industrial relations instead of encouraging activities such as the recent anti-union marches. The marches were designed for one purpose-to pit Australians against Australians. This Government would do well to remember the fate of similar anti-union conservative governments in the past. In 1928 the Government of Stanley Melbourne Bruce introduced a Bill that increased Federal powers in the conciliation and arbitration system. Mr Scullin, the then Leader of the Australian Labor Party, had these thoughtful, and still pertinent, words to say in Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA> The assumption of the Party opposite is that when there is a dispute the workers are always wrong and every set of figures quoted is used as an indictment of organised labour. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask honourable senators: What has changed since Mr Scullin used those words? Of course, the Bruce Government lost the next election and Prime Minister Bruce lost his seat. Sir Earle Page when he was Prime Minister attempted to abolish the conciliation and arbitration system. I think everybody would agree that that was one of the things that led to the downfall of his Government. I am not one of those people who believe that the trade union movement is always right, and I give as an example the recent strike by sewerage workers in Sydney. I agree completely with the remarks made by the Deputy Premier of New South Wales, Mr Jack Ferguson, that it was a very selfish strike. Nevertheless, I ask: How can this Government justify spending $2m on an advertising campaign against the 35-hour week? We have to ask ourselves how many workers in this country now work less than 40 hours. It is a large proportion, and the numbers are increasing daily. One has to look only at the reports this morning of the decison relating to the Altona Chemical complex in Melbourne granting another 850 workers the 35-hour week. We all ought to ask ourselves now long it is since the 40-hour week legislation was brought in. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to refer briefly to part of the present campaign being run by the Government against the trade union movement. It is a campaign against Bob Hawke, and we heard some of it this afternoon from Senator Scott. It is a campaign against Labor's spokesman on industrial relations. It is an attempt to denigrate not only his work as our spokesman on industrial relations but also his previous work as President of the Austraian Council of Trade Unions. I predict that that campaign will fail, and fail dismally. In the past the Australian public gave overwhelming support to Bob Hawke in his efforts to settle industrial disputes, and I am sure that they will continue to support him in the future. I am sure that they will continue to reject the industrial relations policy of this Government. The Opposition opposes this legislation. </PARA>

The Bill omits the existing section 24 (4) and inserts a new sub-section which precludes the making of any determination by an arbitrater or award of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in respect of the redeployment or compulsory retirement of public servants. Does the Minister feel that the clauses of Determination No. 509 of 1977-which, as the Minister said, must be read in conjunction with this piece of legislation-are adequate to enable an employee or groups of employees faced with redeployment or compulsory retirement obtaining redress from a source which ultimately is not the Public Service Board?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think the answer is good enough. We are told that something will be decided with the unions after we have passed this legislation. The legislation will be passed and the unions will have to decide the matter I suppose with the relevant Minister within the guidelines we have determined. It is not satisfactory for a Parliament which does not know what the legislation means to make a law that permits another organisation to interpret it. We are getting back to the stage where the unions control the situation. All we have been told is that the responsible Minister and the unions will fix this matter up. But that will be done after we have passed the legislation. They cannot go too far when the decision is made by us. I understand the Minister for Veterans' Affairs to say: 'I know nothing about the legislation. Please pass this Act because we do not know what it means'. Do we as responsible members of this Parliament have no better reason for passing a Bill than that we cannot interpret it? Is that justification for acting in this way? Are we acting responsibly? I admit that I do not know, but I expect that the Minister from the advice given to him can give us an explanation as to who determines this whole matter and what is meant by the term 'the operation of such qualifications suspended'.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appeal to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) to report progress. I think that that is the only reasonable and sensible course to take at this stage. According to the information provided by the Government, Senator Messner represents four Ministers whose portfolios are: Transport, Business and Consumer Affairs, Capital Territory, and Housing and Construction. Yet he has now been asked to respond to highly complex, complicated questions that Senator Harradine and other senators have asked in the Committee stages about the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Amendment Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the Government wants to show that this Senate is a farce, that the concept of it as House of Review is nonsense, that it does not matter at the Committee stage what the Bill means, let it use its numbers now to force it through and let us be done with it. What worries me is that we will waste another hour of precious broadcast time, while a most controversial matter of the B52 bombers, next on the Notice Paper, awaits debate. I am sure that for the next hour and five minutes listeners to this broadcast would prefer to listen to political parties views on that matter rather than points of order and procedural matters. I appeal to the Minister in charge of the Bill to report progress now-I am not criticising the Minister-until such time as the Minister, who is in charge of this Bill, can attend a sitting of the Senate to answer the questions that have been raised. </PARA>

Tonight he was asked questions by Senator Harradine, particularly about Determination 769 in 1978, which the Government approved. I think Senator Harradine said that Determination 503, which we spoke about tonight, is in practically the same terms, yet it was disallowed. This is a complex question. I do not think that at the moment Senator Messner is in a position to answer the question because he is not even the Minister representing the responsible Minister.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicate to the Senate a problem which I had. As I read the legislation, it provides almost a code in respect of certain matters which become the responsibility of the Government, as distinct from the Public Service Board, and the responsibility of this legislation, as distinct from Determination 509, which the Government says it intends to retain. I wish to pursue a line of questioning which Senator Harradine started. I think that I can best do this by referring the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Carrick) to clause 4 of the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Amendment Bill and asking him: What happens when the employment of a person is terminated after being told by his employer, for example, that he is physically or mentally incapable of performing his work, that he is inefficient in the performance of his work, or that he does not have the necessary qualifications? Is that the end of the road for that employee? What redress does he have from that decision? It is an important question. There has always been provision in the Public Service Act for redress from a termination of employment-indeed, redress in terms of a hearing before an inquiry of some kind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It may be that the answer is completely clear but it is not completely clear in the legislation or in the second reading speech which purports to explain the legislation. The fundamental question in this whole concept is the termination of employment issue. We can all have different views and views of different intensity about the capacity and right of the Government to move employees much more readily than it has been able to do in the past. That is a matter of quite legitimate discussion in which rights are not involved to the same extent. When we get to the question of the termination of employment, rights of the most fundamental nature are involved. It seems to me that the legislation, on the face of it, is not sufficiently explicit in regard to that matter. That is the fundamental question to which I would like an answer from the Minister. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; My questions relate to the nub of the Bill. The nub of the Bill lies in proposed new sub-section (4) of section 24, which precludes the making of any determination or award as defined in proposed new sub-section (7) in respect of the redeployment on compulsory retirement of public servants. Determination No. 503 has now been disallowed, this Bill must be read in conjunction with Determination No. 509 of 1977. The fundamental aspects of redeployment and retirement of public servants will be governed by a code of procedures outlined in the amended Bill plus the code of procedures encompassed in Determiantion No. 509. Furthermore, that code cannot be removed by arbitration; it can be removed only by an Act of Parliament. Therefore, I ask: Does the combination of this Bill and Determination No. 509 provide to a public servant who is to be compulsorily retired on the decision of the Public Service Board redress ultimatley to any authority other than the Public Service Board? Section 16 of Determination No. 509 provides a right of appeal procedure. It sets up a committee which is the right of appeal committee. Sub-section (3) of section 16 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee shall report its findings to the Public Service Board with a recommendation for action appropriate to the case. </PARA>
<PARA>They are recommendations. Under what obligation is the Public Service Board to accept those recommendations? That is the first point I wish to make. The second point is probably even more important and may not have been envisaged by the Government when it introduced this legislation. It involves the issue of automation and technological change. Of course, the issue of automation and technological change, whether it is in the Public Service or in private industry, raises the fear of redeployment and compulsory retirement. As I said in the second reading debate, the Government is on record-there are ample examples of statements by Government Ministers-as to what should occur in respect of automation and technological change in private industry. In essence, it says that there should be notification, consultation, and, failing agreement, arbitration. I ask: Is the Government, by virtue of this legislation, blocking off the final step to its own employees?</PARA>
<PARA> The third and fourth questions do not necessarily relate to the provisions of the Bill but I think the Government ought to answer them. Why did the Government disallow Determination 503 when Determination No. 769, which was tabled in the Senate on 21 August 1979 and which had almost precisely the same provisions as Determination No. 503, has not been disallowed? Why did it take different actions in relation to those Determinations? Determination No. 769 is still in operation so far as the Health Insurance Commission is concerned. Fourthly, why does the Government adopt a double standard in relation to the retrenchment or compulsory retirement of Commonwealth public servants when, as far as waterside workers are concerned, it has enacted legislation-namely, the Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Act (No. 2) 1977-which virtually means that a person working on the waterfront must be a member of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia to be entitled to the provisions of that legislation, which is Government legislation? Those, in brief, are four questions that I can ask off the top of my head. </PARA>

My main concern is who decides the criteria for redundancy. I think the procedures for redeployment or compulsory retirement need explaining. There might be a good explanation. It might fit in if I compare it with the original legislation. Now that we have the promise of some answers, at least we will know what we have to vote on.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition opposes the agreement and believes that it should be renegotiated. I do not believe that the agreement between Australia and the United States Government on the staging of B52 aircraft through Australia should be looked at in isolation. It should be seen as an integral part of the new US Administration's foreign policy strategy, a policy which, unfortunately, is becoming more aggressive and confrontationist every day. I believe that history will judge the Carter Administration on foreign policy much more kindly than did the American voters. I think that, in regard to Australia's foreign policies and interests, the Carter Administration will probably be remembered as the best administration since that of Franklin Delano Roosevelt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think President Carter is to be commended in a number of areas. Firstly, he is to be commended in the area of human rights, particularly in regard to Central and South America. People might think it strange that I should say that but I have in mind the immense pressures that President Carter must have been placed under in Nicaragua. When one looks at what is happening in El Salvador today one sees that it is to his credit that he resisted these policies and pressures. His co-operation with the Socialist International about conflicts in Central and South America meant much closer contact with social democratic leaders like Schmidt, Brandt, Palme and Kreisky. This meant that there was constant European advice which was listened to and acted upon, unlike the present situation where already Canada, France and West Germany have warned the United States on its policies towards El Salvador. </PARA>
<PARA> We had the spectacle of the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) rushing off to America a few weeks ago and appearing to endorse US Policy. We were one of the first countries in the Western world to support the American policy on El Salvador. In our own area of the world, in South Korea and in the Philippines, I think the Carter Administration did not ignore human rights issues. One has only to look at America's actions in the case of Kim Dae Jung to realise that. I think it is interesting to note that the President of South Korea was the first official head of state to visit President Reagan after he was sworn in. </PARA>
<PARA> The United States policy in southern Africa paralleled that of the Australian Government. I think that was a creditable policy especially in relation to countries like Zimbabwe and Mozambique. I think that the role of the former United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Andrew Young, has to be taken into account. His contacts with Robert Mugabe and his wing of the Patriotic Front have proved to be successful. I think anyone who now sees the amount of Soviet support that was given to Joshua Nkomo would realise that in this instance the Americans were right. I think it was Andrew Young who recognised that the President of Mozambique, Samora Machel, was not a Marxist but in fact was an African nationalist, despite the rhetoric that he might have been credited with. </PARA>
<PARA> What disturbs me at the moment is that it looks as if the United States will reverse its policy in southern Africa by giving aid to the rebels in Angola and trying to destabilise the present regime in Mozambique just when I believe that the Prime Minister of Australia, Mr Malcolm Fraser, was about to recognise the regime in Mozambique and to extend diplomatic recognition to it from Salisbury. He was certainly about to re-establish an aid program to Mozambique that was last in existence under the Whitlam Government as a small aid program. I wonder where we will stand on that point. Will we follow Reagan's example blindly? Will we give the United States a positive example of Australia's stance towards Mozambique? Will we be prepared to say that we have a different policy and we will not blindly follow the United States? The fact that five of South Africa's most senior military officers were recently able to spend a week in the United States before they were asked to leave is an indication of an improving relationship between these two countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The relationship between South Africa and the Reagan Administration seems to be improving. Forces led by Jonas Savimbi of UNITA, or the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola, received assistance from the South Africans in the war in Angola. Mr Savimbi is about to visit the United States next week. It is certain that he will be seeking arms. I hope, not because I do not support UNITA or not because I support the present regime in Angola, that he does not get them. I believe that if the supply of arms is continued to the people who are opposing the present regime in Angola the conflict will spill over into Namibia and will not do Australia or any of the Western world any good at all. Rumours in the newspapers this morning indicated that the Reagan Administration intends to invite the South African Prime Minister, Mr Botha, to visit Washington. While these rumours have been vigorously denied, the very fact that they have been printed in the newspapers should concern us. I think Australia's stance must be different from that of the United States in southern Africa. It was recently said here by a spokesman from Nigeria that to be an Australian in present-day Africa is virtually a passport of safe conduct through the continent. We must not allow this standing to be eroded by blindly following United States policies in the area. </PARA>
<PARA> I think another area where the policies of the United States and Australia are bound to differ is in the Middle East. There is no doubt in my mind that events in Iran doomed the Carter Administration. The hostage crisis in November 1979 made the election results of November 1980 entirely predictable. In the US the mood of the people changed dramatically. They felt that the United States had been humiliated by the so-called Government of Iran especially so when the rescue attempt of the hostages was such a dismal failure. I believe that the US voters especially turned to Reagan because he promised to re-establish United States foreign policy as paramount in the eyes of the world. I think it is worthwhile noting that there was one of the lowest turnouts of voters in the presidential election since the 1930s. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the Middle East. We know that the Australian Prime Minister received an award last year in the United States. We have seen him trying to strut the world stage. But the first time he was asked for assistance by the United States, the first time he was asked to take part in strategic naval exercises in the Indian Ocean, he refused. I think we should ask ourselves why. Was it because of National Country Party pressure? Was it because important wheat sales to Iran were being negotiated when the strategic naval exercises were being carried out? Could it be that those naval exercises were being aimed at Iran and at the Gulf? This is something we have to ask ourselves. Again we have been asked recently to take part in a peace keeping force in the Sinai. At the moment the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) is in Saudi Arabia and in the Gulf States on an important trade mission. There is no way he will make a commitment one way or the other about a peace keeping force in the Sinai when he is in countries such as Saudi Arabia. </PARA>
<PARA> I also raise the question of Israel and Palestine. I was very disturbed to see a cutting from this morning's Australian Financial Review. I am glad that Senator Martin from the Government side asked a question on this matter this morning. Peter Robinson, the Financial Review's correspondent in Riyadh, had this to say in part of his article:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Saudi Arabia was looking for Australian support-particularly in 'voting patterns in the United Nations'. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anthony, in an answer that was not in his prepared text, said: 'I believe there is growing awareness and an even-handed policy being applied by Australia'. </PARA>
<PARA> 'I look forward to discussions-particularly private ones-in an attempt to do what we can to solve this painful problem.'</PARA>
<PARA>I just hope that Mr Anthony was not signalling a change in our attitude on the question of Israel and Palestine purely because of trade. I just wonder: Is this the way that we go about getting respect from our United States allies because, if it is, it is no wonder that they deny us information about their activities at the bases in Australia. Also on the Middle East question, I believe the United States is in danger of making the same mistakes in Saudi Arabia that it made in Iran. Giving a country the most sophisticated military equipment does not necessarily guarantee the stability of the regime in that country. If the regime does not have the support of the people, no amount of military equipment, no matter how sophisticated, will keep that loyalty. We should have learnt a lesson from the situation in Iran, and the United States should have learnt a lesson from Iran. It did not matter whether the Shah had F14s, F16s, or F18s, or how sophisticated the equipment was; he did not have the support of the people and the regime toppled. I believe that there is a great danger today that the regime in Saudi Arabia might change. I believe that there is a very strong chance of that happening. We will then have to ask ourselves who will use that equipment, because outside the superpowers at the moment I think Saudi Arabia is moving to a situation where it will certainly have the most sophisticated air force in the world. What will happen then? Will we have another Iran-Iraq type of conflict in the Middle East? I think it is in Australia's interest to be more sympathetic towards Iraq. Here is a country that is moving gradually away from the Soviet Union. It is attaining a leadership role in the non-aligned movement. It is making a natural progression towards the West, expecially as far as new technology-equipment and computers-is concerned. But it is also a country which has no diplomatic relations at the moment with the United States. It is certainly in Australia's interest that we improve our relations with that important country. </PARA>
<PARA> I view with concern the statement of the United States Secretary of State Haig that the Reagan Administration is attempting to develop a strategic consensus to counter the Soviet Union. He went on to say that the United States was looking at a belt of countries that extended from Pakistan to Egypt and that included such divergent states as Turkey, Israel and Saudi Arabia. I think that proposal is farcical. I think it runs counter to all modern political and global strategies and, again, I hope that Australia is able to put to the United States our belief that that strategy will fail. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the Camp David agreement. It would seem to me that the cautious approach that was used by the Carter Administration is now to be replaced by a harder line stance and that the problems of Israel and Palestine will be much harder to solve than they would have been under the Carter Administration. Another area where I think it would pay us to have a much different foreign policy from that of the United States is Vietnam. Recently, as a member of a Senate committee I heard representatives of the Australian Indo-China Refugee Association, certainly no supporters of the present regime in Vietnam, recommend to the committee most strongly that Australia begin a massive aid program to that country. They pointed out to our committee that agriculture in Vietnam at the moment was in such a mess that there was likely to be a massive exodus of refugees in the very near future. While, of course, they hoped that a lot of those refugees would come to Australia, they realised the sort of predicament Australia was facing with unemployment and the economic circumstances in Australia at present. But they did not hesitate to suggest that Australia should give aid to Vietnam. </PARA>
<PARA> I think all of us should realise that the United States policy towards Vietnam, no matter how justified people might think it was because of the conflict that took place, has resulted in forcing Vietnam closer and closer to the Soviet Union. If people are concerned at the present build up of forces in Cam Ranh Bay they have only to look back at the reason why there has been this build up. To whom will Vietnam turn if it does not get aid from the West? Certainly it will turn to the Soviet Union. I do not believe that we can rely unswervingly on the Administration of President Reagan and Secretary of State Haig. I do not think we can expect them always to do the right thing by Australia. I do not believe that the United States will respect a government that agrees with everything that it does. The Labor Party believes that the relationship between Australia and the United States should be based on mutual respect. We believe that an ally should tell a friend when it is wrong. After all, it was the Australian Labor Party that formed the Australian-American alliance. Yet at the moment, if we criticise the United States we get members of the Government jumping up straight away and claiming that we are being pro-Soviet. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the issue of the B52s. I have here a copy of Hearings before the Committee on Armed Services, United States Senate, where evidence was given by General Richard H. Ellis, Commander in Chief, Strategic Air Command, and Director, Strategic Target Planning, Joint Chiefs of Staff. In his evidence there is an expression-SIOP-which stands for Single Integrated Operating Plan which, if one cuts out all the jargon, I believe means all-out nuclear attack. I showed a copy of this document to the Attorney-General, Senator Durack, earlier this evening and I now seek leave to have the two pages incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>THE ROLE OF CONVENTIONAL FORCES</PARA>
<PARA> Recent Soviet activity in Africa and South Asia can be traced, not to a change in our overall conventional force capabilities, but rather to a shift in the strategic balance. The Soviet Union and the Warsaw Pact have enjoyed a conventional advantage over the U.S. and our NATO allies since World II. Through the years, we have maintained a moderate size force with investment keyed to modernization in an effort to keep the historical conventional balance static, as opposed to closing the gap. Today, we find the Soviets using their increased strategic capabilities as a ''nuclear umbrella'' in the pursuit of global activities we were able to deter when we had the undisputed nuclear shield. Because of this, deterrence can no longer be neatly divided into subgroups such as conventional and nuclear. It must be viewed as an interrelated, single entity. </PARA>
<PARA> In response, SAC is developing new options which provide the National Command Authorities (NCA) with additional flexibility to respond to future crises and conflicts in a timely and controlled manner. In addition to nuclear adjustments, we are exploring a range of non-SIOP (contingency) options for SAC forces. </PARA>
<PARA> Participation in these evolving contingency options is not intended to diminish the SIOP mission but to assure the most effective use of SAC resources. Strategic forces are uniquely capable of supporting general purpose force missions. The ability to execute contingency plans and procedures using SAC assets-particularly the manned bomber-markedly improves U.S. war fighting capability. SAC aircraft can provide rapid, long-range force projection in the conventional and theater nuclear areas while retaining their contribution to the SIOP, if so tasked. </PARA>
<PARA> SAC's contingency capability spans a wide range of conventional operations-from rapid force projection to psychological warfare. Let me briefly discuss one small portion of SAC's contingency operations-B-52 rapid force projection-so that you can better understand the extent of this national asset. </PARA>
<PARA> No other weapon system can match the B-52 in delivering concentrated conventional firepower on the battlefield. In the opening hours of hostilities, B-52's, with 30 tons of explosives, can provide timely and effective assistance in disrupting enemy actions. </PARA>
<PARA> The projected conventional battle scenario is one characterized by minimum warning time followed by a massive attack from highly mobile forces aimed at a rapid breakthrough of defensive lines. In this situation, employment timing is critical. Ground forces need all available firepower in the first 48 hours, preferably applied directly on attacking and supporting forces. </PARA>
<PARA> The most timely way to meet a commander's request for B-52 support is to operate from forward area bases which have been upgraded for B-52 operations and have prepositioned war reserve materials. Last December we tested the ability of our B-52's, aircrews and maintenance teams to support such a concentrated effort in a conventional scenario. A B-52H squadron of 14 aircraft from Ellsworth AFB, South South Dakota, was tasked to deploy to Andersen AFB, Guam, as an extension of its Operational Readiness Inspection (ORI). The unit was provided ten hours notice prior to the first aircraft launch. The KC-135 was the only organic support airlift authorized. Fourteen B-52H's (reconfigured from a SIOP mission capability to a conventional weapons configuration) and five KC-135s launched from Ellsworth for Andersen. All deployed aircraft, support equipment and personnel were in place within [deleted] hours. Four hours later, the first B-52H had launched on a sea surveillance, mine, laying, and conventional weapons delivery training mission. During the next five training days, 30 conventional warfare training missions were flown. A similar deployment to Guam was initiated three weeks ago as part of an ORI at Grand Forks AFB, North Dakota, with equally outstanding results. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the current world situation, combat missions could be launched from Andersen to the Middle East, if the need arises, although the distances involved are incredibly long. This points to the critical near-term need for operating bases closer to the Persian Gulf area to support both tactical and bomber forces. Standby operating bases in Northeastern Africa, Sinai, Turkey, or Saudi Arabia could be developed to accept U.S. combat aircraft. Air operations from these bases could also support the rapid deployment ground forces program now being developed. These forward bases are essential if the United States is to effectively insert a military presence in the Middle East or Persian Gulf area. </PARA>
<PARA>CONCLUSION</PARA>
<PARA> I hope the preceding statement has covered an urgent and convincing message-our current and near term strategic forces, while capable and ready, are, unable to achieve the relative balance possessed just two years ago. The delay in ratification of SALT II promises to further aggravate the balance and I would like to expand on this thought. </PARA>
<PARA> For the past several years, the Soviets have had, and still have, three ICBM's a supersonic bomber with intercontinental capabilities and a nuclear submarine with long range missiles in hot production. They have a new generation of ICBM's and a Trident size submarine in advanced development. [Deleted.] Less well understood, but just as certain, is the development of a new strategic bomber. All of this points to a near and mid-term continuing build-up of Soviet strategic forces. SALT II restraints would have placed a quantitative lid on these on-going programs-even though qualitative improvements would have continued. With no SALT II, the Soviets have the option of pursuing both. Of equal concern is the probable loss of certain intelligence and other data that would have been made available by the verification clauses of the treaty. </PARA>
<PARA> From a military and strategic balance point of view, the U.S. needed SALT II more than the Soviets and now our country must be prepared to meet the consequences of delayed or no ratification. If the Soviet strategic buildup continues as it has for the past ten years, we could be faced with an even more critical situation than that portrayed in this statement. </PARA>

<PARA>I would think that probably Darwin would be seen as being part of the places that he mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to spell out in detail the Labor Party's reservations about the B52 agreement. The Government alleges that the B52 agreement is comprised of, firstly, an exchange of diplomatic notes and, secondly, a statement made by the Prime Minister in the House on 11 March 1981. The Prime Minister's statement does not form part of the agreement either from an international, legal or a commonsense point of view. The additional document to which the Foreign Minister referred and which he produced from the Embassy in Washington is no more than a set of speaking notes, the purpose of which was to produce an agreed formula for Fraser's public statement, which would protect the long-standing United States policy of not disclosing whether its nuclear strike force planes and ships were carrying nuclear weapons. The agreement, as constituted by the exchange of diplomatic notes, is inadequate and does not in any of its eight clauses contain an unequivocal assurance that the United States will inform the Australian Government whether any of the B52 flights to stage through and over Australia are carrying nuclear weapons. Sub-paragraph 1 of the agreement says that the B52 flights shall be for sea surveillance in the Indian Ocean and for navigational training purposes. The fundamental point, however, is that the B52 is a long range strategic nuclear bomber which has been designed specifically for carrying and dropping nuclear weapons. It is not a training aeroplane or a surveillance aeroplane and it would be naive to think that any other power would regard it as such. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement made by the Prime Minister on 11 March purports to be in accordance with the exchange of diplomatic notes-it is the latter which constitute a binding international treaty obligation on Australia-but it is not. The fact is that late last year the Americans were prepared to agree that we should receive notification whether nuclear weapons were on board these planes, but they subsequently refused to do so. A careful reading of the diplomatic notes makes this quite clear. When the agreement was introduced in the House of Representatives, Mr Bowen, the Labor Party spokesman on foreign affairs, moved an amendment. The Government exposed the worthlessness of the Prime Minister's statement to the House when it voted against the amendment. The amendment simply would have ensured that such flights would not be armed with nuclear weapons. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has expressed the wish that it be possible to have a bipartisan policy on these issues. I believe that that is nonsense. When this agreement was presented to the Parliament, the diplomatic notes had already been exchanged which means that we had already entered into an international, binding agreement. Therefore, we were presented with a fait accompli. There was no attempt by the Government to discuss the question with the Opposition leaders prior to the tabling of the notes in the Parliament. For those reasons, the Opposition opposes the agreement. We believe that it should be completely renegotiated. </PARA>

<PARA>I seek leave to have the text of the speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Australian Tourist Commission Act 1967. The Australian Tourist Commission Act 1967 established an Australian Tourist Commission for the purpose of the encouragement of travel to and within Australia by people from other countries. The Act was assented to on 23 May 1967. The principal Act has been amended on three occasions to date; namely, in December 1973 by the Statute Law Revision Act 1973; in October 1974 by the Australian Tourist Commission Act 1974; and in June 1978 by the Administrative Changes (Consequential Provisions) Act of 1978. The 1974 amendments allowed the Australian Tourist Commission to engage in domestic tourism promotion and extended the membership of the Commission from seven to nine. The amendments to the Act which I now propose have three main purposes; namely, to increase the total number of commissioners from nine to 10; to increase the number of state and territory representatives on the Commission from two to three; and to bring the financial provisions of the Act into line with legislation covering comparable statutory authorities. </PARA>
<PARA>Increase in Number of Commissioners</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>In discussing the proposed amendments I turn firstly to the need to increase the membership of the Commission to enable Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory representation on the Australian Tourist Commission on the same basis as the States. At its meeting in August 1979 the Tourist Ministers Council, a body comprising the Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers having responsibility for tourism matters, agreed that the Northern Territory should be accorded membership of the ATC through incorporation into an existing rotational system of representation. This decision was made in the light of progress in the constitutional development of the Territory. In its March 1980 report on tourism in the Australian Capital Territory, the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory recommended:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Tourist Commission Act 1967 be amended to allow the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory to be represented on the Australian Tourist Commission on the same basis as the States. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for industry and commerce, the Rt Hon. Sir Phillip Lynch, and the former Minister for the Capital Territory, the Hon. R. J. Ellicott, raised the question of Commission membership by the Australian Capital Territory at the April 1980 meeting of the Tourist Ministers Council. The Council agreed to the proposal subject to the number of State and Territory representatives being increased from two to three. The Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory are important tourist destinations with tourism making a significant contribution to the economies of these areas. It is logical, therefore, that each Territory should be able to take its turn along with the States in providing membership on the national body concerned with the promotion of tourism. </PARA>
<PARA>State and Territory Representatives</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Against this background and in recognition of the wishes of the Tourist Ministers Council, the amending legislation provides for the increase in total membership of the Commission from nine to 10, thereby allowing three members to be persons nominated by the States and Territories. Consequent upon the increase in total membership of the Commission, the Bill provides for the increase in the number of members required for a quorum from five to six. Needless to say the Bill preserves the position of existing commissioners. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial and Other Provisions</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Amendments to financial and other provisions of the principal Act aim to bring the Act into line with legislation covering comparable statutory authorities and incorporate further consequential amendments as necessary to accommodate these changes. Clause 4 removes reference to the redundant Superannuation Act 1922. Clauses 5 and 6 bring the provisions of the Act into line with recommendations of the Bowen Committee relating to removal of members and disclosure of interests by members. Clause 8 brings the financial provisions of the Act into line with legislation covering comparable statutory authorities. Clause 9 repeals section 28 of the principal Act which relates to the application of the Officers' Rights Declaration Act, which will become redundant on the proclamation of the Public Service Amendment Act 1978. Clause 10 repeals reference to section 29 of the principal Act, concerning reports, which will become redundant on the twenty-eighth day after the day on which the Act receives the royal assent. Provisions concerning reports are embodied in Part V-Finance of the amendment Act 1981. Clause 11 takes account of formal amendments to the principal Act as scheduled. Clause 12 clarifies the Commission's powers to function pending the enactment and proclamation of the amending legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that the Territories will wish to see the way cleared as soon as possible for the new system of representation, under which they will in due course enjoy representation on the same basis as the States. It was with this in mind that the Government has accorded a high priority to this legislation. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Although it would not have been apparent from much of what Senator Sibraa said, we are in fact discussing a ministerial statement on the staging of B52 aircraft through Australia for sea surveillance in the Indian Ocean and for navigational training. At the outset, I would like to correct one remark Senator Sibraa made, that this was an initiative of the Reagan Administration. In fact, it was an initiative of the Carter Administration which came to fruition in the time of its successor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In discussions on this subject, the remarks of the Opposition seem to cast doubt on whether it realises that we are an ally of the United States of America. We have a military alliance with the United States and it is one of the few countries with which we have such an alliance. Of course, that alliance is in the form of the ANZUS treaty. This treaty-a very important one though it is- is not, in fact, most important because of the assurance of support it gives in the event of an emergency. The United States will come to our assistance in an emergency if it thinks it is in its interests to do so. That is what happened in 1942. There was no military alliance then. That is not the real importance of the ANZUS treaty. The real importance of the ANZUS treaty is the deterrent it provides to the outbreak of hostilities in our area. </PARA>
<PARA> It has a secondary importance in that the mechanism and the existence of the ANZUS treaty provides very valuable world-wide intelligence for Australia. The treaty provides facilities for joint training by our armed forces and it provides for us a vehicle, a mechanism, for the provision of a great deal of technical information that otherwise would not be available to us. These are all enormous benefits that flow from the existence of our treaty relationship with the United States. Any treaty has both benefits and obligations. One of the obligations we have under the ANZUS treaty is set out in Article II of that treaty which reads:</PARA>
<PARA> In order more effectively to achieve the objectives of this Treaty the Parties separately and jointly by means of continuous and effective self-help and mutual aid will maintain and develop their individual and collective capacity to resist armed attack. </PARA>
<PARA>This staging of B52 flights through Darwin falls squarely under Article II of the ANZUS treaty. The purposes of these B52 staging flights are, firstly, sea surveillance in the Indian Ocean, an area in which surveillance is grossly inadequate. Despite the remarks of Senator Sibraa, the B52s have a very considerable surveillance capability. The second objective--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4H4">Senator HAMER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has nothing to do with their long range tanks. It is primarily their radar which gives them this capability. Their very long endurance and their radar capability make them excellent sea surveillance vehicles. The second role for which the staging is designed is for navigational training. This is an important role. The B52s are, as Senator Evans has just remarked, essentially long range bombers. That is their prime role and the crews need training in this role. The use of Darwin as a staging point will make it more possible for them to get effective training. This is a very important contribution to the deterrent. Turning firstly to the role of sea surveillance in the Indian Ocean, as I said, this is a key area in world affairs at the moment, particularly the north-west corner. The surveillance facilities in that area are very inadequate. Darwin is necessary as a staging point if surveillance is to be carried out in the Persian Gulf area. Surveillance cannot be done effectively from Guam. I wish to make quite clear one point that sometimes arises. The thought that the surveillance might be carried out by satellites is quite false. Satellites can provide the raw intelligence. The one thing that is essential is identification. Aircraft and satellites must work in conjunction if we are to have effective surveillance of an area.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, the Americans have a very considerable array of bases that cover the Pacific very adequately. The second reason for the use of the Darwin staging facility is the navigational training of the B52 crews based in Guam. They are a very important contribution to the nuclear deterrent and their effective training is, of course, the key to their deterrent capability. When operating out of Darwin, we are assured they will not be armed. The assurance comes from the American Government in the person of Secretary of State Haig. The suggestion made by Senator Sibraa that this should be somehow written back into the treaty, presumably because the Opposition does not trust Secretary Haig, is nonsense. If one does not trust the Americans, the Americans do not become any more trustworthy because provisions are written into the treaty.</PARA></TALK.START>

I saw a very good example not long ago in the Parliament when one prominent Labor member, talking about the invasion of Afghanistan, did not like to call it an invasion. What he preferred to call it was a Russian presence in Afghanistan. This is the approach of Labor members; they grovel to their potential enemies and take every opportunity--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The remark was made by the member for Hunter in the House of Representatives. It would be idle to pretend that the United States has a perfect government. No human institution is ever perfect. Of course that government makes mistakes. Also it is certain that our interests will not always be identical with those of the United States, but we must recognise where our friends lie and where our potential dangers come from. To adopt the words of Sir Winston Churchill, I refuse to be neutral between the fire brigade and the fire. That is the sort of attitude that many members of the Labor Opposition would like to see us take. Quite clearly, the broad thrust of the policy of the United States is correct. The broad thrust of the policy of the United States is in our interests. The instance that we are looking at, the staging of B52 aircraft in Darwin, is concerned with two matters of very considerable interest to us. One is stability in the Middle East and the other is the deterrence of nuclear war.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We cannot do anything specific about the conduct of a nuclear war but we can assist and are assisting to deter the outbreak of such a war. That is clearly in our interests. We are doing that through providing facilities at North West Cape for communication with missile firing submarines. They are second-strike weapons designed because of their vulnerability to be able to inflict unacceptable damage in the event of a lightning attack on the United States. By their existence and by the existence of the communication stations, they make such an attack almost inconceivable. The monitoring stations in central Australia are designed to give warning of a surprise attack. Again, they contribute to the deterrent. Now in a more minor way, the staging facilities and the training for the B52 force also are contributing to deterrent. All these activities are in Australia's interests. It is in our interests to deter the outbreak of a nuclear war. It is not only in the interests of the United States but also it is in our interests. What we are seeking to do through this agreement is to increase the sea surveillance of the Indian Ocean. That is clearly in our interest. We are improving the effectiveness of a nuclear deterrent. That too is clearly in our interests. Finally, of course, we are continuing, as we should continue, co-operation with our tried allies, and that is also clearly in the interests of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that it has to be said, and said clearly, that the blame for any deficiencies in the agreement which we made on 11 March with the United States over the use of the B52 bombers in Australia cannot be laid at the door of the Government of the United States. I agree with many of the things which Senator Hamer has said. It is a realistic point of view that we have the ANZUS alliance with the United States; and I firmly believe that the majority of Australians support that view. That said, it is essential that the understanding between the two nations should be clear and unequivocal. The real objection of the Australian Democrats is to the fact-indeed it is a fact-that that agreement is not clear and unequivocal. We say it is the Government of our own country which is the culpable party here.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are two questions which have to be asked. The first question is: What is the extent of its culpability to the Australian people? The second question is: How can the Government now remedy the unforgivable carelessness, laziness and slovenliness with which it has committed the Australian people to this very important agreement? It is an agreement which amounts to no less than the use in Australia of one of the United States most awesome weapons, the B52 nuclear bomber, which exists for the major purpose of delivering a massive nuclear strike against an enemy in the event of total atomic war. </PARA>
<PARA> It is our Government's responsibility to protect our national interests in a matter of this kind. It is our Government's job to see that the clearest and fairest agreement possible with other nations is finalised. It was our Government's job, I should have thought, if it was seeking consensus, to bring this matter forward for discussion by the Parliament before it concluded the agreement. I think it is of vital importance that the Government did not do that. It came to this Parliament with a fait accompli and said: 'Rubber stamp this'. I suggest to the Government through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, that it should not be surprised if those of us on this side of the House suggest changes to the agreement and that indeed many members of the community also are deeply concerned about this matter and also are suggesting changes to it. </PARA>
<PARA> In assessing what has happened, it is very important to separate the actual facts from the mass of rhetoric that has built up in recent days around this issue of the B52 bombers. Basically, I suggest, the rhetoric does not matter very much; it has consisted mostly of political statements, innuendo, mud slinging against individuals and then refutations and denials. That practice has been dangerous to the extent that it has tended to obscure what is really important, that is, the agreement itself, its actual terms and what it actually says. I suggest that we must look only at that agreement and be guided in our judgment by what it says and only by that. So we can look then, I suggest, at what is in it, not at what is in the speech made by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and not at the explanations which have been made since. Sub-paragraph (I) states:</PARA>
<PARA> The B-52 staging operations shall be for sea surveillance in the Indian Ocean area and for navigation training purposes. The agreement of the Government of Australia shall be obtained before the facilities are used in support of any other category of operations. </PARA>
<PARA>Thus far so good, but this apparently clear statement then becomes clouded and muddled by sub-paragraph (VII) of the agreement which states:</PARA>
<PARA> Arrangements shall be made for consultations to ensure that the Government of Australia has full and timely information about strategic and operational developments relevant to B-52 staging operations through Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Democrat view is that sub-paragraph (VII) should be strengthened so that there is no possible inference that consultation might be substituted for actual agreement. This could be very easily achieved simply by saying as much in that article of the agreement. Indeed, we believe it should originally have been in the agreement. We cannot understand why it was not there. The Government will keep on having trouble over this agreement until it has explained why it was not there. If it cannot come up with a satisfactory explanation, it must make sure that the agreement is renegotiated and that something is done about it. It is not too late to make changes now. There is nothing irrevocable about an agreement of this kind. If we are dealing with a friend and a friendly country, as indeed we are, it should be very pleased to permit an agreement finally to take form, which is something that the Australian people can agree with in consensus as a proper agreement between friends. It is important that treaties of this type state first the uncompromised integrity of Australian sovereignty as clearly as possible, and the present sub-paragraph (VII) does not do that. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the most serious deficiency of all, to our mind, in the actual treaty. I think the Australian people now feel this very greatly because this is an issue which has emerged and already has become a major issue in this society. The fact is that nowhere in that treaty, from end to end, is the actual question of nuclear armaments, the carriage of nuclear armaments or the non-carriage of them mentioned. The agreement provides that, subject to the terms and conditions specified in the sub-paragraphs of the agreement, the Government of Australia agrees to United States Air Force use of RAAF Base Darwin for the staging operations of B52 aircraft and, of course, their associated KC135 tanker aircraft which refuel B52 aircraft in the air. It is necessary to reiterate that this agreement, in terms of that definition, is the only area of importance. The understandings of the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) with United States Secretary of State Haig appear to have absolutely no force in law. I will be interested to hear an explanation from the Government perhaps later in this debate. Perhaps it can instruct me whether they have any force in law and how they have any force in law. I think the Australian people would be reassured by that. </PARA>
<PARA> I have no brief here for Mr Hayden, but I thought it not very intelligent of Mr Street to castigate Mr Hayden because he would not accept as adequate a casual, old boy agreement between Secretary of State Haig and Mr Street about nuclear weapons. Mr Street's response was to say that if Mr Hayden wished to impugn the integrity of the United States Government and of the member of Cabinet who represented it on that occasion, he should get up and say so. Senator Hamer has repeated those thoughts. I suggest that it is not worthy for a matter of this seriousness to be degenerated to this degree of politicking, because I think the Australian people see it as not worth while. It is not for me, of course, to define the attitudes of the Australian Labor Party, but certainly as far as the Australian Democrats are concerned there is no question of impugning the integrity of Secretary of State Haig or of anyone else. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that in politics and history there is a continuous change of personalities. Mr Haig may become ill, may die or may be replaced for a variety of reasons. That is why agreements between governments exist-mere verbal discussions between personalities can have no force over a period. That point was made earlier in interjections from this side of the chamber, notably by Senator Evans; and I think we agree with that. That is why Mr Street's protestations about vague and illegal agreements that the B52s will not carry nuclear weapons seem to us not to be worth the breath he expended in making them. I do not doubt his sincerity, but I doubt his competence to do his job in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that the matter should be clearly stipulated in the agreement; it should have been from the first. That agreement should say in so many words that no nuclear weapons will be carried on to Australian soil or serviced from facilities on Australian soil without the previous agreement of the Australian Government in writing. This does not seem to the Australian Democrats to be an unreasonable thing to ask for. I feel sure that the bulk of reasonable Australian people would not see it as unreasonable either. I urge the Government to commence the task of renegotiating this agreement as soon as possible and in good faith with the United States. There is no question of its being anything other than that. </PARA>
<PARA> If our Government does not do that, it will be guilty of consequences beyond its original laziness and carelessness in this matter. It will be guilty of perpetuating a divisive situation in this matter which will be, into the future, a permanent cloud over Australian-American relationships. That would be very damaging and we, as a political party, would see it as disastrous. We would see it as counter productive to the objectives the Government itself is trying to pursue and to those we would approve of. It is important that there be clear understanding between friends about their relationships. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that while the Government is renegotiating the matter it should look again at sub-paragraph (VII) with its reference to arrangements for consultations and should consider a new and tightly worded sub-paragraph (VII) that would make it plain that, whatever consultations are held, an expansion of the role of the B52s beyond reconnaissance and training must be subject to prior agreement of the Australian government of the day in writing. </PARA>
<PARA> The next point that worries the Australian Democrats is the selection of Darwin. In the United States, B52 bases are not located, quite deliberately, near major cities. Why should we have one right on the outskirts of our major northern city? Why Darwin? I was in Darwin last week and I discussed this matter with many people. It was very much a burning question in Darwin last week; everybody was talking about it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a good mind to give Senator Evans all the details. Perhaps I will do that. No, I will not; I will spare him. I can only say that I was appalled at the mechanistic and cold-blooded way in which nuclear targeting, especially from submarine-based missiles, is organised. I implore Senator Evans not to approach this rather serious subject in a spirit of levity. I do not think it is one we should approach in a spirit of levity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is to my mind no doubt at all that the presence of a B52 base in Darwin will ensure that that city becomes a nuclear target of quite high priority in the event of war. I invite honourable senators to consider honestly what that means. It means that in the event of war Darwin would be obliterated in the first strike. It would be destroyed with all its men, women and children, its shops, its houses, its hospitals and it schools, because it is of a size that could be destroyed by a single submarine-launched warhead. What we are doing in this agreement is conniving very coldly in the possibility of death for a city housing 50,000 Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> I was shocked at the kind of rubbish some irresponsibles in the political field were talking in Darwin last week, especially the dishonest and cynical claim that somehow B52s would protect Darwin-provide a mantle of safety, I believe the words were. This is absolute and dangerous nonsense. The B52s are strategic bombers designed to drop nuclear weapons and are not likely to be adapted to Darwin's defence. I will be very pleased to hear a statement to the contrary from anybody on the other side of the chamber. If they cannot give me an undertaking, I would be pleased if they would send to Darwin a note instructing some of their people there to be a little more responsible in the statements they are making now to the citizens of that city. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to the Australian Democrats that any decision to expose the people of Darwin to such a monstrous and hideous possibility as I have outlined is of tremendous consequence in this country. Even worse is that it appears to have been taken very coldly, very lightly and without good reasons. For instance, on the North West Shelf of Western Australia, far away from any major area of population, is the Royal Australian Air Force base at Learmonth. I understand that it has the runways to handle B52s. It would need more facilities certainly, but it seems not unreasonable to assume that the United States might be prepared to provide those facilities. I gather that there is a question of an extra runway having to be built at Darwin. Why Darwin? I bring up this point again and again. What about Learmonth?</PARA>
<PARA> Learmonth is much closer to the Indian Ocean than is Darwin. It would seem much more rational and reasonable to use it and to get any possible danger away from one of our cities than to use Darwin. Because it is closer to the Indian Ocean it should be much more suited for surveillance there and would be in fact a considerable economy in terms of crew time, fuel and everything else. To conclude, the Australian Democrats again ask: Why Darwin? It is a good question to ask the Government. We would like a reply to it. We will not stop asking that question until we get a reasonable reply. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome this agreement between Australia and the United States on the use of facilities at Darwin by the B52s. It is one small but positive step to increase the security of Australia and of the Western democracies. The agreement provides that B52s and KC135s can use Darwin. Sub-paragraph (I) defines the purpose for which they will be tasked operationally. Sub-paragraph (II) gives the numbers of aircraft involved at any one time. Sub-paragraph (VII) details the consultations that the Government will be required to go through with the United States if there is any change in these defined operational requirements. Sub-paragraph (VIII) defines how those changed operations may come about. Despite what Senator Mason said, sub-paragraph (VIII) is necessary because the Australian Government has to go through fit and proper conditions to fulfil its treaty obligations. It is necessary to provide that we can fulfil the requirements of the ANZUS treaty if it is necessary in a time of emergency. That is the great importance of sub-paragraph (VIII). I would like to deal with sub-paragraphs (V) and (VI), which state:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (V) Irrespective of financial arrangements agreed between the two Governments, RAAF Base Darwin shall remain an Australian facility under Australian control. </PARA>
<PARA> (VI) No circumstances arising from this Agreement shall affect the title of the Government of Australia to the relevant land, or the pre-existing authority of the Government of Australia in the use of RAAF Base Darwin. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that is a particularly important point and I commend the Government for making it. I am behind this agreement in all ways because I believe we have to support the United States, but I do not believe that we should ask the United States to pay for the facilities it uses here. That is where I differ most strongly with Senator Mason. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to use the adjournment debate tonight to mention two matters associated with the print media. I mention firstly a letter which I wrote to the editor of the Brisbane Courier-Mail. The topic of that letter was suggested to me when I saw a letter written by Senator Bjelke-Petersen to Wallace Brown, the Courier-Mail's representative in Canberra. In discussing casual Senate vacancies in that letter Senator Bjelke-Petersen said, amongst other things:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Joh asked for a panel of names when the Labor Party proposed Mal Colston, because the ALP had demanded the same thing previously. </PARA>
<PARA>The latter part of that assertion is quite false. I replied to that point by way of a letter to the editor of the Courier-Mail. Most of the letter was not published so I would like to read the whole reply so that the letter I wrote is on record. I mention that I have discussed the severe abbreviation of the letter with the editor of the Courier-Mail so I am not going behind his back in mentioning the matter in this chamber. I read from the letter which was printed in quite an abbreviated fashion in the Courier-Mail. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA> In a letter to Wallace Brown, (C-M 14 March) Senator Bjelke-Petersen referred to the nomination of three persons for the Senate vacancy caused by the resignation of Dr Glen Sheil. The nomination of a panel in the State Parliament last Thursday bordered on the Gilbertian because it was a fait accompli that Senator Bjelke-Petersen would be the successful candidate. </PARA>
<PARA> More important than that, however, is the incorrect information in Senator Bjelke-Petersen's letter to Wallace Brown. The Senator stated: 'Joh asked for a panel of names when the Labor Party proposed Mal Colston, because the ALP had demanded the same thing previously.' The latter part of that assertion is absolutely false. </PARA>
<PARA> These are some relevant facts: Prior to the introduction of proportional representation in 1949, there were three casual vacancies in Queensland. In none of these cases was there a call for a panel of candidates. </PARA>
<PARA> After the introduction of proportional representation, State Parliaments recognised that it was proper to replace a Senator who died or resigned with a person of the same political persuasion. Since 1949 and prior to last Thursday's proceedings, four casual vacancies have been filled by a sitting of the Queensland Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Two of these were Liberal vacancies, the first caused by the death of Senator Sherrington in 1966 and the second by the resignation of Senator Dame Annabelle Rankin in 1971. In both cases, the Liberal Party submitted one nominee only and those nominees, Senators Heatley and Bonner respectively, were duly appointed by the Queensland Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1962, Labor Senator Max Poulter died and the Labor Party nominated Mr Alf Arnell to fill the vacancy. The Country-Liberal Government, led by Mr Nicklin, refused to accept Mr Arnell because of his alleged left-wing philosophy. It insisted upon another nominee and the Party reluctantly (and against the wishes of many Party members) submitted the name of Mr George Whiteside who was subsequently appointed. </PARA>
<PARA> Upon the death of Senator Bert Milliner in 1975, the Premier of Queensland, Mr Bjelke-Petersen, demanded that the Labor Party submit a panel of three nominees for the vacancy. This time the Labor Party would not accede to the Premier's demands and I was the only person nominated by the ALP. </PARA>
<PARA> The Premier seized the opportunity to stack the Senate and selected Albert Field. </PARA>
<PARA> I stress that the ALP has never demanded that a panel of names be submitted when it has been necessary to fill a casual vacancy. If Senator Bjelke-Petersen is going to rely on history to support her arguments, she should first make sure that her facts are correct. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>MAL COLSTON Senator for Queensland</PARA>
<PARA>The other matter which I wish to raise is related to a motion of which I gave notice in the Senate yesterday. Today's Notice Paper outlines that I moved as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> That leave be given to introduce a Bill for an Act to make provision for the Senators for the State of Queensland to be chosen by the people of that State voting as one electorate. </PARA>
<PARA>I gave such notice as I was originally assured that I would, indeed, be able to bring my motion forward today. I have no quibble with the fact that it has been necessary to delay my Bill's introduction. I believe it will be brought on in the near future. Unfortunately, however, Press representatives misunderstood the purpose of my Bill. I would like to read from sections of two newspaper reports which refer to this. An article on page 8 of this morning's Australian stated among other things:</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Florence Isobel Bjelke-Petersen had barely taken her seat in the Senate yesterday when an Opposition senator gave notice of a private member's Bill which, if enacted, would prevent further political appointments to the Upper House. </PARA>
<PARA>The article went on to mention some other things including your reply, Mr President, to admit them. The last paragraph of the article stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Moments after the swearing-in, the Senator Mal Colston (Queensland) gave notice of his private member's Bill, which, if enacted, would stop political Senate appointments. </PARA>
<PARA>An article in the Courier-Mail, the newspaper from the capital city of my home State, outlined how Senator Bjelke-Petersen was sworn in. The article concluded:</PARA>
<PARA> Queensland Labor Senator Colston gave notice of a private member's Bill, which would prevent further political appointments to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not want to traverse the content of my Bill at this stage. I stress it has nothing to do with political appointments or casual vacancies. Indeed, it had nothing to do with Senator Bjelke-Petersen except insofar as she is a senator for Queensland as are nine other people. When I present the Bill, the content will become available and will become known to all. If Press representatives had wanted to know what it was all about I would have been happy to inform them yesterday. I consider this would have been a far preferable course of action than to disregard the facts so that a good story was not spoiled. </PARA>

<SPEECH PAGE="776" SPEAKER="Tate Sen M.C." NAMEID="NJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Tasmania)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(11.8)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish briefly on behalf of the Tasmanian Timber Association to bring a matter, which is of grave concern to the exporters of timber from Tasmania, to the attention of the Senate in the first instance and, of course, to seek action from the relevant Minister who in this case is the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt). As honourable senators know, the timber industry in Tasmania is based on our dense and continuous forests with which we are blessed, unlike the mainly more arid regions of mainland Australia. Some 31 per cent of the State's area is in fact covered by what might be loosely termed commercial forest area. The industry is based on hardwoood holdings although softwood is being planted to supplement the hardwood natural timbers. Figures which I obtained tonight from the Parliamentary Library indicate that we exported some 245,000 cubic metres of sawn timbers at a value of some $29m in 1977-78. No doubt, when adjusted for inflation, those figures could be enhanced. However, this gives some idea of the scope and importance of this industry in Tasmania-the export of sawn timber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Therefore, it is very important that the Tasmanian freight equalisation scheme operate in a fair manner not only in respect of producers of sawn timber in Tasmania but also in respect of the Australian taxpayer from each State and Territory who contributes moneys to the Federal revenue. In what I am about to say there is no intention on my part or, indeed, on the part of the Tasmanian Timber Association to impugn the attempts by the Department of Transport to reach a rate applicable for north-bound sawn timber from Tasmania which, as I say, is fair both to producers and to the taxpayers who are paying a subsidy related to the volume and weight of wood sent north to the mainland.</PARA>
<PARA> This saga began on 24 December 1979 when the Department of Transport made it known to the Tasmanian timber industry that assistance rates applicable to north-bound timber were to be varied and a new series of rates was to apply from 1 January 1980. In summary and without going into great technical detail, one tonne of timber that occupies 1.9 cubic metres of stowage or less-in other words, it is dense or perhaps green timber-was to have assistance paid at a lower rate than fully dried and seasoned timber of which one tonne could be stowed in 1.9 cubic metres or more. For example, the rate of assistance for transportation from northern Tasmania to Victoria of the dense, usually green timber would be $6 a tonne but on dry, less dense timber the rate would be $11 a tonne. I will not go into the technical details. I merely say that the variation between the two rates of assistance was then dependent on whether one tonne of timber occupied more or less than 1.9 cubic metres. </PARA>
<PARA> In practical terms, this meant that from that date, 1 January 1980, all green timber and about one-third of all dried timber bollards moving north from Tasmania received assistance at about half the previous rate. As honourable senators can imagine, this has had quite a severe impact on the industry. One may note in passing, as I have said, that the determination apparently was made on Christmas Eve 1979 and notified to the industry at a time when the industry was in its traditional recess. So, in fact, when businesses began their operations in the third or fourth week of January 1980, they were confronted with circulars and letters which one might say had a retrospective impact because contracts and undertakings entered into by the industry for the year commencing 1 January 1980 were, as I said, negotiated and undertaken without any idea that this new rating system would apply. </PARA>
<PARA> Be that as it may, its impact was estimated by the Tasmanian Timber Association at that time to be such that about $750,000 worth of assistance which might previously have been expected under the old formula would be lost by the application of the new formula. It may be that some new formula was and is required so that some exporters of timber are not overcompensated and some are not undercompensated. Some change might be required. As honourable senators can imagine, correspondence has been entered into and has been going backward and forward between the responsible Minister and the Tasmanian Timber Association for some 15 months since January 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not intend to take up the time of the Senate by detailing the correspondence and the various conferences that have taken place. The Minister has received delegations. His officials have been made available both from his Department and the Bureau of Transport Economics. One can say that a situation was reached in the latter part of last year in which the Minister was prepared to say that there are alternatives. It may be that the break point should not be 1.9 cubic metres per tonne. Perhaps one could look at alternatives ranging from 1.3 cubic metres, or even a new flat rate. He pointed out the consequences of selecting new break points. That led to further consideration by the Tasmanian Timber Association, which eventually suggested that 1.6 cubic metres be the break point. That elicited further replies from the Minister which pointed out that this break point might have a detrimental effect on some exporters of timber. At the end of this 11 or 12 months of negotiation, in a letter dated 11 December 1980, the Tasmanian Timber Association concluded:</PARA>
<PARA> Under these circumstances we believe that, even at 1.6, the subsidy rates should not be reduced but, for the sake of cutting short to some degree the continued injustice of the present assistance rates, we acknowledge that you probably will reduce them. </PARA>
<PARA>This amounted-and I believe it was understood to amount-to a plea that the north-bound assistance rate for timber be set at a break point of 1.6, with such consequences to the industry as the Minister had outlined, and the industry was forced to accept that. The industry accepted it reluctantly, but considered that it was marginally better than the original proposal put forward on 1 January. </PARA>
<PARA> Further correspondence and telegrams have been entered into. Senator Messner looks a little bewildered, and I agree that I may seem to be speaking, in the substance of my remarks, about a technical area. My real concern is about the sequence of events. Over 15 months have elapsed since the matter was first presented to the Tasmanian Timber Association and the new rates were introduced, about which continuing negotiation has taken place. There has been no meaningful response from the Minister since the letter dated 11 December last year from the Tasmanian Timber Association to the Minister accepting the 1.6 break point. There have been just a series of acknowledgments and letters which, I may say, have put off the Tasmanian Timber Association. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that this industry which, as I pointed out in my earlier remarks, is of great importance to the economy and to employment in Tasmania, has been treated in a shabby manner. It certainly has not been treated in an expeditious manner or in a way that reflects the urgency which is spoken of and experienced not only by the exporters themselves but also by their employees in the sawmilling industry in Tasmania. I believe that unless we get a response in the very near future the Federal Government will have to bear the ignominy of its attitude of putting off this industry's legitimate claims for full consultation and a response to the compromise which was reached over many months. I ask the Minister to take to the Minister for Transport the concern that I express, not only on my behalf but on behalf of the other Tasmanian Labor senators with whom I have consulted, and I consulted with them all before making these remarks. </PARA>
