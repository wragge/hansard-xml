<PARA> That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death on 30 May 1981 of His Excellency, President Ziaur Rahman, President of the People's Republic of Bangladesh since 1977, and tenders its profound sympathy to his family and to the people of Bangladesh. </PARA>
<PARA>Bangladesh has lost, under tragic circumstances, a leader of zeal and integrity. His loss is one that Bangladesh can ill afford. His dedication to the development of rural Bangladesh and its huge population was one of the principal reasons why his party won a substantial majority in the democratic elections held in 1979. He spared no efforts either at home or abroad to achieve the objects that were the basis of his election and continuing popularity. He became a leader of the least developed countries. The late President was highly respected by all for his views within the North-South debate. Within the non-aligned movement and the Islamic Conference, he had established himself as an independent and moderate leader. </PARA>
<PARA> President Ziaur had strong links with the Commonwealth and it was gratifying that he attended the first Commonwealth Heads of Government Regional Meeting in Sydney in 1978. The friendship between our two countries has grown and strengthened in recent years. Australia was one of the first countries to recognise the newly independent nation in 1971 and we sponsored its membership of the United Nations and the Commonwealth. In the past year, Bangladesh was the third largest recipient of Australian bilateral development aid and an increasingly important trade partner. The late President was aware of these important links. </PARA>
<PARA> We were particularly shocked by the circumstances of President Ziaur's assassination. This is the third occasion in recent months on which a world leader has been the subject of political violence. It is impossible to express in words the abhorrence that Australians feel about events of this nature. They deserve the strongest condemnation by all people. All members of the Senate and all other Australians will join me in condemning this brutal act and in extending our sympathy to the President's family and to the people of Bangladesh. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave- Mr President, I wish to ask whether you were consulted about and whether you gave permission for the clearing of King's Hall, realising, of course, a very unpleasant situation was developing in King's Hall. I wonder whether those who gave the order for the clearance anticipated the violence that would follow-that women would be dragged from the hall and children would be pushed down the stairs of Parliament House. Mr President, were you informed? Did you take into consideration the fact that this is the people's Parliament and that, no matter how erratically and how extraordinarily people may behave, it is their Parliament and such action against them should not be tolerated? In the 13 years that I have been a member of this Parliament, I have not seen a scene such as developed today in King's Hall. I know that the blame may rest very heavily on those women who gathered in King's Hall. Nevertheless, the responsibility for the resulting debacle must rest on those who gave the order to clear. Were you consulted, Mr President?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response, I refer firstly to the latter part of Senator Georges's question when he said, and rightly so, that this is the people's Parliament. That, and the desire and the need to ensure free and easy access by all citizens to this Parliament, weighed very heavily on my mind, having experienced disturbances here on previous occasions. No person or body of persons coming here should so act as to intrude on the rights of all other Australians who come here. Yes, I was consulted. Mr Speaker and I consulted. The decision to permit eviction proceedings to be taken was not an easy decision to make. I can assure the honourable senator that everyone concerned was advised not to use unnecessary force and to avoid causing any hurt or harm to anybody. We appreciated the gravity of the situation in doing what had to be done, but this place must go on uninterrupted.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought that any supplementary question would be covered by my first request for leave, which I was granted. Nevertheless, I have now sought further leave and I thank the Senate for granting that leave. I should have thought that all the members of this Parliament, especially the Opposition, through the leaders of the Opposition would have been consulted in some way. I take it that that was not done. No appeal was made to me to try to find out in some way whether any of my constituents were involved so that I could appeal to them to use, shall we say, more sedate methods. I was going to say 'respectable methods' but it seems to me that a certain section of society has found that respectable approaches are no longer to any avail. Nevertheless, was the Opposition consulted? If not, why were members of the Parliament not appealed to in some way to try to separate out and quieten down those people who felt it necessary to take part in such a demonstration? In spite of all the attempts to avoid it, acts of extreme violence occurred in King's Hall. There is no doubt that the police had to use and did use extreme violence against individuals in King's Hall. Those who made the decision should have taken that into account.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Mr President, in view of what you have just said, I think you should know that I stood in King's Hall and watched women dragged, bump by bump, down the steps from King's Hall. There were at least as many policemen present as there were women, so the police could have at least picked the women up and carried them outside, but they did not. They dragged them down the steps, in some cases by their hair. I had to stand in this Parliament building at the top of the stairs and hold a small child while she screamed in terror because a policeman was taking her mother away. I say that, if we cannot keep order, if we believe that this is the people's House, and if you are forced at some stage, Mr President, to declare that certain people should be removed because the Parliament cannot go about its business, then surely those orders can be given so that people can be removed in a civilised fashion. This afternoon the scene was like every scene I have seen out of every film about fascism in this world. I stood in the hall and watched women, who had stood aside with their children, herded out of the hall, in much the same way as women without children were herded out of the hall. I hope that if ever again you have to give those sorts of orders you will remember some of these remarks.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-My remarks will be quite brief. Today is a sad day for Canberra. The last time we saw brutality of this nature was when police were forced by the then Minister for the Interior, Mr Hunt, to remove the black embassy from outside Parliament House. I understand that one of the women involved has a broken arm and that other injuries have been sustained. Under these circumstances, if there are any injuries, I ask whether you, Mr President, or Mr Speaker, have done something about getting medical treatment for the people. The group was engaged in a perfectly legitimate exercise. The Government has seen fit to take away the funding from a group in the community which needs it most. This is its only way of showing protest. The people used no violence at any stage. I understand that a number of the policemen involved are extremely upset because they were forced to carry out this brutal eviction from what has been said--</PARA></TALK.START>

Mr President, I am disappointed that you had to be involved in the matter. You have had a very good reign in the Senate as our President, but in the last three weeks of your reign you have been forced into this situation where you have had to order brutality to be carried out within Parliament House.</PARA></TALK.START>

I suggest that it ill becomes those Government senators, who are turning this matter into a joke and a charade, to carry on with their interjections of this nature. Obviously they strongly support the brutality that has just been carried out and they like seeing it done. This Senate will not be turned into a fascist House even if people such as the Liberal senator from Warrnambool, who frequently goes to sleep in the chamber anyway, now approve of what has happened.</PARA></TALK.START>

I reject out of hand the claims of Senator Keeffe of the Australian Labor Party, who spoke before me. The Government finds no joy or happiness at all in the situation, but we accept, and I hope the Australian Labor Party accepts, the fact that the two Presiding Officers have a very serious responsibility. That responsibility relates to the orderliness of conduct and behaviour within the precincts of the Parliament and the degree of protest movement, if any, within those precincts, as distinct from the place outside where protests normally occur. If any of the circumstances, as described by one or two honourable senators, did occur this morning, I hope that they took the number of the Commonwealth policeman so engaged, because if they did not--</PARA></TALK.START>

However, several times in the course of the last week, I saw something unique to me, that is, King's Hall largely obstructed by a demonstration. I would be second to none in favour of the right of people to protest, but the right of people to protest in a large way in King's Hall is a matter for very serious consideration by the Presiding Officers. It is also the people's Parliament and there should be freedom of access and egress of visitors and members of the Parliament. So this matter raises fundamental questions.

<PARA> 1. Uphold the principle that the seeds and cuttings of plants are a public resource and a common heritage to all and that accordingly seeds should be freely available to all, freely multipliable, able to be sold, exchanged, exported and imported by anyone who wishes. This is seen as a matter of national food security.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Recognise that plant breeding is a highly co-operative venture often involving private enterprise at the very last stages after basic seed collection, storage, and research has been publicly funded.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. In view of the aforementioned paragraphs, recognise that any system giving 'property' or ownership rights over seeds to individuals, organisations or enterprises is inappropriate and unjust.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. Recognise that legislation establishing plant patenting schemes overseas has had serious adverse effects, namely:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) a slowing-down of scientific information exchange and exchanges in basic plant breeding materials, that is, germ plasm,</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) subordination and/or curtailment of public breeding programs,</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) farmer unrest at seed prices,</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) monopoly control of seed production and sales has passed into the hands of giant petrochemical and drug corporations also marketing crop chemicals,</PARA>
<PARA> (v) increased uniformity of crop varieties leading to a vulnerability to pest and disease attack.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. Reject any proposal to legislate for any system such as the drafted Plant Variety Rights Act, which gives exclusive ownership rights over seeds to individuals, organisations or enterprises.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister representing the Treasurer to the Treasurer's recent decision that, in future, taxation deductions on investment in Australian films will be available only when approved films are completed and are being exhibited. Did the Treasurer not foresee that his decision would mean that film producers would be forced by investors into making cheap 'quickies' completed in less than one year and that plans for high quality productions involving production periods of two and three years would be shelved? Does the Minister agree that this is a manifestly unfair decision which, if carried through, would constitute a massive blow to an infant Australian industry which has distinguished itself in an extraordinary fashion by its progress over the last few years?

The Minister is aware of the desire of Radio CHY to go on air without delay. It is hoped to be able to resolve any outstanding problems as soon as possible.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Education. Has the Commonwealth followed up its support in principle for the establishment of an Australian Children's Television Foundation? Since the Australian Education Council's meeting last February in Hobart when all States and the Commonwealth looked to this Foundation as the best way to provide for and promote improved television programs for children, the objectives and the budget for the Foundation have been decided, and most State governments have com- mitted their share of the funding to the Foundation. I urge the Government to provide in the Budget the proposed Commonwealth share, which I understand to be $377,000. Finally I ask: Is the Government aware that this kind of initiative was strongly recommended by the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts, the Davidson Committee, in its now widely acclaimed report on children and television?</PARA></TALK.START>

I understand that the discussions are not finalised. I cannot indicate the point they have reached. The States tend to do a considerable amount of curriculum development work. They look to the Curriculum Development Centre for special kinds of projects.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Minister for National Development and Energy, refers to the as yet unreleased draft report of the International Energy Agency for 1980 entitled 'Overview and overall evaluation of Australia's energy performance'. I understand it was prepared towards the end of 1980. Paragraph 56 of that report refers to a 1979 Australian Government submission estimating shale oil production in 1990 at 235,000 barrels a day. The figure was reduced to 40,000 barrels a day in the 1980 Australian Government submission. In other words, the Government has drastically scaled down its Rundle estimates and/or extended the time frame. Did the 1979 and 1980 submissions to the IEA come from his Department? If so, will he table those submissions? If they did come from his Department why, as late as his 2 February 1981 Press conference, was the Minister still talking up Rundle shares? I refer for example, to statements such as this:</PARA></TALK.START>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2408" SPEAKER="Carrick Sen The Hon J.L." NAMEID="2U4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To put Senator Walsh's question in perspective, the International Energy Agency from time to time visits one of the member countries and, with its own assessors, independently makes its assessments of what is happening with regard to energy in that country. That is precisely what happened. Members of the IEA came to Australia. They had complete freedom of movement and they sought their information wherever they wished to do so. Of course, they had discussions with my Department. I am not aware of anything in the nature of official submissions being made. My understanding is that that is not how it works; rather, there are general discussions between the Government and the IEA and the IEA then produces a draft report and, ultimately, a full report. I believe that within the immediate months ahead the IEA is likely to produce a full report. Certainly that will be made available. My instinct is that the IEA will regard oil from shale as one of the most significant cost effective sources of synthetic crude oil for the future, but that will be a matter for judgment when the report comes around.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The general understanding when the IEA representatives were in Australia was based upon the reports of the companies concerned-acting, I believe, in good faith-that they would have the pilot plant in position and proceeding to production from 1984-85 onwards. No doubt, the IEA made its own assessment in that regard. So all that has happened, as is the case with any mining venture, is that certain mining and cost difficulties have been perceived and the mining venture itself has therefore made some rearrangements. The statement by the Rundle consortium in recent days has shown the path on which it should proceed in the future.</PARA>
<PARA> It is significant that, with the knowledge that Rundle was under question and, indeed, at the very time it was the subject of controversy, there should have emerged discussions between some of the Rundle partners-the Australian partners and the Japanese National Oil Corporation, JANOC-to set up heads of agreement for a feasibility study of Condor, another shale oil deposit. With all that knowledge, the Japanese, including the Japanese technologists, believe that shale oil is likely to be a very significant part of the general program for synthetic crude oil in the future.</PARA>
<PARA> Once again, Senator Walsh has suggested that I talked up the price of the shares. I wish to state what is now history, and in Hansard. The prices of shares in Rundle moved substantially downward from high levels in, say, October and November of last year and were halved prior to my visit to Rundle; so the prices of the shares were falling, due undoubtedly to judgments made in the market place. On that we had no influence, direct or indirect, at all. There was no intention of talking up or talking down shares. Had the Government and I wanted in any way to alter the position in the market place as such in a talking-up fashion, the last thing we would have done, once we discovered that there was a difficulty-a perceptibly different viewpoint amongst the partners from that in the market place-would have been to seek the earliest possible public exposure of the matter. The contrary is true.</PARA>
<PARA> If the intention of honourable senators opposite is to suggest that shale oil is not a likely significant syncrude, I believe that that perception will not be held by the experts. If there is some movement in the development of shale so that it comes on stream not by 1990 but during the 1990s, that may very well be because the import parity pricing policies of the Government are producing more oil in Bass Strait and elsewhere than had previously been thought possible, and therefore the capacity to achieve an energy balance in Australia is becoming more apparent. I hope that in due course we will be able to publish figures in that regard. Therefore, those who are seeking to produce synthetic crudes may believe that the time frame and the lead times are longer than they may have judged to be the case before.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have had a number of very detailed discussions with the Premier of South Australia, Mr Tonkin, commencing in recent times last Friday when we discussed this matter in detail in this building and during the weekend when we met under other circumstances. The Prime Minister also had some discussions, in which I joined. The fact is that the Commonwealth Government recognises that the River Murray and its main tributary, the River Darling, are of immense significance not only to the States through which they move but also nationally. Downstream they are of great significance to South Australia. As everyone knows, there is, largely in Victoria but also elsewhere, an inland dried seabed of immense proportions which, when there are droughts and when irrigation is misused and raises the water table, produces excess saline into the water in the Murray. That has serious consequences for agriculture. That situation becomes exacerbated when drought does not allow a flush to go down the Darling into the Menindee Lakes and, therefore, to dilute the salt. It is a sad fact that about 1.5 million tonnes of salt is going down the Murray from the dried seabed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The great solution would be for the good Lord to continue to send us sufficient rain so that the Dartmouth Dam, which is 40 per cent full, could reach its full capacity and so that the Hume Dam, which is 10 per cent full, could be filled so that we might let water flow further down the Murray. Against that background, the Commonwealth and the States have been working very closely to get a new River Murray Agreement which will place emphasis not only on quantity of water but also on quality; and it is the quality factor that is highly significant. The States have made enormous progress and are within only one factor of reaching total agreement. We have asked the New South Wales Government whether, in good faith, it will reach an agreement on this matter. The significant point is that we are asking the New South Wales Government to be willing to agree that the agreement should state that where the Government proposes to take any action which would have a significant effect on the future quantity and quality of water it will notify the River Murray Commission prior to taking that action.</PARA>

I pay tribute to the fact that the Water Resources Commission in New South Wales contains officers of very superior standards who are good Australians and who are trying to get a result. The Minister was prepared, under his own authority, to go as far as to agree with respect to water use for irrigation, but naturally we need it with respect to paper mills, industry and so on. What has happened is that there has been consultation on the wider sphere. I understand indirectly that progress is being made. I am enormously hopeful that we will reach that result with the good will of the New South Wales Government. I believe that it understands fully the need to take a national view on the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the question asked, of course South Australia is frustrated. If honourable senators were facing at this moment, as a result of such a drought, a situation in which the river mouth was sanded up and in which downstream irrigation was producing a situation in which there were strong saline levels in the stream which were damaging plant life, of course they would be frustrated. The Premier indicated his frustration. He has indicated, of course, that he has no intention at all of using the duress of gas supply. He is using the parallel that he has a national responsibility for the gas supplies that come out of South Australia. Honourable senators should take that in good faith.

If it is not totally good enough, we will take the next step. But an ability to apprehend changes in quality and quantity will enable the River Murray Commission, ahead of the fact, to expose the fact to the world, to create a dialogue and, therefore, to initiate other action.

What evidence is there that New South Wales has been thieving water which, they claim, rightfully belongs to South Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As to the first matter, the answer is yes; under federation the States have responsibilities for the rivers that run through them. Had I been allowed to proceed without interruption I would have said that nevertheless the only two great river systems in Australia, the Murray and the Darling-they are really only one system-have such national consequences, as I said in answer to a question earlier today, that of course there is a need for Federal-State co-operation. That is evidenced in the River Murray Commission. It is evidenced in the National Water Resources Council, of which I am a member. It is acknowledged in the national water resources programs and in a variety of programs in which the Commonwealth seeks consensus with the States to use resources to the best advantage. It is quite natural for the South Australian Minister of Water Resources to be apprehensive when he observes that States are continuing to develop along the tributaries irrigation projects which, in his perception, will draw off water-not simply interfere with the quantity of water-and by drawing off water will interfere with the flush and therefore alter the rate of salinity and turbidity in the journey.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact of the matter is that a time will come-and very soon-when no new water licences for irrigation can be permitted in any reasonable way by a State along the River Murray's tributaries, if the quality and quantity of the Murray are to persist. That is a nice question of judgment and it is a nice question of self-control and management that the States will have to exercise. The States, by their actions, have added to the problems. For example, the detreeing of areas along the Victorian reaches of the river and the use of water for irrigation have exacerbated the problem because the particular trees were salt-absorbent. So every State has a responsibility in this matter.</PARA>
<PARA> I can fully understand Mr Arnold's frustration and sense of indignation that this matter has not been resolved. I am not aware of what legal matters Mr Arnold may seek to pursue. That is a matter between him and others. As I have said, I read a statement in a newspaper by Mr Tonkin regarding gas supply but I took it to mean that he paralleled the fact that gas came from his State with the fact that he had a national responsibility and other States should share that responsibility. I believe that New South Wales will accept that national responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA> A number of discussions took place between Mr Tonkin and me, and no doubt between the Prime Minister and Mr Tonkin, regarding the future development of dams which may be used to store water high up on tributaries and therefore lower the volume and quality of water further down. I indicated that there will have to be discussions between the various States as to the general philosophy for the future of the development of irrigation dams. There is a limit to the amount of water available. As I have said, the real problem is not only the salinity, which sadly enough largely comes from Victoria, but also the drought conditions, the lack of water flow down the Darling River which would dilute the salt and so alleviate the situation. South Australia has a quantity of water asserted to itself. That is an established fact. I think the real worry that Mr Arnold has in mind is that any further irrigation or industrial grants-riparian rights-might result in damaging not only the quality of water but also the quantity of water. I take the whole matter seriously and am endeavouring to get it to a proper solution.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I do not know whether there has been any increase in the lobbying. I am aware that there always has been lobbying with regard to the issue of so-called double taxation concerning dividend paying companies. The Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System, as I recall, did hold a seminar at which public expression could be made and I am aware that at that Committee's hearings a variety of views was expressed and there was fairly strong lobbying, if that is the term, on the effects of this so-called double taxation. I think other comments were made about alternative types of arrangements that could be undertaken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Treasurer did point out earlier this year the cost of introducing a measure that would have the change envisaged by Senator Bjelke-Petersen. It would be a very considerable revenue cost and it is of such magnitude that the Government would need to be aware of the effect that it would have on the encouragement to small investors to undertake equity investment. It would need to outweigh the revenue that would be forgone under the present system. The material contribution that could be made by small investors to equity capital would be significant. Perhaps, as Senator Bjelke-Petersen has suggested, it may overcome some of our need for foreign capital in the development of some of our corporate structure. I think that there would be need to weigh these counterbalancing effects to see what the outcome of them will be. It may be that the Campbell Committee of Inquiry will report on such matters in detail sufficient to give us an overall picture of the effect of a change of this type. If not, I will see that the Treasurer is advised of the question of Senator Bjelke-Petersen and see whether he has any comment to make or any figures that may be able to be given to the honourable senator.</PARA>

Some of the banks mentioned by the honourable senator could well be among their number. Such expressions of interest, of course, do not constitute a formal application for authority to conduct banking business in this country. The long standing policy of Australian governments on this matter is generally well understood by foreign banks, as is the fact that this policy may come under review in due course as a result of the recommendations of the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System. I could not speculate on the motives that may be involved in any pending applications from certain Australian banks or foreign banks seeking the Treasurer's consent to merge their operations. That is a matter which, of course, would be before the Treasurer for his decision. It is not something on which I could speculate with regard to motive.

I therefore ask honourable senators who wish to take note of these papers to move only to take note and not to speak to such motion. My Whip has given an undertaking to the Opposition-one which I endorse-that during the first week of the Budget sittings the Government will allocate a significant part of a sitting day to the consideration of these and other reports presented to the Senate. I ask for the goodwill of the Senate. In that spirit I undertake that opportunity will be given to debate fully papers that are indicated as being considered important.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>In so moving I wish to make what I believe to be a number of relevant criticisms of the first annual report of the Australian Federal Police. Honourable senators may recall that an attempt was made to amalgamate the Australian Capital Territory Police with the Commonwealth Police during the period 1972-75. The government of the day was convinced of the need to merge those two units in such a way that the functions of the Commonwealth so far as police and public order were concerned could be more effectively carried out. That was a period of bloody-mindedness in the Senate and, of course, in both the House of Representatives and in the Senate that legislation did not obtain the support of the Opposition of that time. So it was not until 1979 that the Australian Federal Police was established. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition finds the first annual report unsatisfactory in that, whilst it gives some statistics about the factors relating to the amalgamation of the two forces, it glosses over to an amazing degree the problems that have developed because of the long period since the Parliament refused to take the step after it was mooted at the beginning of the 1970s. Consequently, there was in the minds of both the Australian Capital Territory Police and the Commonwealth Police at that time a feeling that something might happen and probably would happen. That created a degree of unease, confusion and concern in the minds of the officers and the members of both police forces. However, those feelings were sensibly resolved at the time the legislation received the approval of both Houses of the Parliament. The formal declaration incorporating the two groups into the Australian Federal Police took place on 19 October 1979. Of course, that was considerably more than 18 months ago. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the report tells us something of the functions and activities of the new force that has come into operation, it fails to deal with the actual position that exists in the Australian Federal Police. Very little has been done by this Government or by the responsible Minister to bring about the kind of harmony necessary, if this force is to do its work effectively, or to correct the problems involved in the merging of two separate forces. The Minister has been singularly inactive and unenergetic in attempting to assist that process. That has probably been brought about by several changes in ministerial control, but it has also been a weakening of the attempts to bring about some harmony. In fact, there has been a lot of discontent which is not referred to in the report; nor does the report make any reference to the differences that exist between the two forces. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst it could be said that there would be difficulties in any amalgamation of two distinct arms of an organisation, the fact is that the Minister has done very little to try to get the two associations to which the Australian Capital Territory Police and the Australian Federal Police belong to work in any spirit of harmony and co-operation. The annual report, presented to us by the Minister and expressing the views of Sir Colin Woods, the Commissioner, seeks to suggest that there are no problems at all as a result of the amalgamation. That is not the position. Therefore, it ought to be part of the responsibility of the Minister and of the Commissioner to tell the Parliament about the problems that exist within this organisation. We have a very absurd, odd and unacceptable position in which members of the force doing the same jobs, for example, are receiving different rates of pay. We have the situation in which old uniforms of the old force are still being worn. </PARA>
<PARA> One could therefore be confused about the passage of the legislation and the fact that these situations still exist 18 months after the merger has taken place. Identity cards have still not been issued after this length of time. The resignation rate from both sections of the old force-now part of the singular force-is still much too high, indicating a measure of discontent within the organisation. One can read the journals of the associations. After all, we still have the two separate organisations. I think insufficient initiative has been taken to get the two organisations together. Of course, inevitably there is some conflict as a result of the fact that the two organisations still exist. </PARA>
<PARA> One has only to read the journals which are available-I appreciate that honourable senators have so much to read that they would not be going out of their way to read the journals of the respective organisations-to see that there is discontent within the force and that the morale in the Australian Federal Police is at a very low level. There is no recognition or mention of this in the report. As I said at the outset, it is a glossy report. It does not give to the Parliament the information it ought to have about the difficulties. One can understand the difficulties that may exist in such a merger. There are problems about promotion, personalities and tasks which might have varied as a result of the creation of the new force which has set in opposite ways traditions and job procedures which hitherto had been carried out. </PARA>
<PARA> One can understand all that but one would have expected that there would have been some mention of these sorts of difficulties in the report. One would have expected that somehow or other the Parliament would have been acquainted with these difficulties so that it is not just left to the Executive to make a decision, if it so desires, on the basis of information that may be available to the Minister. After all, this is the Minister's report. It has his authority and his signature on it. The Parliament is being treated with discourtesy. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the Government, the Minister and the Commissioner to bring to the attention of the Parliament some of these matters which have been brought to my attention on the basis of communications sent to me by members of the organisation who have contacted me and from reading the letters published in the journals of the organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, there are different views about who is responsible for this unsatisfactory state of affairs. I will certainly not suggest that the leadership of one organisation is right or that the leadership of the other organisation is wrong. But there is bickering and procrastination. There are difficulties. A decline is taking place in the standards of the Australian Federal Police and morale in the organisation, because of the way in which the hierarchy within the new organisation operates, is not satisfactory. That is not in anyway to be construed as being an attack upon the rank and file of the organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> After all, the responsibility rests at management level. It rests with the Commissioner, the senior officers, the Government and, particularly, the Minister. We cannot afford to have a situation in which this state of affairs continues. I do not agree with the suggestion that the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Carrick) made at the start of the examination of the reports that we should put these matters off until August because I think they are still too important to be left for some debate that will take place in two or three month's time no matter how much pressure there is for the Senate to complete its business. The fact is that if we have this problem of time on our shoulders it is not the responsibility of the Opposition but rather of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, one would hope that the brief remarks I have made in respect of these matters will be looked at by the Government and by the Commissioner. I hope that the Commissioner will take the criticism in the manner in which it is given, that is to say that management has to accept some responsibility for the unsatisfactory state of affairs that exists in this new force, a state of affairs which must affect its efficiency and capacity to carry out its task. This is a period in which we have established a Federal police force to examine a whole range of new activities which need to have the attention of the Australian Federal Police. I am not talking now of the common sorts of law and order issues or of the civil issues with which citizens have to contend. I am talking about organised crime. I am talking about the deficiencies in the matter of drugs in Australia. After all the Australian Federal Police has the responsibilities now for what were previously those of the Narcotics Bureau. So little is said about that in this report. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst it is not our prerogative to pry specifically into these matters, nevertheless I do not think there would be too many people in the Parliament or too many citizens in Australia who would feel satisfied with the surveillance and protection of citizens and with the problems associated with drugs and narcotics in our country. So it is not just another report. It is not just a matter of accepting the nice words included in this report. It is a matter of the Senate fulfilling its proper role of surveying the activities of the Australian Federal Police. Because nothing in the report gives the Opposition any encouragement to believe that it is in a better position to deal with the problems of drug trafficking in our country, it regards the report as being very piecemeal, very inadequate and one which gives us an opportunity at a later date to debate the matter in much more detail than we have the time to do today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the last couple of sentences said by Senator Gietzelt that that part of the report which deals with drug trafficking is, to say the least, very superficial and hardly gives anyone who is interested in doing something about the problem much comfort. The matter is contained very sketchily on pages 20 and 21. I have listened with interest to what Senator Gietzelt said. The Australian Federal Police has problems which were built into the formation of the Australian Federal Police. Since I last spoke about the Australian Federal Police I have had the opportunity of meeting the Commissioner, Sir Colin Woods, and I am pleased to be able to say that the high praise that I was able to heap on him in previous debates, which I made from repute, I now can confirm after having met the gentleman in the flesh. He is a fine person and someone who, I have great hopes, will do something constructive in the direction in which he is charged, particularly in drug trafficking.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Very briefly I will just refer to something I have mentioned quite often in the last 14 years since I was first Minister for Customs and Excise in 1969. First, the illicit drug problem in Australia is increasing. Secondly, it has reached massive proportions and is growing yearly. There is a cannabis industry in this country which reaps profits of about $250m a year for organised crime. Illegal heroin dealings reaps about the same-about $250m in profits-for organised crime. Added to that is the illegal gambling which takes place mainly in New South Wales with police approval, Government approval and apparently with Opposition approval. It reaps another $150m to $200m a year for organised crime. That means that profits of something like $600m to $700m a year go to organised crime in this country. It never ceases to astonish me--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Young" NAMEID="HV7">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HV7">Senator Young</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A lot of those profits come from crime in the first place to give them money for those drugs.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3V4">Senator CHIPP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly; it is all interrelated. As I was saying, it never ceases to astonish me how legislators throughout Australia, both Federal and State, can be so complacent about a situation where organised crime is earning such money. One wonders whether any of the structures of our society are safe. Is any politician, any magistrate or any judge safe when a bribe of $100,000, $200,000 or $300,000 is petty cash in this area? Once again, I make an appeal to the legislators in this Senate and in this Parliament-probably in a futile sense, but I make it notwithstanding. No matter what sorts of law enforcement practices are instituted, no matter whether Sir Colin Woods turns the Australian Federal Police into the most ruthlessly efficient law enforcement agency in the world, at no time will we be able to prevent less than 10 per cent to 20 per cent of illicit drugs entering this country. Anybody who says that we can do better than that is a fool. That is the experience of every country which is battling against the importation of illicit drugs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was favoured to travel overseas in 1972 at the request of the McMahon Government to study this question. It is impossible even to contemplate law enforcement methods preventing less than 10 per cent to 20 per cent of such drugs entering Australia. I believe the logic is inescapable. If the supply of illicit drugs on to the market cannot be prevented, surely the only approach to the problem is to try to allay demand for the drugs. One wonders whether the policies that we follow throughout our community and in this Parliament, as well as in the State parliaments, allay in any shape or form the demand for illicit drugs mainly by young Australians? The debate on cannabis has raged in this country for 14 or 15 years. I wonder whether those who enjoy their social lubricants-whisky, brandy, sherry, wine or any other form of alcohol--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Georges" NAMEID="7V4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3V4">Senator CHIPP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I said social lubricant. After 14 years of disputation and public debate, has the Government any conclusive proof that the ingestion of cannabis in moderate quantities is as dangerous as the ingestion of alcohol for the body, the brain, society or in terms of the road toll? I have seen no statistics to indicate that those who promote the consumption of alcohol, who even defend the advertising of alcohol, have put anywhere near a conclusive argument about the harm that cannabis, in any of its forms, does to those who use it moderately as a social lubricant. Although this is not considered to be the policy of the Australian Democrats, I, for one, have reached the view that the arguments for the decriminalisation of cannabis have now reached almost unanswerable proportions. They ought to be considered on a non-party, non-political and non-point scoring basis because the drug trade is not bringing $250m a year to creatures who exploit our young and who exploit this law. One would only need to have read last week of the arrest of members of the international Mafia in Calabria and read of their direct associations with Australia and with the cannabis trade, to wonder whether we are not pursuing this course of stupidity ourselves. These creatures flourish, not necessarily because of the weakness of our young, but because of our hypocrisy. We are too frightened to attack something like the legalisation or the decriminalisation of cannabis because of the political implications.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Similarly, why should we also not look at the heroin problem? Does anybody here really believe that we can cure the massive heroin problem in this country by police action-by law enforcement? Time and again I have suggested to this Parliament that it should at least try a pilot scheme along the lines of the British experiment. In that experiment, people diagnosed as being addicted to the opiate heroin are allowed, on government prescription and under medical supervision, to have their habit attended to in a medical way. I am not persuaded that this is a cure-all for a social problem or even a medical problem. I know that when human beings have been addicted to heroin and even when the physiological addiction has been cured, weeks, months and years later, for no apparent reason, there is a reversion to the drug. This happens for no scientific, moral or sociological reason whatsoever. This may happen because heroin does in some way destroy the mental, spiritual or physical processes and makes a human being, once addicted, different altogether. I do not know the answer, but I do know that if an addict is under medical supervision and is being given doses of heroin in diminishing quantities, at least there is a fighting chance of containing that person's addiction. There is an excellent chance of putting the creatures, who make millions of dollars out of the addict's misery, out of business. </PARA>
<PARA> In many ways the British experiment has been successful. Where it has been unsuccessful is that the clinics that were constructed for the use of addicts were too far apart and too few in quantity. That meant that an addict, in some cases, had to travel for an hour and three-quarters in the morning for his morning shot and an hour and three-quarters back and then repeat that process in the afternoon. I would have thought that the way in which the program of heroin addiction was being administered, at least in philosophical terms, was unanswerable until, of course, Mrs Thatcher found a brillant way of destroying it. One has noted that Boots Chemist in Piccadilly Circus no longer attracts the midnight queues. Under the former policy, addicts could have some form of treatment in civilised circumstances. Boots now closes at 8.30 p.m. and it has large numbers of security guards to keep the addicts out. This thrusts them into the back streets to buy drugs on the black market. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that the suggestion I am about to make is almost anathema to politicians. I suggest that the Government legalise heroin for addicts. Just think what the do-gooders and the National Right to Life Association would say. These people would have an instant rush of blood to the head. They would attack us and say that this is politically unpopular. I ask those people whether their methods of law enforcement have made any dent at all on the problem. Are they likely to do so? Can they genuinely believe that doubling the force of the Australian Federal Police, Federal narcotics investigations or any other body will have any effect in the future? All I am saying at this stage, in speaking to the report, is that the old ways have not succeeded. Is it not time for politicians to have the guts, the courage, to be prepared to cop some flack from the narrow-minded, insular people in the community and at least to introduce a pilot scheme in these areas to see whether there is another way of preventing this kind of damage to Australian society?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak briefly to the motion, but, before doing so, I wish to respond to the appeal which the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Carrick) made concerning the presentation of papers. One can understand the appeal being made at this time. Nevertheless, I think the Government will have to appreciate that there are things to be said at the time when papers are presented and that it cannot postpone for five months the opportunity for us to say those things. What Senator Chipp had to say was important to him and to those who listened. Whereas the whole of his speech may not have been entirely relevant to the report of the Australian Federal Police, nevertheless, what he had to say was of vital interest to those in society who are concerned about the problems to which he referred. I say to the Government that, if an honourable senator wishes to speak to an item on the list of papers to be presented, his freedom to do so ought not to be limited to any extent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have seen the report. I looked through it because, since there have been several incidents in King's Hall of late, I wanted to see to what extent the Australian Federal Police were involved in the running of Parliament, just what sort of surveillance we could expect in the future and what has been the connection between the Federal Police and the security within Parliament House itself? What has been the relationship between the Federal Police and the Usher of the Black Rod and the Serjeant-at-Arms? I cannot see any mention of those matters in the report-not a solitary mention. There is a mention of the protection of VIPs. There is no mention of the work of the police within this Parliament. I believe that that is highly relevant, considering what happened today. Through you, Mr Deputy President, I say to the President that a debate needs to be held at an early stage on the role of the police within this Parliament, the role of the Usher of the Black Rod and the role of the supervisor of security in Parliament House. Where are we heading? In what way are we regulating the Parliament if it leads to such an occurrence as the ugly incident which took place in King's Hall today? What are the rights of a member of Parliament?</PARA>
<PARA> I moved across King's Hall today to try to separate some women and children from the melee that was taking place. In the course of doing that I was interrupted by the police. I endeavoured to speak to the people who were sitting on the floor of King's Hall. I was interrupted again by the police. One policeman told me to stand to one side and, in fact, put his hand on me to push me to one side. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7V4">Senator GEORGES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know whether he knew, but the Serjeant-at-Arms and the Usher of the Black Rod were standing by. I told the policeman that, if he continued his action, he would be subject to privilege, but he should not have needed to be reminded of that fact. Once I started to speak to those people, it was my right to continue to speak to them without interruption and without police dragging people away by the legs while I was endeavouring to convince them that there was a far better way in which their message could be conveyed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This matter has to be spoken on now. I speak on it in relation to this report because the police were in this place in great numbers. They dragged people out from this place violently. I do not know where the fault lies; nevertheless people were dragged out violently. The efforts of members of parliament-several endeavoured to intervene-were ignored by police. As I have said, a policeman endeavoured to frustrate me in my efforts. The look on that policeman's face conveyed that he thought I had no right to be there, that once he was given the order to shift people that was his order and he was going to shift them irrespective of what members of parliament wanted. Maybe that is his correct position. Perhaps once an order is given by the Presiding Officers, through the Ushers or the security organiser, a policeman must do his duty, but there is also a responsibility on a member of parliament, in the Parliament itself, that surely cannot be frustrated by a policeman. If I wanted to speak to those people on the floor, I should have been allowed to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> To come back to the report, I suggest that, within this report, should be a complete accounting of the role which the police play within this Parliament. I have argued previously that, in spite of the need for security in this place, there is also a need for people to move freely. I have argued against the over-presence of police. I notice that there has been some improvement. The police no longer do the work of attendants on the lower levels. The police are here to carry out what is called a double surveillance. People are scrutinised on the lower ground level and come under a second scrutiny on the ground level. I know that I may be defending the indefensible when I refer to the incident in the Parliament the other day when an egg was thrown in the Parliament itself, the first time that such an incident has occurred in many years. Surely that action does not mean that we should be walled in by glass as has now been suggested is in the mind of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). I put it again to the President, directly, that there needs to be a protection of the rights of all people, including those who are demonstrating today. It was said earlier that people could not move freely in King's Hall. That is not correct. There was a great deal of noise. The noise may have intruded into the working of both Houses, but surely that would have been far more acceptable than what followed when the order was given to remove the people who were creating the noise. </PARA>
<PARA> The security arrangements in this place have resulted from a reaction on the part of the Prime Minister and the Presiding Officers. It has been an overreaction. We pride ourselves on allowing people certain democratic freedoms and rights. Even though some may behave inordinately those rights should not be limited as they are becoming limited in this place. If there is a risk of some physical damage to us, let us take the risk. It has been argued that the risk is not only to ourselves but also to other people. Of course, that is a risk that we take in society today and, with increasing violence, it is an increasing risk but we should not succumb because of that to imposing added security and giving added authority and added power to the police. That would end up in such an incident as took place in King's Hall today-violence by one individual against another and an intrusion upon the rights of parliamentarians. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a fine balance here and the balance should be in favour of less surveillance and greater freedom. If some people abuse that freedom, we must accept that and not overreact to it. I feel strongly about this matter. I have raised it before. I feel very strongly about the Federal Police being invited into this Parliament today to do violence to individuals. I do not know where the position of the Usher rests. The Usher should have protected my rights. To a certain extent he did plead with me but he should have protected my rights to speak to those people who were in King's Hall. Was the Usher of the Black Rod exceeded, overruled or supervised in his authority? I would have thought that the Usher of the Black Rod, on behalf of the Senate, should protect the rights of parliamentarians and protect the rights of constituents through their parliamentarians. </PARA>
<PARA> Is it that the supervisor of security is senior to the Usher of the Black Rod regarding the organisation of this place? Is it the supervisor of security who says to the President that we shall do this or that and who advises him on these matters? Is he, not the Usher, the person responsible? So many questions are raised in one's mind because of the unedifying and disgraceful-it has been otherwise described in this place-spectacle in King's Hall. Many questions arise and many need to be answered. One thing I hope is that no matter what the provocation this situation will not arise again. </PARA>
<PARA> I remember when a group of Aborigines refused to move from the steps of King's Hall. They were obstructing entry into Parliament House because there was no entrance underneath. People had to move around them to get into Parliament House. That was an obstruction. Deliberations took place for an hour. Finally, the police turned around and looked the other way and the Aborigines got up and walked away. That demonstrated good sense. It took a long time and a considerable amount of discussion. The President was personally involved. Finally the matter was peacefully resolved. I should have thought that the incident in King's Hall today would have been peacefully resolved, not violently accomplished. I think it is a sad day for us all. </PARA>

<PARA>I will speak briefly. This is the first report of the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs. I have been privileged to become quite close to the activities of the Institute. I have had several discussions with the Chairman, Mr Frank Galbally, and the Director, Mr Petro Georgiou. I compliment the Institute for the work it is doing and welcome its first report. The work that the Institute does is most important for our multicultural society. Sometimes in this place we forget that one Australian in four was born overseas. Now there are about 80 ethnic groups which speak 60 different languages. The significance of the Institute's work is obvious from these figures. I am pleased to note that the Institute's first major research project is a review of multicultural and migrant education in Australia. We, as members of parliament, often take for granted that we know what the problems and answers are in connection with the very special area of migrant education. The fact is that we do not. I am delighted to note that this is the first major project organised by the Institute. I congratulate it for its report. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to make a few brief remarks. They will be brief, both because of the time constraint and also because, as usual, the report has been in the Opposition's hands insufficiently long enough to enable any very considered or reasoned response to be made. The report is about the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman. It is clear that that is a very important question because there are some very large exclusions from the jurisdiction which can presently be exercised by the Ombudsman. In the second report of the Ombudsman it was noted that some 11.4 per cent of the complaints received that year by him-that is, 443 out of a total of 2,680-were outside his jurisdiction. By the time the most recent Ombudsman's report was made-the third report-that figure had escalated to a much larger percentage, with 2,457 complaints being outside the Ombudsman's jurisdiction and only another 4,458 complaints actually being able to be investigated. So it was clear, and it is fast becoming increasingly clear, that it was necessary for this question of complaints felt to be legitimate to be able to be investigated. </PARA>
<PARA> What this report appears to do is to make a number of quite significant recommendations for an extension of the Ombudsman's jurisdiction, especially in relation to statutory authorities in competition with private enterprise and especially in relation to Commonwealth controlled companies and also in relation to a number of intergovernmental Commonwealth-State authorities and activities. I note that the report does not appear to be a complete analysis of possible extensions of the Ombudsman's jurisdiction to the extent, for example, that nothing is said about the Ombudsman's jurisdiction extending into the area of freedom of information matters. This, of course, was recommended by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs in its report on freedom of information wherein the recommendation was that the Ombudsman here have not simply an expanded, conciliatory and investigative role including matters in relation to ministerial decisions, but also an advisory role, a critical role and something of a monitoring role in relation to the operation of that legislation and, furthermore, a relatively unique role as a general counsel before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in relation to freedom of information matters. I simply note the omission of any discussion of this matter from this report and query whether there has been an independent review by the Administrative Review Council as to whether that body feels that this jurisdiction ought to be granted and, if so, query the absence of that report being tabled in the Parliament in time for it to form part of the materials before us when we finally get back to, as I hope we will this week, the Freedom of Information Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other matter I wish to raise with respect to the Ombudsman's report is that although this particular document tabled today deals only with the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman, it is in fact known that the Administrative Review Council has dealt with a number of other aspects of real significance relating to the powers and functions of the Ombudsman. Those other matters on which the ARC has reported have not yet been the subject of tabling in this Parliament. It is no secret that such additional work was done by the ARC because it has been referred to in some detail in the 1978-79 annual report of that body. </PARA>
<PARA> There are just two matters of this additional kind that I think need specific attention and, if possible, some Government response as to why nothing has been tabled in the Parliament in relation to them. First of all, there is the question whether or not the Ombudsman should have power to apply to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for an advisory opinion, there having been experienced a number of difficulties in that respect and there being a strong case-certainly I gather in the Ombudsman's view-for a clarification and an extension of his power in that respect, not least following debacles of recent years in the Ombudsman's dealing with the Department of Social Security and Mr Lanigan in particular. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter which has been raised in the past by the Ombudsman in his annual reports and which I understand has been the subject of ARC recommendation but which is not part of this document tabled here today, is the question of the power of the Ombudsman to apply to the Federal Court to get a determination as to the limits of his jurisdiction-again, a matter which achieved some notoriety and prominence in the context of the Department of Social Security and the resistance of that Department to claims by the Ombudsman to have such a jurisdiction. This is a matter which does seem to have caused practical difficulties for the Ombudsman. It is an area in which it would, apparently, be helpful were the legislation to be clarified. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I make the point that we are grateful to have this paper tabled at last, even in what appears to be its present incomplete form. A long time has elapsed since the Administrative Review Council made its recommendations on these matters to the Government. Indeed, I believe that the date on which this material was made available to the Government was August 1979, which is, of course, nearly two years ago. The most pressing need now would appear to be for a government response to the advice it has thus received from the ARC, a response which, I hope, in all cases will be affirmative. Mr President, I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the papers. </PARA>
<PARA>Item 19 is, in fact, two reports of the Administrative Review Council, one on the Commonwealth Employees Compensation Tribunal and another on the Social Security Appeals Tribunal, together with voluminous appendices to the second report. It is, I believe, worth while pointing out that the Commonwealth Employees Compensation Tribunal report was presented to the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) on 1 May and on 30 April the Lynch committee, the razor gang, incorporated changes in the administration of Commonwealth employees in line with these recommendations by the Administrative Review Council. So, it seems that there were obviously consultations going on at the time and, one suspects, probably last minute additions to the razor gang's decision on this matter. We believe it makes sense to transfer the jurisdiction of the Tribunal for Commonwealth Employees Compensation to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal which is now well established, has considerable authority and, in fact, is developing a very good reputation. The recommendations we particularly approve of include recommendation 1 which states:</PARA>
<PARA> There should be a legislative provision requiring Commissioner for Employees' Compensation to determine a matter as soon as practicable, but in any case, within 60 days of lodgment of a claim with the Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not believe that the justification for such a recommendation needs arguing here. Similarly, we approve of recommendation 2, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> The jurisdiction currently exercised by the Commonwealth Employees' Compensation Tribunal should be conferred on the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition believes there needs to be safeguards even in these circumstances for the rights of appellants such as Mrs Beattie, whom Senator Chaney knows, having intervened in her case. There is a need to ensure that appellants are protected in that they should not be penalised for being test cases against decisions in appeals by the Commonwealth which can use the powers and facilities available to it in such situations. We believe it is a good move that the razor gang, for instance, decided to pull together the administration of Commonwealth employees compensation, something which the Opposition, including me, has been advocating for some years. But all that is no good if the appellants to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal have to pay their own costs. We have been trying to get a definite answer from the Government for some time on this. We hope that in cases which are test cases there will be a standard procedure in future to ensure that people are not penalised or even prevented from taking out appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or any other body because of the costs involved and, particularly, in view of the inequality which will always exist when an individual is appealing against the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The report on social security appeals seems to have been a long time in coming to this Parliament. The appendices attached to the report, which are too voluminous for the Opposition to comment on in the time it has had them, represent investigations which were made in 1978, the findings of which are thus three years old. We have been making requests for a long time that this report come forward and I can see no good reason for such a delay. The Administrative Review Council which has in previous reports stated its dissatisfaction with the appeals system and the protection of the rights of social security appellants and clients, proposes a comprehensive system of external review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal of decisions in the social security area. The jurisdiction went to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in April last year and Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle announced these changes in September. So it appears again that this report has been held up and we would really like to know when the report was received by the Government and by the Minister and why it has been held up for so long. </PARA>
<PARA> The recommendations are comprehensive and, in our view, are well thought out. They include the power to make an order for an interim payment to an appellant who had been receiving unemployment or sickness benefit. They include reasons to be given to the claimant, either orally or in writing, for decisions taken by the Tribunal. Many recommendations pertain to the administration within the Department of Social Security such as: Pre-grant interviews where possible to get as many facts and figures and inform the claimant as to rights and responsibilities; interviewees' statements in departmental interviews should represent both the words and the context in which they were made; claimants should have an opportunity to rebut other material on which the Department might be making a decision; manuals should be freely available to the public and relevant parts given to the interested persons, a matter which has been a bone of contention in the social welfare area for many years; written notification to be given to the claimant as to the reasons for adverse decisions, the same responsibility to apply to the Commonwealth Employment Service as long as the CES has responsibility for the work test. The Commission also recommends legal aid for cases going to the presidential bench of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and that the Tribunal be empowered to award payment of expenses to applicants attending hearings. </PARA>
<PARA> We particularly commend the recommendations for the provision of advice and assistance to claimants in the social security appeals process which appear in chapter 7. This program has been recommended by the Council of Social Service and is very close to a recommendation I have been making over the last couple of years for welfare advocates to do this sort of job. Paragraph 7.002 states:</PARA>
<PARA> It was suggested to the Council that there was no special need to provide advice and assistance to claimants because many will be able to manage on their own account and because the DSS officers and voluntary welfare groups will be able to provide some help. </PARA>
<PARA>If, as I suspect, it was the Department of Social Security that made that suggestion at the time, it demonstrates again that the major welfare department in this country still remains in ignorance of the abilities and the circumstances of its poorest and least literate claimants, particularly in the situation in which they are appealing against bureaucratic decisions. It is ludicrous to state as an analogy, as this unnamed arguer did, that there is no provision for special advice and assistance before taxation boards of review. Social security clients, we suggest and the Council suggests, are in an entirely different position from the usual people going before taxation boards of review. Fortunately, the Council stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Council considers that advice and assistance are of such importance in social security cases that their provision should not be left to the chance that DSS officers and welfare groups will be available to assist in given cases. </PARA>
<PARA>It further states:</PARA>
<PARA> The difficulty many claimants will have in understanding and taking advantage of a review process is likely to be accentuated for groups facing special problems, particularly Aboriginals and migrants. </PARA>
<PARA>It demonstrates that the Administrative Review Council has a much clearer idea of the difficulties and disabilities facing the sorts of people who will receive social security payments in this country, the sorts of people who will receive any of the benefits and who may in fact depend on these benefits for the meagre standard of living they have. It is with some disturbance that one notes the argument that they do not need this because there is an analogous situation with those before taxation boards of review, which was put forward by the Department of Social Security. I shall quote some words of the Council in chapter 8 which I believe we should all take very seriously. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> In the Council's opinion, the present review system, even as modified recently by vesting a limited jurisdiction in the AAT (which, in itself, is a useful step forward), does not meet the foregoing requirements-</PARA>
<PARA>The report refers back to the necessary requirements-</PARA>
<PARA>and falls short of the standards accepted as appropriate in other areas of jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA>This is one of the problems. The normal standards accepted as appropriate in other areas of appeals somehow have been neglected in the area of social security. The report goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> The defects of the present system, in both principle and procedure, have been set out at a number of points in this Report. The proposal put forward by the Council should overcome those defects. It is a structure which is designed fairly to balance the rights of the individuals with the needs of sound administration and to be comprehensive. Each part of the proposal interlocks with the others in making a whole. If only parts of the whole were to be implemented, there would be a danger that the balance carefully struck might be lost. The Council expresses the hope that its Report will receive early consideration by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>Obviously, some of the Council's suggestions have been taken up by the Government, but we take up the Council's suggestion that unless one looks at this in an integrated way, unless, as it says, each part of the proposal interlocks with the others in making a whole, we will end up only with the inequities and the difficulties which arise in the present system. People reliant on social security benefits and on the Government for their welfare should be protected against arbitrary and unfair decisions by the bureaucracy. There are many other ways to improve the system. There are many other ways to ensure that experienced and knowledgeable people are the ones who deal with social security clients. But while we are developing that, we must have a fair and efficient system of appeals-one that cannot be ridden over by any director-general, by any Minister or by any bureaucrat at any level. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>In moving that the Senate take note of the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation annual report, I place on record that this development was an initiative of the Whitlam Labor Government. Newspaper reports speak very highly of this development and point out the great benefits accruing to the area as a result of the foresight of the Labor Government. At the same time as this project was initiated, so also was the Monarto Development Commission in South Australia which, unfortunately, is now in moth balls and may even be sold by the present State Liberal Government which at present is looking at every possible means to raise revenue in an endeavour to get itself out of the very severe financial troubles it is in. It is a real tragedy that the Monarto Development Commission had to be shelved. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very pleased that the Albury-Wodonga development project is going ahead in leaps and bounds and is conclusive proof that things initiated by the Labor Government in office from 1972-75 were very worth while. It is fortunate in many respects that we have a Labor State government in New South Wales. If it had been a Liberal government, this project might have got the axe as well and might have been treated as a white elephant as the Monarto Development Commission has been treated. No doubt the razor gang had a look at it and tried to do something about it. Nothing has been reported yet. I hope it will not be. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>My tabling statement, which I will later seek leave to incorporate in Hansard, not only reflects some of the recommendations in the report but also seeks to draw the attention of the community to some of the problems facing education today. The Senate will recall that our reference paid particular attention to literacy and numeracy. In this regard I invite the Senate to study our observations concerning much misunderstanding and disagreement in this area. We have called for dialogue between the areas of education, employers and the community. With the changes in demands which society is imposing, we have drawn attention in our report to changes in required skills and, therefore, changes in training and education. In the future there will be a broadening of the approach to education. Future curricula will become more diffuse and less recognisable as traditional subjects. This broadness of approach reflects the need for modern students to have a broad, comprehensive education which is adaptive and innovative as opposed to being stereotyped and segmented. </PARA>
<PARA> The report also gives attention to problems faced by the underachievers and early school leavers and their subsequent difficulty in entering the work force. This relates to their survival in society and particularly to the additional problems of unemployment. There are a number of recommendations in the report. My tabling statement extends some of these and makes general observations on this area of education. I commend the report to the Senate. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the tabling statement. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This report contains recommendations affecting some 16 major areas of educational concern. These areas range from the concern and responsibility of State and Federal governments, to individual schools, to individual teachers and, more importantly, to individual parents. These recommendations are not designed for the exclusive attention of education departments or governments; rather, they are a plea, indeed a challenge, to each and every one of us to accept the responsibility to improve the educational lot of our forthcoming generations. </PARA>
<PARA> For the continued well-being of a society it is incumbent on that society to monitor continually the standards and quality of the education it provides. Given the modern exponential growth in human knowledge and complexity of life, it is important and necessary for society not only to improve continually the existing success of its education system but also to provide for its future progress. This is necessary in order that the demands of modern society and the abilities of the younger generation are evenly matched. Thus society must consider not only the present but also the future. </PARA>
<PARA> In putting before the Senate these recommendations the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts believes that these recommendations are necessary if indeed the present and future effectiveness of Australian schools is to be improved, and the tragic loss to society of early school leavers is to be redressed. As the Senate may well appreciate, too often systems such as the education system may grow at variance with their basic aims or objectives. In point of fact the practice of education can diverge significantly from the theory of education; it is therefore important for an inquiry such as this to realign theory and practice. </PARA>
<PARA> The work of the Committee on this inquiry began in May 1979 when the Senate referred the terms of reference to the Committee. In the subsequent time that has elapsed the Committee has taken over 3,000 pages of Hansard evidence as well as taking evidence from 143 witnesses representing some 58 organisations. Senators will recall that during this time the work of the Committee was interrupted by the reference to the Committee of the Broadcasting and Television Amendment Bill 1980, insofar as that Bill related to the Independent and Multicultural Broadcasting Corporation. This inquiry took the Committee the three months of the 1980 winter parliamentary recess to complete. Again the work of the Committee was interrupted, this time by the 1980 general elections. </PARA>
<PARA> Hence this inquiry has been delayed not only by the dimension of the task but also by other important independent events. This report is thus the result of this extensive inquiry. The overall message contained in this report is that conclusions we have drawn from the evidence presented to this inquiry have once again confirmed many independent research findings which have been presented to both Parliament and to education authorities over the last few years. From evidence presented in the course of this inquiry, the Committee could conclude only that many problems largely in existence over five years ago still remain essentially unresolved today. It would appear that the education system has been unable to respond. The Committee would thus argue that, given the wide public importance and interest in education, there is a greater need for firmer and more positive leadership and action from both governments and education departments. </PARA>
<PARA> On closer examination, honourable senators will note that there are five central areas of discussion and concern in the contents of the report. The first and most general is the wide community disagreement, or at least, misunderstanding, over the purpose and philosophy of education. Whilst the most obvious disagreement over the purpose and philosophy of education occurred between educationalists and employers, this disagreement was usually expressed in terms of a comparison of the success or failure of students in the areas of literacy or numeracy and over differing generations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's concern, however, was not an academic question of comparison between today's and yesterday's standards, but whether present levels of literacy and numeracy could be improved overall, by improving the education system as a whole. The Committee was anxious that this evident disagreement be rectified as quickly and completely as possible. To this end, the first recommendation is aimed at stimulating a wider public debate. The second area of focus of the Committee was the plight of early school leavers. It is now well accepted that 20 to 25 per cent of students leave school without sufficient basic rudimentary skills in literacy and numeracy. Consequently, these young adults are educationally handicapped-many for their whole lifetime. </PARA>
<PARA> Literacy and numeracy are essential elements to any person's education. During the inquiry it became evident to the Committee that the foundations of these elements greatly involve the students' home background. The home and school in many ways complement and supplement each other. Failure of any one to reinforce the other leads to weaknesses in the achievement of this educational core, and in particular the achievement of literacy. Whilst much control can be exerted over the quality and type of education provided, little control can be effected over the students' home environment without the active support of the parents involved. Given such limitations of action, the Committee could only recommend that headmasters give greater priority to establishing a closer involvement with the students, and particularly the parents of under-achieving students. </PARA>
<PARA> Other recommendations which have a bearing on the overall improvement of literacy and numeracy levels are the heightened need for better trained teachers and the effective implementation of remedial programs, especially in the first two years of primary education. Furthermore, given that once teachers are appointed permanently to positions within schools there must naturally arise from time to time situations for which they have not been trained. Therefore, to ensure that teachers remain up-to-date with their teaching knowledge and methods in-service courses are essential. To this end the Committee has recommended the wider and greater use of such courses. </PARA>
<PARA> The next two areas to which I draw the Senate's attention relate directly to the teaching profession and methods by which its effectiveness can be improved. The secret of any good education system must essentially come back to the teaching effectiveness of its teachers. By strengthening the effectiveness of the classroom teacher, we are not necessarily guaranteeing learning success by the pupil, but at least we are placing the odds in its favour. The success of the system therefore depends on the interface between teacher and student. Thus, it is axiomatic that teachers should be properly trained and that the teaching environment within the school should be, as far as possible, positively orientated towards effective teaching. Therefore, the selection and training of teachers is vital. As well, an adequately trained teacher must be assisted in the execution of his profession by manageable class sizes, an effective and efficient school structure and, above all, be aided and guided by the experience and expertise of older teachers. The Senate will note that the Committee has made detailed recommendations in relation to these areas and includes recommendations specifically on school size and design, class size, teacher training and selection, and the effectiveness of the practising teacher as well as the leadership role of school principals and senior staff. </PARA>
<PARA> The last major area of concern to the Committee was the structure of the secondary school and the nature of the curricula in general. The Senate will note that the Committee has advanced recommendations relating to the restructuring of the secondary school system and to the introduction of a nationally recognised core curriculum, particularly in relation to the elements of literacy and numeracy. These recommendations place emphasis on those factors necessary to take the education system into the eighties and beyond. They are designed to place schools in a modern perspective and to reflect present and future trends of our society. </PARA>
<PARA> I consider it important to delineate between the compulsory and non-compulsory years of education. The youth of our nation are bound by law to attend school up until they reach an age of 15 or 16 years. It is within this time that society largely dictates the learning program these students will undertake. The culture, language and general societal characteristics are imparted within these years. At the finish of this period society says that this amount of education is sufficient for that person to function properly within the wider community. A person's educational coming of age is recognised at this point. It can be argued that within these years the emphasis on a competency in literacy and numeracy is the central characteristic of this education and that there is relatively little freedom for students to embark upon education programs of their own choosing. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from an increase in the provision of vocational orientated programs for early school leavers, it would appear that this situation will persist for quite some time. To provide the foundation of education will still be largely the responsibility on these first 10 years of education, while education for careers or professions will be centred upon the education of the latter years of high school and beyond. It therefore stands to reason that any future modernisation within these years will mainly concern itself with improving the delivery and effectiveness of the material taught but not essentially the substance of what is taught. </PARA>
<PARA> Conversely, the non-compulsory years of education, for instance, the latter years of high school and tertiary education, are at the discretion of the student. As well, students within these years are not primarily absorbing the culture or basic educational tools necessary for survival in the wider community. Instead they are studying at their own discretion in order that they may fulfil their own ambition. As such the curriculum and style of education within these years are totally different. As can readily be appreciated the curriculum of these years is much more sensitive to outside influences such as student fashion, technological change, unemployment and the economic realities of modern life. Thus within these years, high schools and other educational institutions must in this respect be more sensitive, more adaptive, more innovative and more forward looking than their earlier counterparts. </PARA>
<PARA> In mentioning curricula provided by these higher years of education, we naturally bring to mind the concept of material divided up into traditional subject areas. Yet this traditional classification may no longer be appropriate for today. As the Curriculum Development Centre has stated in its booklet Core Curriculum for Australian Schools-'Our traditional way of packaging knowledge into required subjects no longer satisfies either society or students'. In supporting this belief, the Committee believes that the future curriculum will become more diffuse and less recognisable as traditional subjects. Instead of strictly isolated subjects such as English and mathematics, we believe that modern schooling will gradually evolve to broader areas. For example, if the proposal put forward by the CDC is followed, English and mathematics would become communication, and mathematical skills and reasoning. This broadness of approach is thus reflecting the need for modern students to have a broad comprehensive education which is adaptive and innovative as opposed to being stereotyped and segmented. To accommodate these changes, institutions themselves will have to undergo change and reorganisation. In the future we can expect senior high schools to become institutions for responsible adult education as opposed to schools designed to pass or fail students or to grade them for tertiary studies. </PARA>
<PARA> In short, while I expect the early school years to undergo changes and improvement to the art of teaching, the latter high school years will undergo significant changes mainly to curriculum content and teaching structure. Senior high schools will increasingly offer a broader choice of courses to students. This does not mean less rigorous courses but simply a greater variety offered in a more adult climate and under adult style responsibilities. I commend the report to the Senate. It is a response to an area of concern which has both social and educational implications. As I observed when opening the inquiry:</PARA>
<PARA> 'Education should be united with life to find its mission in co-operation with work and therefore it should become the basis of social reality. This leads to the importance of lifelong education and its process within a human being who learns to express himself-to communicate and to question the world through his experiences and, above all, as a result of his earlier training. Man is an unfinished being and can fulfil himself only through constant and efficient learning'. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee therefore hopes that its deliberations will alert the community to the need for constant and efficient learning. The Committee places on record its sincere appreciation of the work of the secretariat. Attention to the detail of the many requirements of investigating a reference such as this have been faithfully and effectively carried out. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly to the motion because the report is on a subject in which I have taken special interest. The scope of the terms of reference of the report is enormous, but the Committee did not seek to re-invent the wheel or to repeat the many educational inquiries of recent years; rather it sought to give a focus related to actual reform in the education system in Australia. The report is to the point and quite brief. It has 36 pages and its 16 recommendations are quite explicit and affect every area of secondary education and indeed some other areas as well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will make two further points in my brief remarks. The first recommendation of the Committee directly encourages public discussion about areas of disagreement and misunderstanding that are still too prevalent in the community. In commending that recommendation, I suggest that parents' groups, employer groups and school staff rooms, indeed students, could very well extract the 8 pages of the relevant chapter and circulate it very widely in Australia for direct discussion. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter I refer to is that the two other substantial chapters of the report relating to the teaching profession and schools in new perspectives are directly to be taken up by the States in their education departments as well as by the Commonwealth and independent schools. I think it is not necessary for a Senate committee to make apologies for the fact that the findings of this report relate not only to the Commonwealth Government in actions that would flow from the report. There is very much a call for actions and a response by State education systems and by independent schools. Whether this action is taken through the Australian Education Council or in other ways, I know that the Senate in looking to the outcome of this report will be looking for action across the whole field of education in Australia. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>The Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, in tabling this report entitled 'The Constitutional Qualifications of Members of Parliament' presents to the Senate the results of a thorough examination of the constitutional provisions relating to the qualification and disqualification of members of the Parliament. This inquiry arose out of a private member's Bill, the Constitution Alteration (Holders of Office of Profit) Bill 1978, introduced into the Senate by Senator Colston on 15 November 1978. By resolution of the Senate on 7 March 1979, the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committeee was given the task of inquiring into the following matters:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the desirability to amending section 44 (iv) of the Constitution in the terms proposed by the Constitution Alteration (Holders of Office of Profit) Bill 1978 or otherwise; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the desirability of changes to other provisions of the Constitution relating to the qualification and disqualification of Members of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>On 28 February 1980, Senator Mason, by way of a motion in the Senate, sought a re-examination by the Government of:</PARA>
<PARA>the requirement, contained in Public Service General Order 3/D/4, that an officer or employee of the Public Service who wishes to nominate for election to a House of Parliament must resign 'before nomination' on the ground that the wording and effect of the provision may be contrary to the provision of section 44 (iv) of the Constitution, which provides that any such person, holding an office of profit under the Crown, shall be incapable of being 'chosen or of sitting' as a Senator or member of the House of Representatives, in relation to which a conditional resignation, contingent upon being chosen, might be regarded as sufficient. </PARA>
<PARA>On the same day Senator Mason's motion was amended so that, instead of a request being made to the Government for re-examination of General Order 3/D/4, the question was referred to this Committee to be considered in conjunction with the reference on the qualifications of members of parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Colston's Bill</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Colston's private member's Bill was prompted by his concern for the disadvantaged position of public servants and other public office holders, both Commonwealth and State, who wish to seek election to the Commonwealth Parliament. To comply with section 44 (iv) of the Constitution, and in line with the prevailing interpretation of the word 'chose' in section 44, all persons who hold an office of profit under the Crown must resign before contesting a Commonwealth election. However, except in New South Wales, the re-appointment of all such office holders is a discretionary one vested in either the Public Service Board or, in four of the States, in the State Cabinet itself. The effect of such a situation is to disadvantage severely public office holders who, in order to seek election, must place their livelihood in jeopardy. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst Senator Colston's Bill was the catalyst leading to this inquiry, the clear need for widespread changes to the constitutional provisions dealing with members' qualifications and disqualification, along with an anomaly in the amendment proposed by Senator Colston's Bill, have led us to recommend that the Bill should not proceed. We recommend, however, a comprehensive constitutional amendment to replace existing section 44 (iv). In considering this question the Committee has been guided by the following two clear principles: Firstly, any person who holds a State or Commonwealth public service position or holds a position with a Commonwealth or State authority should be ineligible to sit in Parliament; and secondly, there ought not to be any additional disabilities on State or Commonwealth public servants or office holders seeking election to the Commonwealth Parliament than those laid down in the Constitution. In consequence, we recommend a new section 44 which provides that State and Commonwealth office holders, as well as several other categories of persons, shall be deemed to have vacated their office at the time they become entitled to a parliamentary allowance. The effect of this, in the case of public servants, is to enable them to retain their employment until they are sure of their election to the Parliament. This will remove the present disability under which they suffer fear of loss of livelihood if they are unsuccessful in their quest for election to the Commonwealth Parliament. We also recommend a new section 45 which provides that, if a senator or a member of the House of Representatives accepts a position as a State or Commonwealth public servant or, without the approval of the Parliament, accepts a place with a State or Commonwealth public authority, he shall thereupon vacate his place. In the same chapter, we also discuss the ambiguous position of senators-elect, as well as the several categories of persons who are excluded from the operation of section 44 (iv) by the proviso to that section. </PARA>
<PARA>The Grounds of Qualification and Disqualification</PARA>
<PARA>Although the problems posed by section 44 (iv) commanded the greater part of the Committee's time and attention, the other constitutional qualifications and disqualifications in sections 34, 44 and 45 are also considered in detail in the report. The report initially deals with the matter of the qualifications of members of parliament and then proceeds to a consideration of the grounds of disqualification, each of which is the subject of a separate chapter of the report. I will briefly comment on each of these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The second chapter considers the qualifications of members of parliament contained in section 34 of the Constitution which have been subsequently superseded by section 69 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. These qualifications relate to age, residency, British subject status and entitlement to vote. We recommend that the last three qualifications referred to be deleted from the Commonwealth Electoral Act, and that age, and the new qualification of 'Australian citizenship' should constitute the only affirmative qualifications for membership of the Parliament. Chapter 2 also discusses section 44 (i), which disqualifies any person who has an allegiance to a foreign power, or is a citizen or entitled to the rights or privileges of a citizen of a foreign power. The Committee was concerned that this provision appears to place an absolute bar against persons with unsought dual nationality from nominating for, or sitting in, the Commonwealth Parliament. We recommend the deletion of the constitutional bar, but suggest some necessary safeguards to ensure that candidates and members of parliament have an allegiance to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Chapter 3 of the report deals with section 44 (ii) of the Constitution which disqualifies on the grounds of treason or because a person is under sentence or subject to be sentenced for a criminal offence where the offence is punishable by imprisonment for one year or longer. We recommend that the disqualification for criminal offences be deleted from the Constitution on several grounds, notably the considerable inconsistency in the setting of penalties for similar offences in the several Australian jurisdictions and because of its general inappropriateness as a yardstick for parliamentary disqualification. We do recommend, however, the retention of the disqualification for treason in an amended form. </PARA>
<PARA> Chapter 4 considers section 44 (iii) of the Constitution, which disqualifies candidates and members of parliament who become bankrupt or insolvent, and section 45 (ii), which vacates the seat of a member who takes the benefit of any law relating to bankrupt or insolvent debtors. Our consideration of these provisions made us particularly aware of their ambiguity and hence of the uncertain scope of their operation. Whilst these ambiguities could undoubtedly be rectified by appropriate amendments, we concluded that both provisions no longer serve any useful purpose. Because of changing social and economic conditions, including the community attitude towards bankrupt and insolvent persons, we consider that these provisions no longer indicate the suitability or otherwise of a candidate or a member of parliament, and we accordingly recommend their deletion from the Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA> The next two chapters consider the disqualification in section 44 (iv), that of holding an office of profit under the Crown, and the exceptions to this disqualification in the proviso to section 44 (iv). I have already referred to the issues raised in chapter 5 in my comments on Senator Colston's Bill. Another issue arises in the context of the proviso which excludes Ministers of the Crown from the disqualifying provision of section 44 (iv). However, the matter of Assistant Ministers has always been a vexed one. Chapter 6 addresses itself to the issue of Assistant Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries in the context of section 44 (iv) and other relevant constitutional provisions, principally section 64. Our report discusses, in their historical context, the difficulties which have been experienced throughout the existence of the Commonwealth in appointing and, more especially, adequately remunerating Assistant Ministers. Although we comment on several options which exist within the constitutional framework, we point out that our recommendations in chapter 5, which abolish the uncertain expression 'office of profit under the Crown', will, if accepted, remove the constitutional barrier to appointing Assistant Ministers or Parliamentary Secretaries. </PARA>
<PARA> The report then considers the pecuniary interest disqualification in section 44 (v), and the complementary provision in section 45 (iii), which is directed at professional services rendered to the Commonwealth or other services rendered in the Parliament for a fee. We discuss the meaning and likely interpretation of these provisions and comment on their uncertain but potentially wide area of application. The Committee concluded that the whole question of members' pecuniary interests is best dealt with by legislation rather than entrenched constitutional provisions and we recommend that the present provisions be replaced by a head of power enabling Parliament to legislate on the whole question of pecuniary interests and improper influence.</PARA>
<PARA> The final chapter examines the various procedural questions which arise as a consequence of a breach of sections 44 and 45 and notes the different effects of a breach as between the two sections. The mechanisms by which an alleged breach may be challenged, namely, sections 46 and 47 of the Constitution, are discussed, as is legislation enacted pursuant to those provisions. Some difficulties and anomalies relating to the various provisions are alluded to, and we make a recommendation in relation to the common informer provisions and section 203 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusions</PARA>
<PARA> From the brief comments that I have made on each of these constitutional provisions, it can be seen that the Committee has made a series of recommendations which, if implemented, will have the effect of removing almost all of the existing provisions relating to the qualification and disqualification of members and senators. Those few provisions whose purpose requires retention within the constitutional framework are, according to our recommendations, to be replaced by clearer and more explicit language. In deciding to recommend a substantial simplification of the constitutional provisions relating to qualification and disqualification, our motivation has been to achieve a less rigid arrangement so that the question of suitability for parliamentary office can be determined in accordance with changing social conditions. In many cases, we seek to achieve this simply be leaving the matter of a particular person's suitability to the judgment of the electorate. In others, our recommendations seek to deal with some aspects of the matter of suitability by means of legislation, which can, if necessary, be amended to meet changing social conditions and perceptions. Implementation of these recommendations will require substantial alteration of the Constitution which, of course, can only be achieved by means of a referendum. Our inquiry has revealed obscurities, ambiguities, inequities and anachronisms within this area of the Constitution. It is, therefore, desirable that they be put before the people in a referendum to enable the necessary tidying up to take place. I hardly need emphasise the relevance of this report to all honourable senators and to members in another place. Accordingly, I commend the report and especially its recommendations to the study of all members of the Commonwealth Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, in regard to this investigation and report, which has taken more than 18 months to complete, I pay tribute to the staff of the Committee-Mr Chris Fogarty, its Secretary, and Mr Tim Dodson, its research officer-for very meticulous work done over an extended period in a very difficult area of study. I also thank my colleagues. This is the last report that this particular Committee, this particular band, will present to the Senate as changes will occur. All of my colleagues have contributed well to the work of the Committee. I wish to refer particularly to the work of Senator Evans on this reference, in regard to which his special qualifications and interest have been of great value. Two members of the Committee will shortly be retiring from the Parliament and I will not have an opportunity of saying anything about them hereafter. I am thankful that the Honourable John Wheeldon has been a member of the Committee for a period. I mention especially Senator Chris Puplick, who has been a member for the last three years and who has played a tremendous part in the work on the various references that the Committee has had before it. I have in mind study of the freedom of information legislation and the reference that the Senate is now considering in particular. I believe that Senator Puplick has had the most outstanding record of any first-up senator. I hope that he will soon be back in the Senate to join the Committee and its work. I wish to pay an enormous tribute to him for the work that he has done as a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Consitutional and Legal Affairs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This report, in common with all of its predecessors from the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs with which I have been associated, comes forward as a set of recommendations agreed upon unanimously. That that is so is at least partly attributable to the chairmanship skills of Senator Missen, whose own contributions to the work of the Committee deserve considerable praise. I endorse the remainder of his remarks concerning the other members of the Committee except, given the constraints of modesty, those that he directed at me, and his reference to the contribution made by the staff. It ought to be said that the completion of this report turned out to be a much longer and more complex exercise than any of us had first envisaged when we took it on. The issues involved are extremely technical, difficult and intricate. At the same time they raise very large questions of principle of general public interest, not to mention, of course, of interest to members and senators of this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The origins of the exercise lay in a number of different directions. In the first place, there was that feeling of unfairness which has now become quite widespread and which Senator Colston first articulated as to the way in which the consitutional provisions were being construed and applied with regard to both Commonwealth and State public servants but in particular with regard to those State public servants in respect of whom there was no tradition or law requiring them to be reinstated once they had resigned to contest an election. The second concern was our strong feeling that a number of constitutional provisions governing membership qualifications were out of date, anomalous or likely to cause difficulties out of all proportion to the intrinsic importance of the principles they affirmed. One obvious candidate for those descriptions is the involuntary dual nationality situation to which Senator Missen explicity referred. </PARA>
<PARA> The third consideration underlying our report was our feeling that the High Court in the Webster case had not entirely distinguished itself, that the law in relation to pecuniary interests was in a very unsatisfactory state and that the community's judgment in respect of how to change it had not been sufficiently aided by the recommendations of the Bowen committee on pecuniary interests, which committee had left the constitutional questions largely untouched. The final basic concern was the continuing concern that has been expressed by a large number of people from the point of view of public administration; that is, the controversy, stretching back now for a number of decades, concerning the constitutional prohibition, if such indeed it is, on the appointment of assistant Ministers or parliamentary undersecretaries with some additional remuneration other than merely that by way of recoupment of expenses. That concern simply repeats that which has been expressed by a large number of commentators for a number of years-that to the extent that the Constitution did impose significant prohibitions, it represented an undue limitation on the flexibility of operation of the Executive Government and needed to be looked at. </PARA>
<PARA> In the event, the Committee has produced a report which makes a number of far-reaching proposals for both constitutional and statutory change. Those proposals essentially speak for themselves, although Senator Missen has very ably summarised their individual import. In conclusion, let me say, firstly, that I hope that individual members and senators will look at this report rather more carefully than they might normally be accustomed to doing with reports emerging from various standing committees in this Parliament because the matters raised in it are of intimate personal concern. The second point I make is that I trust that the Government will respond rather more promptly, not to mention favourably, than it has tended to do hitherto in relation to reports emanating from our Committee. Finally, I make the point that this report, if it is adopted, will require constitutional amendments in a number of respects to implement its recommendations. That strengthens very much the argument for another meeting of the Australian Constitutional Convention in one form or another relatively soon, a matter to which I adverted in Question Time today. I hope the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) takes aboard the implications of this report in that respect when he is discussing with the Cabinet the question of Commonwealth initiative or participation in a further session of the Constitutional Convention. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will detain the Senate only very briefly on this matter, mainly to thank the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs for its consideration and appreciation of the undoubted diminution of the rights of public servants in present practices. This is a matter on which I have had regular and continued representations over the years and I think it is something that is considered very much within the community. If something could be done about that in due course along the lines of the Committee's recommendation-I have not read the report yet, but Senator Missen has made clear what it intends-it would be welcomed by society. I am also rather interested in the recommendation concerning bankrupt and insolvent persons because the situation represents a weakness in many respects in the Constitution. Without having too many flights of fancy one could envisage a situation-personal experience inclines me to this view-in which a large organisation or a very wealthy individual, if they wished, could get rid of a member of parliament by forcing him into a situation in which he incurred very heavy costs as either plaintiff or defendant in a libel action. Costs in such matters now are alarmingly high and unless a person is extremely wealthy he may well involuntarily become bankrupt or have to seek that recourse. Indeed, a member of Parliament might lose his place or be induced deliberately to lose his place because of that one factor alone. I hope that this report of the Committee, which intends to clear some of the cobwebs of the Constitution that have become so irrelevant over the passage of time, will be considered seriously and will not suffer the same fate as many other reports from committees of this place. I would like merely to back up Senator Evans's comment that one hopes some further action will be taken soon to see that these enlightened ideas are brought forward.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak principally to see that the debate on this report will take place at some later date. Of course, I have not seen the report and all that I have had the opportunity to read at present is the statement brought down by Senator Missen. I have a particular interest in the report because, as Senator Missen said, the inquiry arose out of a private member's Bill which I introduced into this place on 15 November 1978. I had no idea when I introduced that Bill that such a comprehensive report would be furnished with respect to it. Of course, the report deals with more than the Bill which I brought forward-it goes much further-and, therefore, it is such an important report that I think we must debate it in this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At this stage I would just like to congratulate the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs for the work it has done. It has been remarked to me on a couple of occasions that, had I not brought down that private member's Bill, there would have been far less work for a few honourable senators. But I believe that the work they have done will not only take away that constitutional bar with respect to many public servants that I was aiming to take away but also it will tidy up a great deal of section 44 of the Constitution. It seems to me from reading Senator Missen's statement that other sections of the Constitution are involved as well. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not say anything further because I want to have the opportunity to study the report in detail and because I think we should be able to debate it in great detail in this place. I join with Senator Mason in expressing a hope that the recommendations outlined in this report do not end up like many other reports that come before this place and that eventually we will have a referendum throughout Australia to make sure that that section of the Constitution is in a more contemporary form.

They are included in the Senate Estimates Committees Hansard but not in the Hansard which is read by most people who are interested. I am very interested in an answer which came to me through the secretary of Estimates Committee C today. It is a matter I have been pursuing for a long time. I refer to what it is costing the Australian taxpayer to keep the immediate previous Governor-General in exile in London. I have been seeking to know, firstly, whether this gentleman has an office in London. The answer I got today, signed by Mr Wenger for the Secretary of the Department of Administrative Services, reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The answer to Senator McLaren's question about the cost of rent for the immediate previous Governor-General in London is now available. </PARA>

<PARA>It is costing the Australian taxpayer $16,416 a year just for the rent of an office. A quick calculation shows that that is what this Government is prepared to pay to about three pensioners in this country. </PARA>

I think that it is quite outrageous that this Government is prepared to pay that amount of money. I am very pleased that at long last the Government has seen fit to answer the question which I have posed at Estimates committee meetings for a long time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That brings me to the other matter I have raised in the Estimates Committee which deals with the Department of Administrative Services and the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet-that is, whether this gentleman is provided with a free telephone. It goes without saying that if the taxpayers are funding office space in London for this gentleman, the office certainly must have a telephone in it. It would not be an office without any communications system. The Senate will recall my many requests that details in respect of the telephone services of the immediate previous Governor-General in London be provided by the Fraser Government. The Government has always refused to say whether a telephone service is provided and, if so, at what cost to the Australian taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA> I now have given notice of a motion-it is on the Notice Paper-dated 26 November 1980. I look forward to that motion coming on for debate when the parliamentary sittings resume in the Budget session. The Government will then not have the numbers to carry motions in the Senate that Government Business take precedence of General Business on Thursday evenings. I live in hope that immediately Parliament resumes many of these notices of motion on the Notice Paper will come forward for debate and we will be able to get some information from the Government as to what it is costing. In short, I will conclude by reading the terms of my notice of motion. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Senate views with great concern the continued refusal of the Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, to answer repeated calls from Senator McLaren for information as to whether he has provided the previous Governor-General with a free telephone service between Great Britain and Australia and, if so, what has been the total cost to the Australian taxpayer. </PARA>
<PARA>As I said in my opening remarks, it is quite obvious that a telephone must be in the office. The Government would not be paying over $16,000 a year just to rent the office. Of course, there must be many other costs that go with it. There are the costs of furniture, lighting, cleaning and everything associated with running an office which no doubt are being met by the Australian taxpayer. With that letter was an attachment giving an answer to a question asked by Senator Gietzelt. To save the time of the Senate, instead of reading the answer into Hansard I seek leave to have the two-page letter provided by Mr Wenger, dated 29 May, incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>On 23 November 1978, the Senate referred the following matter to the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources:</PARA>
<PARA> The replacement of petroleum-based fuels by alternative sources of energy with regard to: (a) research into alternative fuels;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) development and demonstration of practical alternatives; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) fiscal and other measures required to encourage their adoption. </PARA>
<PARA>In addition the Committee decided to include the effects of conservation as part of its reference. As the Minister responsible for national energy policy, it is my responsibility to make a statement to the Parliament detailing the Government's response to the report of the Committee, which was tabled on 18 September 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me first congratulate the Committee on a most comprehensive report which I believe is a generally fair and objective assessment of Australia's energy problems, an area in which it has been often difficult to obtain bipartisan agreement. In particular I wish to draw the attention of honourable senators to the conclusion of the Committee concerning the Government's import parity pricing policy:</PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the Committee acknowledges that the Government's world parity pricing policy covers both old and new oil the significant feature is that all future discoveries in Australia will be covered by world parity pricing and this assurance provides the framework and incentive for further exploration and for the development and introduction of viable alternatives. The Committee supports a world parity pricing policy for crude oil in order to secure access to imports of crude oil, to encourage exploration and the development of alternatives and to promote conservation. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee's report identifies Australia's major energy problem as an approaching problem of liquid fuel supply, particularly as it might affect certain sectors of the economy-mining, transport and agriculture-where substitution by non-liquid energy sources is difficult or impossible. In this assessment of Australia's energy situation, the Committee is broadly in accord with the perceptions and actions of government. The report made 34 recommendations. With the concurrence of the Senate, I incorporate in Hansard a summary of the report's recommendations and the Government responses to them. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE ON NATIONAL RESOURCES</PARA>
<PARA>Report on Replacement of Petroleum Fuels: Schedule of Government Responses to Report's Recommendations</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA> 1. NEAC's fuel economy goals be introduced as mandatory requirements on a fleet average basis for cars and station wagons. </PARA>
<PARA>Government response</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has indicated it prefers a voluntary approach to vehicle fuel economy goals. Regulations should be considered if the goals are not achieved.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA> 2. A fuel consumption program should be established to facilitate fuel conservation in the road haulage industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Government response</PARA>
<PARA> The Departments of National Development and Energy and Transport are currently co-operating in preparatory work aimed at the development of a voluntary fuel economy program for trucks and buses. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Protection for the motor industry be reviewed with the object of applying a more direct competitive stimulus to the local industry to adopt advanced fuel efficient technologies; the removal of quota restrictions on car imports and variation of local content regulations should be the first steps in such a review. </PARA>
<PARA>Government response</PARA>
<PARA> Protection for the local motor vehicle industry up to 1984 was the subject of a recent Government announcement (3 December 1980). Energy conservation will be one factor considered when post 1984 policies are formulated. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA> 4. A graded sales tax on engine size or power output be introduced to discriminate against large engined or less fuel efficient vehicles with the lowest rate applying to very economical small cars. </PARA>
<PARA>Government response</PARA>
<PARA> Under the impact of more realistic fuel prices, consumer preferences have already moved strongly in favour of more fuel efficient vehicles. No further action of the type suggested by the Committee is considered warranted at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA> 5. A continuing publicity campaign aimed at heightening public awareness of the need to conserve fuel and the methods by which that may be accomplished be conducted by the Commonwealth and State Governments. </PARA>
<PARA>Government response</PARA>
<PARA> During 1980-81, the Commonwealth is contributing $1 million to the continuing conservation publicity program. The States (except W.A. and Queensland) are supplementing this expenditure. No increase in expenditure is considered to be justified in 1980-81. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA> 6. The Australian Transport Advisory Council (ATAC) inquire into and make a recommendation on the abolition of standing charges applying to motor vehicle ownership. </PARA>
<PARA>Government response</PARA>
<PARA> To abolish standing charges imposed by the States, an increase in fuel taxes would be necessary. The proposal is under consideration in a number of States.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA> 7. Comprehensive national standards for the manufacture and use of LPG vehicles be prepared as a matter of urgency. </PARA>
<PARA>Government response</PARA>
<PARA> A new comprehensive standard is expected to be printed in 1981. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA> 8. The Commonwealth Government require the oil companies to produce an automotive LPG which meets the requirements of the motor industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Government response</PARA>
<PARA> It is not within the powers of the Commonwealth to require the oil companies to produce LPG of a particular specification. However, the matter of determining a fuel specification for LPG is receiving attention from a joint industry committee. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA> 9. LPG be made eligible for the rural freight subsidy. </PARA>
<PARA>Government response</PARA>
<PARA> In view of the subsidies already announced for household and traditional commercial and decentralised industrial LPG users, it is not considered appropriate to act on this recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA> 10. The Commonwealth Government through the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Council (NERDDC) and the Australian Transport Advisory Council promote research into, and practical application of, advanced traffic management techniques. </PARA>
<PARA>Government response</PARA>
<PARA> In view of current activity in ATAC and support by NERDDC in this area, no additional promotion is considered necessary. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA> 11. The Commonwealth Government take the initiative in formulating with the States a national policy to facilitate and encourage the development of electricity co-generation by Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Government response</PARA>
<PARA> Because of the responsibilities of State Governments for electricity supply, this recommendation should be considered in an appropriate Commonwealth/State forum, e.g. the Australian Minerals and Energy Council (AMEC). The question of co-generation shall be placed on the agenda for the next AMEC meeting. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA> 12. The Commonwealth through the Department of Productivity become involved in providing energy audits and related advice to industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Government response</PARA>
<PARA> No further action is considered necessary to supplement the existing activities of the National Industrial Energy Management (NIEM) scheme, the National Energy Conservation Program, the Standards Association of Australia and State authorities. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA> 13. Increased emphasis be given to research and development into coal combustion in general and particularly fluidised bed combustion and electricity generation using magneto hydro-dynamics. </PARA>
<PARA>Government response</PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth support for these technologies as for other technologies, should be determined within the framework of the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration (NERDD) Program, taking note of support provided by other organisations. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA> 14. The Commonwealth Department of Housing and Construction initiate the establishment of an Australia-wide information service, in co-operation with the States, dealing with energy conservation in buildings. </PARA>
<PARA>Government response</PARA>
<PARA> The Departments of Housing and Construction and National Development and Energy are currently examining the subject of energy conservation in buildings and the appropriate role for the Commonwealth to play in promoting further conservation in buildings. Arising out of that examination a proposal for appropriate Commonwealth involvement will be made at a later date. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA> 15. The Department of National Development and Energy, in consultation with the oil industry investigate the optimum means of developing hydrocracking capacity in Australian refineries. </PARA>
<PARA>Government response</PARA>
<PARA> Government involvement in determining which technology option of oil refiners choose to meet changing market requirements is not considered to be warranted.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA> 16. The Commonwealth vary the excise rate applying to 89 to 92 octane petroleum to establish a clear 2 or 3 cents/litre price advantage over super grade (97 RON) petroleum. </PARA>
<PARA>Government response</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of National Development and Energy has this option under active review. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA> 17. A research project to establish the relationship between lead additives, fuel economy and exhaust emissions under normal usage be set up as a matter of urgency by the Commonwealth Government. </PARA>
<PARA>Government response</PARA>
<PARA> This study has been performed by the Committee on Motor Vehicle Emissions (COMVE). The study was considered at the February 1981 ATAC meeting. The introduction of lead-free 91.5 octane petrol and the use of catalytic converters was endorsed by that ATAC meeting as the optimum technology for meeting vehicle emission goals. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA> 18. The opportunity be taken to examine thoroughly the environmental, social and economic impact of the Rundle shale oil project with the object of resolving points which are in dispute and producing a standard set of guidelines on these matters which will enable future similar projects to proceed in a context of predictability as to Government requirements and intention. </PARA>
<PARA>Government response</PARA>
<PARA> The updated information contained in the Commonwealth environmental impact statement on Rundle will permit informed examination of the environmental, social and economic implications of the Rundle oil shale project when it becomes available. At the same time it will be possible to evaluate to the general applicability of guidelines established for its preparation, to other projects of this type. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA> 19. Hydrocarbon plants to be given a very high priority and emphasis in future research, development and demonstration funding and that a combined approach by the Commonwealth and the State Departments of Agriculture be encouraged. </PARA>
<PARA>Government response</PARA>
<PARA> Under the 1980-81 NERDD Program, support will be provided for an overview feasibility study in this area. The second part of the recommendation has been drawn to the attention of the Australian Agricultural Council. No additional action is considered necessary. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA> 20. The Government establish a large-scale demonstration project involving the actual operation of vehicles using blended fuels with the object of clarifying the effect of those fuels in areas such as fuel consumption, exhaust emissions and driveability. </PARA>
<PARA>Government response</PARA>
<PARA> As part of the NERDD Program, investigations into the suitability of using alcohol fuels in vehicles have been supported. Shell and CSR are also test marketing an alcohol/ petrol blend in Queensland. No supplementary action is considered necessary at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA> 21. NERDDC increase its support of research into cultivation and selection of vegetables oils as fuel crops and their utilisation in diesel engines. </PARA>
<PARA>Government response</PARA>
<PARA> Through the NERDD Program, substantial funds ($270,000) have been made available for research into the production and use of vegetable oils as fuels. No further funding is considered warranted at this time. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA> 22. The feasibility of small-scale vegetable oil extraction plants suitable for on-farm use be examined. </PARA>
<PARA>Government response</PARA>
<PARA> Under the NERDD Program, nearly $68,000 has been committed to developing improved methods of vegetable oil extraction, suitable for on-farm use. CSIRO and BAE studies indicate that, except in the case of isolated properties, on farm production of oil from oilseeds is currently economically unattractive. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA> 22A Research gives emphasis to crops that do not compete for land with existing food crops. </PARA>
<PARA>Government response</PARA>
<PARA> CSIRO research results indicate that significant quantities of oilseeds can be grown in the cereal belt without prejudicing existing crop production. Implementation of this recommendation may restrict Australia's potential to meet liquid fuels requirements from biomass, and may eventually distort the balance between land use for meat and fibre production and that used for crop production. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA> 23. NERDDC direct funds to research into the large-scale production of hydrogen and into hydrogen hydrides. </PARA>
<PARA>Government response</PARA>
<PARA> Hydrogen research is accorded a lower priority under the NERDD Program. Some projects involving production and storage of hydrogen are being supported. No further action is considered warranted at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA> 24. The Commonwealth in conjunction with the State Governments should take a more positive role in initiating and encouraging research development and demonstration in specific areas which are considered to be in the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA>Government response</PARA>
<PARA> The NERDD Program has provided nearly $60 million for energy research within the framework of established national priorities for energy R&amp;D. Additional action is not considered warranted. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA> 25. Research and development into electric vehicles receive a high priority and that support be provided for demonstration programs for small passenger/commuter vehicles as well as for commercial vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA>Government response</PARA>
<PARA> R&amp;D into electric vehicles already receives a high priority under the NERDD program. Support for demonstration programs for small passenger/commuter vehicles will be considered when suitable technology becomes available. No change to these arrangements is considered warranted. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA> 26. Steam engine development for both stationary and automotive purposes receive a higher priority for development and demonstration funding. </PARA>
<PARA>Government response</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth has provided substantial assistance for the development of steam engines. Because of the poor performance of the engines so funded, NERDDC has not supported additional steam engine projects. No further action is considered warranted. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA> 27. The use of pipelines in Australia for slurry applications be encouraged in future resource projects. </PARA>
<PARA>Government response</PARA>
<PARA> A number of investigations into pipeline transport of coal are already underway. No additional Government involvement is warranted at this time. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA> 28. The operation of Section 73A of the Taxation Act should permit deductability for demonstration projects leading to commercial production. </PARA>
<PARA>Government response</PARA>
<PARA> The operation of Section 73A of the Taxation Act already provides significant support to R&amp;D. No further concessions for incorporation into the Section are warranted at this time. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA> 29. Greater emphasis should be given to development and demonstration projects in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Government response</PARA>
<PARA> Considerable support is already being provided for such proposals under the NERDD program. However, demonstration projects aimed primarily at commercialisation, as distinct from assessing technical feasibility, are mainly the responsibility of private enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA> 30. At the Commonwealth level a joint consultative group be established by the Department of National Development and Energy to provide a formal mechanism by which other Commonwealth Departments can be directly involved in the formulation, implementation and review of the Commonwealth's energy policy. </PARA>
<PARA>Government response</PARA>
<PARA> Existing channels of consultation between Departments on energy issues are considered to operate in a satisfactory manner and no additional consultative group is considered necessary. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA> 31. The need for the large number of advisory bodies be reviewed. </PARA>
<PARA>Government response</PARA>
<PARA> Any reduction in the number of specialist advisory bodies would deny the Government the specialist technical advice essential to the proper formulation of energy policy. Larger resources of Commonwealth staff might well be required to maintain the quality of advice to the Government currently provided by these advisory bodies. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA> 32. The Australian Minerals and Energy Council be restructured as the principle mechanism and forum for the development and implementation of co-ordinated energy policies in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>Government response</PARA>
<PARA> AMEC could not be reorganised without the full agreement of the States; in practice this could prove extremely difficult. Current arrangements for AMEC have been working satisfactorily, and there would appear to be no good reason for proposing changes to the States. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA> 33. The Income Tax provisions in relation to Section 73A, investment allowances and concessions to individuals, be reviewed. </PARA>
<PARA>Government response</PARA>
<PARA> The Government already provides substantial taxation concessions for various users. The Government considers that no further concessions are warranted at this time. </PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA> 34. The application of the existing customs duty criteria be changed so that cases where no genuine local equivalent is manufactured in Australia can be identified and permitted duty free entry. </PARA>
<PARA>Government response</PARA>
<PARA> A provision already exists to allow imported goods to be entered at minimum duty rates when suitably equivalent goods are not reasonably available from local production. It is considered inappropriate to extend these provisions to give additional concessional treatment to energy conservation measures at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA>Many of the report's recommendations are broadly in line with current Government initiatives. Others, such as recommendation 17 dealing with the relationship between lead additives, fuel economy and exhaust emissions, have been acted on already and, in some instances, circumstances have changed so as to make the Committee's recommendations inappropriate. Yet others have some attractive features and indeed have been proposed in the past. Indeed, many of them have been examined by governments, but have had to be rejected because of difficulties that would be encountered in implementation or because of irreconcilable conflicts with existing policies. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, any review of government liquid fuels policy must take into account related issues such as exploration for and development of conventional oil reserves, oil depletion policies, and liquid fuels stockpiling policy. Such policies must be integrated with other government policies, including policies concerning energy related resource development, employment and industrial policies, and inflation and general economic policy. Of necessity however, the Committee's terms of reference could not cover all these issues. The major issues covered by the report can be discussed in the context of existing government policies designed to improve liquid fuel supplies and develop a diversified energy base. These policies cover four main areas:</PARA>
<PARA> the conservation of liquid fuel supplies;</PARA>
<PARA> the substitution of more abundant energy sources, such as coal and gas, for liquid fuels;</PARA>
<PARA> the stimulation of exploration for, and development of, Australia's remaining oil resources; and</PARA>
<PARA> the encouragement of the development of alternative liquid fuels. </PARA>
<PARA>Conservation</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Although strictly outside its terms of reference, the Committee justifiably considered conservation as an area of major importance. It supported the Government's import parity pricing policy as an important instrument for stimulating conservation. The success of Government policies in promoting conservation and substitution out of liquid fuels is already apparent. During the period to 1978 growth in petroleum product consumption averaged 2.3 per cent per annum. In 1979, that is, after the introduction of full import parity pricing, that growth rate dropped to 1.4 per cent and in 1980, consumption fell by 4.4 per cent. Taking into account the strong economic growth in recent years-3.5 per cent in 1979, and over 4 per cent in 1980-and the generally recognised short term inelasticity of petroleum product use, these results are a very pleasing indication of the success of the import parity pricing policy. As other non-pricing measures, such as motor vehicle fuel economy goals, begin to take effect, further substantial savings can be expected. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the report recommended greater government activity in areas such as publicity, public information and education, and energy audits. This is consistent with recent Government initiatives. The 1980-81 Budget approved an allocation of $1m to continue the National Energy Conservation Program, $1m for the Energy Policy Information Program, and $0.5m for the first year of the National Industrial Energy Management Scheme. I shall be proposing that these programs be continued in 1981-82. </PARA>
<PARA>Substitution</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Committee again acknowledged the primary role of Government pricing policy in stimulating substitution. The Government has a number of other, complementary policies in place to encourage substitution. These include tax concessions for industrial and commercial users converting from oil to other energy sources such as coal or solar power. In addition, a range of pricing and fiscal measures directed at encouraging liquefied petroleum gas use in automobiles were announced on 8 April 1980. These pricing arrangements have provided an attractive incentive for automotive LPG use in high mileage vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA>Exploration</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Although the Committee's report does not deal with this subject, a brief mention of it here is essential because of the importance of new oil production to our liquid fuel position. The Government's commitment to full import parity pricing, free of levy, for 'new' oil, coupled with various tax concessions, have been dramatic stimulants to oil exploration activity. Expenditure on oil exploration and development is estimated to be $1,400m in 1981, compared with $781m in 1980 and $430m in 1979. A substantial expansion in Australia's oil reserves has occurred both from new discoveries and additions arising from the fact that higher prices have enabled the development of oil pools previously considered uneconomic. The result of these factors is shown in the fact that our reserves of crude oil at 30 September 1980 were, at 283.88 million barrels, 5.8 per cent greater than they were at the end of 1978 and 33.5 per cent greater than they were at the end of 1976. </PARA>
<PARA>Alternative Liquid Fuels</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> While the Committee discussed the area of alternative liquid fuels at length, few specific recommendations were made. However, since the tabling of the Committee's report, an informative and comprehensive report on this subject has been published by the National Energy Advisory Committee. This report 'Alternative Liquid Fuels', released on 2 February 1981, is a realistic assessment of the hurdles to be overcome before the alternatives to crude oil become a reality on a large scale. Although the barriers to synthetic fuel development are considerable, the policies of the Government have led to interest by private entrepreneurs in alternative fuel development in Australia, particularly in shale oil and coal liquids. In addition to the incentive provided by pricing policies, the Government has in place a number of measures which stimulate alternative fuel development, including tax concessions, facilitating the provision of infrastructure, considerable research and development support, and specific measures to encourage smaller scale alternatives such as LPG and ethanol. The activity being carried on by such groups as Nippon Brown Coal Limited, BHP, CSR, the Australian Coal Corporation and the Rundle partners is clear indication that these policies are having the desired effect. </PARA>
<PARA>Research and Development</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Committee devoted considerable attention to energy research, development and demonstration, particularly areas of energy research which should receive Commonwealth support through the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration-NERDD-program. Almost all the areas identified by the Committee as requiring sustained research and development funding are receiving support under the NERDD program, with the exceptions of steam power and hydrogen. Funds under the NERDD program are allocated according to a set of priorities. These priorities were determined only after extensive consultation with over 150 organisations having an interest in energy supply, demand, end-use and research and development. The NERDD program is developed on the recommendations of the NERDD Council, an independent body consisting of persons drawn from a wide range of business, government and research organisations. Under these circumstances, it is not clear that a case has been made for changing the workings of the NERDD program. The Committee's views will, however, be taken into account when the next review of the NERDD program is made. </PARA>
<PARA>Energy Policy Machinery</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The Committee made a number of recommendations relating to energy policy machinery. It suggested for instance that there was a need to review the number of committees providing advice to the Government in the field of energy policy. Any reduction in these advisory committees would deny me, as the responsible Minister, and the Government, the specialist technical advice essential to the proper formulation of energy policy. Such a reduction might well be self-defeating in that larger resources of Commonwealth staff might be necessary to maintain the quality of advice to Government currently provided by these advisory bodies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also recommended the creation of a joint consultative group of Commonwealth departments to consider energy issues. The Government considers that existing channels of consultation between departments on energy issues operate in a satisfactory manner. In view of the Committee's concern on the duplication of energy policy machinery in the Commonwealth area, the Government has decided not to implement this recommendation. The Senate Committee also recommended strengthening the Australian Minerals and Energy Council- AMEC-as the forum for co-ordinating energy policies in Australia. AMEC meetings are, however, already generally structured to facilitate consideration of energy issues and the current arrangements for AMEC are working well. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Government recognises the crucial importance of liquid fuel supply in the coming decades. It welcomes the inquiry by the Senate Committee in this area and is acting on several of its recommendations, while keeping a number of others under active review. The outlook for Australia's liquid fuel self-sufficiency is considerably improved on forecasts made only a few years ago. Growth of demand in the next two decades is now likely to be lower than was previously estimated, due to higher oil prices and to the impact of the Government's substitution and conservation policies. Oil exploration has increased significantly in recent years and significant additions to oil reserves have been made. Synthetic fuel projects, such as oil shale development and coal liquefaction, will provide additional liquid fuel resources in the 1990s and beyond. These developments will assist in helping to maintain a relatively high degree of self-sufficiency in liquid fuels through to the turn of the century. However, the continued application of government policies, particularly pricing, supplemented where appropriate with other measures, will be necessary if reality is to meet expectations. As the Committee correctly pointed out of course, the secure supply of liquid fuels to Australia's industries must remain a key area of Government concern for the foreseeable future. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the statement. </PARA>
<PARA>I will speak very briefly because I understand that the Government will make time available for a proper debate on this report later. I want to make just two points. Firstly, there are several references in the statement of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) to the Government's policy of import parity pricing for newly discovered oil. The implication is that that policy was originally one of the Fraser Government. Such reinterpretations and misinterpretations of history are quite common. The plain fact, of course, is that the policy of paying import parity prices for newly discovered oil-less at that stage only what is now a fairly insignificant levy of $3 a barrel-dates from the middle of September 1975, and was initiated by the last Federal Australian Labor Party Government. It was carried on by this Government. The exploration effects of that policy-nobody would deny that those exploration effects have been significant-are the product of policy common to the present coalition Government and the previous Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point I make is that recommendation 31 of the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources recommended 'the need for the large number of advisory bodies to be reviewed', the implication quite clearly being that the number of advisory bodies be reduced. Senator Durack, in reply on behalf of the Government, has said that the specialist technical advice is necessary and to reduce the number of bodies would deny the Government that specialist technical advice. That may be so. I would not pass judgment on that. However, the point I make is that the next time it seems to be necessary for this Government to pull another political stunt out of the bag, we might find that the number of those committees is, in fact, reduced if precedent from the last political stunt-the so-called razor gang report-is to be taken as any guide. Among other things, in that report the Government abolished the Commonwealth Council for Rural Research and Extension which it had established with great fanfare only two years before. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I do not want to take a great deal of the Senate's time. As Senator Walsh has said, this matter can be debated at some time in the future. I think it is important to make the point at this stage that a reading of the statement by the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) makes it apparent that this is another one of those sad days for the Senate. The recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources, which has done a very good job in opening up a tremendous and important matter, have not really been taken seriously. Apparently the Government does not have any intention of implementing them in any effective way. The providing of motor spirit on which we can continue to run our cars and trucks in the future in a country which, as I have said before in this place, is the most dependent of all the Western developed countries in the world on roads and motor transport and, therefore, on motor spirit is a very important issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The years are passing quite remorselessly. At the moment we may be deceived by the fact that there is a glut of oil products in the world. Prices seem to be going down. There is discounting again in the petrol stations. Because of this, I believe, Australians are being lulled into a totally false sense of security on the matter. The Bass Strait crude is now steadily drying up and no other major oilfield is in sight in this country. Although we all, of course, hope greatly that one will be found, the technical evidence that I have been able to establish so far is to the effect that we are not likely to find one. I think the Government is pulling the wool over people's eyes in its response to this report, especially by talking about oil from coal and Rundle. The image of Rundle has been severely dented in recent months, and, of course, for good reason. As far as many of us here, who think about these issues, are concerned, for a long time it never had an image. The image has been dented because of the almost inextricable difficulties that face this project, no matter which way it is looked at, and which, of course, will not be resolved, regardless of the reassurances of the Government. I can only wonder why the Government persists in trying to make these continual reassurances about Rundle. The Government somehow sees Rundle as a gift to the Australian people, which will solve all of our problems in the future. Again, the processing of coal to oil poses many problems. The technology has yet to be developed, particularly with regard to Australian coals. The advice that I have is that virtually every type of Australian coal will demand a different technology. It is not just a matter of saying that there is a lot of coal in Australia and we will turn it into oil. That is the simple way the solution to the problem has been presented. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things that worries me greatly about the recommendations of the Committee is that I can see no reference at all in the Minister's statement to the idea of making methanol from natural gas. This is a technology which is now being considered very seriously by a neighbouring country-New Zealand-with the Maui Field. The technology for that process is not only thoroughly established throughout the world but also relatively cheap. The lead time for bringing on methanol plants that could give us a significant extender to our petroleum is quite short; it is about two years. I am concerned that, although this matter has been raised with the Government again and again by many people-I think it may have been raised in evidence to the Committee-apparently, for some perverse reason, the Government does not want to go to the natural gas producers of this country and say: 'Why do we not have this valuable national asset-methanol-which could be used as M15, in our own petrol? It would immediately give us the option-certainly within two years-of being able to reduce substantially the amount of petrol that we need'. </PARA>
<PARA> On page 3, the Minister mentions that consumption fell in 1980 by 4.4 per cent. This is apparently seen as a cause for self-congratulation. I see it as being very far from that in view of the situation we are likely to face in future on motor spirit and which we may have to face at very short notice if, for instance, things blew up in Saudi Arabia. I would have thought that it should have been possible to reduce consumption very much more than that. If the recommendations of the Committee's report were carried out, indeed consumption would go down very much more quickly than that. On page 4, the point is made that the Government is giving:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . tax concessions for industrial and commercial users converting from oil to other energy sources such as coal or solar power. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask again: Why are tax concessions being given simply to industrial and commercial users? Why can we not do what is being done in a dozen other countries and offer a decent tax concession to domestic users of solar power so that they can be induced to overcome the large problem, the high capital costs of a solar installation, which prevents many thousands of young Australians putting solar heaters in their homes when they build them. In California there is a 65 per cent subsidy from State and Federal income tax for solar installations. As a result the demand for solar power has grown enormously. The California Energy Commission has found that it will not have to build new thermal power stations in future because the demand for thermal power has fallen. I wonder why the Government is so obdurate and so tardy on that matter, which is now one of great interest to the community. </PARA>
<PARA> On page 5, we read of the Government harping back to the matter of shale oil and coal liquids. It mentions the smaller scale alternatives, such as liquid petroleum gas and ethanol. Here again, no mention is made of methanol. Methanol is the obvious fuel; it sticks out a mile. We would have thought that anybody would have quickly come to the conclusion to use methanol. I regret that, on page 5, hydrogen and steam power are seen as not having very good priority. I would have thought that an intelligent program in this area might have been of some service to this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn briefly to the recommendations. The first four recommendations of the Committee are designed to get rid of the gas guzzling motor car. I think they are highly intelligent recommendations and very much to the point. Yet the Government has indicated in its response that it does not want to do anything about the recommendations. The first recommendation of the Committee states:</PARA>
<PARA> NEAC's fuel economy goals be introduced as mandatory requirements on a fleet average basis for cars and station wagons. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government's response states:</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has indicated it prefers a voluntary approach to vehicle fuel economy goals. Regulations should be considered if the goals are not achieved.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course it is a very simple matter when the Government provides the motor industry with the laughably easy goals it has, instead of something of any real significance which might make some appreciable difference to the consumption of fuel in this country. Of course, the voluntary approach will perhaps meet the very easy situation which the Government is now considering. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee goes on to say in Recommendation 2:</PARA>
<PARA> A fuel consumption program should be established to facilitate fuel conservation in the road haulage industry. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government states that it is:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . currently co-operating in preparatory work aimed at the development of a voluntary fuel economy program for trucks and buses. </PARA>
<PARA>How many steps are in that? The Government is currently co-operating in preparatory work aimed at the development of a voluntary fuel economy program. There are four steps before anything gets done. I think that this shows the lack of seriousness with which the Government regards this situation. Recommendation 3 states:</PARA>
<PARA> Protection for the motor industry be reviewed with the object of applying a more direct competitive stimulus to the local industry to adopt advanced fuel efficient technologies; the removal of quota restrictions on car imports and variation of local content regulations should be the first steps in such a review. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Democrats could not agree more with the Committee, but, of course, the Government does not. When there are fuel efficient cars like the Daihatsu Charade, which everybody in Australia wants to buy and which has a waiting list, the Government says: 'No, we are going to keep them out'. Why do we want to keep them out? Presumably the Government wants to do that to allow the Australian motor industry to go on with its silly, inefficient current productions, some of which, as I have said, do no more than nine miles to the gallon. I am speaking there of the major manufacturers. Yet we allow that situation to go on. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee did not think that should happen. In its Recommendation 4, it states:</PARA>
<PARA> A graded sales tax on engine size or power output be introduced to discriminate against large engined or less fuel efficient vehicles with the lowest rate applying to very economical small cars. </PARA>
<PARA>What a sensible, intelligent and rational view! But the Government's response states:</PARA>
<PARA> Under the impact of more realistic fuel prices, consumer preferences have already moved strongly in favour of more fuel efficient vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, it is going to be left to God again, like everything else the Government considers needs doing. I have news for the Government. Because of the soft way in which it is presenting the fuel crisis to the Australian people-it is saying that there is not really a crisis and that Rundle will solve it all-according to motoring writers now there is a move in Australia to go back to driving cars that use a great deal of petrol. I think it is a very serious indictment of the Government that it allows this to happen. I urge the Government to reconsider its response to this report because this is an urgent matter. I urge it to look at this Committee's report and especially to the first four sensible and rational recommendations. I urge it to get to work and to agree with the Committee's recommendations. If the Government simply agreed with those and said: 'We will do these things', I am sure that it would achieve the respect of the Australian people because it would at last have set us on an energy course which would get some significant reduction in petrol consumption. It would also give the Australian people the type of motor car they want. That is not what is happening at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 20 states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government establish a large-scale demonstration project involving the actual operation of vehicles using blended fuels with the object of clarifying the effect of those fuels in areas such as fuel consumption, exhaust emissions and driveability. </PARA>
<PARA>That would be a great idea. Other countries are doing it. It has never been done under Australian conditions. New Zealand, which is a much smaller country than ours, can afford to do it and thinks that it is worth doing. But, of course, we do not do it in Australia. The magnificent sum of $270,000 is being put into the important area of support for research into the cultivation and selection of vegetable oils as fuel crops and the utilisation of diesel engines. The Government puts that amount forward as an answer to the Committee's recommendations. When we have time to look at this report in more detail, I think we will certainly have more to say about it. All I can say now to Senator Carrick-I must make a classical allusion to him-is that in this case he is very much our fuel Nero. He is very much fiddling while Rome burns and while time passes and he is doing virtually nothing. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I have before me a statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) on a proposed multinational peacekeeping force for the Sinai and possible Australian participation in that force. I seek leave to incorporate the text of that statement in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this statement is not to announce a decision by the Government on Australian participation in the proposed force-Australia has still not yet formally been invited to participate in the force-but to set before the Senate the facts and information additional to that available when I last spoke on this subject on 14 May, and to indicate the issues which the Government will take into account in reaching a decision. Honourable senators will be aware that the focus of Middle East peace negotiations over the last three and a half years has been the process begun by President Sadat when he visited Jerusalem and addressed the Knesset in November 1977. President Sadat's unprecedented and dramatic visit to Jerusalem led to negotiations between Egypt and Israel, with the United States also involved, which culminated in the Camp David accords in September 1978 and the Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty of March 1979. </PARA>
<PARA> Essentially the Camp David accords and the Peace Treaty can be divided into two parts. The first dealt with the Israeli occupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza and set out a procedure for implementing 'full autonomy' for the inhabitants of those two areas after the establishment of an elected self-governing authority. The Government regrets that progress on this aspect of the peace process has been disappointingly slow. Nevertheless this aspect of the peace process, while proving extremely difficult to implement, has helped to isolate the issues involved and has contributed to a greater understanding, by those outside the Middle East as well as those directly involved, of those issues. Mr President, it must be emphasised that progress on these complex issues is essential if undertakings in the accords concerning the return of occupied territory in the Sinai are to be met. The Government, for its part, believes that successfully carrying out the accords as they relate to the Sinai, could be crucial in influencing those sections of the Arab world which have strong reservations about whether the complex problems of the Middle East can be resolved by means other than conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> Undoubtedly the major achievement of the peace process has been the bilateral peace treaty between Egypt and Israel. This has proved that Israel and an Arab country, despite thirty years of bitterness and war, can negotiate a substantive peace agreement involving basic concessions on both sides. There is no doubt that as a result both Israel and Egypt have received substantial benefit. Israel's security interests have been enhanced substantially while Egypt has regained a good part of the Sinai and is now able to concentrate on domestic economic reconstruction. This is a significant achievement and must not be put at risk. Progress on the second part of the accords, the bilateral aspects of the Peace Treaty, has been good. Diplomatic relations have been established, Ambassadors exchanged and civil aviation, commercial, telecommunications and other links have been established. In addition, and most importantly from the Egyptian perspective, Israel has withdrawn from approximately two thirds of the Sinai. Egypt now controls all of the Sinai west of an interim line running from El Arish in the north down to Ras Muhammed on the southern tip of the Sinai. Annex I of the Peace Treaty stipulates that Israel will complete its withdrawal from the Sinai 'not later than three years from the date of exchange of the instruments of ratification of this Treaty'. Hence by the end of April 1982 Israel is scheduled to have withdrawn completely from the Sinai. It is quite clear from the text of the Treaty that Egypt, Israel and the United States envisaged that United Nations Forces would supervise both the Israeli withdrawal from the Sinai and the implementation of the security arrangements agreed on in the Treaty. Article VI of Annex I stipulates the role and functions of such United Nations forces.</PARA>
<PARA> Since the signing of the Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty in March 1979 the United Nations has been unable to give any mandate which would enable United Nations forces to operate in a peace-keeping role in the Sinai. The United Nations Emergency Force-UNEF-which was carrying out peacekeeping operations in the Sinai ceased operations in July 1979 when the Soviet Union indicated that it would veto an extension of its mandate. Honourable senators will be aware that an Australian helicopter unit was based at Ismailia as part of UNEF. The United Nations Truce Supervisory Organisation-UNTSO-to which a number of Australian officers are seconded, still has about a dozen or so observers in the Sinai but could not be expected to assume the tasks of a Sinai peacekeeping force without the drastic revision of its mandate and a substantial increase in its numbers in the Sinai. Again it is clear that the Soviet Union, which has consistently opposed the Camp David accords and the Peace Treaty, would not agree to an extension of UNTSO's mandate. In recent months there have been informal discussions in the United Nations about the possibility of obtaining a United Nations peacekeeping force to oversee the final Israeli withdrawal from the Sinai and to implement the peacekeeping functions as envisaged by the Treaty. </PARA>
<PARA> On 21 April the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs of Egypt, His Excellency, Kamal Hassan Ali, requested the President of the Security Council to initiate, as a matter of urgency, consultations with members of the Security Council. The purpose was to explore the role of the United Nations, and specifically whether the Security Council would monitor and supervise the withdrawal of Israeli forces from Egyptian territories, and participate in the reciprocal security arrangements through the establishment of the Force and observers, provided for under the Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty. On 18 May in a letter to the Egyptian Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Japanese President of the Security Council, Mr Nisibori, replied to the effect that following consultations with individual members of the Security Council, including the Soviet Union, the members of the Security Council were unable, for various reasons, to reach the necessary agreement to facilitate the withdrawal of the Israeli forces and to participate in the security arrangements provided for in the Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty. With the concurrence of the Senate, I incorporate in Hansard the letter from the Egyptian Minister for Foreign Affairs, Kamal Hassan Ali, to the President of the Security Council and the President's reply to the Egyptian Minister. </PARA>

<PARA> With reference to the letter dated 21 April 1981 from your excellency addressed to the president of the security council for the month of April. I should like to inform your excellency that the individual consultations I have undertaken lead to the conclusion that the members of the security council are unable, for various reasons, to reach the necessary agreement on the proposal contained therein. </PARA>
<PARA> Accept, excellency, the assurances of my highest consideration. </PARA>

<PARA>21 April 1981</PARA>
<PARA>Excellency,</PARA>
<PARA> Upon instructions from my government. I have the honour to bring to your attention a matter which is directly related to the maintenance of peace and security in the Middle East region. </PARA>
<PARA> Ever since the inception of the United Nations, the organization has been called upon to ensure the maintenance of peace and security in the Middle East. At this time, when serious attempts are being made to bring the Middle East closer to a comprehensive peace, it is legitimate to expect that the United Nations, particularly, the security council whose primary responsibility is the maintenance of international peace and security, should continue its established practice in undertaking its constructive role to ensure the durability, and consolidation of peace and security in the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> The Security Council was seized with the situation in the Middle East since armed hostilities erupted, on November 22, 1967 the council unanimously adopted resolution 242, a resolution which is considered the universally agreed basis for a just and comprehensive settlement to the Middle East problem. Security council resolution 242 (1967) required that the establishment of a just and lasting peace in the Middle East should include the application of both the following principles:</PARA>
<PARA>Quote: (1) withdrawal of Israel's armed forces from territories occupied in the recent conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) termination of all claims or states of belligerency and respect for and adknowledgement of the sovereignty, territorial integrity and political independence of every state in the area and their right to live in peace within secure and recognised boundaries free from threats of acts of force. unquote . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The resolution further prescribed, as security arrangements:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . guaranteeing the territorial inviolability and political independence of every state in the area through measures including the establishment of demilitarized zones . . . </PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with this resolution, the Secretary-General appointed a special representative to promote agreement and assist efforts to achieve a peaceful and acceptable settlement towards this end, the special representative submitted, on February 8th 1971 an aide memoire, to Egypt and Israel. The aide memoire called upon Egypt and Israel to enter into a peace agreement as a first step towards a comprehensive settlement of the Middle East problem. Such an approach was endorsed by the general assembly with increased majorities when it adopted resolutions 2799 (XXVI) and 2941 (XXVII). </PARA>
<PARA> In this context, Egypt and Israel concluded a peace treaty on March 26th 1979 and registered it with the Secretary-General on 15 May 1979 in accordance with article 102 of the charter. Consistent with the underlying principles and basic provisions of security council resolution 242 (1967) the treaty stipulated that Israel will withdraw its armed forces behind the international boundary between Egypt and Israel by April 1982. Within this context and to ensure the durability and further consolidation of peace and security, Egypt and Israel agreed to reciprocal security arrangements and a request that the United Nations provide forces and observers. </PARA>
<PARA> In the light of the above, the government of the Arab Republic of Egypt views it timely for the security council to consider, on an urgent basis, the modalities for carrying out the required responsibilities for ensuring peace and security in the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> Towards this end, my government has instructed me to approach your excellency, with a view to consulting the members of the security council in order to ascertain the role of the United Nations, and specifically whether the security council, would undertake to facilitate the withdrawal of the Israeli forces from Egyptian territories and to participate in the reciprocal security arrangement herein referred to through the establishment of the force and observers provided for in the Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty. </PARA>
<PARA> In this connection, it may be important to confirm that Egypt's request emanates from its solemn commitment to the principles of the charter of the United Nations, from a deep conviction that the presence of the United Nations is the most appropriate formula for ensuring the maintenance of peace and security, and that this request falls within its sovereign rights in liberating its territories and pursuing a policy aimed at establishing a just, comprehensive and lasting peace in the Middle East. </PARA>
<PARA> As we have been conducting informal consultations with security council members for several weeks, I would appreciate receiving at the earliest possible date, the results of your excellency's consultations. </PARA>
<PARA> Accept, excellency, the assurances of my highest consideration. </PARA>

<PARA>President of the Security Council</PARA>
<PARA>United Nations, N.Y. 10017</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I deeply regret that the President of the Security Council's letter effectively rules out for the immediate future at least, any United Nations involvement in the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Sinai under the terms stipulated by the Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty. United Nations involvement in this crucial area is therefore not an option. The Senate will be aware that Security Council Resolution 242, which was agreed on after the 1967 Middle East war, called for an Israeli withdrawal from occupied territories. Egypt has expressed the hope that a non-United Nations multinational force will only be of a temporary nature and that the way should be kept open for its replacement by a United Nations force at a later stage. Against the possibility that the United Nations would not agree to fulfil the role envisaged for it, President Carter in letters dated 26 March 1979 to both President Sadat and Prime Minister Begin undertook, and I am quoting directly, 'To ensure the establishment and maintenance of an acceptable alternative multinational force'. With the concurrence of the Senate, I incorporate in Hansard the letters from President Carter to President Sadat and Prime Minister Begin. </PARA>

<PARA>Sincerely, JIMMY CARTER His Excellency</PARA>
<PARA>Menachem Begin,</PARA>
<PARA>Prime Minister of the State of Israel</PARA>
<PARA> It has been suggested that the formation of such a force is not a part of the Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty accords. Nothing could be further from the truth. President Carter's letter is and remains an essential document accompanying the Peace Treaty ratified by both Egypt and Israel. The failure of the United Nations to fulfil the role envisaged for it in the Peace Treaty represents the basis for the current endeavours by Egypt, Israel and the United States to fulfil their obligations to the Peace Treaty through the establishment of an alternative multinational peacekeeping force. </PARA>
<PARA> In the absence of any effective United Nations peacekeeping force the United States concluded an agreement in September 1979 with both Egypt and Israel on interim arrangements in which the already existing Sinai Field Mission, which is an American establishment, staffed by American civilians, would continue its monitoring functions in the Sinai. The Israelis while agreeing to these arrangements made it clear that they were acceptable only in the interim period while they still had a substantial force stationed in Eastern Sinai. It is essential that the Parliament understands, Mr President, that Israel regards the establishment of an effective peacekeeping force as an integral part of the Treaty, indeed as an essential pre-requisite for their final withdrawal from the Sinai. </PARA>
<PARA> Put bluntly, in the absence of United Nations involvement, failure to form an effective mutlinational force would risk provoking a refusal by Israel to withdrawal from the final third of the Sinai. The consequences of such a refusal cannot be over emphasised. It would be a very severe, if not catastrophic blow to the Camp David peace process and the Egyptian-Israeli Peace Treaty. Beyond this, and in the absence of any progress on the crucial Palestinian issue, it could imperil future prospects for attaining a comprehensive, negotiated peace in the Middle East. Further, it would seriously dent the faith of two nations who, after decades of conflict and death, have deliberately chosen the path of peace through negotiation and compromise as an alternative to mutually ruinous conflict. </PARA>
<PARA> The fundamental reason why Israel agreed to withdraw from the Sinai was that a satisfactory set of arrangements to guarantee their security had been agreed upon. These arrangements quietened Israel's legitimate fears about its security and gave it the confidence to take the decision to withdraw. With an effective peacekeeping force in place in the Sinai Israeli's southern flank will be secure. It is the Government's hope that in these circumstances the Israelis would move with greater confidence to negotiate on outstanding issues affecting the future status of the West Bank and Gaza, including the right of the Palestinian people to a homeland. </PARA>
<PARA> Since President Sadat's visit to Jerusalem in November 1977 he has pursued bold and imaginative policies in the cause of a negotiated settlement with Israel. Any failure to fully implement the provisions of the Peace Treaty could react adversely on Egypt's ability to carry out its commitments. Moreover, the uncertain and volatile situation in Lebanon reinforces the urgency of dissipating by peaceful means, the atmosphere of suspicion and conflict which has dominated the Middle East for so long. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, amongst the factors which will be taken into consideration by the Government if and when a formal approach is made to Australia to participate in a multinational peacekeeping force in the Sinai are: First, that Australia's overall interests are served by maintaining the momentum for the peaceful resolution of conflict in the Middle East. Secondly, the Government will need to consider the means available to maintain the momentum for peace. As I stated earlier, Mr President, the inevitability of a Soviet veto has once again effectively removed United Nations involvement from consideration. Thirdly, is the proposed multinational peacekeeping force in accordance with the Camp David accords and the spirit of United Nations Resolution 242, both of which enjoy the unreserved bipartisan support of this Parliament? Fourthly, can the Government support the formation of such a force? Finally, if Australia is formally invited to participate in such a force, are the conditions of participation such as to warrant consideration of Australia's involvement?</PARA>
<PARA> Australia has established a record of participation in international peacekeeping operations, both within and outside the United Nations context, which the people of Australia can be justly proud of. By their very nature peacekeeping operations involve risks. The safety of any Australian force associated with the proposed peacekeeping operation in the Sinai, as well as the possible effects on our overall interests in the Middle East, would weigh heavily in any deliberations by the Government. The factors outlined above accurately reflect the present level, and current state of the Government's thinking. I emphasise again, as I did in my statement on 14 May, that any communications between Australia and the parties concerned can be described as being only exploratory at this stage. Even as I address the Senate today negotiations proceed between Egypt, Israel and the United States about the membership, structure and detailed functions of such a force. </PARA>
<PARA> In the statement of the Minister for Foreign Affairs in the House on 14 May, Mr President, he said that the Government believes that such an exploratory approach is both justified and prudent in the present circumstances. It was in accordance with this exploratory approach that in response to an earlier message from the United States Secretary of State I wrote to Mr Haig, on 27 April. In my letter I pointed out that the Australian Government's preference remained for a United Nations peacekeeping force. I referred to allegations in the media in this country and the United States that the proposed multinational force would have a role beyond the Sinai itself. I also referred to speculation about the future use of air bases located in that part of the Sinai which Egypt is scheduled, under the terms of the Peace Treaty, to recover in 1982. I stated that it was important to dispel such suggestions. </PARA>
<PARA> I noted that before the Australian Government could make any commitment to participate in the force it would have to be assured that other participants would give the force a broad geographical and political balance. Moreover, I pointed out that Australia's relations with the Arab world will have to be taken into account. While almost all of these governments have opposed the Camp David peace process they have not been opposed to all aspects equally. I said that the Government would welcome advice about the command structure of the force, its controlling authority and the proposed relationship between that authority and the force. I sought information about the financing of the force and asked advice about the proposed duration of any commitment, mentioning that it would obviously be difficult for the Australian Government to consider an open ended commitment. Finally, I mentioned that because the force would be operating on Egyptian and Israeli territory, any formal approach to Australia should be extended by those two countries. </PARA>
<PARA> As I stated earlier, it has become apparent from the information we have obtained that there are a number of aspects of the proposed multinational force on which final agreement has not yet been reached. Negotiations are still continuing, and while I understand that Egypt, Israel and the United States are close to agreement, the final details of the force are still to be concluded. I ask the Senate to keep this in mind. </PARA>
<PARA> On 19 May the Secretary of State replied to my letter and dealt with some of the general concerns and provided answers to some of the specific questions I had raised. Additionally, Australian officials both here and overseas have sought, and are continuing to seek further information concerning the proposed Sinai force. It is apparent from the Secretary of State's letter to me, that the United States Administration shares the Government's view on a wide range of issues related to the force. Like us, they believe it to be important that a sufficient range of countries participate to ensure that the force is not narrowly based politically or geographically. The United States believes that third world participation is important. We understand that a number of countries from Asia and Latin America are currently being approached to consider participation and we expect states from other parts of the world, including Europe, to be invited in due course. </PARA>
<PARA> Secretary of State Haig has clearly stated that the only role of the proposed force is that of peacekeeping in the Sinai. He assured me that any contribution of a United States contingent is for the specific purpose of peacekeeping. Furthermore, the Peace Treaty states that the airfields in the Sinai will be transferred to Egypt for civilian use upon Israeli evacuation, and that these facilities will be under full Egyptian sovereignty and control. The mandate for the proposed force will be Article VI of Annex 1 of the Peace Treaty. The Government understands that details concerning the command and control arrangments, as well as the composition of the force including its civilian elements are still being negotiated. The Government will require further information on this aspect. This would include details concerning, for example, mechanisms for resolving disputes between the parties, and other aspects of co-ordination. </PARA>
<PARA> The parties are presently negotiating the establishment of a peacekeeping force of a size sufficient to carry out the functions agreed by Egypt and Israel. Precise details are being worked out at this time. As we understand current thinking, the force is likely to consist of about two thousand men. In addition to infantry battalions, it is envisaged there would be a need for support elements including logistics and communications units. One or more of these elements might be provided by one of the countries contributing to the infantry battalions, or they could come from different states altogether. As was envisaged in the Peace Treaty, it is anticipated that units of the force will be located in the north in the Rafah area and at Sharm Al Shaykh. The contingents would man check points and observation posts and operate patrols in Zone C as defined in the Peace Treaty. The observers would perform verification functions in Zones A, B and D. </PARA>
<PARA> The financial arrangements are yet to be finalised, although the hope has been expressed that those contributing states that are in a position to do so will contribute their services, or some part of them, free of charge. The duration of participation by contributing countries remains unclear. It is not expected, however, that national contingents will be required to serve indefinitely although there is likely to be a requirement that an acceptable force be maintained in Sinai so long as either party believes it to be necessary. Current planning is based on the hope that various contingents would agree to serve for a specific duration. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned earlier, the reaction of other Arab countries will also be important to us. Their major disagreement has been over the mechanism for solving the Palestinian issue which they regard as the core of the Middle East issue. They have not taken exception to, nor do they dispute, Egypt's right to regain its territory from Israel. This, I believe, is a major distinction when considering likely Arab reaction to possible Australian involvement in a multinational Sinai peacekeeping force. </PARA>
<PARA> In setting out the above details I have sought to give as full an account as possible of the current state of play concerning the proposed peacekeeping force. I emphasise again, that at this stage Australia has not been invited to participate and I have already referred to the negotiations which are still proceeding between Egypt, Israel and the United States. It is clear nevertheless, that Australian participation would be welcomed by those countries and that it may only be a matter of time before a formal invitation is extended to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I believe it would be appropriate to make a further brief mention of Australia's interests in the Middle East. In my statement on 14 May I explained that while Australia has limited influence in that area our interest in the maintenance of stability in that region is not limited. The Government believes that this interest is best served by the process of agreement through negotiation and compromise rather than recourse to war. For many years Australia has had important links with the Middle East. These links included our dependence for many years on the Suez Canal as a major trade route to the Mediterranean and Europe. Thousands of Australians fought in Egypt, Libya, Palestine and Syria in two world wars in the cause of peace and, over the last 25 years thousands of migrants from Arab countries have settled in Australia in search of peace. In more recent times this country has contributed with distinction to peacekeeping operations under United Nations auspices in this region. An opportunity now exists for Parliament to express its views on whether Australia has a possible further role in the same cause. In this context I quote from the speech of the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) of 21 September 1978, Hansard page 1308, in which he said, inter alia:</PARA>
<PARA> Camp David has been a first step but a critically important one. President Carter's initiative in convening the meeting, and his political skill and courage in keeping it going, have created the essential momentum for the next step, which may well be even more difficult. Our hope is that all the parties, and others whom must necessarily become involved now will maintain the momentum. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister's statement on this matter is a carefully considered one, as is proper in such a complex, sensitive and important matter. I commend him for that and assure him, this House and the nation that on this great matter genuine concern for the achievement of lasting peace in the Middle East is a matter of bipartisan commitment. </PARA>
<PARA>In conclusion, Mr President, I hope that, on such an important issue, the debate will be a well informed and rational one. The Government is hopeful that it will be possible to maintain a bipartisan approach towards the Camp David accords, the Egypt-Israeli Peace Treaty and the need to maintain the momentum for peace in the Middle East. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the statement. </PARA>
<PARA>The statement put down by the Attorney-General (Senator Durack), which was made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) in the House of Representatives last week, calls, in effect, for bipartisanship on this issue of the proposed peacekeeping force for the Sinai. There is a lot of rhetoric about bipartisanship. The Minister asks: Can the Government support the formation of such a force? It was pointed out in the House of Representatives that the correct question, if the Government is seeking bipartisanship, would be: Can the Government and the Opposition support the formation of such a force? There are a number of reasons why the Opposition cannot do so, including the history of Australia's involvement with the United States of America in the disastrous Vietnam venture. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to identify briefly the reasons for the Australian Labor Party's opposition to the suggestions contained in the statement, especially to the proposition that Australia should be a participant in such a force. Firstly, I say that as a legal document the ministerial statement is a poor one, containing errors of fact and interpretation. It is misleading in that it refers to President Carter's letter as 'part of the Peace Treaty and Accords'. It is not a part of the Peace Treaty and Accords. In fact, it is materially at variance with the Treaty itself. Article VI paragraph 8 of Annex (1) of the 1979 Peace Treaty clearly specified that the force could not include permanent members of the United Nations Security Council. That would include the United States of America and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. On the other hand, the Carter letter refers to the establishment and maintenance of an acceptable alternative multinational force. Article VI of the Treaty contains nine references to a United Nations force. There is no reference whatsoever in the Treaty to any force other than a United Nations force. Yet the Government says that the mandate it will claim for this action is Article VI. There is no mandate in Article VI for anything but a United Nations peacekeeping force. </PARA>
<PARA> I should say that the Labor Party welcomed the Camp David treaties as an important step in the search for a just, comprehensive and lasting peace, to use the Minister's expression. We emphasised at the time the importance of United Nations Security Council Resolutions 242 and 338, which both referred to the role of the United Nations. Indeed, I should point out to the Senate that until March of this year the Deputy Prime Minister and Leader of the National Country Party, Mr Anthony, persistently referred to the circumstances in which a contingent might be provided by Australia towards a force in the Sinai as being of necessity a United Nations force. Mr Anthony said that for very explicit reasons arising from his knowledge of the area and Australia's trading relationships with many of the Arab countries. It was only after March of this year, when one suspects the Fraser caravanserai got going again in a desire to beat up an issue, that Mr Anthony appeared to change his mind about the desirability of a United Nations force. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, I say that the Opposition is acutely aware of the dangers involved in what is proposed-that is, Australian participation in such a force which is not a United Nations sponsored force. Direct support for such a force could threaten tension between the super-powers and possibly drag Australia into fighting in the Middle East, something which the Deputy Prime Minister clearly wished to avoid for, if I might be unkind, sordid reasons of trade but which should be avoided for a variety of reasons. Secondly, I point out that other nations could see the proposed force as an attempt to smuggle a United States military presence into the Middle East. That is not a suggestion of mine. It is a suggestion which was made by what was until recently a highly reputable newspaper-the Washington Post. It suggested that such a force would be seen as an attempt to smuggle a United States military presence into the Middle East. Having regard to the rhetoric of Secretary of State Haig about the desirability of a rapid deployment force, confusion about that could easily arise. It could be seen, quite obviously, as an attempt to smuggle a United States military presence into the Middle East. Such a force could also become the forerunner of or springboard for the rapid deployment force to which I have just referred and which the United States Administration plans. </PARA>
<PARA> The next point I wish to make is that the departments of Defence, Trade and Resources, and Foreign Affairs in Australia have serious reservations about the actions foreshadowed in Foreign Minister Street's statement. The Department of Defence has reservations for reasons of defence-that is, there is very serious doubt as to whether a contingent from the Australian Army could be adequately equipped as a result of six years of defence administration under Mr Killen. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not mean to be unfair on that point. It is not material to my argument. I may have misrepresented the position. If I did, I would certainly seek to withdraw that statement and say that the suggestion, from wherever it has come, is resisted by the Department of Defence, for the reasons I have indicated, the Department of Trade and Resources, for the very simple reasons which were advanced in March by the Deputy Prime Minister in relation to Australia's trading relationships with the Middle East, and by the Department of Foreign Affairs, for very obvious reasons of international relations, especially in the Middle East with Arab countries. Of course, we are now informed that the Defence Committee has expressed very grave concern, very serious reservations, about Australia's participation in such a force. It expressed that concern, those reservations about Australian participation, to the Government before Mr Street made his statement. I remind the Senate that the Defence Committee consists of senior public servants from several departments. A report in the Age of 29 May reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The committee's strongly-worded advice to the Government was received before Mr Street made his statement . . . Its general tone was a good deal more cautious than that of the Foreign Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on to refer to the exchange of letters between Mr Street and Secretary of State Haig which clearly suggested that unsatisfactory answers were given to the questions asked by Mr Street about Australian involvement. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude my remarks by saying-I guess I speak more for myself than for the Opposition generally in saying this-that, having regard to the experience of this country under conservative governments involving Australia in external ventures such as that of Vietnam and elsewhere, any parliament of this country would be neglecting its duty if it were not very cautious about any proposal which sprung from a political stuntman such as the present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in relation to the involvement of Australian troops in the Middle East, South East Asia or anywhere else overseas. There is a very strong onus on any government which argues that Australian troops should be involved overseas in pursuit of grandiose plans of Prime Ministers or foreign potentates, and any government that asserts that has a very strong onus to establish it to the Australian people after the experience we have had under conservative governments in the past in relation to these issues. For those reasons, the Opposition is very unhappy about some of the suggestions which have emerged in the Minister's statement. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA>The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> There has been considerable speculation recently that the cost of the new Parliament House is rising. This is not correct. The building cost of $220m at May 1978 prices approved by Parliament remains, in real terms, the budget for the Parliament House Construction Authority. The Construction Authority is confident that this budget can be maintained. The effects of inflation on wages and materials over the three years since the $220m budget was set must, of course, be taken into account in establishing the cost of the building in today's prices. The Construction Authority has estimated that the cost of the building is $296m at June 1981 prices. I again stress that this is not a change in the budget but merely a recognition of the effects of inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> As a member of the Joint Standing Committee on the New Parliament House, the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) is aware that the Committee in refining and developing the competition submission has identified the need for some minor adjustments to the building brief. If adopted by Parliament these would result in less than a 2 per cent increase in the building cost. During the Budget session, the Minister for the Capital Territory will be submitting a full report to Parliament on the development of the design prior to seeking Parliament's approval for the Construction Authority to proceed to the next stage. The report will elaborate on the information contained in this statement and will clearly show that the Government, through the Construction Authority, is determined to maintain the budget approved by Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill 1981 is to bring Australian anti-dumping law into conformity with the revised codes of conduct for international trade which were agreed to at the Tokyo round of the multilateral trade negotiations which were completed in December 1979. The associated Customs Amendment (Securities) Bill 1981 is simply an administrative measure which follows on naturally from the policy decisions involved in the production of the main Bill. The Opposition opposes neither of these Bills which is a predictable enough result, given that it was the Whitlam Australian Labor Party Government which, after all, brought down the comprehensive legislation which updated our then existing anti-dumping legislation and brought it into line with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade anti-dumping code. The arguments in support of our position on these Bills have been put in considerable detail in the House of Representatives and it is unnecessary to repeat them here in any detail.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, there are two matters which may bear some short repetition. The first matter that I raise refers to those provisions in this Bill which relate not so much to the anti-dumping code but rather to the subsidies and countervailing measures code which is similar to the anti-dumping provisions in that it enables the Government to protect Australian industries from imports which are subsidised by foreign governments. But the difference between this and the anti-dumping provisions is that it appears that Australia has not acceded to this code, no doubt because of the continued existence of our export expansion grants scheme and perhaps also the exports markets development scheme which would be in conflict with any international treaty of this kind. The degree of hypocrisy is not, of course, unusual in our external trade relations. I cannot forebear from noting that at least one rather flagrant, alleged breach of GATT is presently the subject of detailed scrutiny by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations. I do ask in this context: How much longer can the Government expect us to be able to get away with double standards in this area of government export subsidies? The Government is no doubt aware that there is a growing hostility to Australia's export subsidies in a number of countries, particularly in Western Europe. </PARA>
<PARA> The remaining matter is that there is a real concern in our minds and in the minds of a number of people who are interested in this area as to the administration of anti-dumping measures of this kind. A stronger code, of the kind that is implicit in this legislation, simply cannot be enforced without an appropriate increment in the relevant staffing resources associated with the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs, in particular the Bureau of Customs. It is necessary for complaints of dumping in this area, for example those that have been very publicly made recently in respect of Japanese exported washing machines and Korean exported steel, to be resolved not only fairly and effectively but also speedily in the interests of continued trade comity with the trading partners in question. In particular I repeat the Opposition's concern expressed by our shadow Minister, Mr John Brown, in the other place that the closure of the London section of the office of our representation dealing with dumping matters raises a very real question as to the future of the Hong Kong, Tokyo, Auckland and New York offices in this respect. There is a danger, as we see it, that the razor gang mentality will apply, be counter productive and far from achieving real efficiencies in the way government is administered, will produce that phenomenon of producing fundamental ineffectiveness in the legislative area of regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that the Opposition is wholly in sympathy with the general principles of these Bills and has no detailed quarrel with matters of detail in respect of any of them because they are in accordance with the policy position that the Opposition has consistently adopted and acted upon in legislative form in the Whitlam days. Rather, our concern is with a number of less immediately central matters which are none the less crucial to the effective implementation of this legislation and also to Australia's continued credibility as a trading nation. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speeches read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The main purpose of this Bill is to amend the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 1975 to incorporate in that Act the new provisions of the revised General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Anti-Dumping Code and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Subsidies and Countervailing Measures Code. These Codes were included in a number of understandings reached in the Tokyo round of the multilateral trade negotiations concluded in December 1979. The Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act 1975 is based on the principles and requirements of the original GATT Anti-Dumping Code. Australia acceded to that code in 1975. The Government announced on 25 June 1980 that Australia should accede to the revised GATT Anti-Dumping Code. This decision took into account the views of State governments, industry associations and other interested groups within the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains the minor amendments which are necessary before Australia can accede to the revised code. The amendments empower the Minister to accept undertakings from exporters to raise their export prices to undumped levels. Retrospective dumping duties may be imposed where the undertakings have been violated. The amendments also include additional criteria for assessment of normal values of goods in countries where the Government substantially influences domestic prices. Other amendments are based on measures contained in the Subsidies and Countervailing Measures Code. Principally, they empower the Minister to accept undertakings by governments of the exporting country to offset the effect of any subsidy and to impose retrospective countervailing duties. They also include additional criteria for determining the amount of subsidy in the case of goods exported from countries where the Government substantially influences prices. </PARA>
<PARA> No final decision on the question of Australia's accession to the GATT Subsidies and Countervailing Measures Code has been announced. However, the proposed amendments are desirable in themselves. The Government is of the view that the amendments will strengthen the powers to protect Australian industry against any injurious effects of subsidised imports. The Bill also proposes further amendments designed to remedy deficiencies which have become apparent during administration of the Act since 1975. These amendments are technical and modify both dumping and countervailing provisions. They are expected to enhance the Government's ability to protect Australian industries against dumped or subsidised imports. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA>Customs Amendment (Securities) Bill 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is associated with the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Amendment Bill 1981. Its main purpose is to amend section 45 of the Customs Act 1901 to vary the time for which the Customs may retain securities taken for the purposes of the Customs Tariff (Anti-Dumping) Act. The amendments are consistent with the provisions of the revised General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Anti-Dumping Code and the GATT Subsidies and Countervailing Measures Code. Both codes provide for the taking of securities as provisional measures pending finalisation of inquiries into allegations of injurious dumping and subsidisation. To conform with the Anti-Dumping Code the provisions of the Customs Act 1901 will need to be amended to allow securities to be held for a period of four months and for the period to be extended to six months if so requested by the exporter of the goods. For the Subsidies and Countervailing Measures Code the period of retention is extended from three months to four months. I commend this Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>

There was a lot of confusion tonight because there were about four Bills listed on the Notice Paper to come before this place before we got to the first reading stage of these Bills. As I say, this causes a lot of confusion and, as we have now witnessed, even the Minister in charge of these Bills has made the comment that it is time the Government got its house in order. I agree with him. If we want to run this place smoothly, the Government should at least give those on this side of the chamber some advice as to what it intends to do. It should not be the case that at eight o'clock in this chamber when the Bells are ringing nobody knows what the Government is going to do because there has been a change in the program.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Bill follows the precedent established many years ago regarding payroll tax in the Australian Capital Territory, that precedent being that the rate of payroll tax within the Australian Capital Territory should be the same as it is in New South Wales and that the Australian Capital Territory payroll tax rates of exemptions should be changed as soon as feasible after changes in the New South Wales rates. This Bill simply ensures that the rates currently applying in New South Wales will also apply in the Australian Capital Territory. It is, in our view, a completely logical thing to do and the Opposition supports the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Petroleum (Submerged Lands-Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill and one associated Bill amend the legislation passed last year and the original Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act of 1967. The most important provision of tonight's amending Bill is that it extends the area covered by that legislation to include the Coral Sea. It also corrects an abundance of trivial errors in the 1980 amending Act. I observe that it is a pity it does not correct the fundamental error in the 1980 Act, that is, that the legislation was ever introduced or passed. The Minerals (Submerged Lands) Bill extends the arrangements provided for the exploitation of petroleum within the 200-mile zone by the 1980 Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Acts to all other minerals. The most important provisions of the 1980 Acts, so far as petroleum is concerned, are extended by this package of legislation to include the Coral Sea which in the minerals Bills apply the same administrative arrangements for the exploitation of undersea minerals other than petroleum. The basic provision of those 1980 Bills was to cede to the States authority within the 3-mile zone and to delegate to the States, as a designated authority pursuant to the 1967 Act, administrative control over the area between 3 miles and 200 miles of the low water mark. This provision was extended further by these Bills to include the Coral Sea as well as the 200-mile exclusive economic zone. Joint authorities are to be set up under the legislation. The joint authorities are to be the adjacent State and the Commonwealth Minister, but the day to day administration of mining activities in the area will be taken over by State authorities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1973, the then Labor Government introduced the Seas and Submerged Lands Act, the intention of which was, firstly, to declare that the Commonwealth had constitutional authority beyond the low water mark and to the edge of the continental shelf, and, secondly, to lay down a code of exploration and mining on that continental shelf. Due to the opposition of the troglodytes who then had a majority in the Senate, the Government of the day deleted from its original intentions the establishment of a code to govern mining and restricted the legislation to the declaration of Commonwealth sovereignty over that area. That declaration was subsequently challenged by at least two State governments. The matter was settled by the High Court of Australia in 1975 which unanimously found that the Commonwealth had authority, that the States had never had authority from the low water mark and could not have authority. Total control rested with the Commonwealth. At least, more accurately I suppose one should say that the matter should have been settled by that unanimous declaration of the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year we witnessed a cowardly and irresponsible surrender of Commonwealth constitutional power to the petty megalomaniacs who abound in State parliaments. The Fraser Government repudiated its constitutional duty. It succumbed to the strident demands of myopic and parochial State premiers, of whom Sir Charles Court and Mr J. Bjelke-Petersen are the prime examples. It succumbed to their strident demands, as it is accustomed to do. It is ironic that these Bills should be debated tonight when at Question Time earlier we heard Senator Carrick speaking at some length of the problems created by divided legal authority with respect to the Murray River and its tributaries. That problem which, at least while State governments maintain their present attitudes, is probably insoluble, was inherited. It is something for which the Commonwealth Parliament, although it is sometimes held to be politically responsible, is not historically responsible. It was an historical accident. </PARA>
<PARA> The problems which will be created by the off-shore legislation being debated tonight and that which was passed last year are, by contrast, the home-made problems of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). They are problems which will be removed, I hasten to add, at the first opportunity by a Labor government. Labor will accept its constitutional duty and will reassert Commonwealth authority from the low water mark to the 200-mile limit of the EEZ and also over the Coral Sea. In regard to the question of irony we have the example-a contemporary example-of the extraction of mineral royalties on land. This Government, as we know, as well as abdicating its constitutional responsibilities in regard to the continental shelf, some time ago also abdicated its political responsibilities and refused to consider or apply a resources rent tax, the purpose of which is to appropriate very substantially for the benefit of the citizens of Australia the economic rent which accrues to high quality and/or easily accessible mineral deposits. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the States decided that they would move in to fill this taxing vacuum with de facto resource rent taxes. In Queensland the favoured de facto resource rent tax is railway freights greatly in excess of cost or of those which would apply in a competitive market. When questioned about this Senator Carrick said-in my view quite rightly; and I support him entirely-that, to the degree that the States imposed de facto resource rent taxes of that nature, their funds from Commonwealth sources would be reduced commensurately. I commend Senator Carrick for having expressed those sentiments. The more eccentric and megalomaniacal of the State Premiers responded with wild threats. All hope of rational policy receded beyond contemplation. The only gains which will accrue from that very unsatisfactory situation will be to foreign miners who will be able to play off State Premiers; perhaps, given the history of the 1960s with respect to Comalco, one should say, in some cases, pay off State Premiers. </PARA>
<PARA> The causes of that very unsatisfactory situation are twofold: Partly, they are as a result of the abdication of responsibility by the Commonwealth, manifest in its refusal to apply a resource rent tax, and partly, again an historical accident or perhaps one should say misfortune, the fact that legal control of the minerals on the mainland resides with the assorted State governments. But now, in contemplating the off-shore situation, because the Commonwealth has abdicated responsibility, the foundations have been laid for repeating offshore what has happened on-shore, and that is a fragmentation, an unacceptable inconsistency in the rules that apply and, perhaps worst of all, destructive competition between parochial State governments which will benefit only those who are seeking to exploit the resources, and increasingly they are foreign companies. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make a couple of other points before closing. I have not checked the second reading speech made here but certainly in the second reading speech in the House of Representatives the responsible Minister, Mr Anthony, said that no permits for exploration would be issued within 30 miles of the Great Barrier Reef. I note, as did Paul Keating in the House of Representatives, that there is no such assurance in the Bill. Even if the Statute Law Revision Bill 1981, which was introduced in the Senate last week and which seeks to give some guidance to the courts in the interpretation of legislation beyond that which is actually written into the legislation, is enacted I do not expect a reference in a second reading speech to the effect that no permit will be issued for exploration within 30 miles to have any legal validity. The statement does not appear in the Act and therefore there is absolutely no guarantee that that will be so. Likewise, I suggest there is equally little doubt that the great majority of Australians, including the great majority of Queenslanders, would be strongly opposed to the reef being jeopardised in that way. In fact, the only way in which the reef can be adequately protected is for the Commonwealth Government to accept its obligation to declare it a marine park. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition considered whether an attempt to amend any or all of these Bills would be justifiable and came to the conclusion that it would not because they were flawed beyond redemption. We will be opposing all of the Bills. I serve notice, as did Bill Hayden and Paul Keating in the House of Representatives, that a Labor government will get rid of these Bills and all of the associated Bills which were enacted last year just as soon as it can. It may do so through the Parliament or by way of a challenge to the High Court regarding the constitutional validity of the Act which transferred authority within the territorial sea, within the 3-mile limit, to the States. At the first opportunity, whether through the courts or through the Parliament, a Labor government will get rid of all the legislation before us tonight and all of the associated legislation that was passed in May of last year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight we are dealing with a group of Bills in a cognate debate. One of them, of course, is the Petroleum (Submerged Lands-Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 1981; others deal with off-shore mining of minerals. There are two main areas in the Petroleum (Submerged Lands-Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill. One of them deals with the fact that, as has been mentioned by Senator Walsh, last year legislation was passed in this Parliament to give the States jurisdiction over the 3-mile territorial sea with regard to exploration for hydrocarbons. The Commonwealth's jurisdiction extended beyond the 3-mile limit to what was once known as the area of exploitability. This included the continental shelf. If Australia eventually decides to go to the 200-mile economic zone, that area would be covered by this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reason for mentioning this aspect in this legislation tonight is the fact that in the amending legislation of last year we dealt with the proposal that the States would amend their off-shore oil legislation. It has been decided since then that, because of constitutional requirements, it would be better if we were to amend the Federal legislation and the States were in turn to re-enact their legislation, not just amend it. That is the reason for the Bill we are dealing with tonight. Another area concerns extension into the area of the Coral Sea of exploration for hydrocarbons and, under the other Bills in the cognate debate, the exploration for and possible exploitation of minerals. One could go on and expand more on the aspect of the Coral Sea, but the only comment I would make is that it is sitting well out in the continental shelf of Australia and, with regard to both oil and minerals, one has already seen the situation on the north-western side of Australia where oil exploration has extended well out into the continental shelf and into the off-shore areas of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minerals (Submerged Lands) Bill is virtually a flow on from the previous Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Bill, which was introduced into this Parliament in 1967. Perhaps I should give a little history about the period when the Bill was introduced into this Parliament. At that time the matter of sovereignty over the off-shore areas of Australia had not been resolved. There was a grey area. The States were claiming that they had sovereign rights and that the continental shelf was a continuation of the land mass into the sea area. The Commonwealth was saying that it would have the right and authority over the waters beyond the 3-mile limit. The irony of the situation at that stage was that internationally Australia was recognised as a coastal state and as such the Federal Government of Australia was recognised by an international court of law as having authority in those off-shore areas. Of course, it was a highly contentious issue with six States and the Federal Government each claiming their rights in the off-shore areas. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Georges" NAMEID="7V4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7V4">Senator Georges</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was pretty clear, but you people made it confused.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HV7">Senator YOUNG</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At that stage it had not even been legally decided who had what in that area. No claim could be made because there had not been a court decision on it. This had not been resolved. It was such a grey area that legislation regarding it was introduced in the six State Parliaments of Australia and in the Federal Parliament. In those parliaments it was identical legislation-what was then commonly known as mirror legislation. When it was introduced in this place strong criticism and genuine concern were expressed. Perhaps the most outspoken were former Senator Wright and a former member of the other place, Mr Bill Wentworth. I shall state some of their main grounds of criticism. Firstly, they said that since there were seven pieces of legislation, six originating in the States and one in the Federal Parliament, it would be very difficult ever to amend it. Secondly, they and other parliamentarians were gravely concerned that there was not enough Commonwealth responsibility for the overall administration of the off-shore areas in regard to the exploration for, and exploitation of, oil. The fact that oil had been found in Bass Strait had created a need for the legislation and there was about its consideration an element of urgency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Nevertheless, because of these and other reasons, it was decided to establish a Senate select committee. That was done in late 1967. The Committee met first in January 1968 and among its members have been such illustrious senators-they are still in the Senate-as Senator Justin O'Byrne, Mr President himself and Senator Keeffe. I was also a member of the committee, as were many other senators who have now retired from the Parliament. The Committee sat over some three and a half years and took, as honourable senators will appreciate, great amounts of evidence. It brought down its report in 1971. The report included many conclusions and recommendations for the guidance of the Parliament. The major problem was still as to where the real authority in the off-shore lay. There had still been no legal inquiry, or High Court decision, regarding the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1975 the High Court did reach a decision which spelt out clearly that the paramount authority lay with the Federal Government and extended from the low water mark. Nevertheless, because of co-operative federalism that had existed between the Federal Government and the six State governments, discussions were held with the Premiers as to how the overall situation might be resolved. It was decided that the States should have authority to the 3-mile limit, or area of the territorial sea, and that the Federal Government should have jurisdiction in the waters and on the sea bed beyond that limit. From those discussions emerged the amendment to the Seas and Submerged Lands Act which was introduced last year. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, the off-shore legislation has passed the test of time. In the off-shore areas exploration activity has increased. To my knowledge, in no area have grave problems been experienced. The State administrations have conducted the whole exercise in their areas in a most exemplary manner and to my knowledge the oil industry has expressed no genuine criticism or concern in regard to overall administration. </PARA>
<PARA> I realise that tonight the Opposition has referred to this legislation in strong terms. It has been concerned about, and highly critical of, the fact that the Federal Government has seen fit to continue to allow the States to possess authority to the 3-mile limit. Basically, it comes back to a difference in political philosophy concerning responsibilities. The Australian Labor Party has always sought centralised and total control in Canberra, whereas the Liberal Party has always worked for what it has called co-operative federalism, which involves the spreading of authority throughout the nation. That concept has been applied; that philosophy has continued to be held. One could continue on this subject and begin speaking about exploration and how it fell away as a result of Labor's term in office. That has been said so many times in this place that I do not intend to repeat it tonight. But I would emphasise that the basic differences that have produced the criticism and opposition tonight are related to differences in political philosophies regarding responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minerals (Submerged Lands) Bill, which relates to the off-shore mining of minerals, follows closely the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) legislation which has been in existence since 1967. That legislation did operate even though there was in existence a Senate committee with regard to its effectiveness. It had been introduced in the parliaments of Australia-I emphasise the word 'parliaments'-in 1967. Perhaps one of the big things to come out of the legislation last year is the fact that Commonwealth responsibility has flowed right down through the States themselves; the Commonwealth Minister himself is now regarded as responsible to the Federal Parliament in this matter. In the original legislation that provision did not exist. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Minister pointed out in the second reading speech, the Minerals (Submerged Lands) Bill has many facets. As I said of the off-shore oil legislation, which was amended last year and which it is proposed to amend again tonight, the Commonwealth legislation will apply beyond the 3-mile limit and the State legislation will apply out to that limit. There is a difference in regard to the mining of minerals. Because of the needs for efficient administration, underground mining which extends from the shore will be excluded. It will be controlled by State legislation. That demonstrates the sense of realism of the Government. In some cases coal mines are already in existence and extend well out beyond the low water mark in New South Wales. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How far?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HV7">Senator YOUNG</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot give the honourable senator the details and it would be improper to make a wild guess. A mine shaft may not be out very far today but it may be one of these days. This legislation is not being made just for today. It is being made for the years ahead. This will be very effective legislation. Foresight dictates that the States, which have been operating efficiently in this area of activity, should continue without interference from the Federal Government. Again, as in the off-shore legislation, joint authorities will exist. The Minister for National Development and Energy in the Federal Parliament will work in conjunction with the Minister for Mines, or Minerals, Energy or whatever may be his designation in the particular State, in regard to all mining operations beyond the 3-mile territorial sea, or State area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The important thing that comes through here is the fact that the Commonwealth Minister will have the final say in regard to any area in respect of which there is disagreement between the designated authorities, or, to put it in parliamentary language, between the two respective Ministers. This is a very important point. The Federal Parliament will still have the final responsibility. Firstly, the designated Federal Minister for National Development and Energy will be responsible to this Parliament. Even though he will work as part of a joint authority with the respective State Ministers, when it comes to any disagreement at all he will have the final say. The joint authorities will cover many major areas. They will deal with such things as the titles to be issued, the granting, refusal or transfer of licences, if any of the exploration companies are fortunate to find anything, and with any farm-ins. In fact, the overall administration of who will have licences or permits and how people will operate in those areas will come under the auspices of the joint authorities. But I emphasise again that the Federal Minister is the man who will have the final say if there is disagreement. So let us not have any criticism from the Opposition that this Parliament or Government are abrogating their responsibilities, because they certainly are not. </PARA>
<PARA> The overall day-to-day operations will be policed by the various State mines departments or whatever those departments may be called. That provision is identical to that in the off-shore petroleum legislation because, I repeat, that legislation has stood the test of time. I am delighted to see that we are following the same pattern of successful history with regard to mining of minerals in off-shore areas because, quite frankly, it would be farcical if a Federal government were to have its departments in each State as well as the States having their own departments, with a consequent duplication of administration and extra costs. So it is good to see the Government basing this legislation on previous legislation which, as I have said many times previously in this speech, has stood the test of time. </PARA>
<PARA> The overall administration of off-shore oil exploration in Australia-I am not talking about drilling success rates-stands second to none. When one looks at the problems of Canada and the United States of America, one sees that Australia stands way out in front in efficiency of operation and in co-operation and co-ordination between the Federal Parliament and the State parliaments. Although we came to the off-shore oil scene well after Canada and the United States of America, we possibly learned by their mistakes. I know that there are some in those countries who would like today to have the same legislation that we have in this country because of the efficiency of operation in Australia. One could go on to other areas and deal with such things as royalties. Again there is to be a sharing of royalties between the Commonwealth and the States. Of course, the States are entitled to their share. Administrative costs will be picked up by the States, but they will get income from licence fees, permit fees and other things to assist them with those costs. </PARA>
<PARA> In supporting this legislation, particularly the fact that it parallels and in many ways is identical to the off-shore petroleum legislation, I am pleased to see that the Federal Government is bringing in legislation dealing with the exploration and the possible exploitation of minerals in off-shore areas. As I said earlier in my speech, we had more or less to rush legislation through the Australian parliaments because oil had been found in Bass Strait and there was a need to get some uniformity in off-shore legislation in this country. This Government is preparing the way now for off-shore exploration for minerals and, we hope, for their exploitation. Of course, overseas a lot of work at present is being done with regard to seabed mining, including mining in deep and international waters. It is known that there are rich amounts of minerals in many areas of the seabed. One does not know the costs or many of the techniques with regard to exploitation of those minerals, but with the advances in technology these days we will no doubt see mining operations taking place in the off-shore areas in the not too distant future. Already two off-shore permits have been issued in New South Wales and one in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> No doubt when this legislation comes into force it will give a lot of confidence to many companies which will be prepared to do some exploration in the hope that they can be successful and can move into exploitation. This legislation will give those companies and this country confidence to move out into those areas. I hope that one of these days we, as a nation, will reap further rewards from the challenges that lie in the off-shore areas. I have much pleasure in supporting these Bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats are very concerned at those aspects of this legislation which to our mind are virtually a blueprint for major disaster at some future time and which could effectively destroy the Great Barrier Reef as a natural asset, not for all time but perhaps for decades or even for centuries. There is no real guarantee that a major oil spill which affected the reef could ever be effectively cleaned up. I suggest that we are looking at that order of disaster. There has been a long battle on this question concerning the Great Barrier Reef. It seems to have recurred constantly in this decade. I refer to the necessity for conservationists and others, including members of this Parliament, to protect the Great Barrier Reef against the depredations of the Government, of State governments of a similar political complexion and of their financial backers. Basically that is what it amounts to. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume), in his second reading speech, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The opportunity is being taken in this Bill to extend the application of the off-shore petroleum legislation to the continental shelf in the Coral Sea area. This is one of the last areas of the Australian continental shelf virtually unexplored for petroleum. It is considered to be prospective and the petroleum industry has expressed keen interest in exploration there. </PARA>
<PARA>There the Government's motive is expressed-it wants to serve the petroleum industry. What the petroleum industry wants, the Government, by a knee jerk reaction, immediately does. It is like the old saying in the United States of America that what is good for the car industry is good for America. It did not really work out that way on the whole. But I think the theory of Liberal-Country Party governments in Australia is that what is good for the overseas multinational petroleum industry is good for Australia. I suggest that is something which not all of us are going to accept without a grain of salt. The Minister, later in the second reading speech, said:</PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the areas adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef region the Government is very mindful of its undertaking to protect the reef and it has therefore been decided that no commitment will be given to issue exploration permits within 30 miles of the reef . . . </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have just quoted from the Minister's second reading speech. It was a precise quotation-'no commitment will be given to issue exploration permits within 30 miles of the reef'. Presumably the Minister knows what he is talking about. I suggest the honourable senator take the matter up with him if he wishes any further discussion on it. When we get a printed second reading speech here, I take it that what is in it is correct. I find it rather surprising for a Government senator to bring up the point that it might not be correct. However, I suggest that he take that up with the Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A little while ago Senator Young talked about political philosophy. If it is Liberal political philosophy to exploit, no matter what dangers there might be in the future, honourable senators are welcome to it. I suggest that the Government is being found out because the Australian public is now beginning to drop to it and to understand that, despite all its cosmetic operations and all its attempts to show itself as being different from what it is, it is being revealed as the creature of outside interests who manipulate it like a pawn. What it does rather than what is says is important, and this legislation is something which it proposes to implement. The Australian people will judge the Government on that and not on what it says. Senator Young in his speech also mentioned Commonwealth responsibility. He said that this Parliament has all sorts of powers and influences and can do all sorts of things. I ask him: If there were a blow-out similar to the one that occurred in the Gulf of Mexico when oil drifted many hundreds of kilometres and the spill was more than 100 kilometres in extent-some people say it was as much as 250 kilometres-what would we, sitting here, do about it? Of course, it would be too late. Whatever powers one has here would be of no help at all. </PARA>
<PARA> What could exist is a momentary situation in which a well that was drilled blew out and could not be capped. There would be nothing anybody on God's earth could do to stop the consequences, least of all those of us in this Parliament. I suggest that our job in this Parliament is to see that things such as that do not happen. We have powers to try to see that something does not happen which will be such an incredible disaster. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, this has been a long battle. I have no doubt it will continue to be a long battle. For us it started on 28 February 1979 when my colleague, Senator Chipp, moved:</PARA>
<PARA> That the following matter be referred to the Standing Committee on Science and the Environment: Oil Exploration in the Great Barrier Reef area, including all the possible effects on any such exploration. </PARA>
<PARA>That reference was modified subsequently to be the inquiry on marine science of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment on which I have the honour to serve and whose inquiries are almost complete. It has some things to say about this area too. On 24 May 1979, the Attorney-General, Senator Durack, a man whom I respect, made a statement to the Press which:</PARA>
<PARA>gave an assurance that the Federal Government would not permit any activity which could in any way damage the Great Barrier Reef. </PARA>
<PARA>I would have thought that that was a clear enough statement. He said with no equivocation 'that the Federal Government would not permit any activity which could in any way damage the Great Barrier Reef'. </PARA>
<PARA> I will spend a little time reminding honourable senators of the uniqueness of the Great Barrier Reef and the extent of the responsibility which we have. It appears to me that the Government regularly forgets this. It may be under the influence of people in other parts of the world who probably regard the only land of any real asset as being land on which one can grow peanuts. That is evident from that State Premier's view of the land he gave away to Mr Iwasaki which he described as waste land but which I would describe as one of the most beautiful and interesting parts of the Australian coast. So honourable senators can see that we have a difficulty with people who may be well-intentioned but whose judgment is faulty on matters of this kind. </PARA>
<PARA> The Great Barrier Reef is the largest, most complex system of coral reefs ever to exist on the earth as far as we know. It is 1,900 kilometres long. Its total area is twice that of England. It consists of over 2,500 individual coral reefs, all of which are interconnected. It has been said by experts on it that so delicate is the interdependence of the ecology that one cannot destroy any large area of it without destroying the whole reef effectively. Between 1,000 and 2,000 species of fish live in the reef. Some turtles such as the leatherback and the green turtle are endangered species and are peculiar to the reef. The same applies to several species of birds found in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> At this stage, having established that we have on our hands something which is regarded by the world as being of the most vital importance and as a unique asset which cannot be replaced, I think we should look properly at the weather circumstances and the currents which operate in the area in which the Government now proposes to permit oil exploration. In winter the surface currents of the Coral Sea move generally from east to west and then move along the reef and the Queensland coast. That is nicely designed so that if ever the Government's scenario, which it is trying so hard to sell to us now, of allowing drilling for oil 40 miles or 50 miles off the reef comes to pass, there is no way, if there is a spill in those circumstances, that those currents will not carry that oil spill on to the reef. It would not only carry the oil to one part of the reef but also distribute it down the entire length of the reef. That is basically what we are talking about. Those are the winter currents. </PARA>
<PARA> In summer the surface currents move generally from north to south so that any oil slick in summer would move either on to the reef or down the Queensland and New South Wales coasts and even beyond the reef. I refer to air currents and winds. The Coral Sea area is subject to cyclonic weather which would spread an oil slick further and faster than could occur merely through the actions of surface currents. On-shore winds are common. So we have a situation in which, if an oil spill occurred, it would be very difficult indeed to halt it or do anything about it before it reached the coral areas. What would happen when it reached the coral areas? I had the advantage of being able to fly across the whole extent of the coral reef with my Committee during our current inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> What impressed me more deeply than anything else was the tremendous inaccessability of most of the reefs. We flew for mile after mile over huge areas of shallow water. We saw reefs which are exposed at low tide and places into which one could not even get a rowing boat at low tide. I cannot think or have I read of any kind of device which could clean up an oil spill and which could be brought into that area once the oil was there. Once the oil got there it would be there to stay. That would be the consequences of what we would do. I will not take the time of the Senate unduly over this matter. I make one final point. I think honourable senators will find that the figures justify this statement. If there were a well blow out of Townsville of the size of the Ixtoc No. 1 well blow out off Campeche Bay, Mexico, in mid 1979, even if it occurred very much further out than the suggested limit of 30 miles from the reef, that oil slick would cover the reef completely from Cairns to Rockhampton. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak on the Petroleum (Submerged Lands-Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 1981. I make it quite clear at the outset that I have no intention of supporting the Bill because I am very concerned about the Great Barrier Reef and the Bill that will give the opportunity for people to do surveys off the Barrier Reef with the ultimate aim of drilling for oil.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I made a speech in this chamber on 22 May 1979 in a debate on an appropriation Bill when I spoke about this issue. At that time, I said:</PARA>
<PARA> Let us consider the Great Barrier Reef. It has some 2,500 islands. It has 60 to 70 sand cays. It extends for some 1,900 kilometres down the Coast of Queensland. It covers about 2,700 square kilometres, which is an area the size of England. I believe that we have had an example of the damage an oil spillage can do to the Barrier Reef. </PARA>
<PARA>At that time I was referring and I drew the attention of the Senate to the fact that on 4 March 1970 the oil tanker Oceanic Grandeur ran aground on the reef. My speech continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The oil spillage caused concern to Australians at that time and caused a great deal of damage. </PARA>
<PARA>It caused damage to many parts of the reef and to many industries which were concerned with the Great Barrier Reef. In my speech at that time I said:</PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the damage it did to the coral, to the fish and to other parts of the Barrier Reef, it had a devastating effect on the growing of pearl shells in the Torres Strait. Although I am told the the Prime Minister today has made a statement that there will be no drilling on the Reef, I ask: Just exactly what does that mean? Does it mean drilling actually on the coral? Is he talking about drilling through the coral? Is he talking about drilling alongside the coral or off the edge of the reef?</PARA>
<PARA>What was the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) actually talking about? Today we find what the Government is actually talking about. The Government is talking about drilling or allowing exploration off the Barrier Reef. Today I had some time in discussions with the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Carrick) who is responsible for this Bill. He told me that there will be a so-called buffer zone of some 30 miles or 45 kilometres off the Barrier Reef. I am still not satisfied that there will be protection of the Great Barrier Reef. To me the Great Barrier Reef is not just something of which the Australian people should be proud and about which the Australian people should be doing everything possible to ensure its preservation. I believe, as I said in my speech on 22 May 1979, that the Barrier Reef is not just a phenomenon ranked as one of the wonders of the world. We have the responsibility of being the custodians of the Great Barrier Reef. I believe that that is a tremendous responsibility for the Australian people. The reef does not belong to the Australian people. It does not belong to any single person or identity. It belongs to the world. I repeat: It is one of the wonders of the world. We have a tremendous responsibility because we are the custodians of that wonder of the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Today we are debating a Bill that could have tremendous effects on the Great Barrier Reef. I am not convinced, despite all the rhetoric that has been spoken, that the Government will ensure that oil spills or blowouts of wells 40 miles off the reef will have no effect on the reef. That is a lot of eyewash as far as I am concerned because oil travels. It floats on top of the sea for many miles. The Great Barrier Reef extends from the Cape York Peninsula to about Gladstone on the coast of Queensland. I do not need to tell you that, Mr Deputy President, because you are a Queenslander. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not convinced that the Government has taken the necessary steps to ensure that the reef will be protected. If one looks at what has happened in other parts of the world with oil spills and blowouts, one will see the damage that can be caused. It is all very well to say that no exploration or drilling will take place near the Great Barrier Reef and that there will be a zone of some 30 miles and, outside that zone, there will be another zone of 30 miles or 45 kilometres, whichever one likes to call it, so that we are looking at a total distance of about 60 miles. In looking at oil spills we have to take into account tide movements, winds and the other conditions that prevail at sea. I suppose that I would have as much experience, if not more experience, as any of the members of the Senate in diving and swimming in the Great Barrier Reef area. I have dived for shells and I know what the tides, the prevailing winds and other things can do in the area of the Great Barrier Reef. We are talking about putting up rigs and drilling, say, 60 miles off the Great Barrier Reef. What does that mean in actual terms? It means nothing. I wonder how many of the people in this chamber tonight realise and understand what happens on the north coast of Queensland. It has a cyclonic season. South-east winds blow in those areas. Let us assume for the moment that a rig is drilling for oil 60 miles off the Great Barrier Reef and it finds oil. That would be a great boon for Australia. But what would happen if a cyclone occurs the next day and it completely destroyed the rig and caused an oil blowout into the air? That oil must come down sometime. Where would it come down? It would come down on top of the water. What would happen to it? It would be carried by the tides or the winds, whatever the case may be. Where would it carry the oil? It would not carry it out to sea. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it will not carry it down to Tasmania. That is too far down. It would carry it to shore, over the coral reefs, and destroy one of the great wonders of the world. This concerns me. I know that there are many people-not only Queenslanders but also New South Welshmen, Victorians, South Australians and Western Australians as well as people from all over the world-who are concerned at the possibility of the destruction of one of the great wonders of the world, the Great Barrier Reef. It happens to be off the shores of our great continent, but it is not just our property; it is the property of the world. I believe that we are only the custodians of it. I want to quote an example of what happened in another part of the world. I am sorry if I do not pronounce some of these words correctly. That may be due to my ethnic background. I quote from a letter from the Australian Littoral Society of 26 May 1981, which states in part:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Ixtoc No. 1 well blow-out off Campeche Bay, Mexico released an oil slick that travelled at least 1,125 km across the Gulf of Mexico and caused pollution problems along the Texas coast of the United States. At one point in the nine month period before the well was finally capped on 23 March 1980, it was estimated that oil covered about 10 per cent of the surface of the Gulf of Mexico-that is about 185,000 square kilometres. </PARA>
<PARA> In all, at least 3.1 million barrels of oil spilled from the well. The semi-submersible Sedco 135 drilling rig was destroyed, and Mexico spent $US132 million on capping the well and attempting to contain the environmental damage, and lost $US87 million in oil revenue. Residents of Texas are seeking over $US250 million for damages. This well was drilling in only 50 metres of water. </PARA>
<PARA>It was drilling in only 50 metres of water. When I was in my prime in diving along the Great Barrier Reef for trochus shells and the like, I would probably have dived that distance with an aqualung or something like that. Yet here we have this kind of thing happening in only 50 metres of water. We are talking about drilling off the continental shelf, which is a greater depth, and yet we are told that there is no possibility of damage to the Great Barrier Reef. I do not believe that and I am not prepared to accept it. Therefore, I am speaking tonight strongly against the possibility of drilling for oil off the Great Barrier Reef. It is all very well for the Government to say: 'All we are doing at the moment is giving permission for people to investigate and conduct research in this area'. The Government cannot tell me that companies will put millions of dollars into exploration for oil and, after they have found oil, say: 'We are not going to drill. We do not want the millions of dollars worth of oil down there. We are only investigating. Now that we have found out, we are going to wait until someone says that it is safe to drill'. They will not say that at all. I know, as an Aborigine, that the almighty dollar is all important to the average person in this country, particularly to the people who will put these dollars into exploration. Once they have put that money into the exploration they will want their money back. If there is the possibility of finding oil down there, they will get it out. Whilst I have the greatest respect and admiration for the current Minister, with all due respect, he will not always be the responsible Minister. What truly worries me is what will happen with the next Minister, whether he be a Liberal, Labor or Democrat Minister. I do not give a continental damn about his party. I am concerned about the protection of the reef. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this case, I do not give a continental damn about that. I am concerned about the protection of the reef. I do not want to see any possibility arising of damage being done to one of the great wonders of the world. As I said earlier, the Government may claim that oil drilling may be allowed in the Coral Sea area without any risk of significant harm to the Great Barrier Reef. If this legislation is passed, many Australians, including the members of the Littoral Society, will regard it as a betrayal of the Government's promise not to allow any exploitation that could harm the reef until the results of both short and long term research are known.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have been told that there have been all sorts of investigations into this matter but no one yet, not even the Minister, has been able to give me a total assurance that drilling outside the Barrier Reef will be safe. No one has been able to assure me that if we drill one mile, two miles, 10 miles or 100 miles off the reef and there is a blow-out, it can be contained. Technology has not yet reached that point at which I, the Australian people and the people of the world can be given an assurance that no matter what happens, if there is a blow-out or damage is done to the oil rig or anything else, we can protect the reef, we can stem the flow of oil. No one in this Parliament, including the Minister, can give me an absolute assurance that if there is drilling and oil is found, whether there is a blow-out, damage to the rig, to the pipes or to anything else the oil flow can be contained so that there will be no damage to the Great Barrier Reef. I do not care whether drilling takes place, 30 miles, 40 miles, 60 miles or 100 miles away from the Great Barrier Reef; if we are stupid enough and insensitive enough to allow drilling with the risks that can be incurred, we will not be living up to our responsibilities as the custodians of one of the greatest wonders of the world. Therefore, I speak tonight against this piece of legislation. I assure the Senate that even if I am the only person who votes against this Bill, so be it. All I say is that if honourable senators allow a rift to occur whereby one of the greatest wonders of the world is destroyed, it will be on their heads. They are responsible to the people of this Parliament and to the future generations not only of Australians but also of the people of the world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can assure Senator Bonner that he is not alone in opposing the legislation before the Senate. The Opposition is also opposed to the Bills. I wish to state quite clearly the number of reasons for our opposition to the Bills. Senator Bonner and other members of the chamber will realise that back in the late 1960s when we set up a Senate select committee to look at the off-shore petroleum resources in Australia, which committee sat for some three years, we went into very great detail on the possible dangers to the Great Barrier Reef if a hydrocarbon prospective area were found in the vicinity of the reef, and exploration and exploitation were to take place in the reef area. The Committee was unanimous in its opinion that this was one of the great dangers to the reef, that if we decided to explore in that area it was possible that irretrievable damage would be done to the reef.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was amazed when the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) said recently that he felt that drilling in the Coral Sea outside the 30-kilometre boundary-he apparently set that arbitrarily-would cause no damage to the reef. That is, in fact, a fallacy. The tidal area in the Coral Sea extends well beyond 30 kilometres. It probably goes out to 150 kilometres or 200 kilometres. If oil were found in that area and there were a break in the pipeline or at the wellhead, damage could be done to the reef. Let us look back in history to when a major oil tanker was in trouble in the Torres Strait. We were told all sorts of stories by the government of the day to the effect that there would be no permanent damage. The pearl oyster industry in the strait was wrecked. It was wrecked not necessarily as a result of the oil spillage but it was certainly aggravated by the detergents used in the area in an effort to clear up the oil spillage. Today that industry has practically disappeared from the Torres Strait. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to the hydrocarbon prospective areas. I suppose the Queensland Government is partly responsible for this legislation because in a deal that was made in the mirror legislation of the day, we took over an area in the Coral Sea in a direct swap with Papua New Guinea for areas south of the Papuan Gulf. This protected the Queensland Government because certain elements of the Queensland Government, including Cabinet Ministers and the Premier, had leases for exploration in the area north of Cape York. I think they believed at the time that this was the area in which oil would be found. A geologist, now retired, has told me that the Barrier Reef is probably not one of the best hydrocarbon prospective areas in Australia, nevertheless he has stated to me in a written document that without doubt there are probably large deposits of natural gas in the area, particularly in the Middle Reef area. Since then other geologists have apparently said that the Coral Sea area, the part to which this legislation refers, is a hydrocarbon prospective area. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that no government in this country will be idiotic enough to believe what the Deputy Prime Minister of this country has said, and that is that we could drill within 30 kilometres of the reef and not damage it. That is not true in any circumstances, because of the way in which the tidal area operates in that part of the Coral Sea. That has been spelt out quite clearly in documents published privately and by governments. I see no reason why this government should knuckle under to the transnational companies, which would be absolutely delighted to obtain leasehold areas in that area for their own exploration purposes. But it is tied in with more than that. It is tied in with the reluctance of this Government to grasp the nettle and declare-we can do it under Commonwealth legislation-the whole of the Barrier Reef area a marine park. All we have done so far is to declare one small area a marine park. I note with some interest that at the weekend the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) said that if the Queensland Government was not prepared to come to the party-he did not use precisely those words but the message was the same-the Commonwealth would use its own powers to declare the Barrier Reef a marine park. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It will be done in a piecemeal fashion. Senator Bonner is dead right. The Government wants to do it in a piecemeal fashion, little bits at a time. We have one little piece. That is the only piece that has been declared a marine park. Every Queenslander and, I hope, every Australian will realise that the Great Barrier Reef is one of the unique wonders, if the not the main wonder, of the world. There is no other such area in any other part of the world. But the Government has been reluctant to declare the whole area a marine park. It is not at all necessary to say that we must declare it in zones. We can put a blanket cover on it and say: 'This is a marine park and as such it is protected against the exploiters of the marine resources of the area'. This would apply not only to minerals on the floor of the ocean. That aspect is very much in its early stages. Probably some of the best uranium deposits are to be found on the floor of the ocean. Certainly, a number of minerals are ready for harvesting. We do not want to see this sort of thing happen. Probably the prospective areas of the Great Barrier Reef can be exploited to the greatest commercial extent that the world search for minerals has seen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I respectfully suggest that the whole of the Barrier Reef be declared a marine park and let us work out the zones later. We do not have to pick it off piece by piece or knuckle under to holy Joh because he and his numerous companies want to exploit the area. Those mining leases which are now frozen-they are still locked up in a safe somewhere in the Queensland Government system-are ready to go at the first opportunity. This legislation provides the first opportunity for exploration effort and exploitation effort in the areas thought to contain hydrocarbons. </PARA>
<PARA> Most honourable senators would realise that north Queensland, particularly on the east and west coast of Cape York Peninsula, is subjected to an average of up to eight cyclones a year. This year was an exception. In fact, this year the nearest we have been to a cyclone was last Wednesday and Thursday week when a low pressure influence off the coast of Townsville brought most unseasonable rain and winds. But that is not the norm. In most other years at least seven fairly destructive cyclones have hit that area and many of them originated in the Coral Sea and the Gulf of Carpentaria. So if a prospective well in the Coral Sea, even if it were 100 kilometres from the Barrier Reef, reached the producing stage, it is quite possible that a severe cyclone could rupture the pipelines and that would be the end of the Barrier Reef in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> Over 60 years ago a very rough cyclone off the coast of Mackay damaged the Barrier Reef to a very considerable extent. This has led to higher tides in that area than on the rest of the north Queensland coast. It is possible that that section of the Reef will never fully recover. It may recover, but we do not know what will happen in the next 100 years. But there will be no opportunity to save the Reef in the next 100 years if we are mad enough, at this stage in our political history, to allow drilling in the Coral Sea that close to the Reef. If those people who want to drill in the Coral Sea win, the next step would be to drill in the middle reef area and in a whole number of other prospective areas. If the Federal Government is responsible, it has a duty to ensure that the Reef is protected. It will not be acting responsibly if we pass this legislation which will allow a piecemeal operation to provide enough evidence that the Reef is a hydrocarbon area where possibly great profits can be obtained. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at this matter in the long term. Australia is not short of natural oil. Bass Strait provides some 70 per cent-together with the contribution from the Roma basin-of Australia's requirements of petroleum products. It is true that we do not have the heavier types of oil that we need and that we have to import all or most of them. But we do not know what the new finds will produce. There has been no public declaration of the quality of the oil coming from the new areas. We do not know what the North West Shelf will finally produce. We do know what Barrow Island produced. Probably one of the great sins of the Australian Government is that it allowed the Wapet company and other people associated with it to explore Barrow Island to the point where it became a public scandal. At that time a number of wells were allowed to be drilled in that area in order to put the type of subsidy that we pay on indigenous oil into their financial coffers. </PARA>
<PARA> It is well known in the geological world and in the world of oil exploration and exploitation that if we force indigenous oil out of the ground at a very fast rate, up to 40 per cent of the exploitable oil will be left behind. It is not a commercial operation to take the oil out of the ground after water and gas pressures have been used to bring oil to the surface. That is what happened at Barrow Island. I am not sure whether it is not happening in Bass Strait, but at the moment there is no written evidence which enables me to make a conclusive decision on the matter. If we do find oil in this area, it is almost certain-because of the general weather conditions, the possibility of cyclones, et cetera-that there will be an attempt to get as much oil as possible in the quickest possible time in a world that is hungry for fossil fuels. We will probably exploit wells in that area at well beyond their capacity to produce. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that if we allow the Bill to pass this chamber in its current form, we will sell our posterity, we will not be fair dinkum in our attempt to subscribe to the policy of preservation of hydrocarbon fuels and most of all-it is the greatest damage that we can do-we will possibly destroy the Barrier Reef. Following in the wake of the destruction of the Barrier Reef will be a change in the tidal patterns on the whole coast of north Queensland. It is possible that where we now have industrial plants and many residential areas, the increase in the height of tides will be sufficient to be totally destructive. We know what a cyclone can do in terms of tidal surges. That was emphasised to a degree by both Cyclone Tracy and Cyclone Althea. On both those occasions the tide was nearly at its lowest ebb. </PARA>
<PARA> The tidal surge from Cyclone Althea which hit some northern suburbs of Townsville was as high as 28 feet. It was never lower than 10 feet and that was at low tide. Some people have said that the highest tidal surge ever known was at Bathurst Bay. The tidal surge measured approximately 40 feet under the old imperial measurement and cost the lives of some 300 people. But only a few of those were counted as lost because the rest were black and in those days nobody counted the number of black people killed. So the published figures show only a few white people being killed on that mission. The rest were Aboriginal people. Nevertheless, the death toll was in the vicinity of 300 people. Only three people died as a result of Cyclone Althea but 329 people received hospital treatment. In the case of Cyclone Tracy, more than 50 people lost their lives and a very large number of people were injured. If a cyclone of the magnitude of Tracy or Althea were to strike an area where oil exploration or hydrocarbon exploitation were carried out, there is no way in the world that the flow of oil from ruptured pipes could be prevented from reaching the Barrier Reef and ultimately the coast. So if we are wise people, interested in the preservation of our greatest natural asset, all of us will oppose this Bill. I hope that that applies to honourable senators on both sides of this chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has before it eight pieces of legislation, all of which relate to seas and submerged lands issues. Two relate to petroleum and the other six are new-type legislation relating to minerals. They provide for minerals a similar set of circumstances to that which is being introduced for petroleum. The petroleum measure seeks to do two things: It seeks to tidy up a number of anomalies which have emerged in the 1980 legislation arising out of our need to work with the States to gain joint co-operation and it seeks to define an area of the Coral Sea for possible exploration. Of the minerals Bills, the main Bill, that is, the Minerals (Submerged Lands) Bill is supported by a Minerals (Submerged Lands) (Royalty) Bill, a Minerals (Submerged Lands) (Production Permit Fees) Bill, a Minerals (Submerged Lands) (Production Licence Fees) Bill, and a Minerals (Submerged Lands) (Registration Fees) Bill. Those six Bills seek to do for minerals off-shore in submerged lands what has happened to petroleum. It is well to remind the Senate that in the past, and particularly in 1967, arrangements were made by Liberal governments of the time with the States for certain State responsibilities. In 1974, the High Court gave a ruling indicating that the powers of the Commonwealth extended from the low water mark. Nevertheless, this Liberal Government indicated that it believed that it was sensible, on a continent of this size and on a continent which operates with one Commonwealth Parliament and six State parliaments, to have joint co-operation to get both the petroleum and minerals exploration and development effectively under way. The Government obviously had before it quite clearly that State governments in the past had dealt with the main problems off-shore of their States. It was quite clear also that they had both the administrative capacity and a considerable expertise and therefore, even though the constitutional power lay quite clearly at low water mark and outwards for the Commonwealth, an arrangement was made whereby the States would operate in the territorial seas beyond that out to the continental shelf. While the Commonwealth itself would have the authority, the administration would be done by the States. There would be a designated authority, being the States and a joint authority, being the Commonwealth. Therefore, what we have before us tonight, in terms of petroleum, is the need to do some tidying up and the need for a Coral Sea definition and, in terms of minerals, a mirroring, virtually, of the petroleum provisions, with, as I think Senator Young pointed out, the States having the right to underground tunnelling and mining but with the Commonwealth nevertheless sharing the royalties from that. So, it is quite clear that the minerals legislation follows the pattern of the petroleum legislation in the past.</PARA></TALK.START>

I think there must be a relevant Standing Order which provides for the fact that policy should not be distorted in the way in which the Minister is so doing. It is true that certain things were done in the Whitlam years. It is equally true that the then Opposition, the present Government, consistently blocked all the legislation that the Whitlam Government attempted to get through the Parliament at the time to protect the Barrier Reef.

The chairman of the royal commission said that there should be no further exploration for petroleum in the Great Barrier Reef region and that there should be no renewal of petroleum exploration permits in the region until the results of both the short and long term research are known. This Government has not only accepted that without question but also has gone further.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If all honourable senators would pay attention and listen as I did when they were speaking, we might be able to get some understanding of this situation. The fact is that this Government is quite emphatic that nowhere at all beyond the boundaries of the adjacent area will it in any way allow anything to happen which will damage the Barrier Reef. Let me define this situation. There is a region which provides a 48-kilometre buffer around the reef. Beyond that is an adjacent area which extends into the Coral Sea and the definition of that area is contained in one of the Bills. It is not to be presumed that, simply because an area is defined, there will be drilling or an open season in those areas. The Commonwealth Government has said emphatically that it will not allow any action at all to be taken which will threaten the reef. Before any kind of drilling would be taken anywhere, there would be action under the Commonwealth environment impact legislation to insist that we had before us the best of all information. For that to happen we would have available to us the top ecologists of Australia and of the Australian Institute of Marine Science and all those who could come to us and say: 'If you do this, you will do damage'. So, quite clearly, the test would be one to each area and that applies whether it is on the edge of the adjacent area or further out. The Government is second to none on this matter. It is a form of intellectual arrogance that believes that one person has a monopoly on the right to protect the reef. Everyone in the Govenrment wants to protect the reef. If one looks at the Bill one will see quite clearly indeed that the Government has said that. There has been some suggestion that a State government might do this or that. Let me make it abundantly clear that it cannot do so.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I am grateful for the help. It reveals the lack of understanding. The fact of the matter is that there is a designated authority, the State; but the joint authority, the Commonwealth Government, has an overriding decision, a final decision, and nothing can be done unless the joint authority, the Commonwealth Government, says so. The Commonwealth Government gives a clear undertaking that it will never do anything to harm the Great Barrier Reef, whether it is done 48 kilometres or 100 kilometres off-shore. Let me make that clear. That point is to be understood because in that undertaking the Commonwealth Government will not universally approve permits or drilling unless an environmental impact statement, compiled with the best scientific knowledge there is, states that the drilling could proceed. Within that context the government has acted in the best interests of the royal commission. It has acted on the best advice available. I give an unqualified assurance to the Senate in the same terms as the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) gave. The Government will do nothing, either on the Great Barrier Reef or in any region adjacent to the reef, which in any way will harm the reef. That region has no limit to its extension. If in fact it is shown by any action at all, by any environmental impact study, by the Bureau of Mineral Resources, Geology and Geophysics or by any scientist that harm will occur, we will take no action. We will protect the reef. I want to make that abundantly clear. With that statement and with that knowledge, I commend the package of Bills to the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise in the Committee stage some of the objections that I raised earlier tonight when apparently it was not quite the right thing to do. I say now that I was shocked at the reply of the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Carrick) to the debate. I am shocked at the contents of the Bills. I am amazed that a Government which said four or five years ago that it was prepared to declare the whole of the Great Barrier Reef a marine national park has failed to do just that. The Government has declared one tiny piece of the reef as a marine park, but it has failed to do anything about the rest of it. I know that a joint committee has been formed with the Queensland Government. The Queensland Government refuses to meet with the Commonwealth representatives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) said at the weekend that if necessary the Government would use the Commonwealth authority to declare the area a marine park. The Government has done nothing about the matter. It has no intention of doing anything about the reef because it lives in craven fear of the Premier of Queensland and everything he stands for. The Government has repudiated not only the marine park but also its obligation under the 1967 legislation to the Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders of this country. It has repudiated its promises on Medibank and on a whole lot of other issues. I do not want to go into all the details because it would lead to a very lengthy debate in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> We will soon get an omnibus Bill setting out all the razor gang's recommendations. I mention what we saw in King's Hall today. I never want to see again in my lifetime the brutality demonstrated by this Government. It threw out defenceless women and kids from King's Hall into pouring rain without any thought for anything except its own political skin. This followed the events of the last few days where the leader of the Liberal Party in New South Wales was deposed from office in a most ignominious ceremony and where the respected Premier of a State was thrown out because big business said he had to go. Let me tell the Committee that a gentleman, Mr Smith, on the weekend prior to his resignation from the Victorian Cabinet had discussions with the Prime Minister of this country as to how they could bring about Hamer's downfall. That is the sort of thing that is going on. The whole thing is corrupt. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight we are selling out to the transnational companies one of the greatest national assets this country has ever seen. I never thought I would see this Government, after all its promises, sell out to the transnational people and to the Premier whom they fear most, the Right Honourable Johannes Bjelke-Petersen. </PARA>

I think this is the most dangerous legislation, so far as Queenslanders are concerned, that has ever been brought into this Parliament. For all practical purposes it repudiates any promise the Fraser Government has ever made about the preservation of the Great Barrier Reef. I said in my party meeting about a week ago that the legislation was very dangerous. It represents a knuckling under by this Government not only to the gentleman I referred to in rather uncouth terms a while ago-I refer to the Premier of Queensland-and those who stand behind him but also a knuckling under to the transnational companies which want to exploit the area. Let us get over this charade of energy conservation, and particularly that of fossil fuels. There are companies in the world which are prepared to exploit the energy resources. We know of the sell-out over Rundle when Ministers of this Government told us what a magnificent show it was, and now the companies are not prepared to go ahead with the project. There are enough shale oil deposits around Queensland to provide a substantial portion--</PARA></TALK.START>

As far as I am concerned, this Bill is one of the most reckless that the Government has introduced. That is true not only of this Bill but also of all of the other areas of activity of which I spoke earlier. If we vote for the passage of this Bill at the third reading stage-I hope that we will not-we will have sold out the people of Australia. We will have sold out more than 50 per cent-probably 70 per cent or 80 per cent-of Australians who have expressed a view in regard to the Great Barrier Reef. This Government is only interested in selling out the natural heritage of the Australian people because it is under the control of the trans-national companies and of a Government in Queensland which has sold its minerals and everything else that it can bargain with at basement prices. Its Premier is not prepared to draw up a register of foreign ownership. He has refused his Cabinet and it is not game to buck him. He has refused his Government and it is not game to buck him either. He will not produce such a register because he knows that more than half the State is owned by foreign companies and individuals. The Iwasaki show represents one of the greatest scandals of all time. I am reminded of the gentleman who came from Honolulu. The Premier got his own son to become part of the board in order to get around the law.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps I could ask some relevant questions on the subject matter of this debate. I have listened to some of the remarks that have been made tonight and I certainly regret that I do not know more of the details of this Bill. Unfortunately, for reasons which I cannot understand, it has not been before the environment committee of our party. Thus, I have not had an opportunity to study its details. There are a number of associated Bills, the complete complexion of which escapes me. However, I wish to raise certain matters because the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Carrick), in replying to the second reading debate, gave very strong undertakings that not only would there be no drilling on the reef but there would be none that would in any way damage the reef. That is very important because in recent days many of us have received a number of representations from many organisations that are concerned with the preservation of the environment and with the maintenance, in all respects, of the reef as a part of the world heritage. As one heard Senator Bonner speak tonight, one was greatly concerned and supportive of the matters that he brought forward. Our concern is that in no case can there be damage to the reef.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Among the representations that I have received has been a letter from Mr Edward Hegerl, the Director of the Australian Littoral Society, in which he states, among other things:</PARA>
<PARA> Because of prevailing winds and currents any oil spilled in the Coral Sea would be expected to move westward toward the Great Barrier Reef and would then, depending on the season and location of the spill, either be distributed northward or southward along and through the Reef system. </PARA>
<PARA>It has always been my understanding that there was great danger and that therefore there must be a considerable distance between any drilling and the reef before one can be sure that there will be no danger. I realise that many steps must be taken before drilling will occur in the area; that environmental impact statements, permits and so forth will be required. Also, I appreciate that the Minister and the Federal Government hold a considerable power under these arrangements, whereby they are designated as the controlling authority. Mr Hegerl's letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Anthony has said in the Bill's second reading speech in the House that 'no commitment will be given to issue exploration permits within 30 miles of the Reef', suggesting that the Government believes that to allow drilling at some slightly greater distance will prevent harm to the Reef. </PARA>
<PARA>Obviously that is a different situation from what I understood the Minister to be giving us an undertaking about earlier tonight. As the Minister knows from a question I asked today, I am very anxious that all the areas of the marine park should be proclaimed as soon as possible. As I understood it, the Minister said-it seemed to me to be at least reasonably acceptable-that there was the reef, the marine park and then a buffer zone of 30 miles, and that it was beyond that zone that drilling was possible in the Coral Sea. That is very different from saying 'within 30 miles of the reef'. It would be very concerning if drilling were to be allowed within just 30 miles of some of the most magnificent reefs to be found anywhere in the world, particularly because of the currents. I would like to know which is right. Is the area that we are guaranteeing under this legislation to be 30 miles from the marine park and, therefore, outside that buffer zone, or is it to be just 30 miles beyond the reef? That is one thing I would like to know from the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The second thing I would like to know is: To what extent are inquiries and surveys being made which are not just dependent upon drilling taking place? Is it possible, in the present state of exploration, for there to be a spill? Therefore, is it possible for surveys of the currents to be made now, so that even before drilling or exploration goes on we know that there will be no danger in that operation-not just in the operation of actually taking the oil out but in the operation of exploring for oil? I would like to know from the Minister, before this debate finishes, which of those conclusions is true. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am bemused by the 3-mile limit. I would like to get some understanding of the distances involved with regard to Queensland and the Great Barrier Reef. Great concern has been expressed here. I am pleased that it has been expressed because at one stage I thought that the debate would lead to a quick passage of the legislation without any references to the new and emerging danger to the area. What does the 3-mile limit mean with regard to Queensland waters and the waters of the Great Barrier Reef? Has anyone made any sort of estimate as to what will happen with the overlap that could occur? What distance from the main coastline of Queensland will the 3-mile limit take us to? It would be interesting to know how far State responsibility will now go. How far have we ceded responsibility to the State Government?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some of us are still concerned that the State, having been given sovereignty in effect and having made a decision to do something under the rights ceded to it, would then be in a dominant position. The State would make a decision within the powers ceded to it and then the Commonwealth would have to impose-I hope it would still be able to do so-the rights of the people of Australia. It may seem idle to talk about this, but there are quite a number of islands and substantial reefs. Does the 3-mile limit surround those islands and reefs? I come back to the overlap. Could the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Carrick) let us know the answer? Of course, it is possible that he has taken that matter into consideration. But how far does the 3-mile limit go?</PARA>
<PARA> To save my getting up again, I would like to ask whether it is possible that a considerable amount of mineral exploitation other than that mentioned by Senator Young could take place. Could there be limestone mining on live sections of the Barrier Reef which have not been declared to be within the protected zone? How far out could that mining take place under State responsiblity without the Commonwealth being involved? All sorts of other aspects of mining could take place on the continental shelf. What protection has the reef from such activities? The reef is one ecosystem and to disturb one section of it would be to endanger the whole. If mining were allowed in one section under this legislation, the delicate balance of the reef would be seriously damaged. The reef is already under threat from a number of sources, including starfish, pollution from rivers, and depredations of man and tourism. The reef is under substantial threat. Any degrading of the reef and of the importance of the reef from an ecological point of view could lead to the destruction of the whole. That is my concern. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Carrick) said that, if research took place and oil were finally found on the Great Barrier Reef, the Government would have the final power to say whether mining or drilling shall take place. I am not prepared to accept that because the Government's track record in its use of reserve powers has been found lacking in recent times. In a referendum that was carried out in 1967 the Government was given power over the States if the States were to override the Commonwealth and carry out things that they believed they should carry out with respect to Aboriginal affairs. The Government has not been prepared to take on those States. I refer mainly to the States of Queensland and Western Australia. So I am not prepared to accept the Minister's assurance that the Government has the final power to say whether drilling shall take place on the Great Barrier Reef which could have the consequence of destroying the Barrier Reef. I am not prepared to accept the Minister's assurance that in this case the Government has that so-called reserve power to say whether mining or mineral development or drilling shall or shall not take place off the shores of the Great Barrier Reef. I will not accept that because the precedent has already been set. The Government was not prepared to accept the reserve power in relation to Aboriginal affairs given to it in the referendum which was carried in 1967.</PARA></TALK.START>

Nothing can happen until the joint authority, part of which is the Commonwealth Government, makes a positive decision that it shall happen. So any comparison with what may or may not have happened in relation to Aboriginal affairs is not pertinent. I make that absolutely and perfectly clear. The first thing that happens is that there is a designated authority. The designated authority has no authority until the joint authority has confirmed or rejected it. I will now proceed backwards. With regard to Senator Georges's questions, the fact is that there will be no ecological change in limestone or anything else because there will be no mining of any kind on the Great Barrier Reef or in the Great Barrier Reef region.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Under the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act the area of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park has been defined. If, indeed, part of what is considered to be the marine park should be within the 3-mile limit it will come under the management and authority of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and will not be under the influence of a State alone. So the Authority has that quite clear responsibility. The Commonwealth Government has made it abundantly clear that in no way at all will it alllow anything to happen which overrides its statement that nothing will be done to damage the Great Barrier Reef, whether on the reef or in any area adjacent to it. So the distances in themselves are irrelevant to that. That has been defined.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I come back to Senator Missen's remarks. I shall mention two matters. Firstly, a number of surveys are going on. After the Wallace Royal Commission, a short term survey and a long term survey were set up. Nobody quite knows what the length of the short and long term surveys will be. The Australian Institute of Marine Science, which is a highly respected body, is carrying out a continuous survey of the whole ecology of the reef. It is supported by scientists around Australia. The fact of the matter is that that is not just a survey of the reef but a survey of the currents, the tides and the whole of the movement of flora and fauna throughout the whole general area. One must understand that the knowledge of the movements of the tides, the very threats, would be constantly before them. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, the Bureau of Mineral Resources, Geology and Geophysics, in order to help in this matter, is arranging seismic surveys-not so much to find oil or to find anything but to get an understanding of the geological strata that underlie the reef. We might get schisms, dangers or threats. To understand the whole matter there will be a step by step seismic survey. I have no doubt that it will also give some clues as to gas or oil, which are important to us for the very important reason that in many places around the world there are natural escapes of gas and oil. Therefore, we must know of these kinds of situations. </PARA>
<PARA> The reef is a very difficult thing to describe because it is not one composite body of coral polyps at all. It is a series of different things-of reefs and cays. There is, firstly, a general area one would call the reef, which includes a bit of buffer water around it and into it, to form the marine park, comes 48 kilometres of buffer, so that there is the marine park itself-the reef, tidied up into an area with 48 kilometres of water around it. I want to impress upon Senator Missen that in many ways it is irrelevant whether it is 48, 96 or 150 kilometres because wherever a project for drilling was suggested there would be, firstly, an environmental impact study. We are not relieved of the need for an environmental study by added distance. I think that perhaps that assurance should be kept clearly in mind. </PARA>

The practicability of that is that that would suffer an intense survey. There would be no way in which a State could act unilaterally. It would have to come to the Commonwealth. It would have to be part of government. It would have to be part of the scrutiny of both the Executive and the Parliament. I put it to Senator Missen that the fundamental situation is to realise that distance in itself does not really solve the matter, although it does buy a bit of time, as I think Senator Puplick said to me privately. I acknowledge that. It buys a bit of time. That would be taken into account by all these marine studies. They would know what would happen in tides and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I repeat, in commending the Committee stage, that this Bill has the clear and emphatic understanding that this Government will do nothing-not just in a region but anywhere at all-which can be shown to be likely to cause any damage. So we are not talking about the region. We are talking about the whole of the ecological system, just as the Australian Institute of Marine Science is dealing on the reef with things that are starting to happen hundreds of miles away. So the whole of that ecological system is put under study. I put it to honourable senators that this Parliament and this Government would have the capacity to act pretty fast should there be an aberration on that. I commend the Bill to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The provisions of the Bill fall into two main parts and there are also some clauses which go to matters of a tidying up nature. The Bill seeks to amend the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904 to do the following: Firstly, provide a procedure whereby members of an organisation at a particular place of work may apply for, and the Commission order, a secret ballot in respect of industrial action in which they have been directed or requested to participate; secondly, provide for technical amendments to certain provisions of the Act to overcome some apparent shortcomings within the Act; and thirdly, provide for the appointment of members of the Commission to constitute the Industrial Appeals Tribunal of Christmas Island. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously, the introduction of the right to call for a secret ballot is the major source of this Bill. The proposal for secret ballots was presented to the Australian people in the policy speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in September last year. It was also foreshadowed by the then Minister for Industrial Relations in a ministerial statement on 18 September 1980. Following consultations with the major employer and union councils in the National Labour Consultative Council, the Government is now in a position to proceed with the proposal. The Government would have presented the secret ballot proposals in the summer session last year, but in deference to the NLCC's wishes, it deferred this action to allow more time for the NLCC to consider the secret ballot proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> The secret ballot provisions of the Bill represent a further development of a major theme of policy which the Government has sought to implement over the years. They are policies which encourage the democratic control of industrial organisations by their members and strengthen the rights of individual unionists against the central authority of officials. </PARA>
<PARA> These provisions of the Bill represent the Government's response to frequent requests from members of organisations-and from the public-to have access to the ballot box either before industrial action is taken or during the course of such action. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has carefully examined the various proposals which have been put to it and has concluded that what is in the Bill is a practical way of giving effect to the principle that opportunities should be available for people to express their own personal views on industrial activity. The logical and practical course to the Government appears to be to extend and modify the secret ballot provisions already contained in section 45 of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Many trade unions are administered in a manner consistent with democratic processes and they are run by conscientious, hard working officials. Some organisations become centralised in their decision making processes and they may fall out of touch with the aspirations and attitudes of their members. So there is a need for a safety valve-a mechanism by which the rank and file can express their attitudes upon a particular matter. Surely there can be no valid objection to this principle. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 45 allows the Commission to order a secret ballot of members where it thinks that the prevention or settlement of a dispute might be encouraged or assisted by finding out the views or attitudes of the members. The Bill will build on this. It will enable a prescribed minimum number of employees at a particular place of work who are members of an organisation which has called for the industrial action to apply to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission for a secret ballot so that the views of the members at the place of work on whether or not they approve or want to participate in the industrial action can be ascertained. Two hundred and fifty of the members concerned at a place of work or a number equal to 5 per cent of them, whichever is the lesser, but no fewer than four, may make the application. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission, constituted by a presidential member will be required to order the conduct of a ballot to indicate whether the members of the organisation concerned support particular industrial action involving them unless the Commission is satisfied that to do so would not encourage the cessation of industrial action. Alternatively, the Commission may order a wider ballot of all or some of the members generally under its existing powers in section 45 of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Unlike the existing secret ballot provisions, under which there is no review of the decision of the Commission, a refusal to order a place of work ballot must be reviewed automatically by the President of the Commission. Thus whilst there is a discretion given to the Commission it is designed so that the grant of a ballot will be the rule rather than the exception because it is primarily an aid to the exercise of the rights of individual members to express their views. In other words, it will be the primary duty of the Commission to order the ballot but a subsidiary discretion is given to the Commission in the context of its conciliation and arbitration power. Where a ballot is ordered, it will be a secret ballot officially conducted by the Industrial Registrar or the Australian Electoral Office. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission will be required to have regard to the outcome of the ballot in any conciliation and arbitration proceedings before it that relate to or are connected with a matter subject to the ballot. Furthermore, and more importantly for an individual member, if the vote is against the industrial action all the members at that place of work are relieved of any obligation under the rules of an organisation to obey a direction or request to engage in or support the industrial action concerned, notwithstanding any rule or practice of the organisation or branch concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an important new initiative in strengthening the individual rights of the membership of a union deciding as a collective group of employees at a particular place of work that they do not want to participate in industrial action directed or requested by the union's decision making body. What it means in practical terms is that a group of employees dissatisfied with a call for industrial action by union officials will have the right to dissent firmly placed in their own hands backed by the protection of the law. To take it one step further, the effect of this Bill, through the operation of proposed new section 45C, is that it would be unlawful for a union to impose or try to recover a fine under its rules against a member not participating in industrial action as a result of a ballot. </PARA>
<PARA> This is in addition to the existing provisions of section 188 which by sub-section (1) (d) and (e) allow an individual member not to join in industrial action by making it an offence for an organisation to impose, or threaten to impose, a penalty, forfeiture or disability of any kind upon a member of the organisation with the intent to coerce the member to join in industrial action. No ballot may be ordered where the industrial action is in contravention of a 'bans clause' inserted in an award pursuant to the Act. I might add that these provisions will be in addition to the existing right of an individual or organisation to seek the conduct of a secret ballot under the present section 45. </PARA>
<PARA> Persons who apply or propose to apply for a ballot, or have participated in a ballot or who act upon a ballot will have the protection available of sections 5 and 188 as amended by this Bill against victimisation, intimidation or coercion by the organisation of which they are a member or their employer. Honourable senators will recognise the several benefits of the proposed amendments: They give the employees at a particular place of work the right, under the protection of the law, to determine for themselves whether or not to participate in industrial action; the existence of the right to petition for a ballot will, when availed of, alert the Commission to the fact that support for the industrial action may not be unanimous; the Commission will be able to test the strength and depth of that feeling and take it into account in coming to a settlement of the dispute giving rise to the industrial action; the organisation itself will be made aware of the existence of any strong dissent from its call for industrial action and will consequently need to re-assess its objectives; the general public will be alerted to the true situation and may bring legitimate pressure to bear upon the organisation concerned to cease the industrial action. </PARA>
<PARA> I have described in broad outline the purposes and operation of the Bill and the importance of this new right to a secret ballot in the hands of the rank and file of an organisation. There are several matters of detail I would point out to the Senate: By new sub-section 45 (8) 'place of work' in relation to any group of employees of an employer is defined to include any place at which the employees included in that group are required to report, whether in person or by telephone or any other form of communication, for the purpose of being allocated work by the employer or for any other purpose connected with the carrying on of the business of the employer. Thus, the legislation operates for the benefit of employees at a readily identifiable location like a shop or factory, so that the employees there who do not want to take part in the industrial action directed or requested by the organisation to which they belong may petition for a ballot. It equally operates for the benefit of employees who do not stay in the one place in carrying out their work or do not work at a single identifiable location. Air hostesses, pilots, salesmen and saleswomen, timber workers and the like who are required to report to a place for or in connection with their work can likewise petition for a ballot as if the place at which they are required to report is their place of work. </PARA>
<PARA> New section 45 (3D) makes it clear that the applicants must all belong to the one organisation, and work for the same employer at the one place of work. This permits particular work groups to indicate their desire to opt out of industrial action. New sub-section 45 (3G) provides that only a presidential member will be able to consider an application for a ballot at a place of work. New sub-section 45 (3P) ensures that a ballot is confined to those members employed by the same employer at the one place of work who may petition for a ballot. New sub-section 45 (7) deems a direction or request to engage in industrial action that is made by a committee of management or by an officer or officers, or by a member or a group of members acting pursuant to the rules of the organisation or branch to be a direction or request of the organisation or branch concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> New sub-section 45 (8) is important because it extends the definition of 'industrial action' in sub-section 4 (1) of the Act, to the situation where industrial action occurs in connection with an industrial dispute before an award is made prescribing, wholly or partly, the terms and conditions of work affected by the industrial action. Industrial action, as here defined, also includes 'industrial action' as defined in sub-section 4 (1) and also means any action in connection with an industrial dispute that results in work being performed in a different manner than is customary, or in a restricted, limited or delayed way; and the performance, acceptance, or offering for work being banned, limited or restricted. </PARA>
<PARA> With respect to the amendment dealing with the Industrial Appeals Tribunal of Christmas Island, Clause 4 of the Bill inserts a new section 16A to provide the President with the power to designate members of the Commission to constitute the Industrial Appeals Tribunal of Christmas Island to hear and determine appeals from the Christmas Island Arbitrator. This proposed section will complement amendments to the Industrial Relations Ordinance 1976 of the Territory of Christmas Island which provide for the establishment, powers and functions of the Industrial Appeals Tribunal. Technical amendments are made by clause 5, clauses 10 to 15 inclusive and 17 of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The then Minister for Industrial Relations in his statement on 18 September 1980, referred to the Government's objective of encouraging the formation of industry based unions. The creation of industry based unions is an established policy of both Government parties and the ACTU. Work has been done, in consultation with the NLCC, on amendments to the amalgamation provisions of the Act on the basis of a criteria of the community-of-interest of unions desiring amalgamation. However, the Government parties wish to consider the full implications of such a criteria for amalgamation and its relevance to meeting the objective of encouraging the formation of industry based unions before proceeding further with any such amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government parties will be examining what other means might be available to achieving the formation of industry based unions and also, within that examination, the possibility and practicability of the formation of enterprise based unions as part of the concept of industry based unions. The Government will be doing this, Mr President, because of the belief that the general public wish to see a stronger movement towards industry based unions. The public see such industrial organisations as far preferable to the demarcation dispute-prone situations which so often wrack the great industries and the small businesses of this nation. Whilst the objectives are formidable ones, if something can be achieved in this direction, a significant service will have been done for the people of Australia. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition opposes the Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Bill 1981. I begin by quoting from what is not necessarily the most reliable source, the Australian newspaper, of 20 November 1980, which mentions this legislation. The article by Malcolm Colless had this to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Federal Government was told by its senior advisers several months ago that legislation for secret union ballots, which it deferred on Tuesday, would be unworkable. </PARA>
<PARA> But despite getting a number of submissions detailing the major legal and industrial problems involved, Cabinet and party hardliners insisted the legislation should be pursued. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, the proposed legislation became central to the government's industrial relations policy during the federal election campaign. </PARA>
<PARA>The article went on to record the speech by the penultimate Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Street, on 18 September 1980. The article in the Australian commented on the legislation and on the words used by Mr Peacock, the then Minister, who was opposed to the legislation. It had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> To make matters worse for the Government, not only does the legislation have no support from the unions but employers have also shown no interest because they believe it will open up a can of worms. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, they point out there is no guarantee that rank and file employees moving for a secret ballot on a strike will not be victimised. </PARA>
<PARA> And if there was a split vote, would those favoring a return to work do so, and what about those who opposed this?</PARA>
<PARA>It then goes on to say that the legislation is open to manipulation. I referred to that article because it could have been written about any piece of industrial relations legislation introduced by the Fraser Government since it has been in office. What the article in the Australian is really saying is that the employers are not keen on the legislation and the unions are not keen on it, but it is another stunt by the Fraser Government in pursuit of some mythical political advantage. That has been a typical example of the industrial relations policy of this Government ever since it has been in office. If there is one particular area that can be singled out and which has not been well served by thoughtful policies which recognised the realities of industrial relations, it is that area to which I have referred. </PARA>
<PARA> This legislation is in a very real sense an example of the way that this Government conducts itself. A certain degree of contempt for the Australian people was displayed before the last election and contempt for the trade union movement and the principle of consultation and co-operation with trade unions. Just as in the case of the new health arrangements, the razor gang report, or the Government's approach to the freedom of information legislation, there was a lot of ideological sound and fury associated with it. But the realities are something of a different order. In terms of facing up to some of the hard questions of industrial relations, the legislation signifies nothing. I make the point at the beginning that there is a conspicuous absence in this Bill and there is an absence of legislation, which the Bill was designed to facilitate, such as union amalgamation where there is a community of interests. That is, with respect, one of the major issues in Australian industrial relations which this Government, because of a variety of ideological hang-ups, has never been prepared to tackle and that is the achievement of a more rationally structured trade union movement and in particular the need for industry based unions, where that is possible. The case for industry based unionism is overwhelming if we are to improve industrial relations in Australia. If the Government spent less time talking about what it is pleased to call 'small government' and if it spent less time talking about the size of the bureaucracy and the innate goodness of private enterprise, it might look at some of the facts of the industrial relations system and the perceived causes of strikes, for which plenty of information is available from the Bureau of Statistics and elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> One fact that the Government might look at is that there are only three countries in the Western world which maintained full employment through the 1970s. They were Norway, Sweden and Austria. They all happen to be countries with democratic socialist governments. They are all countries with healthier public sectors than the Australian public sector and more interesting and more important to this legislation, they are countries that have much more effective consultation and co-operation between the government and the trade unions than has existed in Australia for a very long time. They are all countries with industry-based unionism. I am not so naive as to say that it would be an easy task to change the basis of Australian trade unionism to industry based unionism in the foreseeable future, but there is scope for consideration of union amalgmations on the basis of the community of interest concept. On 18 September last year, prior to the last election, the then Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Street, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> If re-elected the Government would move to facilitate the amalgamation of trade unions. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The new amalgamation provisions are yet another demonstration of how the Government is meeting its responsibility to provide an industrial relations framework which takes account of the views of the parties and meets their needs, while paying due regard to the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA>That was said on 18 September last year as part of the build-up to the election on 18 October. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in his policy speech for that election has this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government proposes to . . . legislate to facilitate the amalgamation of unions where there is a 'community of interest'. </PARA>
<PARA>I repeat that he said the Government proposes to legislate to facilitate the amalgamation of unions where there is a community of interests. We were not told a lot of things in the course of the last election campaign. We were not told about the changes which were to be made to the film legislation. We were not told about the changes which are proposed to the broadcasting legislation. We were not told of any of those things, yet the respective Ministers seem to have devoted most of the last three months to dealing with these pieces of legislation in respect of which-if I can use the old-fashioned term-the Fraser Government had no mandate whatsoever. But it did have a mandate in relation to union amalgamations. It suited the Government, in the policy speech and in the context of the speech of the Minister for Industrial Relations on 18 September last year, to talk about the significance of union amalgamations because if it looks at the figures on the causes of industrial disturbances, for example, it will see that something in the order of 15 per cent of all identified industrial stoppages are attributed to demarcation disputes between unions. So in that context the Government was able to talk at the election about the importance of facilitating amalgamations where there is a community of interests. Now we are told by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner)-the third Minister in a year in this important and difficult area and the Minister least inclined to consult or co-operate with trade unions-that the Government parties wish to consider the full implications of the proposed legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is what the Minister says. I hope the honourable senator is calling him a liar, not me. That is what he said. I sat here in 1975 and saw legislation providing for union amalgamations brought into this chamber three times. It was tossed out by honourable senators then sitting on this side of the House. We were told, in the context of the 1975 election, that the then Opposition was going to do something new and different about union amalgamations. It was going to do something on the basis of industry based unions. Mr Street was the then Minister and he gave a number of undertakings about that. This issue goes back to 1975, when there was a quite mindless rejection of union amalgamation legislation by the then Opposition. Here we are now, in 1981, having received a promise before the last election, in contradistinction to a whole set of other areas of government activity, that legislation relating to union amalgamation would be introduced and that it was a priority of the Government. The Minister now says that the Government parties want to consider the full implications of the legislation. Six years later, this Government is now thinking about the implications of the legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I understand that the legislation has already been prepared. It was said to be legislation seeking to give effect to a report of the National Labour Consultative Council. The National Labour Consultative Council is a creature of the Fraser Government. That Government created it. Over a year ago, the then Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Street, said of the National Labour Consultative Council and its work on union amalgamation:</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course it was. I could not agree with it more. Governments, employers and unions can work together to produce tangible results. This is the sort of thing that we were promised by the then Leader of the Opposition in 1975 when he talked about industrial relations problems being solved by an attitude of mind, a willingness to work together. We have not seen much evidence of it in the last six years, except, perhaps, in that promise given before the last election. I say of Fraser Government legislation: 'Now you see it, now you don't'. We have had promises of union amalgamation legislation, with the Minister making a virtue of co-operation between unions, employers and government in relation to union amalgamations but the Government has done nothing about those promises. We are told that the Government parties wish to consider the full implications of the legislation, six years after they ought to have been considered. If they now want to consider the implications of union amalgamation legislation, what were they doing in 1975? Were they voting mindlessly against Labor Government legislation without considering the implications of the legislation? That is the implication of what is now being said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Out of three years of hard work, the National Labour Consultative Council produced proposals agreed upon unanimously by all the participants-unions, employers and government representatives. That was the result of three years of hard work-not spectacular work, stunting work or work designed to influence the public in relation to the spooky sort of view on industrial relations which this Government propounds. It was the hard work of the three principal participants in industrial relations. That was before the election. 'Now you see it, now you don't', is all that can be said of Fraser Government legislation. We do not see anything now, except the Government's wish to examine the matter further. The one piece of constructive industrial relations legislation arrived at by agreement between the parties since this Government came to power, the one industrial relations measure which would have had the support of both employers and unions, has been shelved. The cost of that action to trade unions and to employers in terms of problems of demarcation and so on is very significant. For example, do not the unions covering the clothing trade, the boot trade, and the textile workers, in any terms in which this Government faces up to manufacturing industry in Australia, have a community of interest? What community of interest is being considered by the Government in delaying this legislation?</PARA>
<PARA> Instead of dealing with the question of amalgamation, this Bill contains provisions for secret ballots concerning strikes. The idea of secret ballots always sounds very good. The secret ballot, the stump jump plough and-I forget the third contribution but it was probably Gough Whitlam-are said to be the three major contributions of Australian civilisation to the Western world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I have said, the idea of secret ballot legislation sounds very good. It is a popular theme in any discussion of what constitutes a democracy. However, in this area the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commision already has power to order a secret ballot to be taken when it believes that it could help prevent or settle an industrial dispute, which is the function of the Commision. When we realise that fact, the legislation begins to look a little like a stunt, a stunt which is premised on a principle which is at variance with the facts. This Government is completely captive to the view that the big bad shop stewards lead all strikes and that workers go out on strike reluctantly. It is not a view which is supported by any evidence here, in Great Britain, where some work has been done on this matter, or in the United States of America. Indeed, if we look at the terms of the legislation to which I wish to refer in a minute we see that the way in which it is structured is quite absurd. If one goes closer to the scene and looks at the idea more dispassionately, it again becomes less impressive. Sir John Moore, the President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, is on record as saying:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I accept the view of Sir John Moore, the President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, and I accept the addendum added by my colleague Senator Mulvihill to that view. The fact is that the Arbitration Commission has failed to order ballots in most disputes-perhaps 99 per cent of them-which have come before it. Why is that so? It is because those who are near to industrial relations as an art form-if that can possibly be said about industrial relations-unlike this Government, know that strike ballots are not the panacea which this Government presumes them to be. For example, the report of the United Kingdom Royal Commission on Trade Unions and Employer Associations, the Donovan commission, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is little justification in the available evidence for the view that workers are less likely to vote for strike action than their leaders; and findings from our workshop relations survey, already cited, confirmed this. Experience in the USA has been that strike ballots are overwhelmingly likely to go in favour of strike action. This is also the experience of Canada, where strike ballots are compulsory in the provinces of Alberta and British Columbia. </PARA>
<PARA>Let us look briefly at the facts in relation to the Australian situation, in particular one situation of current origin. On 27 May of this year members of the Australian Telecommunications Employees Association took a secret ballot on strike action. The cause of the dispute was not the manipulative, bellicose shop stewards we hear about from this Government. It was the intractability of the Government which has prevented management of Telecom Australia from negotiating with its employees-that is a matter of public record-many of whom are skilled tradesmen earning about $25 a week less than skilled tradesmen employed by the instrumentalities of the various State governments in Australia. Despite the fact that for over a year Telecom management has sought to negotiate with its employees, the union took a secret ballot. In New South Wales, 98 per cent of the members of the ATEA voted for strike action. In Australia overall, 96 per cent of the members of that very important union who are employed by Telecom voted for strike action. They voted for strike action because they had a documented grievance in relation to salaried relativities for skilled personnel. In spite of that, the Government went ahead with its amateurish stunts in relation to these matters. Admittedly the Bill is an improvement on some previous legislation and documents such as the razor gang's report in that nothing has been inked out on the last day. But it is full of practical problems and evidence of hasty approaches dictated by ideological prejudice rather than informed opinions. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me say, firstly, that the machinery for implementing the ballots is far too time consuming to be of any effect in a great many disputes. Honourable senators only have to look briefly at the Bill to see that. It is a time consuming and cumbersome procedure. A petition by a number of employees-250 members or 5 per cent of the union, whichever is the lesser-must be presented. There must be a hearing before presidential members of the Commission. If the Commission does not order a ballot, the President may, and arrangements to hold the ballot must then be made by the Australian Electoral Office or the Office of the Industrial Registrar. The ballot must be held and the results must be forwarded. At that stage a result about the intentions of the membership of that union in a particular place or at large must be achieved. In my view these provisions are logistically incapable of applying to a great many, probably most, strikes. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the attention of honourable senators to one provision in this Bill which illustrates its absurdity. It says that after a ballot has been held the Commission must take account of the ballot result. All sorts of things can be done if employees vote against strike action. What happens where, as in the case of the Telecom union, 98 per cent of union members vote in favour of strike action? What does the Commission do when it takes account of the views of the membership of the union? How can the trade union officials, who represent those people, seriously negotiate a settlement of a strike when the Commission is under instruction to take account of the views of the members, 98 per cent of whom, in the example which I have cited, have voted in favour of industrial action? What will the poor old Arbitration Commission do then? I think it will run back to this Government for a bit of patch-up legislation because it will have no idea what to do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course they may have reached a settlement. All sorts of things could happen. There are procedures up to the time of the ballot result, for unlocking the parties and for unlocking the intentions if a settlement is reached but, after that, we are jammed. If honourable senators look at the definition of industrial action in this Bill, they will see that it is absolutely absurd. For example, it states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> 'Industrial action' means-(a) any action in connection with an industrial dispute, being-(i) the performance of work in a manner different from that in which it is customarily performed, or the adoption of a . . . restriction or limitation . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Industrial action means the performance of work in any manner different from the way in which it is customarily performed. I do not know how naive honourable senators on the Government side are, but if they seriously think that they can get a go-slow or a work-to-regulation in a plant as a result of an order from some mythical demonic union offiical into operation, I say to them that they are very naive, if not bonkers-for want of a better word. There is no way that a go-slow campaign can be effected in an industrial situation by order of a union official. It just cannot be done. We must have the co-operation of the employees concerned if there is to be an effective interruption of work as a result of working to regulations, a go-slow campaign, or whatever. The definition of 'industrial action' in the context of this Bill is quite absurd. So we get another farcical situation which is illustrated by a quick reference to the provisions of this Bill. The provisions of the Bill are logistically incapable of working. They will cause, as most Fraser industrial legislation has, more trouble than they are worth. They are based on an ideological commitment which displays an appalling ignorance of industrial relations. They are not based on the views of those people who are involved in industrial relations. Of course they show a complete naivety about the causes of strikes. Many minor strikes involve matters which are extremely volatile, quick to start and quick to finish, but which are not susceptible to the provisions of this sort of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Also there are all sorts of loose ends in the legislation. There is no provision for the sort of vexatious litigant type of people, employed in a small plant, who go to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission every fortnight to complain about some threatened industrial action. There are things in the legislation which could be a real problem, given the tactics of some extreme activist groups which operate within the union movement at present, indeed as always. Those problems are present in the legislation. There is absolutely no provision for dealing with the possibility of dramatically increasing the work load of the Arbitration Commission and the Electoral Office to absolutely no effect. The legislation ignores the very real possibility that it might more successfully promote the interests of pro-strike militants than help more conciliatory groups. It would do this by providing the opportunity for such people within a union to pre-empt and prejudice negotiations by securing a pro-strike ballot. If members of a union are locked into a pro-strike ballot there is less room, less manoeuvrability for conciliation and negotiation-the objects of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. This would be all right if the Government were acting in blissful and stupid ignorance on its own, but it is not entirely doing that because it has had the advice of its advisers that these things are the achilles heel of this centipede of legislation. In fact it has 100 achilles heels. The Government has acted against that advice because it has other things in mind than the good government of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> A strike ballot having been held and the union members having voted in favour of strike action. Firstly, how do we develop the process of conciliation? Secondly, how do we unlock the strike once this monster has been launched on society not as a result of some hydra-headed union official but as a result of the decision of members of a union employed by a particular organisation? I would like to hear from the Minister or the Government spokesman how we unlock the problem when it has got to that situation. This Bill is one of a growing list of measures taken by this Government which are cheap ideological stunts, based on prejudices at the expense of a rational and thoughtful approach to questions of good government in this country. For that reason the Opposition opposes the Bill very strongly as we have done on other occasions in this place with respect to legislation which we have said at the time will not work and which demonstrably has not worked. </PARA>
<PARA> Ever since this Government has been in office there have been pre-election stunts about industrial relations, what an important issue it is in Australia and how the Government will fix it up. Honourable senators can cite the record anywhere they want regarding what has happened to industrial relations in this country. I will be delighted to hear if it proves the point in any way of all that rhetoric that we have had over many years about this Government's industrial relations policy. We strongly condemn the Bill not only for its stupidity and naivety but also for its intrinsic wrongness in the sense that the Government ought to know better because it has had better advice than it has displayed in this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support this Bill to amend the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. (Quorum formed). This Act has been amended some 70 times since its enactment in 1904. That may sound extraordinary but, on the contrary, it is perfectly reasonable because we are a fluid society, we are a community in which changing circumstances and changing interests are constantly the way of life. The fact that an Act as important as one which endeavours to control and to set up the machinery for industrial relations should be amended on a great number of occasions is an indication of the responsible concern of the community in just that area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Button, who has just finished speaking on this Bill, claimed that it was little more than an ideological stunt. I do not believe that that sort of definition can stick in any way at all. It is quite the opposite of an ideological stunt; it is a genuine attempt by a government to implement a capacity for trade unionists, for workers in a place of work, to seek in privacy, through a postal vote, through a secret ballot, the consideration of their members referable to a certain line of industrial action on which they have been launched by the leadership of their union. Surely that is well short of an industrial stunt. I believe that the people of Australia would agree that that sort of provision-the capacity to seek as individuals and as groups of individuals, by secret ballot, the views of the membership on a proposed, often an instructed, industrial disruption-should be available to those members. That certainly is the objective of this amending legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not a debate about trade unions or trade unionism. I believe there is no doubt that the position of trade unions and trade unionists in this country is recognised as basic to the development of the whole Australian circumstance. Rather, this is a debate about the sorts of individual freedoms that should be freely available to the membership of Australian trade unions. That, I believe, is the object of this legislation-to provide a real measure of freedom in coming to a decision on certain proposed industrial stands by way of secret ballot, by way of a private opportunity to express one's opinion. </PARA>
<PARA> The importance of industrial relations in this country does not need to be stressed. Indeed, it cannot be overstressed. I assume that every Australian recognises that the successful solution of the industrial relations problem is probably the most important single contribution that a government and the people whom that government represents could possibly achieve. The successful solution of industrial relations must surely be the objective of every genuine Australian. There was a time then I believed, looking at the bases and the derivatives of the institutions in this country, that maybe the Australian Labor Party could produce just that-an industrial relations situation in which we as a vast country, a vast community, could achieve our massive and exciting potential. Regrettably, that was not the case because the Australian Labor Party, when in government, failed very significantly to solve the industrial relations problems. We inherited a situation that was in real measure worse than the situation that exists today. It is the earnest endeavour of this Government to overcome those problems in the industrial relations area. This piece of legislation is one attempt to create an avenue, a machinery, for freedom of expression which may well contribute to the solution of the problems. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not naive enough and the Government is not naive enough to assume that any form of legislation, of itself, can necessarily solve any specific problem. The point I make is that unless we as a government, as a Parliament and as Australian people have the determination to make legislation before us work then, of course, that legislation will not contribute to the real solution of the problems that confront us. I would have hoped that the Parliament would have looked at this legislation and at what it attempts to do and admitted that it is not, as Senator Button quite rightly said, the panacea to all the problems and worries of industrial relations in Australia. Of course it is not. But it is a real attempt, a conscientious attempt, to provide machinery that may well improve those relations. </PARA>
<PARA> We should not imagine that this Government or any other government will produce some sort of infallible machinery of options and deterrents that will solve all the problems related to the industrial relations area. But we would be less than honest and less than determined if we failed to try and, indeed, failed to solve those problems, for the public itself, besides governments and besides parliaments, is earnestly concerned that we, as a people and as a government, come to grips with the problems that relate to industrial relations. To preserve the rights of the individual, to preserve and safeguard the public interest and to promote industrial peace must be the basic objective of a government in this country. The objective of this legislation is neither more nor less than a genuine attempt to preserve those very things and to establish in this country a real measure of industrial peace. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very easy to stand by and make some cynical reflection on what this legislation fails to do, but let us try to be constructive. Indeed it is a cynical reflection that not only is it the province of the political oppositions in this country and in this Parliament but also in some measure regrettably it seems to be the attitude of the media that, in the first place, these sorts of things have to be regarded as incapable of providing any form of solution. If society is to be convinced of this by headlines, speeches and oratory there will be no solution. It is in our own hands. My appeal would be to examine the legislation and to admit that it has within it a real measure of responsibility and that it is an attempt to give to the trade union movement another access to a capacity to seek a secret ballot and to make a decision in privacy relative to industrial action that very often is thrust upon members without the sort of total consideration that should realistically be necessary. </PARA>

We must relate the prosperity of all Australians to the importance of compromise, discussion and industrial peace as a result of those two elements. Once again we have to create in this country a pride and a determination in our capacity to supply the goods. Today around the world there is in some measure a view of Australia as an unreliable supplier. That may well reflect on management and on unionists alike, but it is a circumstance of which we must be totally aware. We must rub it out of the context of Australia as a great international trader. It can only mitigate against everyone's interest in the long term. Consequently, all Australians have a very real involvement in the solutions to the problems about which we are talking tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I shall return very briefly to the Bill which seeks, as I have indicated, to create secret ballots on industrial action by certain groups of people-rank and file members of unions-in certain employment at certain work places. Of course, the Bill defines a work place and types of employment, and so it should. It has been criticised already in regard to the definition of these two elements. Whatever piece of legislation one provides there will be criticism of the definition. It is one of the most difficult areas. Indeed if definition was not so difficult there probably would be no lawyers in this chamber, and there certainly would be few, if any, in the rest of the community. I suppose it can be said that the fact that definition is attempted is courageous. The fact that it is there will create a continuing problem which we will never be without in whatever part of our economy we determine our emphasis. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill before us involves a closer concern and involvement of the trade union movement in solving the problems. It seeks to avoid any form of coercion and intimidation in the determinations of people. Indeed it is a sad commentary on a free society that we should need to legislate in a manner that will make the avoidance of coercion very much simpler. It seems to me, as I said, a sad commentary that that sort of legislation is necessary, but so be it. It should encourage more people to be involved in the determinations of the problems that surround not only their employment but also the economic and social development of this great country. Since 1928 the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission has had the power to order a secret ballot but it has done so on very few occasions-five or six, I think. This is a step forward because it moves away from the Commission the sole power to order a secret ballot insofar as it gives to the membership of unions, in appropriate numbers-250 or 5 per cent as long as the number is greater than four--</PARA>

I think that is unnecessary. I have chosen to make the point of the extreme importance of the industrial relations field. I have chosen to indicate that what is happening is not extraordinary; on the contrary, these pieces of legislation should be amended on numerous occasions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Rather than go into the detail of the administrative technicalities of the Bill, let me conclude my remarks with one or two references to the matters that were brought forward by Senator Button when he opened for the Opposition in this debate. He devoted very little time to the question of whether a secret ballot was a reasonable, proper and effective instrument for the membership. He seemed to concern himself with the absence in the legislation of propositions for amalgamation of trade unions. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, we are concerned that amalgamation provisions should be legislated for. It is an area of immense width which needs the ultimate of consideration. If by amalgamation we merely make it easier for one trade union to take over another and if we merely make it easier mechanically for trade unions to become monolithic giants in our society, we may not be serving thoroughly the interests of a whole range of trade unions which historically have grown from the craft unions and which historically are dependent for their pride and effectiveness on their size which may not be great. Consequently, I believe that before amalgamation decisions are made and provisions are brought into this chamber, we have to examine in great depth and at great width all those matters which contribute to the ultimate amalgamation of trade unions. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button mentioned the value of industry unions. Of course, the Government is involved in an examination of this area to the nth degree. </PARA>

Senator Button said that community of interest relates obviously to the textile and clothing trade. I assume that those trades would equally be concerned with transport, fuel, energy, retail aspects and advertising. Where is the community of interest? These are the problems that a responsible government has to examine in co-operation, I hope, with the trade union movement. It is our intention so to do. I have outlined the provisions of this legislation. I believe it is a constructive contribution to the capacity of Australian workers to seek a private view amongst themselves of an action that may be imposed upon them.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I supplement the views that have been expressed by my leader, Senator Button, I want to make two comments on the speech by Senator Scott. The first one, and it does not relate to him personally, involves a case of me-too-ism. We often ask: What is a justifiable strike? Senator Scott spoke about the detrimental effects of strikes on our exports. I suppose the classic illustration is the coal miners in Collinsville who were aided and abetted by the local National Party member, Pinky Lester. I think Senator Bjelke-Petersen, the new senator from Queensland, will say 'amen' to the point I am making. Her husband, the Premier of Queensland, said: 'Yes boys, Howard is wrong. You are entitled to some rebate on your rent in an isolated area'. This led to a classic major dispute. I can assure honourable senators that, as a reader of Common Cause which I receive every month, I know that all criticism in that case was aimed at the Federal Government and John Howard. There was not one bit of criticism of the Queensland National Party Premier or Pinky Lester.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it can be said that the whole of the mining communities and the attendant unions-I refer to the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union and the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen's Association-never had any need for such legislation. Nobody would deny that. The unions were unanimous. They were the victims of a tax injustice. I make the point that in situations where there is conflict between a group of people and a federal law such things will happen again. Even if we had used secret ballot provisions, the miners of Collinsville and attendant areas would have voted again and again as they did. The Queensland Premier was all for them. I understand that Senator Collard differed in his opinion. The fact is that, when a Premier-a non-socialist Premier at that-says that miners have a grievance with Canberra, different ingredients come to light. It is not a simple matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point I make relates to the latter part of Senator Scott's speech in which he replied to Senator Button. He mentioned monolithic organisations. The fact is that there is an insecurity in the mind of the average trade unionist today. If he is in his twenties and has an expected working life to 60 years of age-we hope one day it will be reduced to 55 years-he expects to have to change his occupation a couple of times. Therefore, if he is in an industry which is in the front ranks of change, he has to be pretty vigilant. I say that as a preface to the need in the containerisation industry for greater amalgamation of unions. At the moment there is an internal dispute within the Federated Clerks Union. At the risk of having people criticise me, I point out that I really believe that a tally clerk would be better off in the Waterside Workers Federation or the Federated Storemen and Packers Union than in a union covering other clerical people but away from the hurly burly of the waterfront industry. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment it is a titanic task to get a successful ballot because of the fact that two unions will be participants. Let me put a hypothetical case and assume that the residue of the Federated Clerks Union in New South Wales were to have a ballot with the Transport Workers Union, the Storemen and Packers Union or the Waterside Workers Federation and that consensus of 50 per cent of all the parties had to be obtained. New members would not matter much to the Waterside Workers Federation, the Storemen and Packers Union or the Transport Workers Union which have big memberships. The new members would not disturb policy. But we will never have a successful ballot with the provisions contained in the Bill. In turn, some of the turmoil in the containerisation industry is caused by people feeling that their job opportunities are in jeopardy because of the coverage of a rival union. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me take this fear complex a bit further. It is expected that the membership of the Australian Railways Union which is 20,000 at present will be down to 13,000 within the next eight to 12 years. It will not be that everybody will be out of work, but there will not be the same rate of promotion and opportunities for signalmen. Obviously there will be arguments about various allowances to protect them. As Senator Button said the average rank and file member today is far better educated than was the case 10, 15 or 20 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> We find that the inevitable pattern of agitation comes from site committees or area committees. It does not matter whether it comes from McBeatty of the Transport Workers Union or Carmichael of the AMWSU. I assure honourable senators that the drive and thrust comes from the bottom and it comes largely on an issue of relativity. I suppose we could say that one of the negative aspects of television is that we see all the posh advertisements showing that Jack is as good as his master and that everybody has to get things quickly. That acts as an inspiration, to use the capitalist term, to market forces. People want that relativity. That is what this is all about. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the usual pattern? I take the example of a dispute with the Public Transport Commission in New South Wales. The workers could be asking for an industrial allowance of $25. The PTC could come up with an offer of about $8 and say that the demand for more is not on. In such a situation we may have a series of walkouts. The dispute could go on for seven, eight or 10 days. That is usually as long as it goes. I can refer to other disputes that have never left us but did go for longer periods. But what is the pattern? The union asks for more. Premiers and Prime Ministers get into the act. The workers will probably not get their $25. But after seven or eight days they find ways and means of dressing it up again and might get $12. Then they go back and might get another $3, or penalty rates are adjusted. People may say: 'It disrupts the economy of the country.' Maybe under fascism everybody can be put into a slot and kept there but that cannot be done in a free society. Therefore, we must live with this situation of wage relativity. </PARA>
<PARA> No doubt some honourable senator will quote the situation in western Europe generally. In return I would quote the situation in the Scandinavian countries, or in West Germany. One of the in-built stabilisers in those countries is that the State keeps a pretty close rein on hospital and medical charges generally. I have never claimed that there is such a thing as a free lunch but those societies are more equitable than ours. Whatever wages are paid, if a process worker has to pay as much for his health coverage as does a production manager you will get dissatisfaction. The Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Carrick) may not know it-he may not have been involved at the time-but as long ago as 1967 the present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) asked the Australian Council of Trade Unions how it would react in regard to future wage claims if he more or less stabilised Medibank somewhat in line with the Labor Government of 1972-75 idea of a flat rate levy. Under such a scheme you would know during the year, if you had received a good deal of overtime, that you would face a higher levy for health coverage than you would in a lean year. These are all components of the wage system. The Government has ignored that factor for six years, but it is a feature of the Scandinavian and West German trade union wage structure. If we leave Europe and go to the United States of America, the home of private enterprise, with its collective bargaining, the workers may not be as well off as ours would be in regard to holidays but we would find that many private pension schemes are better than the state would provide. </PARA>
<PARA> We could argue all night, and balance one factor against the other, but what are the ingredients of a dispute? Most major disputes in New South Wales result from the prodding by the rank and file of the union's officers. Under this legislation, in a dispute, the commissioner is to take note of the result of the ballot. Let us imagine that negotiations are at a stage at which the employer has offered $8 and the unions are seeking a site allowance of $25 or $30. If one votes 'no strike' one is pretty certain that one will not get much more than $8 or $9. Most Australians are inclined to indulge in a little gambling. There is no doubt that if they vote yes, for a stoppage, in the classic illustration given by Senator Button, they will then get $12 or $14. There is no way that they will not. People would be stupid to take any other attitude. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, if one has a bald recommendation and a vote taken on the basis: Are you prepared to strike for a $30 site allowance? And a yes vote results, and somewhere down the line, the employers offer $12 or $15, the union, as Senator Button knows, is locked in. It has to go back to the rank and file for instructions. Let us take another case-a dispute on a construction site. There have been disputes in which a motion has been put, then three amendments, and ultimately one of those amendments has been carried. Honourable senators have spoken of people being denied their rights. Let me quote an illustration from a union that is in the middle range of unions. I refer to the Federated Rubber and Allied Workers Union of Australia. The employers offered the union a mixed bag, involving extra leave and extra pay and, on the other hand, what one would sacrifice. The dispute involved three shifts of about 600 men each, in metropolitan Sydney. Interpreters were provided and the proposals were put. I respectfully suggest that there is no way in which a ballot-it is not a simple yes or no matter-could produce a proper consensus, compared with going to and fro by way of motion and amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 1950s, we used to be told that there were cases of intimidation. There may have been, but a dispute is not a tea party. At a trade union meeting, although someone may be a bully boy, there are always others with the courage to get up and express a contrary point of view. I have said time and time again that, when we speak of achieving a consensus, the classic illustration was provided by the history in Sydney of the introduction of the one-man bus. In that case the men were arguing from the standpoint of safety. They wanted the tickets collected so they would not have to worry about timetables and do that too. Also, if the bus went, say, two miles out of Sydney as an express service there would not be the same setting down and having to watch people leaving by means of bus mirrors which were not always the best. That dispute was on a stop and go basis for weeks. Finally, in spite of the conciliation commissioners offering extra money, the dispute continued. Suddenly Mr Justice Robinson, a very fine judge of the Arbitration Commission, realised that the important matter involved was safety. When he presented a proposal with that in mind, the men accepted it. It is history now that, because of safety and other reasons, the use of one-man buses has been expanded. My point, which has been supported by Senator Button, and by Senator Chipp by way of interjection, is that it is more a case of speaking in sorrow than in anger because the practicalities are simply not there. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us take the matter a little further. The bane of most trade unions is keeping their records up to date for the 3 year elections. I may have something to say at the Committee stage of this Bill on the matter. I have never opposed postal ballots for union elections or their being under the control of an electoral officer, but I know that keeping the address list up-to-date is the bane of the unions. We have a mobile society. Many people move every year or so to a new suburb. They do not always tell the union. If there is one thing that can create a problem, it is that. There might be a situation in which a secret ballot is conducted. It may be a tight vote, in which a tiny majority will say: 'No, we do not want to be involved in this dispute.' Then people will run to the Press and say: 'We did not get a ballot paper; it went to the last address.' The whole thing will then be called a stew and people will feel that they have been cheated or conned. That already happens. I know of trade union ballots-and this does not represent a reprimand for the Commonwealth Electoral Officer-in which ballot papers are not sent. The union member says: 'I told the union of my new address' and so on. These are some of the problems involved. In this Bill the Government is backing a loser. There is no way to get over that situation. </PARA>
<PARA> We hear much talk of irresponsible militants. I doubt whether any honourable senator would describe the Air Pilots Guild as comprised of left wing militants. I do not suppose that that could be said of even the air traffic controllers, many of whom live in Sydney. Certainly, those who live in the electorate of Bradfield have not a left wing member in David Connolly representing them-far from it. Let us get away from the use of labels and the talk of irresponsibility. There is a fear, an uncertainty, among any group, whether they be shearers, waterside workers or railwaymen. In trying to have a perfect private enterprise system-in the Government's eyes-and saying: 'The State keeps out of it', you may be locked in. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already mentioned the situation in western Europe and the effectiveness of the State's playing a bigger role in achieving stability and holding down the costs of health coverage. In a number of those countries the state may also pay heavy subsidies on basic commodities. All of this would cost the Treasury of the country money. The Prime Minister and the present Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Viner) could call on the trade unions and say: 'We want a bit of sanity. We do not want excessive wage demands.' But, on the other hand they must say: 'In lieu of your going for an increase we will stabilise the cost of meat and potatoes', or conversely: 'I am making a very big effort to maintain health coverage on a more equitable basis, a levy upon taxable income.' Those factors are absent and that is rather significant. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice that Senator Scott in a vague way mentioned that the Government was still considering trade union amalgamation. In many cases a fear concerning the future of those in long term occupations arises and conflicts result. In many cases the employer is powerless to act. These are matters that should have been dealt with, but they have not been. A host of the top line Chamber of Manufactures people-those who are involved in heavy industry-know that what the Government is doing will not resolve the situation one bit. The United States coal miners have had a 13-week stoppage and look like reaching some decision today. So lengthy strikes are not a phenomenon restricted to Australia. I mentioned West Germany. Workers in that country are having their problems now because obviously inflation has eroded their wages. They are in a difficult situation and some of their unions are no longer taking a passive approach. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to this idea of directions with regard to stoppages coming from the top of a union. Invariably they come from the bottom because of a new style of rank and file member. But there are two other points in this situation. Safety provision is one difficulty which today looms largely in many industries. Frankly, sometimes it is only when a certain piece of equipment is suddenly declared unsafe that people stop work and inspectors go in. Recently we were discussing the Industrial Relations Bureau and there were a lot of platitudes about its work. But when we look at its performance in the field, we see that no figures can be given about how quickly and regularly it carries out inspections. I feel that had the Government wanted a package deal, although we found the ballot system unworkable, and had it put out an olive branch and accelerated some union amalgamations, there is no doubt that that would have been taken as evidence of good faith. I do not doubt that if the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), with his charisma and reasonableness, still held the portfolio of industrial relations he would not have been a party to this legislation. After all, the Government has nothing to lose by it. If the Government gave us our head in relation to trade union amalgamations and found that there was still a high degree of unruliness, it could say that the unions had let it down. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has talked about technological changes and we have a mass of material on the research it has done. Despite that, the current dispute with the communications unions and the situation concerning Justice Mary Gaudron show that it is quite obvious that we cannot have one simple format to meet all these situations. People in industry feel that if they get behind it is very hard to get parity again. When we get amalgamations of unions it is surprising what can be done. Senator McIntosh could tell the Senate of the situation of the shipwrights union-a small craft union and very jealous of it. In the shipbuilding industry, with flexibility from such unions as the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union, there was no Custer's last stand about people protecting their jobs. Again that was done on a craft basis. Unquestionably in the container industry, which is run on a non-craft basis, at some stage there will have to be an absorption of tally clerks into the Waterside Workers Federation or the Federated Storemen and Packers Union. That cannot be done at the moment because of the lack of leadership on merger proposals. That is an area in which the number of strikes can be reduced dramatically. As I said, I will have plenty more to say on one or two other aspects of this legislation in the Committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This will be a very short burst. Senator Carrick is not in the chamber, but I think it is time the Government put its flag to the mast, as it were, and indicated to us its attitude with regard to the format of committee operations in the next session. I will illustrate the situation in this way: In the weekend Press there were indications that among the Vietnamese community a sort of Tong war appeared to be going on with people chopping off other people's fingers. This shows the mess we have got in. The logical thing would be for Estimates Committee D, a very talented committee which looks after immigration, to meet and to call before it immigration officials and people from the Vietnamese community to probe whether those reports are wrong or grossly exaggerated. That is an illustration of how Estimates committees could be ongoing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Kathy Martin and Senator Kilgariff have expressed the view, which I and others on this side share, that Estimates committees should do much more than consider Supplementary Estimates and then meet again in September, because things happen between those meetings. If we had ongoing Senate committees we would be able to get to the heart of matters and get quick answers, whether they be with respect to finance, which Senator Martin has been going on about, or with respect to administration, in my case. I just picked the allegations with respect to the Vietnamese community as a classic point. If Laurie Oakes can hint that something has been decided, I think honourable senators here should get from the Government some indication of what is going to happen. </PARA>
<PARA> In the next session there will be new honourable senators on both sides of the chamber. What functions will they have on these committees? I expect Senator Chaney and Senator Durack, who are at the table, to say not later than Friday that next session Estimates committees will be ongoing and will meet situations such as I have instanced. Conversely, they may feel that the various ministries should be apportioned to standing committees. I know that honourable senators opposite are asking for answers, and we should have them. </PARA>
<PARA> Every time the United States has serious problems it sets up committees. It did so when there was an exodus from Cuba after Castro had switched on a few doubtful people who were supposed to be running away from communism but some of whom were perverts and gangsters. The United States was stuck with them. I do not apply that situation to our immigration program, but I think we have a responsibility to have a committee, whether it be Estimates Committee D or some other committee, which meets all year round to consider such matters and to oversee what is happening. It may well be that immigration officers will have some interesting explanations to give. </PARA>
<PARA> Anybody who perused the transcript of proceedings of Estimates Committee D a month or so ago would have seen that the Committee heard a long story about what Fairfield had done to placate people. That may be all right, but the Queensland branch of the Waterside Workers Federation would give a different story about how one or two of the Vietnamese here are still fighting the war over there. If they had shown as much militancy in fighting there as they are showing here, they might have got a different result. My view is that some of them represent a merchant class that lived off black markets and prostitution, and now they have come here. I would like to have some of their leaders before a Senate committee to get the answers which people do not get when they are interviewed. </PARA>
<PARA> I make no bones about what I am after. We should have these ongoing committees. We should be able to probe such situations to find out what the truth is because, whatever views I might have, when something is written in a newspaper it is not probed. The United States Senate and House of Representatives have committees which move in quickly and to which people can put their points of view. If some people in the Vietnamese community thought I had been a bit harsh, they would have an opportunity to come before a committee and explain to me how I had been conned by a newspaper report. So I am being very charitable. </PARA>
<PARA> I speak for every honourable senator on this side. We are entitled to know, before the session ends, what the Government's plans are for Senate Estimates committees. The various newspapers are hinting that something has been decided. As a matter of fact, there is a rumour about Senator Rae. I have a lot of respect for Senator Rae as a parliamentarian. I understand-I am indebted to Michelle Grattan of the Age for this rumour-that he is to become a second Deputy President to round up all the committes. That may be good. We get a lot of talk at times about the functions of committees and how they can be improved. I agree with that talk. But before the Parliament rises, which I do not think will be before next week, Senator Carrick has to tell us what he has in mind. If he does, he will find that the Senate will work better because, when the new senators arrive, he will be able to tell them what committees are available. I notice that Senator Kilgariff is in the chamber. I think he agrees that I have given him an endorsement. He believes in what I am saying-or Laurie Oakes says that he does. I leave it at that. I hope we will get an answer from Senator Carrick. He is the chief helmsman in this place. He has to give us an answer before Friday or the middle of next week. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I note the matters raised by Senator Mulvihill on the adjournment. Unfortunately, I am not in close contact with either Michelle Grattan or Laurie Oakes so I am not fully apprised of honourable senators' views. I will refer the matter to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Carrick. However, I think that most honourable senators would accept that the development of the Senate committee system and, indeed, its functioning is not a matter which proceeds on the fiat of the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Indeed, most changes have followed extensive expression of views by honourable senators in the chamber, at meetings of the Standing Orders Committee and in the other forums which honourable senators have for this purpose.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It may not be possible for Senator Carrick to respond in the simple and direct way he has been asked to by Senator Mulvihill this evening. I suspect that if he sought to do so a large proportion of the Senate would find that quite objectionable. I will refer the matter to him. I think it is generally accepted that sorting out the direction of the committee system is never at an end. It is a matter in which the developments of the last 10 years, I think, have raised new problems for honourable senators who are functioning in committees. I trust that we will be able to come up-if not by Friday then in the slightly longer term-with answers to the questions raised by the honourable senator. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) No. In any event, by its ratification in 1973 of the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT), Australia accepted an obligation not to develop a nuclear weapons program.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Australian work on enrichment using the laser uranium isotope separation process has been confined to a program of AAEC laboratory studies and only milligram quantities of uranium have been involved in the experiment. Enrichment levels achieved are confidential.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes; enrichment research work at the AAEC Research Establishment involves safeguardable nuclear material which is subject to International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) safeguards implemented pursuant to Australia's ratification of the NPT. The safeguards Agreement between the IAEA and Australia is available as the IAEA document INFCIRC/217 dated 13 December 1974 and is also in the Australian Treaty series, 1974 No. 16. As noted in the annual reports of the Australian Safeguards Office, the IAEA has indicated that Australia has satisfactorily discharged its safeguards-related obligations assumed under the NPT.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Some unclassified work arising from the laser isotope research program has been published where it was assessed that publication would not constitute a risk of proliferation.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The full range of implications for Australia of the development of this technology is the subject of continuing study.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Successive Commonwealth Governments have been kept informed of the AAEC's research program on the use of laser technology for uranium enrichment. As regards the non-proliferation aspects of the program, see (1) and (3).</PARA>
<PARA> (7) The enrichment process used in preparing weapons-grade material should not, of itself, have any effect on weapons design. Many conventional weapons platforms, including some of Australia's, could also be used for the delivery of nuclear weapons. As noted in (1) however, Australia has accepted an obligation not to develop nuclear weapons.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) The University of New England was involved at an early stage of the project through an unclassified research contract to provide advice on laser technology. It has not been involved in the AAEC uranium isotope separation program.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) At present 15 members of the Australian Federal Police as well as one administrative officer and two typists employed by my Department are attached to the task force. The estimated operational costs of Commonwealth involvement (including salaries and allowance of the administrative support staff and purchase or hire of plant and equipment) until the end of the current financial year are $380,919, being the net result of a gross Commonwealth outlay of $600,646 and reimbursement of $219,727 by the New South Wales Government under a cost sharing agreement. Each parent police force meets the salaries of its police officers seconded to the task force.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The method of operation of the task force was laid down by the Williams and Woodward Royal Commissions, namely, to target drug trafficking groups, particularly some which the Royal Commissioners indicated would take some time to investigate. Recently both the New South Wales and Commonwealth Governments required the task force to investigate the drug related aspects of the Nugan Hand Bank and persons involved in drug trafficking in any association with the operation of the Bank-in conjunction with the Corporate Affairs Commission of New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA> I am informed that up to 1 May 1981 the task force, constituted by officers of the New South Wales Police and Australian Federal Police-in liaison with the Corporate Affairs Commission of New South Wales, had broken up five major groups (that is involving at least four persons each group) with one group of 11 persons involved in the importation of heroin as well as one major and three minor groups supplying heroin and one minor group supplying morphine (six major and four minor groups). In consequence a total of 66 offenders has been charged on a total of 186 counts, 40 per sons in relation to the import or supply of heroin and three in relation to the supply of morphine.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Up until 21 April 1981 a total of 718.5 grams of heroin had been seized by the task force.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 5 May 1981 (Hansard, page 1569), Senator Gietzelt asked me, as the Minister representing the Prime Minister, a question without notice concerning the future of Towra Point, Sydney.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has provided the following answer for the honourable senator's information:</PARA>
<PARA> The property, of some 282 hectares on the southern side of Botany Bay, was acquired by the Commonwealth in 1975 for the establishment of a nature reserve under the provisions of the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975. Towra Point contains biologically valuable coastal wetland ecosystems and is of special international significance for the protection of migratory birds.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator would be aware that a number of surplus Commonwealth properties, particularly in the Sydney area, have recently been transferred to New South Wales. These properties have, in the main, formed the basis of the Sydney Harbour National Park. On 19 February this year, the Minister for Administrative Services in a joint press release with the New South Wales Ministers for Lands and for Planning and Environment, identified Towra Point for inclusion in the next group of land transfers. Action is in hand to complete the formal transfer of the land to New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA> The State Government has agreed that the appropriate future use of the property is as a nature reserve, managed by the New South Wales National Parks and Wildlife Service with the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service assisting in the preparation of the plan of management and being represented on the management advisory committee. The terms agreed between the Commonwealth and the State for the transfer of this land prevent Towra Point from being used for other purposes, such as an airport.</PARA>

<PARA> I refer to the election of the Socialist candidate, Mr Mitterrand, as the President of France. As his attitude towards French independence movements in the South Pacific is likely to vary from that of his predecessor and as his views will therefore be closer to the Australian Government's attitude on the area, will the Australian Government take the first opportunity to inform the new French President of our views on these matters?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Mitterrand was elected President of France on 10 May. He assumed the office of the Presidency on 21 May. Mr Mitterrand has foreshadowed legislative elections before the end of June to seek a working majority in the National Assembly.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government acknowledges the importance attached to the question and the desirability of registering our interests and concerns with the new French Government. This it will do as soon as it is appropriate.</PARA>
<PARA> The Senate will be aware that in a message to Mr Mitterrand the Prime Minister noted the importance we attach to our relations with France and said that he looked forward to the further development of bilateral relations, drawing strength from our shared concern for the peace and stability of the international community, as well as from the importance that both countries attach to the South Pacific.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 28 April 1981 (Hansard, page 1389) Senator Watson asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Education, a question without notice concerning systems analysts and computer programmers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Education has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Full time courses in computing and systems analysis are offered by 17 universities and 14 colleges of advanced education and some technical and further education colleges, at certificate, associate diploma, diploma, undergraduate bachelor degree and graduate diploma levels. All such courses are approved for the purposes of the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme (TEAS). Students who already have completed an undergraduate degree are normally ineligible for TEAS whilst undertaking a second undergraduate degree except to the extent that the minimum duration of the second course exceeds that of the first. (The only exception to this is where the two courses form part of an approved combined course under the Scheme, e.g. the Bachelor of Business Studies /Bachelor of Applied Science (EDP) at Caulfield Institute of Technology.) Graduates are, however, eligible for assistance whilst undertaking a graduate diploma such as a Graduate Diploma in Computer Science or a Graduate Diploma in Information Science. Given the wide availability of such courses and the scope for assistance under TEAS, it is not considered necessary to provide additional special measures to assist in the training of systems analysts and computer programmers.</PARA>
<PARA> It is also relevant to note that the Government has already announced, in principle, that it will support the transfer of resources in universities and colleges of advanced education to increase enrolments in technology and business studies courses. In 1982 and 1983 it will earmark $5m per annum to assist in this process. It will be a matter for the Tertiary Education Commission and individual institutions to consider particular levels of enrolment in various types of courses but the Government expects that manpower considerations will be a major factor in determining the areas in which enrolments will expand.</PARA>
