<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for National Development and Energy. I refer to a question asked by Senator Colston on Tuesday of this week in which he asked whether the Minister could name any multi-billion dollar project that had begun without a pilot plant. Did the Minister say in answer to that question that Rheinbraun, the West German brown coal company, intended to proceed in the Latrobe Valley without a pilot plant? Has his attention been drawn to a statement by the Managing Director of Rheinbraun Australia, Dr Klix, in which he said that the company was currently carrying out a study of the Latrobe Valley project and, depending on the results of that study, a decision would then be made to embark on a feasibility study? Did Dr Klix also say that only after this feasibility study would a decision be made about building a commercial plant? In view of those statements, does the Minister believe that he has fairly and frankly told the Senate the real situation in relation to the Rheinbraun plant in the Latrobe Valley?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I made the statement, as Senator Button has said. I read the report of the President of Rheinbraun. It is in no way divergent from what I said. The spokesman for Rheinbraun has indicated that the company does not intend, as I understand it, to go through the pilot plant situation but, having done feasibility studies, assuming they are carried out successfully, the company will then decide to go commercial. That was my understanding at the start and it is my understanding of the reading of the Rheinbraun statement now.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="287">Senator DAVIDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs to the latest report of the Industries Assistance Commission on the Australian car industry. Has the Minister seen the statement by the Managing Director of General Motors-Holden's Ltd that, if the Government accepted the draft recommendations, GMH would have to commence planning to down-scale its business? Can the Minister advise whether there has been any development in Government consideration of the draft recommendations? Can the Minister give an assurance that in any consideration the effect on the South Australian economy will be an important factor?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1274" SPEAKER="Messner Sen The Hon A.J." NAMEID="9I4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="VETERANS' AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Industries Assistance Commission, I understand, released a report on the motor vehicle plan post-1984 about a month ago. In the report the IAC was very critical of the present assistance measures comprising the 85 per cent local content plan, the 80-20 market sharing policy and the tariff of 57 1/2 per cent applying to all imports. It sought an endorsement for a longer term objective by the Government of a general policy approach, which is for the passenger motor vehicle and component industry to be afforded similar forms and levels of assistance to those which are currently available to other sections of Australian industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Broadly, the IAC was seeking discontinuance of the present marketing plan, that imported vehicles and original equipment components be initially dutiable at 60 per cent, and that the rates be reduced by five percentage points each year so that by 1 January 1990 imports would be dutiable at the far lower rate of 35 per cent. Allied to that, vehicle producers were to be provided with a basic by-law entitlement of 10 per cent of the value of their production, while export facilitation credits of 7 1/2 per cent of the value of production were to apply to manufacturers as well as to component manufacturers. Specialist component producers were to be entitled to earn export facilitation credits equal to 20 per cent of their original equipment sales.</PARA>
<PARA> That is by way of background to the question from Senator Davidson. In particular he asked whether the Government has developed its consideration of the IAC recommendations. As I understand the situation, the IAC is currently hearing further submissions from industry. Indeed, I think the statement quoted by Senator Davidson in his question is in fact from a submission made by General Motors-Holden's Ltd to the IAC in response to its original draft report. Consequently it should be seen in the light that a further report will be coming from the IAC. When that will be, of course, is in the hands of the IAC. Upon the receipt of that report the Government will consider the situation and determine its position as to future policy. Senator Davidson also sought assurances that South Australia's special situation would be taken into account in this matter during consideration of the IAC report. I can assure him that the Government is most aware of the particular situation in that State, which is heavily dependent upon the motor vehicle industry, and will be taking that into account in making its final determination.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for National Development and Energy. In view of the dramatic fall in the market capitalisation value of the Rundle twins, Central Pacific Minerals NL and Southern Pacific Petroleum NL, from $1,268m in January of this year to $462m on Tuesday's stock exchanges and as this peak had been achieved largely through the continued talking up of the Rundle project by the Minister, the Prime Minister and the Deputy Prime Minister, I now ask the Minister: What action does he intend taking to ensure that false hopes are not also built up in the minds of potential investors and the thousands of unemployed persons in South Australia because of the continued talking up of the Roxby Downs uranium venture in that State by the South Australian Premier, Mr Tonkin, as a great employer of labour with resulting financial benefits to that State? Finally, will the Minister bring down a firm statement to the Senate giving full details of the maximum number of persons who will be employed at Roxby Downs and the expected length of time of this employment?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly I, in my statements both in the Senate and in public, have not talked up Rundle. On the contrary, I have repeated a series of statements that are available to the Senate in Hansard and in which I have indicated that measures of this kind, of this magnitude, raise great technical problems, that there was no absolute proof of the technology and that it was therefore to the immense credit of the partners that they should undertake the project. In fact, I sounded a note of caution and, I repeat, of cautious optimism because I believed it was in the immense interest of the people of Australia that that should be done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the other hand, of course, since we are talking now about talking up and talking down, I remind the Senate that several days ago Labor Party senators, including Senator Walsh, said that Rundle was dead. I want to remind the Senate of what the Labor spokesman on energy and minerals in another place, Paul Keating, said on Rundle two days ago in a television interview in which I participated. It is diametrically opposed to every word that the Labor Party has said in the Senate, and this ought to be known to the people. Richard Carleton said to him:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bureau of Mineral Resources had indicated that the shale oil deposit at Rundle was of high quality-indeed, world quality. We did have the knowledge and advice of the Bureau. That has not been varied in any way at all. I will be very happy, in the interests of the Australian community, to ask the Bureau of Mineral Resources what its present knowledge of the status of Roxby Downs is. I hope, in the interests of all South Australians, that Roxby Downs, along with the Cooper Basin and the production of liquid fuels, is developed, because if these things succeed South Australia will be one of the front runner States under a State Liberal Government.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator has asked me a question about the election for the position of Victorian branch secretary of the AMWSU. I have some information about that election in my brief. My advice is that the election was by secret postal ballot, conducted by the AMWSU Victorian branch returning officer, and that it closed on 30 March 1981. The Department understands that the results of the election were: Mr Halfpenny, 5,859 votes, to Mr Kelly, 5,439 votes-a majority in favour of Mr Halfpenny of 420 votes out of the 11,298 valid votes which were received. I am not aware of the rumour referred to by the honourable senator. However, I am advised that there have been a number of Press reports, following the declaration of the ballot, suggesting that some members of the union may be considering a Federal Court of Australia challenge as to the validity of the election. I think most honourable senators will be aware that under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act provision is made for any member of a registered organisation such as the AMWSU, or a person who has been a member of such an organisation within the preceding 12 months, who claims that an irregularity has occurred in or in connection with an election for an office in that organisation, to lodge an application for an inquiry into the matter by the Industrial Division of the Federal Court. In other words, if there is concern of the type referred to by the honourable senator about the last three ballot boxes, the Act provides a means whereby an election may be challenged.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All honourable senators will know that revenue from one source of tax or charge goes into general revenue. It is not identified for return for a specific purpose. For example, we do not return the revenue from tobacco to smokers. Therefore one should understand that if one looks at the disbursal of moneys to Queensland one should look at the totality of the disbursal in all its forms. I refer to equalisation under tax sharing arrangements. Queensland was a mendicant State and therefore received extra money. Moneys are received for education, hospitals and for a variety of other things. I would be happy to look at the totality of the disbursals. I can appreciate the honourable senator's keen interest in a State which has two great interests. It has a hugeness of size, and therefore a dependence on its roads. Also, it has one of the most exciting prospects for development that Australia has seen. In that regard the co-partnership between the Commonwealth and the State is such that that development is proceeding at an unprecedented rate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for National Development and Energy. Why do Government leaders, including the Minister, constantly stress the overriding importance to our future energy requirements of oil from shale, oil from coal and energy derived from our uranium reserves, to the exclusion of farm based energy sources? Is the Minister aware that Australia could produce most of its oil requirement through farm based methods from an area less than one-third of that which we now use to grow wheat? Why is it that when there are well over 2,000 species of plant in the world which can produce an oil almost identical to that which is drilled out of the ground, not a single major government backed research program at present is being directed to this alternative? When is the Government going to withdraw its support from costly white elephant energy projects, such as Rundle is threatening to become, and begin to look seriously at farm based alternative energy programs?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, with Government backing. Let me say that at this moment, for example, in Mackay a major experiment is being conducted into the production of petranol-that is, a mixture of methanol and gasolene, or the gasahol type of mixture-in which the sugar company and, I think, the Shell company are working together as a start towards regionalisation. So that we can get the matter into perspective, there are two things that must necessarily run. One is that in Australia, as in the rest of the world, when considering biomass, because we are strongly capable of producing alcohols from sugars and starches but not right at this moment from cellulose and wood products, which would be exciting, there is a great conflict between food and fuel, the use of acreages for food in competition with fuel. In a world where people are starving one must be careful not to shrink food acreages. I will give Senator Chipp an illustration. If we were to try to extend by 10 per cent the production in Australia of gasolene from ethanol, it is estimated that it would be necessary to put under cultivation an extra 300,000 to 400,000 hectares of sugar cane or the alternative. That would take up all the available arable land. Let me go further and say that we set up a study to look at sugar beet production in Tasmania. We were sad to have to report that the experts had said that one of the limitations was the availability of land.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am aware that there are interests in various kinds of sub-economic areas where, for example, wild rubber plants and other plants are growing. It is possible, and it is only at that level at the moment, that that will be looked at in the future. Studies are being made, both here and in other parts of the world, to see whether that can be done. If it can be done we will be keen to look at it rapidly, and we will be pressing on in that regard. There is serious contemplation that the Ord River will be used for growing sugar cane to make ethanol. Wherever we can we will be doing that. Senator Chipp asked why we are looking at oil shale and coal.</PARA>

I stress that we want renewable energy if we can get it. The world at large is also faced with the situation that even if America, Canada, Australia, South Africa and China put all the coal they can at sea, the pressure of infrastructure and costs will be so enormous that coal will not totally solve the situation. The pollution from coal and the great health effects on the world being identified now are very serious, and therefore there is an almost total recognition around the world of the inevitability of using nuclear energy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Walsh interjected. Let me inject the report of what Mr Keating said in today's Australian Financial Review regarding Rundle. He is reported as saying yesterday:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . that the Rundle deposit probably had the best potential for oil from shale production in Australia-possibly the world-and the project would probably eventually go ahead.</PARA>
<PARA>I wonder how much that statement conflicts. Having said that I say-this is a deadly serious answer-that nobody can say that the Middle East will remain stable for any number of years. Nobody can say that we can depend on getting our oil from the Middle East for one, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10 or 20 years. Can anybody say that the threat to Poland will not start the building up of defence stocks and a run on oil around the world?</PARA>
<PARA> In that respect Australia cannot simply regard its necessities as a day to day buildup of shuffling an orchestration of energy sources which we can do relatively easily. It must put itself in a position in which the technology is here as fast as possible to meet critical world situations and to get an understanding of the technology of coal and shale so we can bring that into play as fast as we possibly can. Equally, I say to the honourable senator that the likelihood is that countries will make a run on coal out of coal mines for a while and then decide to switch to uranium. It is vital that in Australia the technology of chemical extraction from coal and shale should be in a position to substitute.</PARA>
<PARA> I hope that that is, in fact, a precise answer to the various points the honourable senator made. The question is an important one. I regret the length of the answer, but the necessity for it was there.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My understanding is that the Retarded Children's Welfare Association of Tasmania is an association under which a series of activity therapy centres have been operated in different parts of Tasmania for some years. The organisation came to my attention because it made a request for additional funding either late last year or early this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My understanding is that at least one of the elements of that organisation, the activity therapy centre at Devonport, has charged the fee mentioned by the honourable senator for a number of years. I think the same fee has now been imposed by the other activity therapy centres which are run in different parts of Tasmania. I received a letter to that effect from the State secretary of the organisation in February.</PARA>
<PARA> The organisation also advised me that the charge would be remitted if financial hardship could be proved. That, in a sense, picks up the last part of the honourable senator's question. In other words, if it is a case of hardship, my understanding is that there would be no detriment to the person seeking to attend the centre.</PARA>
<PARA> The matter of tax deductibility is not a matter for me but for the Treasurer. I presume that the only case in which deductibility might be possible is if the fees are regarded as educational expenses and if it is possible for the taxpayer to claim concessional deductions. Of course, not all taxpayers do claim because of the $1,590 or so general allowance given to all taxpayers. I will have that aspect of the question checked with the Treasurer and let the honourable senator know the precise position.</PARA>

The Pacific rim concept has been under increasing examination at both private and governmental levels in recent times.

Australia is taking every opportunity to expand its trade with Asia and with other markets for agricultural products and raw materials and the Government has a continuing policy of seeking assured opportunities of access to those markets. Long term contracts can serve a useful role in assuring our exporters of stable conditions of access to markets and ensuring reliable supplies for our customers.

Eight of them have come from Mr Power, none of them later than 14 months ago and the last one on 14 February of last year. So, indeed, that statement was not true. I will have a look at what Mr Matthews has said. The aim is that the Information Unit should do for groups of Ministers what under the Whitlam Government individual Press officers did for individual Ministers; that the Information Unit should be more economical, be fewer in numbers, and therefore function more efficiently.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For some years now the Government has been funding Aboriginal medical services around Australia in several ways. We have been funding a number of services which have had bulk billing. A number of services have been funded by grants-in-aid from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and some services have been funded through health program grants from the Department of Health. That support continues. Our funding is fairly extensive this year-of the order of just under $6m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A question was asked yesterday in relation to the service at Broome. I indicated then that I hoped to be in a position to give an early answer. I can now advise the Senate that I had officers visit the Broome service at the end of last week to ascertain the financial position of that service. I am now in a position to approve a grant to the Broome Regional Aboriginal Medical Service initially of $2,500 to meet its immediate financial needs and to enable it to continue its present level of operations. I will be making a further grant to the service to enable it to continue its operations until the end of June. The amount of this further grant is still to be determined after further discussions with the Medical Service.</PARA>
<PARA> I am convinced that the Commonwealth should provide some immediate financial assistance to BRAMS and to continue this assistance. I have so advised the Ministers in Western Australia. We are continuing to have consultations with the Western Australian Government officials. We hope to continue to work with them to identify how funding should be continued. At this stage I am unable to say what the level of funding might be after the end of June, but we hope to have that information available for the people in Broome fairly soon.</PARA>
<PARA> I have this morning sent a telegram to the Broome Regional Aboriginal Medical Service advising it of this funding.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I add some further information to the question of radioactive materials which I think Senator O'Byrne initiated interest in and which I am continuing to investigate. The New South Wales Minister for Health made an announcement on this matter yesterday. He indicated that the radioactive containers were not breached. He has ordered the monitoring of Laurieton's water supply. I indicated that if that had not been done it ought to be done. Any additional medical checks that are necessary will be carried out. Investigations will also be made regarding the pesticide spillage. The honourable senator will note that I said that there were really two kinds of toxic substances. Mr Gillespie, the Australian Atomic Energy Commission officer on leave who attended the site of the accident, found there bottles marked along the lines of 'Stripper XX'. Stripper XXX is a substance fatal if absorbed through the skin. I understand that Stripper XXX is a degreasing agent containing methylene chloride. I am not aware of its toxic nature, but presumably it is a dangerous chemical.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The bottles were in a small tool box in a caravan which was being transported on the back of a truck. One bottle was broken and put to the side of the road. The bottles were not related to containers of radioactive materials being transported on the truck.

There were two containers with radioactive sources on the truck. One was an 18-inch by 18-inch steel drum in which there were containers of americum. One weld on an outside drum was slightly damaged but there was no damage to inside containers-and I stress that. One lead pot four inches in diameter contained caesium 137. Both containers were ordered by a New South Wales Commission of Health officer to be taken out of the sun as a precaution against the danger of fire if materials had been damaged as they had been packed in paraffin. That was done. I will keep the Senate in touch with the investigations but that is the information I have up till now.

The question, which was asked yesterday by Senator Jessop, was in relation to expenditure by Australia Post on gold plated Parker pens. I am advised that in fact the contract related to the purchase of about 1,000 pens valued at about $30 each. That purchase related to Australia Post's service award scheme introduced on 1 January 1980. Essentially, the pens are part of an award scheme for long service. Awards are made after 25 years' service and 40 years' service. At 25 years' service people receive a small medallion and after 40 years' service a gold plated pen. With the introduction of the scheme about 500 persons immediately became eligible to receive a pen.

In talking about the truth I remind Senator Carrick and the other members of the Senate again about the standards which were set by this Government, allegedly, in 1975. In 1975 the present Prime Minister, Mr Malcolm Fraser, had this to say about misleading Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA> Ten per cent or even 50 per cent of the truth is as good a way of misleading this Parliament and the Australian people as a downright lie. The half truth, the partial answer and the slipping over of the full facts are a misleading of this Parliament . . . </PARA>

Mr President, we will be referring at a later stage to a number of documents relating to the Government Information Unit. What we are saying in this censure motion is that the Minister in charge of this chamber, a senior Minister in the Government, the Leader of the Government in the Senate and a man who has played a very prominent part in Liberal Party strategy over the years, has the failing of many members of this Government-a capacity to deal very lightly with the truth and an incapacity to be frank as distinct from dealing with half truths, deception and ultimately the misleading of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Maybe the problem is, of course, those very high standards which were so important in 1975. There is not only deception on behalf of this Government but also self-deception because of the failure to meet those standards. In fact, it is fair to say, I think, that Senator Carrick's self-image, insofar as his dealing with the truth is concerned, would make George Washington pale with envy because Senator Carrick denies persistently, day after day at Question Time, the possibility that he might have misled this Parliament in one way or another. I refer again to the standards set by the Prime Minister on 12 March 1978. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> One of my Government's first promises when we were elected just over two years ago was to restore the integrity and honesty of government. </PARA>
<PARA> Without integrity-without the appearance and reality of integrity-no Government can ever hope to have the confidence of the people, or the trust of the people. </PARA>
<PARA>In connection with this Government Information Unit, I interpose that no government, including this Government, can expect to have the confidence and trust of the people because of the way in which Ministers have behaved in relation to dissembling about this Government Information Unit. The Prime Minister went on:</PARA>
<PARA> My Government has demonstrated again and again our fundamental commitment to restoring integrity to public administration in Australia. Our record in this regard is without parallel in our history. </PARA>
<PARA>People might regard that as a somewhat equivocal statement. The Prime Minister continued:</PARA>
<PARA> As long as I lead the Government, there is no way known that anything less than the highest code and practice of public administration will be tolerated.</PARA>
<PARA>In relation to this Government Information Unit those standards have not in any way been maintained. There are numbers of reasons, I suspect, for that. We are talking, of course, about the two faces of the Government Information Unit. We are talking about a Jekyll and Hyde creation of the Liberal Party-the nice Jekyll face which Senator Carrick projects in this Senate in answer to questions and the Hyde face which I will tell honourable senators about in a minute and which every journalist in this country who is concerned about political issues knows about. </PARA>
<PARA> Why is Senator Carrick singled out from other Ministers in this regard? Senator Carrick is singled out because in this chamber he is, if I can coin a phrase, the 'Lynch-pin' in answering questions about the Government Information Unit, and I want to come to Sir Phillip Lynch at a later stage. But in this place, Senator Carrick is the responsible Minister in relation to these matters. If the truth had been told from the beginning, it would not be necessary to initiate this messy procedure. I want to refer to some of the documents in relation to that in a minute. The fact is, of course, that the Fraser Government was so concerned with its own probity and the standards which it would set, the standards laid down by the Prime Minister in the passages to which I referred, that it was not going to have Press secretaries such as those of the Whitlam Government; it would set up something quite different that would provide a facility for the people of Australia in order that they might better understand government decisions. That facility would disseminate information, it would be quite clean, a neutral organisation-nothing like Press secretaries were in the past or have been at any other time in the political history of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the Government Information Unit has two faces, and I want to say something about that. The function of the Government Information Unit is very much one of manipulating the media, getting the taxpayers to fund Liberal-National Country Party propaganda. That is what it is really about. </PARA>

That is a piece of information that the honourable senator can take back to the worthy burghers of Hobart. That is taxpayers' money, and I will show that the taxpayers' money is being spent and was spent in the course of the last election on Liberal Party propaganda, and nothing else.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is the Government Information Unit supposed to do, as distinct from what Senator Carrick and other Ministers have said it does? I refer first of all to a statement about the Government Information Unit released by the then Minister for Administrative Services, Mr John McLeay, on 22 December 1978, in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA> These officers who will be on Ministerial Staff, will be stationed in the State Offices of the Minister concerned and will be responsible for assisting all Ministers--</PARA>
<PARA>As Senator Carrick said-</PARA>
<PARA>in their dealings with matters affecting the State . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He said that they will be ministerial staff. In a later document, believe it or not bearing the date 6 April 1981-surprise, surprise-the present Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) made this statement:</PARA>
<PARA> Overall, the Unit's objective is to maintain a steady flow of straightforward, factual information about the policies and decisions of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>The statement goes on to say and this is a quotation which I commend to the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) when he is dealing with the Freedom of Information Bill:</PARA>
<PARA> Governments in modern democracies have a responsibility to inform; the people have a right to know. This Government accepts this responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA>That statement was made on 6 April this year. I have referred to two Government statements from the Minister for Administrative Services of the time. The first statement says that these people will be on ministerial staff. Senator Carrick has persistently denied that in the Senate. The second statement says that the purpose of the Government Information Unit is to provide a steady flow of straightforward information, and I will come to that.</PARA>
<PARA> Over the last few weeks we have heard a variety of versions of the functions of this Unit from Senator Carrick, from the Prime Minister, and from Mr Newman, the Minister for Administrative Services. Let me cite some examples of the variety of versions we have had about this unit which is to provide simple straightforward information about Government policies. In the Senate on 2 April, referring to the GIU officer, Mr Laurie Power, Senator Carrick said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . he is in no way a ministerial Press officer. </PARA>
<PARA>The day before Senator Carrick said: 'I do not have a Press officer'. On 25 March, in the House of Representatives, the Prime Minister said that officers of the GIU: 'stand in very large measure in place of a Press secretary'. Who does one believe about that? Who is telling the truth about that situation? One can look to 9 April, which I think is today-I am not sure. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. If the honourable senator listens, I will tell him about it. On the AM program, Mr Vincent Matthews, the head of the Government Information Unit, was asked this question by Mr David Margen:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So, the Unit's role is not simply providing the public with the information about the function and activities of Government or to explain to the public a Government policy?</PARA>
<PARA> It is in fact a political organisation involved in electioneering as well. </PARA>
<PARA>We must bear in mind the statement of the then Minister for Administrative Services-that it is a body designed to provide straightforward information. Mr Matthews said this:</PARA>
<PARA> Well, what is politics? Anyone concerned with Government is in politics. We are, as I said, on Ministerial staff. We are the same as Press Secretaries and if Press Secretaries had done the role, performed the role that we performed there would have been no questions asked . . . </PARA>
<PARA>So it goes on. There is a version from the head of the Government Information Unit-again different from the version put by Senator Carrick in this place and again different from the version put by other Ministers. What was Mr Newman still maintaining last night? I quote from the transcript of the PM program. He was asked whether the Unit was being used for party political purposes. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> No, not for Party political purposes. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Vincent Matthews, the head of the organisation, contradicted him today. On 1 April Senator Carrick told the Senate that he did not have a Press officer. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Power himself would indicate that he does not in fact work for me; nor do I seek his services in day to day public relations. All my media work is done either by me or by my personal staff here in this Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA> All my media work is done either by me or by my personal staff here in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>When Senator Carrick replies to this debate will he deny that for a substantial period journalists in this Parliament who wanted to see him had to make appointments through Mr Laurie Power in Sydney? If he does deny that, and if I can paraphrase an expression, flights of journalists will sing him to his political rest, because they know that to be untrue. On 2 April, the day after he had given that answer, and again referring to Mr Power, he told the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . he is in no way a ministerial Press officer;</PARA>
<PARA>Let us remember what Mr Matthews said-</PARA>
<PARA>he is a Government information officer. </PARA>
<PARA>That was on 2 April. Of course, there is now quite clearly some confusion because Senator Carrick says that that they are not on ministerial staff. One can ask this question: If the members of the GIU are not on ministerial staff, why are they given access to the Parliamentary Library on the basis that they are ministerial staff? Let us work that out, because after the GIU was set up its members made numerous demands on the Library for research material. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Grimes" NAMEID="9V4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And still do. The rule is that such requests can come only from members of parliament or their research staff. The Government Information Unit has been said by Senator Carrick not to be involved in that sort of activity. The requests came mainly from Elizabeth Bell, number three in the Canberra GIU operation. Those demands for Library services were based on the tenuous claim that the GIU was attached to the staff of the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Sir Phillip Lynch. Surprise, surprise, old Stumpy Gully Lynch is still at it! The claim made to the Library is that they are the personal staff of Mr Lynch. I suspect very strongly that there are many activities in relation to the Government Information Unit which a senior Minister, Sir Phillip Lynch, did not bother to tell the Leader of the Government in the Senate about. That is one of the reasons that the Government is in this dilemma over the problem, with Senator Carrick saying things which are totally different from things said by other Ministers and by members of the Government Information Unit itself. There was a row about the Government Information Unit's using the Parliamentary Library as members of Mr Lynch's staff, and the Library staff asked for a ruling about it. They received no direction on how to treat these requests from the Government Information Unit. When the Parliamentary Librarian was asked, he went on record as saying that the Unit did not fall into the guidelines set down for the staff of members of parliament. As far as can be ascertained, the Library staff have not been informed of this and the GIU continues to use the Parliamentary Library facilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What does the Government Information Unit do? This will be a matter of great interest to Senator Walters, I am sure. What do Mr Power and his colleagues really do? Let us take Mr Power as an example. On 11 February last year-this was the subject of questions in the Senate-he wrote, distributed and invited requests for information about a Press handout bearing that date. That Press handout was read to the Senate last week by Senator Walsh. In April of last year Mr Power, as part of his Government Information Unit functions presumably, attended nearby the Labor Party briefing on its energy policy, obtained a copy of the tape and took that information to the Minister. Those are some of the things that Mr Power has been doing. We will come later to some more things. What did Senator Carrick say about that in the Senate? He denied that Power was a member of his staff and carried out work for him. On 1 April he said in the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA> I did say, and I repeat, that I did not have a Press officer . . . Mr Power himself would indicate that he does not in fact work for me; nor do I seek his services in day to day public relations. All my media work is done by me or by my personal staff here in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Carrick, when pressed about it the following day, said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . what I said yesterday was that if one looks at the Press statements that are handed out by me, one will see that they come from here but that one or two have come from Mr Power. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the basis of an exchange in which Senator Carrick accused me of being offensive when I pointed out that he did not say that at all on the previous day. As I said, Senator Carrick on the previous day in fact said nothing of the kind. Secondly, Senator Carrick has denied that Mr Power did anything more than work for the Government of the day as distinct from engaging in party political activity. This is what he said on 1 April:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . my instructions to Mr Power were that he was a government employee, that he was to pursue work for the Government of the day and that he was not to be an employee of the Liberal Party as such. </PARA>
<PARA>That was a funny way of putting it-'an employee of the Liberal Party as such', because he is employed by the Government. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is apparently a distinction which the Minister felt it necessary to make and which clearly eludes Senator Walters. On 2 April Senator Carrick said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, if one wanted to locate Mr Laurie Power one would look towards my suite of offices and would find him there. Nevertheless, he is in no way a ministerial press officer;-</PARA>
<PARA>Contrary to what the Prime Minister and Mr Vincent Matthews are saying--</PARA>
<PARA>he is a Government information officer for the totality of government. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Carrick also said that the Government Information Unit, as distinct from individual officers attached to it, had not been engaged in political activity. Further, he said that they had not been involved in party political activity at the last election. On 31 March I asserted in the course of a speech that during the last election campaign the members of the Unit were engaged in electioneering for the Liberal Party. Senator Carrick, according to Hansard, said:</PARA>
<PARA> That is not true. </PARA>
<PARA>That was in the Senate on 31 March. That is a deliberate or a totally ill-informed misleading of this Parliament, as I will show. On 2 April Senator Carrick said:</PARA>
<PARA> My clear instruction on political matters to the Government information officer is that his job is to pursue Government information and not party political matters. </PARA>
<PARA>This is an extraordinary set of allegations and, of course, Mr Newman shares the view of Senator Carrick and was expressing it last night on the PM program when he said that the Unit was not for party political purposes. The essential questions are these: What is the truth about Mr Power's activities? Is he what the Minister pretends he is or is he something else?</PARA>
<PARA> I want to refer to some documents that have come into our possession from the Liberal Party Federal secretariat. I also rely on other matters of public knowledge-published reports and the evidence of journalists and others. How did we get the documents? How did the documents from the Liberal Party secretariat come into our possession? I will tell honourable senators how and I will tell them why. There are many Liberals in this country who are deeply concerned about the deception and the prevarication that have gone on about the activities of this Government Information Unit. Every honourable senator on this side of the House knows that because they talk about it. They are deeply concerned about the prevarication and the deception that have gone on. That is why we have the documents and that is why they were made available to us-because they are very concerned that the standards which were set by Malcolm Fraser in 1975 and in 1978 have in no way been kept by the way in which this Government Information Unit has been operated. That is how the documents came to us. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me mention some of the activities revealed in those documents which can be related to Mr Power, first of all, and which can fairly be described as party political activities. First of all, a minute dated 30 September last year, and marked with the time 8 a.m., states:</PARA>
<PARA> Eddie to ask SCOs to report daily on placement of press ads. </PARA>
<PARA>Eddie Dean is his name. He is a member of the Government Information Unit. What Press advertisements? In the context of the last election, what Press advertisements? Government Press advertisements or Liberal Party Press advertisements? Perhaps Senator Walters may have an answer to that question. The Government Information Unit officers were to report daily on the placement of Press advertisements. Government Press advertisements?</PARA>
<PARA> Is it a straightforward organisation disseminating Government information to the people of Australia or something acting for the Liberal Party? What Press advertisements was it to report on? The answer, of course, is that it was to report on the placement of Liberal Party Press advertisements during the last election. There is no mention of any exception to that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I appreciate that. There is no mention of any exception to that. The second point which arises from the documents is this: There was to be daily political impact monitoring. This was to be a standard procedure followed by State co-ordination officers, including Laurie Power of the Government Information Unit. There was to be daily political impact monitoring as part of the task of disseminating straightforward information on Government policies to the people of Australia. Is that part of the function of the Government Information Unit? Senator Guilfoyle laughs because she knows where those documents came from. She knows what it is all about. Political impact monitoring on a daily basis is a party political activity in which these members of the Government Information Unit were engaged. Other functions are listed in the documents. There are various headings under that daily task. One is 'Problem Areas and Criticism'. Criticism of whom? Another heading is 'Positive Issues'. Issues for whom? The fourth heading is 'Pressure Group Activities'. Pressure group activities against whom and for whom? The next heading is 'Party Morale'. The Government Information Unit is to be concerned about party morale. The last heading states 'Other Matters (Including Local Labor Tactics)'. The information which the State co-ordination officers of the Government Information Unit-a body designed to provide straightforward political information on Government decisions-including Mr Power, monitored and collected daily was to go to the Prime Minister, a Government official. The information was also to go daily to Mr Tony Eggleton, the Federal Director of the Liberal Party. Their function was described in the documents as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Serve as a channel for fast communication between the Prime Minister, the Federal Director--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, Mr Eggleton-</PARA>
<PARA>and members of the Organisation and the Parliamentary Party;</PARA>
<PARA>Members of the organisation! What organisation? I ask Senator Walters what she imagines could be the organisation. On 26 and 27 June, according to one of the documents, the State co-ordinating officers, including Laurie Power, appear again, apparently without the good Minister's knowledge. They were responsible for assessing on that day the political climate. From the documents it appears that on 25 September Power needed some help about those matters. On that date the agenda for a Liberal Party strategy meeting listed a task for Mr Dale Budd, who incidentally is Mr Anthony's brother-in-law and one of the Prime Minister's functionaries. This task was set for Mr Dale Budd by the Liberal Party:</PARA>
<PARA> Follow up request made by Vincent Matthews as to whether the Party can assist Laurie Power. </PARA>
<PARA>Laurie Power needed the Party assistance on that day. Of course, in all these documents the political climate is a continual obsession with the weather men at Robert Menzies House not far from here. Before the election campaign began there was written a minute which shows the way in which the GIU, the Government Information Unit, the cleanskin to replace or raise the standards of government and so on--</PARA>

<PARA>FEDERAL CAMPAIGNING: THE PM'S PROGRAM/ITINERARY</PARA>
<PARA>Planning and Implementation</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> (a) Obtain maximum political value in the time available . . . keeping in mind the Senate as well as the House of Representatives</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Communicate with as large an audience as possible: a national as well as a local audience</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Engagements should be assessed for media potential There should be very good and politically justifiable reasons before recommending any engagement that cannot be maximised through the mass media</PARA>
<PARA> (d) Avoid over-loading the itinerary Importance of 'think' time and opportunity to deal with government business</PARA>
<PARA> (e) The PM's itinerary is the cutting edge of the campaign and deserves all the honing it can get The visit should be supervised personally by the State director, and final responsibility should not be delegated down-the-line</PARA>
<PARA>(2) Nature of engagements (a) With all engagements, there should be an eye to reaching the wider audience through media coverage</PARA>
<PARA> (d) The PM would expect to address at least one major rally/public meeting in each capital</PARA>
<PARA> (e) There is often scope for visits to local institutions and clubs</PARA>
<PARA> (f) There may also be local projects and developments with which the PM can usefully be associated</PARA>
<PARA> (g) Divisions should be alert to opportunities for associating the PM with ethnic communities and young people</PARA>
<PARA> (h) The PM does not favour time-consuming 'whistle stops' through electorates</PARA>
<PARA> (i) 'Walkabouts' should be impromptu rather than being planned as specific campaign engagements (and there should not be advance publicity)-(Attachment 'C')</PARA>
<PARA> (j) Except in special circumstances, factory visits should have a low priority PM is not very interested in just walking rapidly through a factory</PARA>
<PARA> He would want a chance to join the workers (not the executives!) in their canteen, and to address them</PARA>
<PARA> (n) At public meetings, the number of other speakers should be kept to an acceptable minimum The PM should be followed only by a short vote of thanks (where appropriate)</PARA>
<PARA> Note: In planning the most effective program for the PM, it is worth keeping in mind that-apart from getting best value for the PM, the campaign and the Party-the media are quick to criticise if they can point to sloppy campaign planning and politically irrelevant engagements. </PARA>
<PARA>(3) Planning the Visit (a) Early consultation with the federal director</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Proposals to be discussed by State Strategy Committee as appropriate, but not raised with candidates and electorates (danger of raising expectations)</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Proposed program to be submitted to the Federal Director in writing</PARA>
<PARA> (d) Detailed planning for the program not to be activated until Federal Director or PM's private office confirm PM's acceptance of the proposal</PARA>

<PARA> discuss the detailed planning</PARA>
<PARA> make contact with the local media, with an eye to maximising PM's coverage, particularly on TV and radio</PARA>
<PARA> consult with State Director and State Co-ordination Officer to obtain input for an initial 'political climate' report for the PM and federal campaign director</PARA>
<PARA> (b) On the eve of the PM's visit, the State Director should liaise with the State Co-ordination Officer about the filing of a 'political climate' update (this should reach the PM and Federal Director no later than 24 hours prior to the start of the visit)</PARA>
<PARA> (c) In all centres visited, the Prime Minister and his staff will require temporary offices This will normally be organised by the PM's office and the federal campaign team, but the division may be looked to for some assistance</PARA>

<PARA>ANNEX 6</PARA>
<PARA>Campaign Seminar 26-27 June, 1980</PARA>
<PARA>MINISTERIAL CO-ORDINATION</PARA>
<PARA>Approach</PARA>
<PARA> 1. During the campaign proper Ministers will be asked by the Prime Minister to undertake one of the following roles-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Travelling Ministers: Ministers who take part in a co-ordinated programme of visits around the country. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) State Spokesmen: Ministers who will act as Senior Government Spokesmen in their State throughout the campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) State Specialists: Ministers who will undertake general campaign activities within their States. </PARA>
<PARA>Travelling Ministers</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The aim with each Travelling Minister is to design an itinerary which maximises publicity for the Government both nationally and in each State he visits. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. This should be done keeping in mind:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the need to use Ministers to the best possible advantage during the campaign;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the wishes of both the Ministers themselves and the State Divisions;</PARA>
<PARA> 4. In consultation with Ministers' offices and the Divisions, the National Co-ordinator will draw up a programme for each Travelling Minister 'allocating' him to particular States on particular days. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. In preparing the programme, the following guidelines will be kept in mind:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Travelling Ministers should not be in a State at the same time as the Prime Minister. (Activities by other Ministers are less likely to receive coverage if the Prime Minister is also in town.)</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Otherwise, at least one Travelling Minister should be in each State on each day of the campaign. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) Desirably, each Travelling Minister should visit each State. </PARA>
<PARA> (d) Visits should be of two days duration to maximise impact. </PARA>
<PARA> (e) Adequate time must be allowed for each Minister to spend in his own electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> 6. Once the overall programme is finalised, the detailed planning of itineraries in each State will be the responsibility of the State Director. State Directors may wish to delegate the task to a Senior Officeholder or staff member, but they should retain overall responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> 8. The co-ordinated programme for Travelling Ministers will commence on the day following the Campaign Launch and will conclude on the Wednesday prior to polling day, allowing them to spend the last days of the campaign in their electorates. </PARA>
<PARA>State Spokesmen</PARA>
<PARA> 9. The primary role of State Spokesmen is to generate favourable media coverage for the Government in their State. To do this they should be available to the media at all times. </PARA>
<PARA> 10. State Divisions may wish to ask State Spokesmen to undertake a campaign program within their home States, but this should not impinge upon their primary campaign responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> 11. In normal circumstances State Spokesmen would not accept engagements outside their home States. Where they do so, arrangements should be made with another Minister to assume their responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> 12. It is suggested that State Spokesmen be co-opted to State Strategy/Campaign Committees. </PARA>
<PARA>State Specialists</PARA>
<PARA> 13. State Specialists would be available to undertake general campaign activities within their State. </PARA>
<PARA> (a) Maximising the Senate vote. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) Assisting local candidates. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) Working closely with the Party Organisation at electorate level. </PARA>
<PARA> 15. In some cases, there may be scope for these Ministers to undertake engagements outside their home States. </PARA>
<PARA>Kinds of Engagements</PARA>
<PARA> 16. Ministers are a scarce 'campaign resource' and all activities they undertake during the campaign should be designed to get the most possible mileage. </PARA>
<PARA> 17. The principle aim of all Ministerial engagements should be to obtain favourable media coverage. </PARA>
<PARA> 18. Other engagements should only be undertaken if there is a definite objective in mind-for example meeting key businessmen, civic leaders and other opinion formers, speaking at a 'closed' fund-raising function, et cetera. (Normally, fund-raising activities in electorates would be expected to generate coverage, at least in the local Press.)</PARA>
<PARA> 19. Because of the special importance of Travelling Ministers to the overall campaign, the following guidelines are suggested for planning their itineraries:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) On arrival in a State, their first port of call should be the office of the Minister to whom the State Co-ordinator Officer is attached, for a briefing on the local campaign climate. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) State Directors should also contact them to brief them on any special campaign matters, and to finalise last minute details of their itineraries. </PARA>
<PARA> (e) Wherever possible, opportunities should be taken to get Travelling Ministers on radio talk-back shows. </PARA>
<PARA> (f) There is often scope for Ministers to take advantage of forums such as major Chambers of Commerce, Conventions et cetera during the campaign. State Divisions should be alert to opportunities to 'orchestrate' suitable invitations. </PARA>
<PARA> 20. Where Travelling Minsters visit local electorates, close liaison is needed with candidates and campaign managers. </PARA>
<PARA> (a) Past experience has shown that it is not satisfactory to leave arrangements solely to those in the electorate. Against this background it is essential that detailed itineraries be provided well in advance (preferably before the campaign commences) and be cleared by both the State Division and the Travelling Minister concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) Suggested engagements could include:</PARA>
<PARA> public meetings;</PARA>
<PARA> meetings with key special interest groups, civic leaders et cetera;</PARA>
<PARA> visits to local institutions, clubs and factories;</PARA>
<PARA> shopping centre walks;</PARA>
<PARA> calls on local newspaper editors;</PARA>
<PARA> in country electorates, local TV and radio interviews, talk-back shows et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA> fund-raising dinners/bar-b-cues et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA> large meetings of Service Clubs, Chambers of Commerce et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) All electorate activities should involve the local candidate and, where possible, Senate candidates as well. </PARA>
<PARA> (d) Coverage in the local Press, and if appropriate the major dailies and television, should actively be sought. </PARA>
<PARA> (e) Use the time of Travelling Ministers frugally. Generally speaking, activities such as attending small gatherings of 'Party faithful' or Branch meetings, purely social functions and doorknocking (!!) do not require the time of a Travelling Minister . . . and can be left to others to handle. </PARA>
<PARA> 21. Similar guidelines to those contained in Paragraph 20 should also apply to the kinds of activities undertaken by State Spokesmen and State Specialists. </PARA>
<PARA>TO: JACK HAMMOND</PARA>
<PARA> Attached is brief for you on Hinch show and brief on ethnic media was already sent to you to Martin Place office on Tuesday afternoon. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe Hinch should be taken head-on otherwise he will win what he is billing as 'the battle of the year'. </PARA>
<PARA> The difficulty is that Hinch has the assistance of Jill Nankerville and Barber (both sit in an outside studio and have direct access to Hinch via earphones). Paul Barber tends to feed questions and follow up points to Hinch. I would suggest that someone remains outside and talks and disturbs both Nankerville and Barber. I found this worked well with both Newman and Howard interviews. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I referred earlier to the activities of the Government Information Unit. For example, when the Prime Minister went to Delhi last year for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting the reports on the Australian media were supplied to the Prime Minister by Laurie Power. Traditionally the Department of Foreign Affairs has monitored the Australian media. On this occasion Laurie Power of the Government Information Unit, to whom I have referred on a number of occasions, sent a resume to the travelling Prime Minister. That was done so that the Prime Minister could get advise on what he should be doing and saying in a political context rather than rely on a department of government as has traditionally been done-namely, the Department of Foreign Affairs-for objective monitoring of the media.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of Laurie Power's tasks as the Sydney operative of the GIU was to carry out media liaison work as indicated in the documents I referred to earlier. When the Prime Minister arrived at Mascot airport Power was always there of course waiting at flight facilities for the Prime Minister's plane. He was to look after the needs of the media and when required was to organise a Press conference. He rang radio stations frequently during the election campaign to pass on material on behalf of the Liberal Party. He always introduced himself to radio station announcers as Laurie Power from the Liberal Party. This is the man whom we were told in the Senate is fulfilling a non-political, non-partisan role. </PARA>

Senator Carrick might want to step aside from all these answers he has given about Laurie Power. That will be very hard to do because of the indelible nature of the printed word. He might want to talk in generalities about the Unit's role during the last election campaign. So let me refer to some of its activities as an organisation. Perhaps Mr Newman should also note these facts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer again to the set of documents from the Liberal Party. The first meeting of the Liberal Party campaign committee was in June. The agenda is headed 'Federal Campaign Headquarters, Structure and Operations'. Under agenda item (5) which is 'Operations' the following appears: 'Liaison with Government Information Unit'. Under the same agenda item at the same meeting the following appears: 'Liaison with GIU and PM's Office'. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier in the year-on 25 August to be precise-there was another meeting about monitoring. Under the heading 'Operations', agenda item (4), there appears: 'GIU/SCO's'. That refers to State co-ordination officers of the Liberal Party. Under agenda item (7) for the same meeting there appears: 'GIU'. The agenda then sets out matters for resolution involving that Unit, including 'Method of Operations/Location (s)/Staff'. This is all in Tony Eggleton's bailiwick over in Robert Menzies House. The poor old fellow would turn in his grave if he knew that this sort of stuff was going on in the Liberal Party of Australia. Under agenda item (7) also is the heading 'Liaison with PM's Press Office/National Campaign Headquarters'. </PARA>
<PARA> On the same agenda for the Liberal Party campaign committee is a list of monitoring priorities-the most wanted men, it is said. Those priorities are named as follows: 'Hayden, Hawke, Wran, Shadow Ministers, Advertising (theirs and ours), All Local Media/Talk Back Radio/Press Conferences/Interviews etc.'. That appears in the minutes of the Liberal Party's campaign meeting under the heading 'Government Information Unit'. I repeat that reference is made to 'Advertising (theirs and ours)' as well as 'Hawke, Hayden, Wran' and so on. The Liberal Party even used-in fact it assumed the use of-equipment belonging to the Government Information Unit. That comes under the heading 'Facilities and Equipment' in the Liberal Party campaign minutes. </PARA>
<PARA> Other facilities and equipment would have come from the national campaign headquarters of the Liberal Party, the Prime Minister's Press Office and State divisions or branches. That is fair enough. That is a proper divorcement of the activities of a political party from the proper activities of government. Sure, they are the facilities that any political party should use-State divisions and branches of the Liberal Party, the national campaign headquarters-but not equipment paid for with taxpayers' money, namely the equipment of the Government Information Unit. As I said, the campaign minutes of the Liberal Party refer to 'Facilities and Equipment'. </PARA>
<PARA> On 25 August there was a meeting of the Federal Secretariat of the Liberal Party. It was on a Monday. The meeting began at 10 a.m. Who was there? Tony Eggleton, the National Director of the Liberal Party; Martin Rawlinson, the resident analyst, I am told he is called but I do not know whether he is a psychoanalyst or a political analyst; Bob Baudino, otherwise known as the Chuck or Charles Colson of Australian politics; Grahame Morris, Baudino's underling; Eddie Dean-not John Dean-a Melbourne film producer who was hired as a jack of all trades for the purposes of the campaign; Dale Budd to whom we have referred before; also David Barnett, the Prime Minister's Press Secretary, and his assistant Alister Drysdale. There was Jonathan Gaul, the Canberra lobbyist and public relations man who had been hired to run the media unit during the election campaign. Of course there were two other gentlemen employed out of taxpayers' money, two other gentlemen who were to provide facilities and equipment to the Liberal Party during the election-Vincent Matthews, head of the Unit, and his chief assistant Mr Jim Hall; both from the Government Information Unit. </PARA>
<PARA> On 26 and 27 June there was another campaign seminar. There was a discussion on ministerial co-ordination. Under the heading 'Kinds of Engagements', this instruction to Ministers appears in agenda item 19:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) On arrival in a State, their first port of call should be the office of the Minister to whom the State Co-ordinator Officer is attached, for a briefing on the local campaign climate. </PARA>
<PARA>There was a further strategy meeting on 5 October. The first item on the agenda was this: 'Speak to Vince Matthews about the GIU relaying all Press releases and AAP reports to the travelling team'. </PARA>
<PARA> On 30 September more follow-up action was required, with Eddie Dean being asked 'to request the State co-ordinator to report each day on placement of Press ads'. The Queensland officer was asked to monitor closely the repercussions of Mr Eric Robinson's statement on the National Party. Is that straightforward provision of decisions about Government policy? I do not think so. On 9 October a copy of the front page of the Adelaide News, one of the more notorious front pages to appear in the election campaign, was sent to Baudino of the Federal Secretariat of the Liberal Party. It was marked: 'To Bob Baudino from Maurice Dunlevy'. He is the officer of the GIU in Adelaide. On 9 October one Barbara, whoever she is, sent a note to Baudino which read:</PARA>
<PARA> Vincent Matthews has just phoned through the following message: 'Sydney Stock Exchange prices rose sharply this morning in all sections'. </PARA>
<PARA>Is that straightforward provision to the public of important information concerning Government policy? On 29 September Mr Verbickis sent a telegram to Jonathan Gaul, a man hired by the Liberal Party and the man in charge of the campaign media unit. The telegram from Arnis Verbickis, the Victorian officer, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Have arranged news conference for Mr Howard tomorrow at 11.30 a.m. at 4 Treasury Place, Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA>At the strategy committee meeting on 26 September more follow-up action was required of Dale Budd, who had to 'investigate operational problems with the PM's Press office and the Government Information Unit'. There were further instructions of a similar kind, including an instruction to obtain information required by the Prime Minister prior to his talk-back programs. There is, of course, the notorious example of Mr Verbickis in Victoria advising officers travelling with Ministers how to carry out dirty tricks to distract the producers of the Derryn Hinch Show. Similar comments can be made about the activities of Mr Vincent Matthews in launching the Prime Minister's campaign and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend to honourable senators as bedside reading those documents which have been incorporated in Hansard. They really are extraordinary documents. They illustrate the deception which has gone on right from the beginning about the nature of the Government Information Unit-a deception which has trapped Senator Carrick in its web. Statements here again and again represent attempts to divert, to mislead, and to tell only part of the truth about the role of the Government Information Unit. It has all happened, of course, because of the statement by the Prime Minister right at the beginning about the integrity and probity of the Liberal Government and the high standards that would be set. The high standards have not been kept. I assert categorically that what has happened is that taxpayers' money has been used to finance the so-called Government Information Unit. Taxpayers' money has been used for that purpose. That money has been siphoned off to the Liberal Party-the party in Australian politics which always resists the sourcing of campaign donations at election times, which always resists the placing of limits on expenditure at election times and which during the course of the last election campaign spent $3m and, in addition, stole taxpayers' money in order to employ people in the pursuit of Liberal Party activities in the election. </PARA>
<PARA> The facts are documented. They are clear. Facilities and equipment were used. Personnel were used. Personnel employed by the taxpayers had to report to Mr Tony Eggleton every day. People employed by the Government had to report to him. What has he to do with the process of government? Can honourable senators on the other side of the House not distinguish between the process of honest government and the activities of the Liberal Party? Are those two things so merged together in their minds that they see no distinction at all in terms of the propriety about which the Prime Minister spoke? That is what has happened.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Carrick has been cast in the unhappy role in the Senate of dissembling and misleading in relation to the whole thing. He did not want any of that stuff to come out. He wanted us to believe what he said, namely, that the Government Information Unit was not party political and that the persons referred to, quite contrary to what they themselves say, were not on Ministers' staffs, and were not involved in the last election campaign. When I made that allegation last week, Senator Carrick said: 'That is not true'. He accused me of telling lies. It is true. Senator Carrick deserves the censure of the Senate because, as I said earlier, he has been the linchpin of the Government's dissembling, dishonesty and prevarication about the true function of this unit. </PARA>

I said that there is a Government Information Unit, that a Government information officer is stationed in every State and that the officer is under the control of the senior Minister in that State but is not his Press officer. I repeat that the Government information officer in each State is under the control of the senior Minister in that State but is not the personal Press officer of that Minister. That is a simple fact capable of easy proof. I said that the New South Wales officer is quartered in my suite of offices in Sydney for the sake of convenience. That is a fact. Quite clearly, ordinary administrative conditions apply to him there. I said that his role is not to be my Press officer but to service all Ministers and the Government generally. They are facts. The whole thrust of this issue is that the answers I have given to questions in the Senate are inaccurate. I have stated the simple facts. They are easily capable of being ascertained.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The instruction regarding the information officer is that the officer be not absorbed into the normal work of the Minister's office-that is, my office-but, although under the Minister's control, operate a service for all Ministers and for the Government as a whole. Part of the duties of the officers shall be to maintain close liaison with the Government Information Unit in Canberra. They are the facts, and Hansard has recorded, one by one, what I have said. I have pointed out that the Unit provides various services for Ministers collectively. Whereas in the past the Whitlam Government had one Press officer for every Minister and, in addition, a large propaganda unit, we have reduced the number of officers for Ministers down to three, I think, for the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and about four for other Ministers, excluding myself. Some 20 Ministers do not have Press officers, and in their place is a much more economical set-up-a Government Information Unit functioning for all Ministers. Of course, if I were of a mind, as one of the eight or nine Ministers from New South Wales, to ask Mr Power to help, he would be available, as he would to the 27 Ministers who move from time to time through my State. He is a servant of all Ministers and of the Government. I have said that and made it quite clear. </PARA>

Can I plead with the Minister to reply to Senator Button's charge that he, Senator Carrick, categorically stated to this chamber that officers of the Government Information Unit at no time engaged in party political activity in the last election campaign?

However I bow to nobody in this place as to responsibility for the accuracy of what I say as contained in Hansard. What I have said and what was reported in Hansard is that I do not have a Press officer; that is demonstrable. I could have one but I do not; that is demonstrable. There is a Government Information Unit and it is collectively used by all Ministers; that is demonstrable. It is under my responsibility; that is demonstrable. Officers report to the Government Information Unit. I also said that I had used Mr Power only a few times for Press purposes. I have said all those things. Concerning the question on my knowledge of the role of the Government Information Unit and of unit officers in the campaign, the information that I had was that my responsibility was to say to my information officer: 'This is your responsibility. Do it'. I was on a circuit throughout Australia and had no other information. I hope that those points clear the matter up. The point that Senator Chipp makes, in fact, is very relevant to what I was going to say. The test is: What is the concept of the Government Information Unit? How was it instructed to me? The instructions have read out very clear. They are the instructions that I followed. In fact, the Unit was for the use of all Ministers and not for one. The nature of the Government Information Unit becomes of tremendous importance. I will read from the paper that has been supplied. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government Information Unit was set up in Canberra following a decision by Cabinet in May 1978 to encourage. 'more effective communication to the public of government decisions and actions', and to provide 'advice and assistance in that context to all Ministers'. </PARA>
<PARA> The role of the Government Information Unit is:</PARA>
<PARA> to provide advice and assistance to Ministers on a day to day basis as required on the most effective way of communicating government decisions and actions to the public;</PARA>
<PARA> to plan and arrange media coverage, both print and electronic, on matters of substance and advise on services provided by the Government;</PARA>
<PARA> to co-ordinate Ministerial publicity where necessary and ensure there is neither conflict nor overlapping of effort. </PARA>
<PARA> Only four Government Ministers apart from the Prime Minister have press Secretaries. </PARA>
<PARA>Here is a clear statement of fact:</PARA>
<PARA> Overall, the Unit's objective is to maintain a steady flow of straightforward, factual information about the policies and decisions of the government. </PARA>
<PARA> Governments in modern democracies have a responsibility to inform; the people have a right to know. This Government accepts this responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government Information Unit is a genuine effort on the part of the Government to keep the Australian people informed of what the Government is doing. </PARA>
<PARA> The Staff of the Government Information Unit:</PARA>
<PARA> There are two journalists on the Unit's staff in Canberra and one in each State capital, a total of eight. The journalists in the States are known as Federal Information Directors. </PARA>
<PARA> There is provision for a journalist to be appointed in Darwin, and for another to be appointed in Canberra to assist journalists, especially radio journalists, in their contacts with Ministers. In the Unit's Canberra office there is also a research assistant, a secretary and a typist. And, in the States, there is provision for each Federal Information Director to appoint a secretarial assistant. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Information Directors are a genuine attempt by the Government to ensure the best possible communication and understanding between Commonwealth and State governments at all levels. </PARA>
<PARA> They are stationed in the State offices of the Ministers who have responsibility for Federal-State affairs. They assist the media in the States in gathering information on Federal affairs, in making contact with Government Ministers, in helping to co-ordinate programmes for Ministers visiting States, in arranging Press conferences and preparing press releases for special announcements, etc. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Information Directors are also required to keep the Commonwealth Government aware of the significant State issues which are relevant at the Federal level. </PARA>
<PARA> The Directors also help Federal Ministers in their contacts and activities in the States and keep the Federal Government in touch with public reaction to Commonwealth policies and programmes. </PARA>

My clear recollection is that I made that interjection in the unqualified belief that the conditions that I understood the Government Information Unit officers to be working under at the election time were the prevailing conditions. They are the ones I instructed. I have looked at the Hansard reports generally. I say quite clearly and without qualification that I have not either wittingly or unwittingly misled the House.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In supporting the censure motion moved by my colleague, Senator Button, I will also be brief. First of all I take up three of the arguments used by Senator Carrick in his reply to Senator Button. I believe a reply needs to be given to those arguments. I will give an example which demonstrates the difficulty Senator Carrick has had in answering the case. Senator Carrick cast doubts on the veracity of the documents which have been tabled by Senator Button and then he questioned the morality, as he put it, of using such documents. The first point I make is that these documents have been seen by Ministers in another place. They have obviously by now been seen by officials of the Liberal Party. No one, until Senator Carrick spoke today, has questioned the veracity of the documents. I challenge anyone on the Government side to state that these documents are not what they appear to be-true documents from the Liberal Party. Any suggestion that these documents have been falsified by anyone else I believe is nonsense. I believe that Senator Carrick and his colleagues know that it is nonsense.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9V4">Senator GRIMES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a second measure of Senator Carrick's desperation, as Senator Walsh puts it, I refer to the extraordinary performance that was put on to show that the use of documents like this is apparently immoral in this Parliament. If we need an example of queer morality in this place the statement of Senator Carrick must be the best. Those of us who were members of the Senate in 1972 and 1974-I include Senator Carrick-will remember the extraordinary flow of documents which were leaked to the then shadow Treasurer, Mr Lynch. An honourable senator was given a copy of the 1975 Budget documents on the morning of the Budget Speech and delivered them to Mr Lynch. In a Four Corners interview soon after the election the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) justified the use of leaked documents as being in the public interest. Every member of this place knows of that; every member of this place has heard the statement. Senator Carrick was part of that process of using leaked documents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On one occasion in this place Senator Carrick moved a motion which was carried to allow Senator Townley to table in this place an unsigned document which made allegations about the former Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam. Let us not hear any of this nonsense about the immorality of using documents that are acquired in this way. These documents are Liberal Party documents. These documents are true. These documents were legitimately used by the Labor Party as documents were claimed to be legitimately used by the previous Opposition in this place. The difference is that the Treasury documents used by the then Mr Lynch were, in fact, private government documents. It was illegal for them to be leaked. This is particularly so in the case of the Budget documents. In some cases they were even purchased by Mr Lynch and his agents. Let us not hear this nonsense about the immorality of using these documents. It comes ill from Senator Carrick. </PARA>
<PARA> My second point is that Senator Carrick decided to remark that Mr Morrison, who is now a member of the House of Representatives, previously worked for an Opposition member and that one of our senators worked for an Opposition member. The point is that those people were hired by the senator and member to work for them in the same way as people are hired by those opposite. They were electorate assistants. Everyone knew who they were and what they were doing. In this case Senator Carrick and others have persistently pretended that members of the Government Information Unit were somehow separate and divorced from politics and from the Liberal Party. This plainly and obviously is not true. Senator Carrick has referred to the remark he made to Senator Button in this place on 31 March. Senator Button said:</PARA>
<PARA> During the last election campaign the members of the Unit were engaged in electioneering for the Liberal Party--</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Carrick quite unequivocally said:</PARA>
<PARA> That is not true. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Button then said:</PARA>
<PARA> I make that charge and I invite the Government to deny it by argument and not by interjection. </PARA>
<PARA>The denial has not been made by argument here today. It has not been made anywhere else by argument because we have documentary evidence that what Senator Button said is plainly and obviously true. Senator Carrick said that at the time he made the remark he believed it to be true. He has had ample opportunity to discover in the meantime whether his statement was true and to correct it in this House. He has not done so. I believe that is sufficient reason for Senator Button to move the censure motion. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Carrick, other Ministers and backbenchers have repeatedly made a virtue of the claim that junior Ministers, and some senior Ministers in this place, do not have Press secretaries. This was apparently a virtuous state of affairs. Some of us see no particular virtue in it. Whether one Minister has a Press secretary or not is not a matter of great importance. What is important is that Senator Carrick, Mr Newman, Senator Chaney and others have repeatedly fed us the line that there is something special about this Government because it set up a unit which was divorced from the Liberal Party and from party politics; that somehow this is more pure than people having Press secretaries with which, by implication of the argument, there is something wrong. It is clear-as one can show quite clearly after an interview on AM this morning-that this is just not so. The director of the Government Information Unit, Mr Vince Matthews, and his colleagues saw their role as Press secretaries. It was obvious to everybody in this place and many people outside that people like Laurie Power, Arnis Verbickis and Mr Bruce Montgomery were in fact performing the role of Press secretaries and that they pursued this role vigorously and aggressively. </PARA>
<PARA> It is pointless for Senator Carrick and his colleagues, by using the feeble, transparent and phoney device of calling these people information officers, to expect honourable senators to consider them as anything other than Press secretaries. However, we have been told repeatedly that these people are not Press secretaries and that their role is divorced from the Liberal Party and from the political functions of the various Ministers. When the Government Information Unit was set up, I suggest that its nature was obvious to anyone close to the scene. Newspaper articles at the time were pointing out that it was a Liberal Party propaganda operation. The people who were appointed to it were ex-Liberal Party functionaries. They were well-known Liberal Party supporters, like Mr Montgomery and Mr Power who were well known for their beliefs and who had been party activists before. </PARA>
<PARA> In Tasmania the situation was probably more obvious than in most States. It is a small State. People in the media know each other and people in politics know people in the media. It was perfectly obvious from the time that the information officer was appointed in Launceston and housed in Mr Newman's office that he was acting as a Press secretary in every way. He spent his time chasing the local Press. He produced tape recordings of party political statements for supply to local radio stations before, during and after the election. In fact, when one talked to members of the local media they frequently complained of the number of times that Mr Montgomery was coming around pushing the political barrow of Mr Newman. He has now transferred to Hobart to assist Mr Hodgman. One thing that has not been brought out in the debate today is that he is now to be given an assistant who will assist Mr Newman and who will act as Mr Newman's Press secretary in every way. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is important to look at what the senior person in the Government Information Unit said this morning in an interview on the program AM. He said that he thought that Mr Dawkins, who yesterday apparently had said that these people were permanent public servants, was wrong. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> In fact we are Ministerial staff. This means we do not have permanency of tenure and we're seen by the public service in exactly the same way as a Press Secretary would. Now the presence of a Ministerial Press Secretary at a meeting with Liberal Party officials on certain occasions would not be considered out of place and that's precisely the role that we were playing. </PARA>
<PARA>He was asked:</PARA>
<PARA> So, the Unit's role is not simply providing the public with the information about the function and activities of Government or to explain to the public a government policy. It is in fact a political organisation involved in electioneering as well?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Matthews said:</PARA>
<PARA> Well what is politics? Anyone concerned with Government is in politics . . . We are the same as Press Secretaries . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Later, when asked whether members of the Unit had any contact with the Liberal Party Secretariat or Tony Eggleton during the election campaign-that is something which plainly happened, as was demonstrated by Senator Button in his reading of the document this morning-he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Not directly. We were based in Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . we simply carried out a media monitoring function in advising Ministers of what was in the media. A purely reasonable Press Secretary role. </PARA>
<PARA>These people obviously saw themselves as Press secretaries. They were obviously used during the election campaign, as Senator Button has demonstrated, in close liaison with the Liberal Party. They were used as a monitoring unit to assist the Liberal Party in its election campaign. In everything but name they were Press secretaries, and even when questioned they considered themselves to be Press secretaries. </PARA>
<PARA> What was the Unit originally supposed to do? When the co-ordinating officers were first appointed, I asked Senator Chaney, as Minister representing the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman), what they were supposed to do. We got from Senator Chaney an answer that was quite different in some ways from the answers that have since been given by Mr Newman and others. We were told that they were to keep the Government in touch with public reaction to government policies and programs, a function that I thought-I said it at the time-should have been reasonably a function of members of parliament, senators and members of the House of Representatives. There was no need for a highly paid journalist to do this. Secondly, we were told it was to ensure the best possible communications and understanding between the Commonwealth and State governments. Surely that is the role of senior public servants and of members of parliament in liaison with their State colleagues. I said at the time, and we knew at the time, that these were not the roles of the journalists, that these people in fact were intended to be public relations officers and Press secretaries; and that is the role they have played. That is the role that Senator Carrick has denied repeatedly in this place that they have played. That is the reason for the censure motion moved by Senator Button. </PARA>
<PARA> Further disturbing aspects of this case have come out since the fuss has arisen. As honourable senators are aware, and as Senator Button has mentioned, we have in this place the Parliamentary Library. It is an excellent library which is made available to members, including Ministers and their staffs, for assistance in the course of their parliamentary duties. The duty statement of Library staff says 'parliamentary duties only'. The Library is not there to help with private concerns. It is not there to help political parties push their own political propaganda. It is certainly not there to get a Minister's personal image across to the public. It is not there to assist with the dissemination of government propaganda and party political propaganda. Yet we know-no one on the Government side can deny this-that officers of the Government Information Unit have made repeated requests to the Current Information Section and the reference service of the Library and, I believe, the Legislative Research Service. Those requests have been made by people on the grounds that they were on the staffs of Government Ministers, particularly Sir Phillip Lynch. They have misrepresented themselves to the Parliamentary Library and they have taken up the time of the Parliamentary Library, they have made it more difficult for members of parliament to use the Parliamentary Library and they have put an extra stress on the staff. If nothing else comes out of this censure motion, that sort of practice should stop. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no need to go on at great length on this matter in this place. Senator Button has demonstrated at length, with carefully documented evidence from Hansard and from the Liberal Party documents we have received, that these people operate as Press secretaries. He has demonstrated quite clearly that this Unit, paid for by the taxpayer and purported to be a Unit which puts out information about government activities, has worked in close liaison with the Liberal Party, and, indeed, worked in close liaison with the Liberal Party on a daily basis during the last election. It is quite clear from the Minister's answer to Senator Button on 31 March 1981 and his repeated denials to this House that Mr Laurie Power in particular, but co-ordinating officers in general, were in fact working as Press secretaries for Ministers, and were working in close liaison with the Liberal Party. He has had time to find out the truth of the matter and has had an opportunity to deny those allegations. He has not done so. He did not even do so satisfactorily today. For that reason this censure motion is justified. For that reason this censure motion should be supported. I support it. </PARA>

We naturally deplore the plain use of this Unit for what at best- I emphasise at best-could be called quasi-political purposes. I use that term because in the very nature of present day politics where can one draw the sort of line that I think we are attempting to draw in the Senate today?

That of course is true.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have listened carefully to what Senator Carrick has said in this place over the last few days. Our impression is that every utterance he has made on this point-a sort of convenient blurring of role-supports more or less what I have said; that is, that this is a grey area. It is a grey area because the Government designed it as such. Therefore, the Government is culpable to that extent. We do not disguise our contempt for it for that culpability. The extent to which it involves the Minister in this case is something I will come to later. But let me make that point quite clear at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, that blurring of role was changed by the Minister only on 31 March last when he interjected and said that it was not true that GIU members were engaged in political activity. That was an interjection made on the spur of the moment. I think we have to consider whether in fact the Minister genuinely believed at that time what he said was so. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this motion is to censure him, not to do all the other things mentioned. I will try to address myself to that. We make two points about GIU. I think they are very relevant. In the first place, the Government should either disband this Unit and attach its people honestly as Press officers on the staff of Ministers and not try to get away with this stupid dissimulation that it is trying to get away with, or it should allow the GIU to make its services freely and impartially available to shadow Ministers in the Opposition, including, I might say, the Democrats.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator MacGibbon laughs at that. I take it from the expression on his face that he believes it is perfectly all right to have other than those two situations. In other words, is he saying that it is perfectly all right for the GIU to work overtly for the Government at election time? The honourable senator should take these things a little more seriously. I reiterate the two points for Senator MacGibbon's benefit: The Government should either disband the Unit and attach its people to Ministers honestly, so we know where we are, or it should make the Unit completely apolitical in the sense that its services are available to other areas of this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have listened carefully to what Senator Button has said. Unfortunately, the Australian Labor Party-we wish it could have done better in this respect-did not do us the courtesy of making the material available to us before it moved this motion, although it did warn us that it might happen and it has given us the information since. That made it a little difficult for us to assess the matter at short notice, and I would like to record that. I would like to speak next about the apparent role of the Unit as disclosed by this information. The Minister has cast some doubts on whether this material is genuine. Senator Carrick, when he first started to speak, made some noises as if he thought it was not genuine, but he has not been very explicit about it. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YJ7">Senator MASON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That clarifies that point. But it returns us to the main point. I do not think there is any serious suggestion from the Government that this material is not genuine. If so, we would like to know about it. I take it from the silence that there is no doubt about that. As a result of that, we see a reason to indict the Liberal Party absolutely and in every possible respect for its dirty tricks, its dirty tactics and its cynical and dishonest exploitation of taxpayers' money which have now been revealed by this matter. To the Australian Democrats that is far more important than whether a Minister should be censured, because it is the behaviour, ethics and morality of the entire political party which represents a substantial part of the Government which we are now considering. An honourable senator mentioned that Sir Robert Menzies might turn in his grave. I would say that any honest Liberal Party politician or any other honest politician from the past would certainly do so at these revelations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have watched this situation. We are aware of the way in which the Government sneaked in to abolish section 16 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act to its own advantage at a carefully planned time when it knew there was a Press strike on so that its action would not be known to the Australian people. Large numbers of the Australian people still do not know that that happened. That was due, of course, to the sneakiness of the Government in its desire to get electoral advantage in 1980 in every possible way. Indeed, the tactics emerged, including the abolition of that section of the Electoral Act, various other things we have discussed previously and the quite unwarranted attacks on the Australian Democrats. The allegations about our being allied with the Labor Party were denied in the eastern States when they were raised against Senator Chipp and me. The Government dropped them here and then, a few days before the election, it spent $400,000 in Western Australia when it knew it was too late to deny the allegations. That is how the Government won the last Western Australian Senate seat, and let that not be forgotten. This matter we are discussing--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YJ7">Senator MASON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, I hope the Government is. I hope he does the Government credit. Let it be said and clearly understood that the 1980 Federal election was Australia's dirtiest election to date. We have discussed whether the documents are genuine. Did Senator Carrick know about them? We are not impressed by Senator Carrick's garbage tip ploy. It is not good enough. It is quite irrelevant. If the Liberal Party did these things, it is absolutely essential that we, the members of this Parliament, and the public of Australia should know the full revelations. It does not really matter very much where they come from. I again mention the relevance of this to what we were discussing last night-freedom of information. Honourable senators opposite have created the climate, as I said last night, in which things fall off the backs of trucks, in which journalists have to resort to leaks and in which things have to come out in this way. So do not be surprised. As I said last night, there will be more and more of it. Are honourable senators opposite surprised that that is beginning to happen already?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We believe that Senator Carrick has been less than clear and frank in his answers here and we would castigate him only to that extent, although I must say again that the blurring of roles here makes it very difficult to be completely explicit. There is involved a subjective judgment of what is political and what is not political during an election campaign. I do not want in any way to pull any punches in our condemnation of the Liberal Party-that is absolute-nor do I want to qualify in any way that our belief is that the Unit should be disbanded or otherwise made apolitical. But we accept the assurances the Minister has given that he did not know of these documents and that he believed that the Unit--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Leader of the Opposition, Senator Button, has moved the most serious motion that can be moved in this Senate in relation to an honourable senator. The terms of the motion are:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate censures the Leader of the Government in the Senate for persistently misleading the Senate as to the nature and activities of the Government Information Unit. </PARA>
<PARA>The nature of the charge against Senator Carrick is contained in the phrase 'persistently misleading the Senate'. I would have thought that there was upon any honourable senator who makes that charge against another senator the highest responsibility to do so with the strongest evidence and with the strongest conviction that he was justified in taking that step. That step is justified, and the Senate should support such an expression of opinion, only if the Senate is satisfied that the Leader of the Government in the Senate, or any other honourable senator against whom such a motion is brought, did deliberately and intentionally mislead the Senate. But it is alleged against Senator Carrick that he not only misled the Senate but also that he persistently misled the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> The way in which this debate has gone, and indeed some of the things that Senator Button said in moving the motion, make it quite clear that the purpose of moving the motion here this morning was only very slightly related to Senator Carrick at a personal level or to any allegations that he was responsible for misleading the Senate. The purposes of members of the Opposition are really otherwise, although they may be somewhat confused. The Opposition seemed at one point to be condemning the existence of the Government Information Unit, which has been in existence for some considerable time and about which a number of questions have been asked and information has been provided. In another place yesterday the Opposition raised the issue in that form and did not seek to raise it in the form of a censure motion against a Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Another theme has been running through this debate; that is, the activities of members of the Government Information Unit during the election campaign and whether they were engaged in party political activities in association with the Liberal Party in that election campaign. That is another issue altogether. That issue is completely different from the existence of the Unit or from whether Senator Carrick misled the Senate. That seems to have been the basis for introducing the documents which the Australian Labor Party quite openly and proudly introduced despite the way in which they may have been obtained; and we do not know whether they are even accurate documents. The Opposition has not provided us with any evidence and has made no attempt to prove that they are accurate documents. They may be accurate, they may not be. Those documents were introduced into this debate not to attack the existence of the Unit but to attack the way in which some members of the Unit are alleged to have operated during the last election campaign. That is an entirely different issue. Other matters have been introduced into the debate about the dirty tricks of some members of the Liberal Party, of the Government, or of officials during the campaign. That is another quite irrelevant issue. </PARA>
<PARA> I want the Senate to come back to the real issue, which was identified by Senator Chipp very early in this debate. I think he adopted an unusual tactic to elicit the point of the debate, but it was a very valuable intervention he made to elicit what is the one and only real point in this debate. I am desperately disappointed in the attitude that has been taken by the Opposition, its Leader and its Deputy Leader in making these highly serious imputations upon Senator Carrick when really their purposes were otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA> Introducing the motion, Senator Button indicated, I thought in a somewhat apologetic way, that this motion was directed at Senator Carrick. He said something about Senator Carrick being selected because he was the spokesman for the Government on this issue. It is quite unjustified to use the procedures, the Standing Orders, and the conventions of the Senate as a vehicle for a motion censuring a Minister. It is not a motion censuring the Government, it is a motion censuring the Minister. They are not the same; there is a fundamental difference, and Senator Chipp put his finger on it very clearly. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a fundamental difference between a motion censuring the Government and a motion censuring a Minister. If the Opposition had wanted to raise the issue of the Government Information Unit or if it had wanted to raise the issue of the activities of members of this Unit, the proper course was to put down a motion which attacked the Government and alleged the Government's responsibility for these matters. But it has brought this motion-this is what I want the Senate to come back to and to focus on-against the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has made a serious charge against Senator Carrick, and it has not established any proof whatever against him. The issue is simply and solely-this is the point which I said was earlier identified very clearly by Senator Chipp-whether the Senate is to believe that Senator Carrick, when he made that statement, believed that statement to be true. That is the only possible issue of substance in the exercise that has been going on here today at great length. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Carrick has made very clear and very correct statements about the situation of Mr Power and his position as information officer attached to Senator Carrick's staff. He made it clear that Mr Power is not his Press secretary. Indeed, that is all perfectly clear and, I think, well established. These officers are attached to the office of a Minister but they are not Ministers' personal Press secretaries. Senator Carrick has given figures on the statements he has issued since he has been the Minister for National Development and Energy. Of approximately 144 Press statements, only eight were issued by Mr Power. As I have said, the issue is in relation to an interjection Senator Carrick made when Senator Button said that during the last election campaign the members of the Unit were engaged in electioneering for the Liberal Party. Senator Carrick interjected and said: 'That is not true.' Senator Carrick has clearly stated what he understood to be the role of Mr Power, the person attached to him, in the election campaign. He specifically instructed Mr Power as to what his role should be and what he understood to be his responsibility for Mr Power's work. Senator Carrick has made perfectly clear what his understanding of this role was. He has quoted from the documents which show what that role was. </PARA>
<PARA> I challenge anyone in the Senate to assert honestly, and vote accordingly, that he does not believe what Senator Carrick said in the Senate today in relation to this issue. I believe that it is a misuse of the Senate to bring this most serious censure motion in relation to Senator Carrick personally on issues which the Opposition wants to raise on other matters. Let the members of the Opposition raise those matters and let them be debated, but they should not raise them as a censure motion of Senator Carrick. I believe that this motion is hypocritical, misdirected and unjustified. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Mr President, I claim to have been misrepresented. During the debate on the censure motion earlier today Senator Carrick said something to the effect that it was all right for Morrison and Sibraa to be on the government payroll when they were endorsed Australian Labor Party candidates. That is the way my staff took it down and that is the understanding that people on this side of the chamber have. As a matter of fact, it was mentioned by my colleague Senator Grimes, the Deputy Leader of the Australian Labor Party, that Senator Carrick had said that both Morrison and I as endorsed Labor candidates, had been on the government payroll. I advise the Senate that when I was elected to this place in 1975 I was the Assistant Secretary of the Labor Party in New South Wales. It paid my salary. I worked as Assistant Secretary during the campaign. It was the members of the Labor Party who paid my salary during that campaign.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When I was defeated in 1977 I occupied my seat in the Senate until 30 June 1978. From that date, 30 June 1978, until I was selected by the New South Wales Parliament to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of Senator James McClelland, I was not working; I was unemployed. As a matter of fact, I was being interviewed for a number of positions when the vacancy occurred. The only other time I was an endorsed Labor candidate was in 1966 and that was for the House of Representatives seat of Wentworth. At the time I was a local government official and I took annual leave for the duration of the campaign. At no time have I ever been on the Commonwealth Government's payroll, including the time when I was an endorsed candidate. </PARA>
<PARA> Bill Morrison was appointed by me and was responsible to me and worked out of my office. I have never tried to hide that fact. I repeat: At no time have I been on the Commonwealth Government payroll, as an endorsed candidate or otherwise. I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Carrick) to acknowledge that fact and to apologise. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I have so moved first of all because of the obvious fact that here we have an annual report for 1978-79 being brought down in 1981. This situation has recurred almost every year since the report became necessary. The introduction to the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> This report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of section 76A of the National Health Act which provides:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) The Permanent Head shall, as soon as practicable after 30 June in each year, commencing with the year 1971, furnish to the Minister a report on the operation of registered organizations during the year ending on that date. </PARA>
<PARA>Apparently, to bring down a report for the year 1978-79 in April 1981 is to furnish it as soon as practicable. There are several things of interest in the report. The problem is that the report is so much out of date. Of course, one thing that is of interest to honourable senators on this side of the chamber, particularly those from Tasmania, is the fact that the report contains a list of funds which went out of existence in 1978-79. Only one of those funds-I believe that it was the Hibernian Medical and Hospital Benefits Fund in Queensland-was subject to court proceedings, but in all the other cases difficulties and obviously some anxieties were expressed by people who were caught up in the collapse of funds. Since then we have had the collapse of a very large fund in Tasmania-the Druids Hospital and Medical Benefits Fund-with the result that doctors, patients and, in some cases, hospitals have found themselves in financial difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> We asked questions about the funds last year. We asked why they were not better monitored. We asked why we and members of those funds could not have some foreknowledge of why the funds were collapsing or even of the fact that they were going to collapse. We were assured in the Estimates committees by Mr Carroll that there had been a tremendous improvement in the provision of timely and adequate information coming from the health and secured funds. Despite that reassurance we have this report coming down so long after the episodes which occurred in this case. I suppose that the next report will be equally delayed. We seek some assurances that some action will be taken to make sure that the reports are not so delayed. </PARA>
<PARA> Only last Thursday the Auditor-General's report was presented in the Senate. It contained a complaint that the collapsed registered medical fund in Tasmania-Druids-had not responded adequately to requests by the Department for the provision of information. The Auditor-General sent a circular to all organisations asking for a more intensive program of reviews of the operations of the funds. It is regrettable that the annual report on the operations of these important registered medical and hospital benefits organisations-organisations which can exist only when they are licensed by the Commonwealth Government to do so-comes down when its information is so much out of date. We would like to know why the ninth report for the year 1978-79 was presented to the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) only in March 1981-about 15 months later than most annual reports are presented to this place. There is no explanation in the report of why it has been delayed. The only thing stated in the report is that the report should be presented as soon as practicable. If this is as soon as is practicable, surely the Senate should know why. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing that makes this report out of date is that it gives details of changes to the health insurance scheme in 1978. But these changes were rendered out of date by the 1979 Government changes. The financial and accounting base on which the funds were then operating was also changed. The report is so delayed and so out of date as to be of interest only to historians. It provides the minimum of information which is required under the National Health Act. The accounts are there and the abstract of assets is there, but there is no analysis of fund membership and no real analysis of the problems facing funds. There is insufficient information in what should be the companion volume to this document-the annual report of the Department of Health. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are to have a proper oversight of our health insurance scheme, if we are to have some sort of confidence in our private health insurance funds, if the Commonwealth and the Parliament are to have a proper oversight of the functioning of these funds and their general operations, we really ought to receive a report on their operations less than 21 months after the end of the financial year. The funds are required to provide information to the Department of Health. Clearly, they do so only after considerable delay and considerable effort by the Department. The Auditor-General had to send out his own investigators to find out how the funds were financially situated, because the Department of Health, not having the returns, did not know. The simple fact is that the Minister for Health has the power to require that this information be given and be given promptly. The officers of the Department of Health have the power to follow up and to make sure that the health funds registered under the National Health Act play the game and play it properly. There has been a remarkable reluctance by either the Minister or the officers of the Department to put pressure on the funds in order to find out what is going on. I am afraid that until the Government and the Department of Health know what is going on the clients of the funds will be at risk, as were the unfortunate clients of the Druids health fund in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> We point out that the report is late, skimpy and of interest largely to historians only. I believe that it is essential that in future a report should be brought down on time each year. I hope that at a later date we can have an answer from the Minister as to why the present set of circumstances exists. For that reason I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to speak very briefly on an aspect of the report which concerns the Anglo-Australian telescope at Siding Springs which, as honourable senators would know, is one of the largest astronomical instruments in the world, a device truly designed to explore the furthest possible limits of space. When we-that is, the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment to which I have the honour to belong-visited that telescope on 14 and 15 June 1979, considerable problems occurred with the telescope due to the temperature differential between the air inside and outside the dome. Whilst this may seem a rather technical point, it was more than that because in fact it meant that this instrument, which has been built at huge cost, was not able to operate at its full potential and, after all, its principal value is at its full potential. It had been reduced to the performance level of a lesser instrument because of air perturbations within the dome. I understand from inquiries that large fans have been installed now to bring the outside air into the dome before opening the aperture and also very large fans have been fitted into the aluminising room where mirrors are plated; thus a lot of the problems have been overcome. </PARA>
<PARA> But, I think there is a lesson to be learnt from that, and I would hope that it has been learnt. It would appear that these aspects were originally designed into the observatory but they were removed at some stage during its construction on a cost cutting principle. I think that this is as good an example as any to bring forward to show how this kind of cost cutting which may appear simple and easy can have profound implications for the total investment concerned. I raise the matter now partly because of its intrinsic merit. We did have a situation whereby for many nights of the year this large, expensive instrument did not have the opportunity of working to its full potential. I am pleased to congratulate the Government and whoever has been concerned in seeing that that situation has been remedied. I think that is good. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I make the point that the observatory is now going through a fairly large period of expansion in the laboratories at Coonabarabran, as is the associate one at Epping, with the instalation of some rather sophisticated computers. I believe that there again there may be some kind of staff strains. I exhort the Government at this stage to look at this matter and to ensure that we do not have a situation again where somebody-perhaps someone in the Public Service Board or an accountant-says, 'You can't have this and you can't have that', thereby perhaps hindering the valuable work going on at that place. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to point out to the Senate that on page 15 of the report mention is made of government assistance to the manufacturers of tobacco. For example, it is stated that domestic manufacture of cut tobacco is assisted through the rates of duty and that provision is made for funds for domestic manufacturers. On page 17 of the report there is a section which points out that assistance is given to tobacco growing. </PARA>

<PARA> Was the campaign designed to alert people to the dangers of smoking-related diseases, the most serious preventable health care problem in Australia?</PARA>
<PARA>In reply, the Minister pointed out that the Government had contributed $260,000 towards a campaign to instruct people on health care, and that smoking would come into this. The Minister went on to say that last year the Government had committed $500,000 to health care and had committed itself to a further $500,000 for the same purpose. I just wonder what the Government's attitude to this problem really is and where we are really going. On the one hand we wish to assist the tobacco growers and on the other hand we are spending money to promote a health campaign against smoking. I wonder whether the Minister representing the Minister for Health, Senator Peter Baume, could explain sometime the attitude of the Government towards the campaign for health care and anti-smoking on the one hand and the assistance to tobacco growers and manufacturers on the other hand. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -What is hinted at in the Industries Assistance Commission report on manufactured tobacco and what tumbles out of the transcript of the public hearings of this inquiry, for anyone who wants to look at it, is that this was an exercise in applying a veneer of probity to one of the shady backroom deals for which the Fraser Government is gaining richly deserved notoriety.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The circumstances which led to this report are that, after many years of extremely high levels of protection estimated by the IAC in the report to equal $20,000 per tobacco grower, the tobacco growers were faced with a market which was shrinking absolutely. Given that the proportion of Australian leaf as a component of tobacco manufactured in Australia is not likely to increase despite the protective arrangements, the Australian tobacco producers were therefore faced with an absolute market decline and, therefore, commensurate reductions in quotas. This led them to seek means of enlarging the captive market granted to them by the existing arrangements. One way in which it was being by-passed was that already manufactured tobacco imported into Australia was not subject to the protective arrangements which comprise about 5 per cent of the market and involved principally Douwe Egbert tobacco. </PARA>
<PARA> What the National Country Party wanted was a back door arrangement to force imports of manufactured tobacco within the captive market mechanism. The problem was the Industries Assistance Commission Act. The IAC was established in the first place to guard against this sort of practice. That is why its establishment was fought so strenuously by the National Country Party. It was established to prevent, amongst other things, that sort of shady back room deal being done without anyone being aware of it. Confronted with the existence of the IAC Act the Government was obliged to send a loaded reference. Quite clearly it is regarded by the IAC as being a loaded reference. I shall not read it in full. It can be found in Appendix 1 to the Industries Assistance Commission report on manufactured tobacco. I will precise the reference. The Commission was asked to ascertain the level of assistance required to facilitate the use of Australian grown tobacco leaf in place of manufactured tobacco imports. Page 33 of the Commission's report reads:</PARA>

<PARA> (i) a mechanism has to be found to facilitate the increased purchase of Australian leaf, by altering the rates of duty applying to sub-item 24.02.9 in the Customs Tariff;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) purchases should be at prices maintained by the Australian Tobacco Board's Grade and Minimum Price Schedule; and that</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) the policy includes importers within the term 'suppliers';</PARA>
<PARA>then this could be most appropriately achieved by the introduction of a concessional duty for imports of manufactured cut tobacco, contingent upon purchases of Australian leaf, along the lines outlined in Section 6.1.4. </PARA>
<PARA>The critical paragraph reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission is not prepared to recommend adoption of this mechanism. On the basis of the evidence received, this would appear to be incompatible with the policy guidelines under Section 22 of the Industries Assistance Commission Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission proposes that the assistance afforded the tobacco growing and manufacturing industries be reviewed by the Commission as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA>In the official Press release that accompanied the public release of this report there was no hint that the Commission was not prepared to recommend the extension to imported manufactured tobacco of the arrangements which apply to Australian manufactured tobacco. However, in spite of that the Government went ahead, which it is legally entitled to do, and it will offer a rebate in the vicinity of $120 a kilogram on imports of manufactured tobacoo for each kilogram of Australian leaf purchased. Since the importers of tobacco have no use for Australian leaf inside Australia, and if the importers of manufactured tobacco are to operate under the scheme, the Australian leaf, which they are forced to purchase in order to obtain the rebate of duty paid on imports, will have to be re-exported. This provoked comments from the IAC. Page 29 of the report reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Tariff arrangements which encourage the use of Australian leaf have been bound in the GATT as part of the Multilateral Trade Negotiations to a limit of 50 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the legal limit at the moment; the proportion of Australian leaf used in Australian manufactured tobacco is 57 per cent. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Yet the industry has, by means of pressures not specified, induced the local manufacturers to voluntarily agree to absorb 57 per cent. It now seeks to have the same proportion imposed upon importers. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, the methods by which the tobacco growers seek to impose that requirement on importers amount to an export subsidy to induce further purchase of leaf at the high prices determined for local leaf. Such a subsidy appears to be contrary to the protocol on Export Subsidies adopted by the GATT as part of the Multilateral Trade Negotiations settlement-notably Article 10. </PARA>
<PARA>The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA>The principle of our trade policy which would be most affected would be Australia's opposition to subsidies paid to induce export of agricultural products by rich countries which, by world standards, are relatively inefficient. The Australian Government has consistently attacked such direct or indirect subsidies to agricultural production designed to place upon world markets output which cannot be absorbed locally. An export subsidy for Australian tobacco leaf would compromise the Australian position, which is of major importance for efficient industries. </PARA>
<PARA>It is predictable that this further breach of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade which the Australian Government has now accepted as policy was done at the behest of a National Country Party Minister. Of course, that fact has come out in evidence given before a Senate committee. Evidence was given on oath by the former Chairman of the Australian Dairy Corporation that in 1976 Mr Sinclair, as Minister for Primary Industry, sanctioned such a breach of GATT with respect to the export of the skim milk powder. To be fair one ought to add that a former public servant whose demeanour before the Committee was, to say the least, vague did not corroborate that evidence and another public servant, after a great deal of pressure had been applied, did implicitly corroborate that the Minister was not aware of it. That will be the subject of a discussion at some other time. </PARA>
<PARA> However, according to more recent reports the arrangements, which the Government has tried to make but which it has declined to acknowledge publicly or frankly, regarding the extension of the protective mechanism-that is, protective to producers of tobacco leaf-effectively to encompass imports of manufactured tobacco, may not succeed. Douwe Egbert, according to the latest information I have received, has declined to purchase any Australian leaf at auctions presumably because it believes the inducement, bribe, or whatever one likes to call it, offered by way of rebate of duty is insufficient incentive. </PARA>
<PARA> I think I should also put on record the fact that there is a serious problem in the Australian tobacco industry. The consumption of tobacco is declining absolutely. Anyone who takes a balanced and rational view of the whole area will agree that that is a good thing for the nation. This means that there are adjustment problems for Australian tobacco producers. I repeat what I have said in public both last year and the year before, namely, that Australian tobacco production ought to be concentrated in north Queensland instead of being spread around three States as it is now. It just so happens that both technically and economically tobacco production in north Queensland is more efficient than it is in any other tobacco growing area. I believe it is also true that there are fewer alternatives available to people growing tobacco at Mareeba and Dimbulah in north Queensland than there are to people currently producing tobacco in other parts of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Ultimately this problem must be faced. Adjustments will be imposed upon the Australian industry by a declining market and, if we are to show any common sense, Australian tobacco industry production will ultimately be concentrated in north Queensland. In the meantime the Government, having declined to face up to that problem or to offer any constructive policies as to how that objective could be achieved, is in a sleazy back door way sanctioning-this is being done by a government which preaches the virtues of small government-a complex arrangement which is wide open to malpractice and corruption, and it is sanctioning further breaches of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. This is most important. Because it is sanctioning further breaches of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade it is undermining its own moral position in its argument against the European Economic Community and is endangering the exports of a number of other Australian agricultural commodities. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the papers. </PARA>
<PARA>The report brought down by the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) is concerned with the physical conditions under which livestock are to be exported from Australia. That aspect of the matter was covered very comprehensively yesterday by my colleague, John Kerin, in the House of Representatives. If anyone is interested in the subject I refer him to that speech. The export of live sheep, of course, has been a controversial issue both with respect to the physical conditions under which the animals are held on board ship and of course on the question of whether the sheep ought to be exported at all. There has been a continuing public debate, if that is not too euphemisic a term, between the Liberal and National Country parties in particular and the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union over whether the trade ought to be permitted to continue at its present and immediately preceding level. </PARA>
<PARA> This issue was touched on by Mr Michael Baume in the House of Representatives on 5 March in the context of broader comments on a resources rent tax but his comments would be more accurately described as advocating a return to Tudor mercantilism. He was advocating that any new materials capable of further processing in Australia ought to have an export tax imposed on them. He called that a resources rent tax. For all sorts of technical reasons it is not a resources rent tax and it does not meet these objects of such a tax. In case anyone should be induced to believe that the Liberal Party is modernising its economic thinking I think it should be added that what Mr Baume calls a resources rent tax of course would be a resurrection of 16th century Tudor mercantilism. The Liberal Party has reached back even further for that economic inspiration than it did by way of John Stone and a few other people when it adopted monetarism as its current economic dogma. Mr Baume continued on this theme and said:</PARA>
<PARA> There should be, for example, an export levy placed on live animals, but there is no levy on meat being exported. Such a levy would encourage the maintenance of a thriving meat processing industry to the benefit of all Australians, particularly primary producers. Once again I declare my interest in that industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Baume is in fact a director of the meat processing and exporting firm Tancred Bros Pty Ltd. I guess that as well as having once been a partner of course in Patrick Partners, because of his association with Tancred's he would be well aware of the effect on the meat processing industry and the people employed in it of the current severe turndown in the numbers of livestock available for slaughter in Australia-particularly the numbers of cattle rather than sheep. The point I really want to make is the supreme irony of a Government member-the Government has in the most outraged tones for the last two or three years denounced the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union for daring to suggest that any impediment should be imposed on the export of live sheep from Australia and that there should be any interference with pure market forces-condemning the AMIEU for suggesting there should be any interference whatsoever with pure market forces in determining the level of live sheep exports. The proposition, although different in its form, has precisely the same object as the object of the AMIEU, which is to restrict the number of sheep and other livestock currently being exported from Australia. It was announced without any apparent embarrassment by a member of the Liberal Party, without attracting any squeals of outrage from members of his own party or members of the National Country Party. They are so forthright and so eager to condemn members of the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union who, whether they are ill-advised or otherwise, attempt as they see it to maintain their employment in the industry by placing some restrictions on the export of live sheep. It is an ironic situation. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am prepared to make an exception on occasions for chickens. On this occasion I make an exception for sheep as well. The matters raised by this report on the sea transport of sheep are not just of interest to farmers and meatworkers and those concerned with animal welfare, they are also of considerable interest to those concerned with honesty and openness in government. I refer in this respect to an item which appeared in the 19 March 1981 issue of the National Farmer and which was in the 'Waterbag' column of that paper. The article appeared under the heading 'Stormy wether'. It read as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The government has apparently ordered a swift bomb-disposal operation on a report which could have had an explosive effect on the live sheep industry. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year, with the animal welfare debate raging, Primary Industry Minister Nixon despatched a government vet to the Mideast on a live sheep carrier to monitor conditions on board. </PARA>
<PARA> The vet returned, his report went in-and promptly vanished. </PARA>
<PARA> Sources inside the Bureau of Animal Health insist it went to the Minister. The Minister's office denies having seen it. </PARA>
<PARA> But Waterbag has confirmed that all copies were promptly rounded up and pulped, while the allegedly strong, criticial and pointed recommendations are being 'readjusted' to a more palatable form. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue to Waterbag, reeks of stupidity and mishandling. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, if this report has any credence at all it would be very interesting indeed, to say the least, to have an explicit ministerial response to the allegations made in the article. It would be particularly interesting to know just how much of the report form the Government vet was in fact incorporated in the body of the report on the sea transport of sheep. I notice that on page 11 and subsequent pages of the report there is a reference to a study undertaken in October 1980 by Mr Meischke of the Bureau of Animal Health who made observations and measurements on a modern sheep carrier with 40,000 sheep. It may be that this is the gentleman whose report is the subject of the newspaper reference. If that is the case it would be interesting to know what was in the report, if this description of some of its comments is accurate. This description as far as it goes makes fairly unsavoury reading. I will add just one short illustration of that by referring to the passage headed 'Waste Control' which is a description of the findings of Mr Meischke. The passage states:</PARA>
<PARA> Great difficulty was experienced in waste control on this ship. The impervious pressed aluminium alloy or concrete floors drained through single 10 mm holes in each corner, which were nearly always blocked, and then through grates in the alleyways, which were frequently blocked. The result was that the wool of the sheep became contaminated and this raised atmospheric ammonia levels and humidity. Waste spilled over into food and water troughs below. Water spillage, feed spillage and, in certain areas of the ship, seaspray and rain, exacerbated the problems. </PARA>
<PARA>The report went on in respect of a number of other matters on this voyage which resulted, it is recorded, in a final mortality rate among the sheep in question of 1.5 per cent. It must be acknowledged that that is perhaps no higher a percentage than one would expect for any kind of transportation of animals over this distance and for this period. However, that figure is qualified by a further reference in this account of the report to the effect that true mortality figures were enormously difficult to establish because of the logistics involved in obtaining an accurate on-off count uncomplicated by other factors. I simply make the point that, if this is the report which was pulped in its original form and made to be rewritten in a more palatable and less potentially explosive form, it still raises some very serious questions as to what on earth was in the original report. On page 21 of the report it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Several other veterinarians have recently travelled with sheep to the Middle East. Their findings differ in emphasis from those made by Meischke but not in the overall picture. </PARA>
<PARA>So it is unclear, at least to me, whether the repressed report which is the subject of the National Farmer allegations was this Meischke report or whether, in fact, there are some other government veterinarian reports, at least one of which has been made subsequently to the Meischke expedition and which has been pulped and suppressed because of the unpalatability of its findings. I think these are important matters. They are of particular interest, as I have said, to people who are concerned with the operation of the industry generally. They are also of very obvious and immediate concern to the extremely large number of people in the community who, quite properly, are concerned with issues of animal welfare. I would suggest also that they are of an obvious kind of concern to that equally large and growing number of people in the community who are concerned with honesty and openness in government. I for one would very much appreciate an indication from the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner), who is in the chamber, that he will arrange for an investigation of the matters to which I have adverted, which clearly arise out of the contents of this report, and report to the Senate accordingly. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4L7">Senator McLAREN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have handled live chooks, too, over a period of 10 years. I am concerned mainly with what the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) said in the statement he put down yesterday in the House of Representatives and which we have not yet seen. The statement did not come down with the report in this chamber and I have to refer to yesterday's House of Representatives Hansard to see what the Minister said. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Commonwealth has the constitutional responsibility for animal exports. The Bureau of Animal Health co-ordinates and supervises this activity by delegating inspection and certification functions to State departments of agriculture. </PARA>
<PARA>Whilst this is a very comprehensive report, nothing was said yesterday in that statement by the Minister about the Department of Primary Industry overseeing the export of live horses. I have mentioned that matter at length in this chamber. Whilst the Department has carried out a study on the effects of the export of live sheep, I look forward to the day when a similar report is brought down in the Senate about what the Department has done in overviewing the export of live horses to Japan. From the Press reports and the interviews which have been conducted on This Day Tonight and other current affairs programs, there is conclusive proof that those animals have been severely mistreated. This report is entitled 'Sea Transport of Sheep'. In the section headed 'General Husbandry of Sheep During Transportation', under the sub-heading 'Purchase and Assembly in Australia' it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Although those directly engaged in the industry understand the cumulative effects of such activities, those engaged in single facets may not. For example, most stock transport in Australia is to single destinations. An owner of stock arranges for his livestock to be carried to a sale by a local carrier. The stock are sold and the new owner then becomes directly involved in their welfare. </PARA>
<PARA>The problem begins after the stock have been sold in the saleyards and loaded on road transports or even into railway trucks for transport either to an abattoir or to the sea-front for export. This is the area about which concern is being expressed by many people who are concerned with the welfare of animals. Those of us who use the roads in country areas know that one has only to travel behind these road transports to see the way that some sheep are crowded into transports. Before the sheep have travelled a very great distance a lot of the weaker ones are trampled by the stronger ones. Quite often, when the transport reaches its destination a lot of the sheep are dead or severely injured. I think that the Bureau of Animal Health should be supervising that sort of transport of live sheep as well as supervising the transport of live sheep by sea. That matter is of great concern to me and to many other people. Under the same heading to which I referred, the report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> All those engaged in the transport of sheep within Australia must be made aware of the special needs of sheep which are to be exported. </PARA>
<PARA>I would add to that the special needs of sheep which are transported within Australia for any purpose, when great care ought to be taken. Another heading in the report attracted my attention. On page 6 of this report, under the heading ' ''Shandying'' of Sheep' it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It is known that 'shandying' of sheep, i.e. mixing of sheep as to age, breed and origin, takes place and is accepted in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA>The shandying of sheep is not accepted by many of the people who have sheep for sale. I have been told by quite a few people who have sold sheep to buyers, supposedly for live export, that those sheep are drafted on the property. A certain percentage is drafted off the mob which is to be sold; the grower is paid at one price for X number of sheep for the live sheep market and at another price for sheep supposedly for local kill. After those sheep have been segregated and the price has been arrived at-on a basis of 30:20, or whatever, until 100 per cent is reached-the sheep are again mixed up and loaded on to transports. Many of the growers are very concerned that all those sheep are exported live so that the buyer, the in-between man, is the man who is making the enormous profit out of the sale. The grower is not being paid 100 per cent export price for all the sheep because the buyer claims a certain percentage are being exported live. This is something that the Bureau of Animal Health also ought to consider. Further on in the report, under the sub-heading 'Standards for Carriage of Sheep', it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Bureau of Animal Health in consultation with the States and industry, has issued 'Standards for the Carriage of Sheep by Sea' . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I hope that the Bureau will also issue standards for the carriage of sheep within Australia, no matter for what purpose they are being carried-whether for transport from one farm to another, from the farm to the abattoir, from the sale yards to the abattoir, or from the sale yards to the sea front. Whichever way livestock are carried, whether they be sheep, horses, donkeys or whatever, the Bureau of Animal Health should lay down standards for their carriage and should see that those standards are policed strictly. In that way people who have no concern at all for the welfare of livestock will not be able to abuse them just for monetary purposes. Having been a shearer for over 20 years, I have witnessed sheep being treated in a very callous manner in sheds which have not been built to care properly for sheep. They are crammed into pens, in some places there is not even a grating. I have shorn in many sheds where the sheep are crowded together on dirt floors, and honourable senators can imagine the state of those sheep. If there has been a dewy night the roof is dripping with dew in the morning and if the sheep have not been drained properly prior to shedding-this occurs also in the carriage of sheep to market-they are in a terrible mess and they suffer terribly overnight. The shearers also have had to suffer greatly the next day. In many cases they take a vote on the sheep and turn them out as being wet sheep even though the sheep have not been in a shower of rain, only the dew that has come off the roof. The sheep have been shedded in conditions which are highly unsatisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA> I could talk at great length about much of the cruelty to live sheep which I have seen, particularly ewes which are heavy in lamb. They are jammed into very confined spaces. It is all very well for people who talk about the export of live sheep to say that only old wethers are being exported. Much evidence has been provided to show that young sheep and young female sheep are being exported live to the Kuwait market and to other Middle East markets. This is of great concern to me. Senator Walsh made mention of the fact that the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union has shown some concern that great numbers of sheep are being exported live. The unionists point out that that is to the detriment of their livelihood. On the other hand the members of the union of which I have been a member since about 1935, the Australian Workers Union, benefit because the sheep have to be shorn before they are loaded for live export. So two unions are somewhat at a difference as to the effect which the export of live sheep has on their members' livelihood. </PARA>
<PARA> Be that as it may, I think what we must look at when we talk in terms of exporting live sheep is educating the buyers of live sheep in the overseas market in supervising the slaughter of those sheep in Australia under the conditions in which they want them slaughtered for those markets and in setting up properly equipped abattoirs in Australia so that the sheep can be slaughtered in Australia and so that no one in the Australian work force is losing a job or an income because the sheep are being exported live. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that I do hope that the Bureau of Animal Health takes the study mentioned in this report somewhat further, undertakes a study on the transport of live sheep in Australia and extends that even further to the export of live horses and cattle. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave -I present the report of the Australian Delegation to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development debate at the Council of Europe, held at Strasbourg, in September 1980. I was not a delegate at the meeting in Strasbourg. I was a delegate at the Inter-Parliamentary Union conference which was held in East Berlin last year. Dr Harry Edwards was the leader of that delegation, but due to the fact that there was an election forthcoming, he had to return to Australia. Australia was very ably represented by both Mr Bruce Graham and the Honourable C. K. Jones. In annex B of the report, the Honourable C. K. Jones made the following statement:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before concluding, I should like to repeat my concern about an issue I mentioned when attending this Council two years ago, namely, the process of preparation of OECD economic surveys, which we all know are based on information supplied by the national governments. The problem is that, at least in Australia, this national survey is accepted as being simply a mouthpiece for the Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA>I mention that because it has been mentioned in this chamber before. Indeed, the Honourable C. K. Jones quoted from the Australian Financial Review to support his argument in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA> The annual survey of the Australian economy, and economic policy, by the Secretariat of the Paris-based Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has become a regular occasion for self-congratulation by the Australian Government. For inevitably it gives a somewhat rosy picture of Australia's policy experience and prospects. This is not surprising, since the OECD has long since given up any attempt at giving an objective, independent evaluation of the Australian economy. It can be relied upon to faithfully reflect the Australian Treasury's views. </PARA>
<PARA>The reason I mention that is that the Secretary-General of the OECD, Mr Emile Van Lennep, in annex C, picked up that point. In defence of the OECD he said:</PARA>
<PARA> I regretted that Mr Jones reiterated the criticisms of the independent judgment of the Secretariat of OECD. It is difficult for me to accept such comment. It would have been more helpful to have been confronted with facts and with analysis of what the defects are. Mr Jones told us that the OECD Secretariat goes to Australia and talks only with the Government and the political party in power. Let me state the facts about the visits of the last two missions of the Secretariat to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The first of these two saw, apart from the government departments, the Australian Employers' Federation and the Australian Council of Trade Unions. The mission made appointments with the Leader of the Opposition in parliament and with the Opposition spokesman on Treasury affairs. Both gentlemen, for reasons that were never clear, cancelled those appointments, to our regret. </PARA>
<PARA> The second mission, a year later, again saw government departments-as OECD missions do in all countries they visit-and apart from that made a tremendous effort to obtain other views, through visits to the Melbourne Economic Institute, to the Monetary Group at Monash University, and to the Institute of Labour Studies at Flinders University. </PARA>
<PARA> I can assure Mr Jones and, as far as necessary, others, that the OECD Secretariat also has the ability to read and to follow very carefully the development of views expressed in individual countries, and it also reads newspapers. </PARA>

Perhaps I should quickly mention the subject matters which engaged the attention of the speakers in the plenary sessions. There was a discussion on current threats to international peace and security, led by India. There was a discussion on the Brandt report; international collaboration in combating drugs, 'the Law of the Sea', and the subject which engaged the attention of most people 'Africa South of the Sahara: The Beginning of a New Era'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable senators will recall that when the delegation had reached Lusaka it had reached a peaceful country adjoining another peaceful country; and every delegate to the conference was very pleased with the result of the Rhodesian settlement, which had been supported by the Australian Government and by the Australian Parliament. As a result of that settlement a very well known and educated African, Mr Mugabe, had been installed as Prime Minister of Zimbabwe. At that time he seemed to be a successful Prime Minister and since that time has established control over his country to such an extent that our Government in particular has donated over $20m in aid to Zimbabwe and the United Kingdom Government has promised about #100m in the next three years. </PARA>
<PARA> At the conference discussion took place as to what should be done about South Africa and about apartheid. The general tenor of the discussion was that the Commonwealth should proceed with the sort of role which we have come to accept. I only want to say that in my opinion the procedures that have been adopted by the Commonwealth-negotiation and discussion-including the pressures which heads of government can apply in important circumstances, prove that the Commonwealth is still a useful organisation. Of course, the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association plays an important role. However, the Australian Commonwealth branch proposed in New Zealand that to some extent procedures in the plenary sessions ought to be strengthened and that the Association should consider the adoption of recommendations and resolutions. It seemed to us from Australia that that procedure would strengthen the Association. I must confess that although we put that proposition before the conference, the executive opposed it in the plenary session. Many of the speakers at the conference asserted that such a procedure would not aid the Association but might wreck it and that dividing on motions or recommendations might be worse than retaining the present procedures. The Australian delegation was not convinced of that and argued for acceptance of its proposal. It still seems to me that the Australian Commonwealth branch and other branches of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association ought to be able to take a positive stand on this matter. The report contains a reference to this matter. Honourable senators will see that although we put our proposal in the strongest way, not only did the conference reject it but also, surprisingly some of our State branches did not agree with it. The Australian Commonwealth branch also put forward suggestions on how the panels should be composed, but they too were rejected. </PARA>
<PARA> I ought to say on behalf of the members of the delegation that we were in a very favourable position to see the change that had taken place in Zambia and in Zimbabwe as a result of the settlement in Zimbabwe. Both countries will develop more quickly than the situation in the early part of the war would have allowed. The settlement allowed us not only to travel within Zambia but also to make short visits to Zimbabwe. </PARA>
<PARA> On behalf of my colleagues in the delegation I acknowledge the assistance given to the delegation in particular by the then Acting High Commissioner, Michael Potts, and by an accompanying officer from the Department of Foreign Affairs, Sue Boyd, who not only gave valuable assistance in respect of arrangements but also knew the country and was able to guide and help the delegation. I commend the Australian High Commissioner in Zimbabwe, who also assisted the delegation. On behalf of those honourable senators and members who went further afield, I also thank the Australian High Commissioner in London, who was able to assist me and others in our program in the United Kingdom. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to make a point about aviation. This matter was raised by Senator Sibraa and me shortly after my return from the conference. Honourable senators might remember that in November Senator Sibraa and I asked why the Australian Government had prevented Qantas Airways Ltd from flying in and out of South Africa. The reasons have not yet been made public. </PARA>

<PARA> Mr Leslie also said Qantas was looking for new business and trying to overturn the Government ban on flights to South Africa. </PARA>

<PARA>In the week that that was reported the Government had approved three extra flights by South African Airways into Australia, which seems crazy to me in the aftermath of an important decision by Australia in respect of Zimbabwe and in view of the fact that our prestige and the interests of the Australian Parliament in that country and in surrounding countries had been recognised and reported upon by delegates to the conference of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. As Senator Sibraa said, if there are problems in flying into Johannesburg, there are other ways to fly into South Africa. I hope that soon the Government will consider not only what we are saying but also the request of Qantas in respect of this matter. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>I wish to respond, on behalf of the Government, to the report on Australia and ASEAN, the Association of South East Asian Nations, by the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, which was tabled in Parliament on 4 December 1980. The report was issued after a wide-ranging inquiry by the Committee during 1979 and 1980. The Committee heard evidence from many individuals and groups and the report covers the many issues involved in Australia's relations with ASEAN and the countries of ASEAN. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Committee and its members for their report and would not wish to let the opportunity pass without paying a tribute to Senator Peter Sim. I understand that this is the last of a distinguished series of reports the Committee has produced under his chairmanship. I believe all honourable senators will agree that the report owes much to his wide understanding of the relationship between Australians and the peoples of our neighbouring region. </PARA>
<PARA> The report on Australia's relations with ASEAN brings into focus a central concern of our foreign policy. Australia's long-standing ties with the individual countries of ASEAN have gained in significance since those five nations came together in a joint endeavour to work for the social and economic development, and the stability, of their region. Australia, as a close neighbour, is intimately affected by events there. Not only does the region include some of the world's most rapidly-growing economies, but changes occurring there have obvious political and strategic significance for us. Australia's national interest demands that we follow these changes closely, that we support ASEAN in meeting the challenges these changes pose and that we seek, consistent with our national interests, to influence the way in which these challenges are met. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee's report cautions against any attempt to categorise the relationship between Australia and ASEAN as in some way special. The Government agrees with this view. In fact, neither ASEAN nor Australia has sought to create an exclusive or special relationship. Australia and the ASEAN countries have global policies and obligations and a multiplicity of links with other countries which it is not desirable or intended to set aside. To harbour the belief that the ASEAN-Australia relationship is special would be to invite a potentially damaging complacency in the relationship. At the same time, there should be no doubt that the Australian Government continues to place a high priority on its relations with the countries of ASEAN and the Association itself. Vietnam's invasion of Kampuchea, with support from the Soviet Union, and the resultant problems which have flowed from that invasion, have served to underline a number of important politico-strategic concerns shared by Australia and the ASEAN countries. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1974 Australia became the first country to establish a dialogue relationship with ASEAN. Regular consultations are now held on political, economic and development issues and on a range of other matters. They have included one meeting at heads of government level-in 1977 when the Prime Minister met with his ASEAN counterparts in Kuala Lumpur. Meetings between the Australian Foreign Minister and his ASEAN counterparts are now an established practice and are a welcome and most valuable feature of the dialogue. The frequency of consultations between other Ministers of the ASEAN and Australian governments has also increased since 1977. </PARA>
<PARA> Consultations at the ministerial level are supplemented by regular contact between Australian and ASEAN officials in Canberra, in the ASEAN countries and in other centres such as the United Nations in New York. Consultations have been given form through the annual ASEAN-Australia Forum, a meeting of senior officials, which is scheduled to meet next in Canberra in April. Between Forum meetings, the ASEAN-Australia Consultative Meeting, AACM, established in 1978, brings Australian officials from twelve departments into regular consultation with the heads of the ASEAN diplomatic missions in Canberra. Matters of detail affecting our trading relations and our development co-operation programs are dealt with by special working groups under the AACM. This consultative machinery has proved an effective and practical way of enabling a continuous process of consultations on matters of interest and concern to the six countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government agrees with the Committee's recommendation that priority be given to developing policy-making processes to co-ordinate effectively the interdependent elements of domestic and foreign policies. The Government considers that the political and economic, foreign and domestic elements of Australian policy should continue to be treated as parts of our total policy towards ASEAN and not approached as entirely separate entities. As well, in formulating policy towards ASEAN, full account needs to be taken of Australia's important bilateral relations with the ASEAN countries. It is important that the practice of adequate consultation on policy matters affecting Australia's relations with ASEAN be continued. To provide a co-ordinated approach the Government in 1977 established the interdepartmental committee on ASEAN. I believe this machinery is working well. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government accepts the Committee's recommendation that consultative procedures in policy co-ordination should be broadened to promote close liaison with the non-governmental sector when the issues involve them. Some advance has been made in this area since evidence was presented to the Senate Committee. In practice the Government and departments maintain close contact with the business community and with business groups, including the bilateral business co-operation committees, chambers of commerce and similar bodies which link the Australian and ASEAN private sectors. In addition, officials provide briefings and seminars for individuals and groups in the Australian business community and these have resulted in a better understanding by government and business alike of matters arising in dealing with ASEAN. </PARA>
<PARA> To meet the growing demands of Australia-ASEAN relations, the Committee recommended that Australia's diplomatic missions in the region be provided with adequate staff and resources to ensure that Australia's policies are effectively implemented. Our posts in the ASEAN countries are regarded as having a high priority in claims on staffing and resources. At the same time, there is need to balance the requirements of our ASEAN posts with requirements elsewhere, such as those arising from the opening of new posts. Because of this, pressure points do exist. Staffing levels, both at our posts and in Canberra, are kept under constant review. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of economic relations, the Committee recommended that emphasis be given to developing economic policies as they are a key element in the relationship and serve both ASEAN and Australian long term interests. Efforts are already under way through consultations with the ASEAN countries, and through trade and investment development initiatives, to widen regional understanding of Australian economic policies. In July 1979 a joint trade commission was established with the Philippines and a joint trade committee with Thailand. These bodies, together with the AACM, provide useful and direct means for exchanges of information on matters of trade interest between Australia and the ASEAN countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee states that the development of economic policies should include careful explanation of Australia's position on tariffs, including domestic implications, commitment to tariff reductions and responsibilities to the Australian community. The Government's approach to industries assistance, which involves a commitment to lower and more stable tariff levels, was set out in the White Paper on manufacturing industry and endorsed by the Study Group on Structural Adjustment. This approach recognises the need to take into account the ability of the community to absorb change and the need to deal with short term problems. The ASEAN countries have been advised of the Government's approach to those matters and this practice will continue. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government notes the Committee's recommendation, in respect of trading relations, that the general approach to preferences should continue 'where it is practical and mutually beneficial'. It further notes the Committee's recommendation, on prospects for trade development, that Australia should continue to stress its commitment to a reduction of trade barriers on a reciprocal and non-preferential basis and intensify its efforts to achieve such reductions. Tariff preferences accorded to products of developing countries have been regarded as an important concession by those countries, including ASEAN. As a member of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade Australia has supported and participated in reciprocal and non-preferential reductions of trade barriers in the context of global trade negotiations such as the multilateral trade negotiations. Outside that framework, however, reductions in tariff occur in the context of reviews of industry assistance and are not dependent on reciprocity. To tie such reductions to reciprocity would in some instances involve maintaining barriers higher than economic prudence would justify. While opportunities for reciprocal reductions of trade barriers arise in the context of GATT negotiations, reciprocity is not required of developing countries in such rounds and, in the present global climate, demands for reciprocity from developing countries would not be well received. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has already taken action in the direction recommended by the Committee to encourage and support links between private sector organisations in Australia and ASEAN. The ASEAN-Australia Business Council was established in June 1980 and I note that the Committee acknowledges the initiatives the Government has taken to support the development of industry links with ASEAN. Co-operation with the ASEAN-Australia Business Council and the various business co-operation committees and chambers will be continued where appropriate as part of these initiatives. In the end success or failure will depend upon the independent efforts of business people but I can assure the Senate that, as a Government, we will do all we can to create, as far as possible, the conditions for success. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of data on trade flows, the Committee recommended that the Australian Government should give further consideration to providing more detailed statistics on the balance of payments with ASEAN countries, particularly to serve industry needs. Further progress has now been made on the review of regional balance of payments statistics mentioned in the letter from the Treasurer (Mr Howard) to Senator Sim and quoted on page 38 of the report. The Australian Statistician is now able to release broad statistics on the balance of payments with each ASEAN country, although he is unable at this time to release statistics at a detailed level. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee expressed support for the proposal that the Australian Government should post a labour attache to ASEAN. It is the Government's view that such an appointment is not required at this stage but that the matter should be kept under review. The Committee's recommendations that the relevance and significance of development assistance in Australia's relations with ASEAN and its member countries should be kept under review are consistent with Government policy. Bilateral development assistance to the ASEAN countries is kept continually under review through project and program reviews, and through direct consultation with recipient governments, aid co-ordination officials and the various international consultative organisations, such as the Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia-IGGI. The ASEAN-Australia Economic Co-operation Program-AAECP-which brings Australia and the ASEAN countries together in regional programs, is also continually reviewed through regular meetings of the AACM's special working groups on development co-operation and on trade and through the annual meetings of the ASEAN-Australia Forum. </PARA>
<PARA> In its conclusions and recommendations on immigration, the Committee stated that it is concerned that Australia is still seen as a European outpost in an Asian region. It recommended that the Government concentrate on projecting Australia's identity which is evolving through the changing structure of its society. The Committee also recommended the further development of immigration policy along the lines recently adopted, a humanitarian approach to the needs of refugees and the intensification of efforts to finalise the reunion in Australia of families from East Timor. </PARA>
<PARA> In general the Government accepts these recommendations. A substantial shift of opinion has taken place in ASEAN countries since Australia's restrictive immigration policies were changed. While Australia is still seen by some as excessively predisposed towards Europe, the view is less widely held than six or seven years ago. The understanding that many suitably qualified people are eligible to migrate to Australia is now more widespread as is recognition that Australia, while having close cultural and other ties with Europe, shares many of the preoccupations and interests of the ASEAN countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Personal contracts are indispensible as a basis of understanding between countries. The Government agrees with the Committee that student exchanges and migration from the ASEAN countries play an important role in building this understanding, and in removing any impression that Australia remains a European outpost in an Asian region. Changes to our private overseas student policy have recently led to the introduction of new arrangements whereby a greater number of such students will be able to enter Australia for long term study. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the report was drafted, Australia has maintained its resettlement and humanitarian support of Indo-Chinese refugees and its efforts to complete the East Timor family reunion program. The Australian Government has contributed some $30m to Indo-Chinese refugee and related programs overseas, with further substantial private contributions from Australian citizens. We have accepted some 47,000 Indo-Chinese refugees, most of them from ASEAN countries of first asylum. Upwards of one in every 310 persons in Australia is an Indo-Chinese refugee and community groups have backed and supported the Government's efforts. In addition to its vital humanitarian contribution, the Government's Indo-Chinese refugee program has been a postive factor in Australia's co-operation with ASEAN. </PARA>
<PARA> In line with the Committee's recommendation, the Government is engaged in a co-operative effort with the ASEAN countries to stem the flow of illegal narcotics through the region. The Government agrees strongly with the recommendation that everything possible should be done to prevent the incalculable damage which could be done to the fabric of our societies by the spread of narcotics, and has recently devoted increased resources to this area. </PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the news media, the Committee urged continuing efforts to ensure information flows between Australia and the ASEAN countries and recommended that the Government initiate further discussions with the Indonesian authorities to ensure that Radio Australia has a correspondent in Indonesia. The Government considers that the Committee's comments on these matters touch on significant aspects of the relationship between Australia and the ASEAN countries. We recognise the importance of encouraging informed and balanced coverage of developments in the region by the Australian Press and support the Committee's view that the ASEAN countries should be encouraged to establish media representation in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that Radio Australia has an important place in expanding perceptions of Australia in the region and awaits with interest the report of the Committee of Review of the Australian Broadcasting Commission which has considered Radio Australia's operations. We are aware of objections within the Indonesian Government to aspects of Radio Australia's broadcasts. Contracts between the Australian Broadcasting Commission and the Indonesian authorities aimed at securing the return of an ABC correspondent to Jakarta have taken place. I hope that these will be successful. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government notes the Committee's support for the establishment of an Asian studies council, a proposal put forward in a report prepared by the Asian Studies Association of Australia. Government departments are already examining the report and the Government's views on it will be made known later in the year. In the meantime, my colleague, the Minister for Education (Mr Fife), has asked the Tertiary Education Commission to take account of the report in preparing volume I of its report for the 1982-84 triennium. On education and cultural relations the Government accepts the Committee's recommendation that every effort be made to meet requests from the ASEAN countries for assistance in education, particularly in the teaching of English. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia already supports a number of projects in the ASEAN countries related to education. These include bilateral aid projects, support for the South-East Asian Ministers for Education Organisation, SEAMEO, for the activities of the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee under the Australian-Asian Universities Co-operation Scheme, AAUCS, and for the ASEAN Education Development Project under the ASEAN-Australia Economic Co-operation Program. In these fields, as in the particular field mentioned by the report, that is English teaching, the Government welcomes and makes every effort to meet requests from ASEAN governments according to their own priorities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee in its report, recommended that the work of non-governmental organisations continue to be supported by the Government and, in response to the needs indicated by the ASEAN countries, that that support be expanded wherever possible. Non-governmental connections between Australia and the ASEAN countries have been the subject of a recent inquiry by a working group established by my predecessor. The group has now completed its work and I plan to make a statement on this shortly. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government accepts, in the context of available resources, the Committee's recommendations about the importance of providing information about Australia in the ASEAN countries. An extensive information program is pursued by our diplomatic missions in the region. In addition, the Government has given support to Chulalongkorn University in Thailand in establishing a course on Australian politics, and in assisting the University of Indonesia which hopes to establish a Chair of Australian Studies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government welcomes the public attention which the Committee's inquiry and report attracted to Australian relations with ASEAN. The report has served to underline the important place of ASEAN and the ASEAN countries in Australia's foreign policy. The findings of the Committee are broadly consistent with the initiatives the Government has already taken, or is taking, to strengthen our relations with ASEAN. The report has, at the same time, thrown into relief some areas in which problems exist and has made useful suggestions on what might be done to deal with them. The practice of consultation with ASEAN is firmly established, and I believe that this will assist with the resolution of any differences in a co-operative spirit. In dealing with the issues which must arise from time to time between neighbours, I am sure we will all remain aware of the fundamental interests we have in common in the preservation of a secure, strong and self-reliant region. </PARA>

<PARA>I wish to make a very short statement. First of all, in general terms I think the Government's response to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence is very satisfactory, but I reserve the right at some later stage, when I hope the Government's response will be debated in the Senate, to make some comments upon some aspects of the response and on the Committee's recommendations.

I am very pleased about that. Like Senator Sim, I am very pleased about the quick response which we got to the report. I hope the Government did that because of the criticisms which have been made in the past by members of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. Having said that, however, I am disappointed that the Government did not agree with the Committee's recommendation concerning the appointment of a labour attache to ASEAN. Page 7 of the Government's response states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee expressed support for the proposal that the Australian Government should post a Labour Attache to ASEAN. It is the Government's view that such an appointment is not required at this stage but that the matter should be kept under review. </PARA>
<PARA>A recommendation which all honourable senators on the Committee strongly support was that we should have a labour attache in ASEAN. It was supported by the Australian Council of Trade Unions and also by a group of Australian trade unionists who recently attended an Asian trade union conference in Bangkok. I believe the labour attache should be stationed in Singapore where there is a strong trade union organisation. I think more importantly his job would have been to keep in touch with trade unions and trade union leaders in the ASEAN countries, especially in those countries where they face great difficulty in carrying out their trade union duties. </PARA>
<PARA> I think all of us should remember what happened to the democratic trade union movement in South Vietnam, and that is that the people who, early on in the conflict, were a third force in that country were one of the first groups to be crushed by the then South Vietnamese Government. I think it is important that a labour attache would have kept the governments of ASEAN up to date on the Australian industrial scene. It is a pity the Government did not support our recommendation. Japan has realised the importance of a labour attache. It has appointed one to Australia and, of course, we have now appointed one to Tokyo. I am not completely happy with the Government's answer in regard to staff. Page 4 of the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> To meet the growing demands of Australia-ASEAN relations, the Committee recommended that Australia's diplomatic missions in the region be provided with adequate staff and resources to ensure that Australia's policies are effectively implemented. Our posts in the ASEAN countries are regarded as having a high priority in claims on staffing and resources.

Because of this, pressure points do exist. Staffing levels, both at our posts and in Canberra, are kept under constant review. </PARA>
<PARA>I think one of the problems we have is that of staff ceilings in the Department of Foreign Affairs. Unfortunately, in the ASEAN region, in some instances, it has been the locally employed staff-the local people-who have had to be put off, and Australia's image has suffered as a result of that. A number of other issues in this report ought to be debated, such as Radio Australia, the immigration policies and the ASEAN Studies Council. I do not think this is the time to debate them. Senator Sim has sought leave to continue his remarks later. I will conclude my remarks and hope this matter is brought on by the Government at an early date for debate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a statement on a recent incident on an Australian aid project in the Philippines.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> On 16 February 1981, two construction supervisors assigned to the Philippines Australia Development Assistance Project-PADAP-located in the province of Zamboanga del Sur on the island of Mindanao were robbed, abducted and subsequently shot by a group of bandits. One of the supervisors, Mr Gordon Murdoch, was killed and Mr Harold Hough, a New Zealander, was seriously wounded. Contrary to some reports there is no evidence that the attack was politically motivated or that it was directed specifically against the project or the personnel assigned to it. </PARA>
<PARA> The incident has been a source of great distress to all associated with the project: Australian aid personnel have never previously been victims of such a violent attack, although they have on occasions faced real threats to their personal safety. I wish to make a statement today about the incident, the outcome of the investigations so far conducted by Philippine and Australian officials and the intentions of the Minister for Foreign Affairs regarding the future of PADAP. </PARA>
<PARA> Before dealing with the incident, I pay tribute to the many persons and their families who, over the years, have accepted appointments to Australian aid projects and who have committed themselves to achieving the objectives of Australia's aid programs. Often they have been asked to work in extremely difficult and generally remote areas where the lack of development has given rise to security problems. Without the support of dedicated people such as the late Mr Murdoch, Mr Hough and others who have at one time or another worked on PADAP and similar projects in other countries, Australia would not have been able to earn its well deserved reputation as an aid donor. </PARA>
<PARA> The Philippine Government reacted quickly to assist by providing an aircraft to transfer the wounded man to Manila on the day of the shooting. Assurances of continued assistance in improving security arrangements have been received and measures have already been taken in this regard. Regret and concern about the incident have been expressed at the highest levels in the Philippine Government and by many from the province itself. The importance attached to the project and appreciation of the efforts of the Australian personnel assigned to it have been re-emphasised. </PARA>
<PARA> Investigations of events surrounding the incident have been given a high priority by the Australian Embassy in Manila which has maintained close consultation with the Philippine authorities and the Australian Development Assistance Bureau which sent a senior officer to the Philippines to investigate. On the basis of reports that have been submitted to me, I would like to inform the Senate of the incident and its implications for the project. The bulk of evidence points to project personnel, who regularly travelled the road on which the incident took place, inadvertently coming upon a road block and robbery. The subsequent events remain unclear. The bandits, for reasons that are unknown, apparently decided to abduct the two Australians after the robbery and were taking them away when shooting started. This was associated with the arrival of Philippine Armed Forces personnel at the site of the hold up; the two supervisors were shot by the bandits as their captors attempted to retreat from the military forces. Despite improvements that have already been made to security arrangements, the fact remains that there is no way by which either the Philippine or Australian governments can provide an absolute guarantee of the personal safety of personnel on this and indeed on several other projects in other countries short of withdrawing from these aid activities. The risks must, however, be balanced against the benefits to the people being served by the project. In this case the benefits are very substantial indeed. The project had a most significant and positive impact in its area of influence and has made a substantial contribution to improving living conditions and to providing greater economic opportunities for the mostly rural population affected by it. For example, there is evidence that the project has improved access to markets and rural credit facilities for those people and, as a result, there has been an increase in both the volume and number of agricultural crops. </PARA>
<PARA> Intensive project activity in the testing and dissemination of new crop varieties with co-operating farmers has made a significant impact on rural production as has the irrigation project. Small farmers have been the primary beneficiaries of the livestock and pasture development aspects of the project. Transportation costs have been reduced as a result of restoration of roads, while the population in the project area now enjoys improved access to health, education and other basic services. Many villages which previously had no clean and reliable water supplies are serviced by pumps installed by the project. </PARA>
<PARA> The project's achievements are clearly substantial. In particular, a great deal of progress has been made in ensuring that the bulk of the population shares equitably in the economic and social benefits generated by the project. As the project comes nearer to completion those benefits will become more evident. A number of Australian priests working in the area have noted the benefits that the project has brought to the local population. For its part, the Australian Government is fully committed to the project and is doing all that it can to see that its objectives are realised. </PARA>
<PARA> In the light of all these circumstances, the Minister for Foreign Affairs has decided that Australia's involvement in PADAP should continue but has directed ADAB to investigate alternative means of implementing the project whereby Australian personnel will in future be less exposed to risk. For instance, the Minister has directed that the geographical coverage of the project be reduced and that access to more distant work sites be improved. This will ensure that Australians are not required to work in either remote areas where it is difficult for local authorities to provide adequate protection. As a result, the risk faced by Australian personnel will be significantly diminished. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the Philippines Australia Development Assistance Project is an aid activity of which all Australians-and especially those who have worked on it since 1974-have every reason to be proud and one which I believe deserves the Government's continuing support. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the statement. </PARA>
<PARA>I think the incident referred to in the statement brings home to all of us the often hazardous and extreme conditions in which Australian aid officers work. Only recently an Australian Development Assistance Bureau officer died in an air crash in Tanzania after visiting an aid project at Singida. It is a project which I and other members of parliament visited in 1979. It is a very worthy project. Australian aid officers and their families are coping well there in extremely difficult conditions. In this instance it appears that the motive behind the killing was robbery and was not political. However, Senator Primmer, Senator McIntosh and I have raised questions about the dangers facing aid officers in the Philippines, particularly those in the province of Zamboanga on the island of Mindanao. We have also questioned the worth of our aid program in that place. It is an area where Moslem separatists are active and where there is a strong feeling against the central Government. An article in the Australian this morning, under the heading ' ''Poll rigged'' as Marcos wins', states in part:</PARA>
<PARA> But even before all the votes were counted, there were strong claims that the election had been rigged. </PARA>
<PARA> Mayor Cesar Climaco, of Zamboanga City, charged that the Government tried to forge official returns for the entire region of five southern provinces with more than a million votes. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Climaco raided a Zamboanga hotel, seized the forged returns, and arrested four government men allegedly caught red-handed completing the documents six hours before the polling precincts closed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I seek leave to have a statement relating to the southern bluefin tuna fishery incorporated in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will recall that on 30 March 1976 the then Minister for Primary Industry gazetted a notice under the Fisheries Act 1952 concerning the taking of southern bluefin tuna in certain waters off New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia by the pole and live bait method of fishing. The effect of this notice was to freeze the number which had fished there in the 1974-75 season-about 70 vessels. The freeze was intended as a temporary measure to allow an assessment of the situation in the fishery, and to stabilise investment, following two bad seasons when catches were poor and prices low. The industry felt recovery would be helped by controlling the number of vessels entering the fishery. The freeze was reviewed in 1977 and again in 1978, by which time studies had been completed and better fishing seasons experienced. In 1979 the Australian Fisheries Council recommended to me that the freeze be lifted. </PARA>
<PARA> I met with industry representatives in January last year. They drew my attention to the interaction which had developed between the tuna and south eastern trawl fisheries-many fishermen operating their vessels in both fisheries. Largely because of this I deferred lifting the tuna freeze, announcing that it would be lifted on 31 March 1981, and that in the meantime my Department would update the earlier economic survey to see if there was a need for any continuing management regime. The Australian Fisheries Council met again in September 1980 and reaffirmed its earlier recommendation that the freeze be lifted. The economic study has been completed and does not provide any basis for concluding that the freeze should continue, or that management of the tuna fishery per se is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently there have been a number of meetings within the industry, between industry representatives and State departments, my Department and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. I have also met with the Federal President of the Australian Fishing Industry Council and had extensive discussions with him. I think it fair to say the industry is divided, both within the processing and fishing sectors, as to the need for the freeze and its effectiveness. After considering the advice of the industry, of my own Department and the CSIRO, I am satisfied that the freeze has been ineffective in achieving its objective of stabilising investment in the fishery. I therefore believe the Australian Fisheries Council recommendation to lift the freeze was well based. Furthermore, I am concerned about Australians being prevented from fishing for southern bluefin when we have an agreement enabling Japanese fishermen to do so. Another point is the need for Australians to expand their fishing activities to take other species of tuna, such as skipjack. It seems to me this will not be facilitated by retention of the freeze. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not expect there to be any significant increase in the number of new vessels in the fishery. New entrants, if any, will not be able to establish access rights under any future management regime on the same basis as fishermen who have operated in the fishery to date. Accordingly fishermen planning to enter the fishery should not base their expectations of profitability on taking southern bluefin tuna. I have concluded that I should endorse the Australian Fisheries Council's recommendation and lift the freeze, and the necessary fisheries notice will be gazetted forthwith. However I will require the South Eastern Fisheries Committee to immediately undertake a study of the tuna and trawl fisheries recommended in my Department's economic study and require it to report its conclusions to the Australian Fisheries Council in September. In the meantime operations in the tuna fishery will be kept under review by my Department to ensure that I am immediately informed if a situation develops which requires more urgent attention, and I have sought, and confidently expect to obtain, the immediate co-operation of my State colleagues in implementing any action necessary. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the statement. </PARA>
<PARA>I find it necessary to make some comments on this paper because I have some reservations about the method by which it has been prepared and the results which are likely to be achieved. The southern bluefin tuna has been under discussion in regard to a freeze of fishing efforts since 30 March 1976. Whilst this subject has been discussed fairly regularly between then and now, there really is not a great deal of information additional to that made available at that time. This industry has involved approximately 70 vessels. It has now been decided, according to the statement, that the existing freeze shall be removed. The statement reads:</PARA>
<PARA> In 1979 the Australian Fisheries Council recommended to me that the freeze be lifted. </PARA>
<PARA>On page 2 it reads:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . does not provide any basis for concluding that the freeze should continue. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very negative statement. I would have far preferred one which said that information was available to indicate that the freeze should not continue. To me it is not a strong enough statement to justify the action which had been taken. The next paragraph reads:</PARA>
<PARA> I think it is fair to say the industry is divided . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I do not think that is a good enough statement, either. The section of the industry which is involved with this fishery, to the best of my knowledge, does not say this. The section of the industry which is not involved may say it, but the section which is involved does not. The next paragraph reads:</PARA>
<PARA> I am satisfied that the freeze has been ineffective . . . </PARA>
<PARA>But we are given no detail as to how or why it is considered to have been ineffective. The statement does not say whether there has been any change in the maximum catch levels or the economic advantages of the fishery. I believe it is not sufficient for the Minister to say: ' . . . I am satisfied that the freeze has been ineffective'. In the last paragraph on page 2 of the statement the Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, I am concerned about Australians being prevented from fishing for southern bluefin when we have an agreement enabling Japanese fishermen to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>When there is an agreement with the Japanese fishermen and if there is any question of pressure the obvious thing to do is reduce the Japanese fleet and allow an equivalent number of Australian boats to take the place of the Japanese vessels. In my opinion that would be the prudent way to ensure that the industry develops. On the third page of the statement the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> I do not expect there to be any significant increase in the number of new vessels in the fishery. </PARA>
<PARA>At a meeting of the South Eastern Fisheries Committee on 25 November 1980 the industry's view was expressed by Mr Connell, the President of the Australian Fishing Industry Council. The minutes of that meeting state:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Mr Connell expressed the view of industry that if there are no management measures imposed on the southern bluefin tuna fishery after 31 March 1981, there will be a dramatic increase in the number of vessels licensed for the fishery and consequent increase in effort which would in turn put pressure on other fisheries such as the south east trawl fishery. Both Dr Francois and Mr Wharton commented that they would be concerned to see any additional pressure placed on the trawl fishery. </PARA>
<PARA>In spite of that comment by an industry representative the Minister has stated:</PARA>
<PARA> I do not expect there to be any significant increase in the number of new vessels in the fishery. </PARA>
<PARA>The next sentence in the statement probably sums it all up. I would need some explanation from somebody to tell me what it means. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> New entrants, if any, will not be able to establish access rights under any future management regime on the same basis as fishermen who have operated in the fishery to date. Accordingly fishermen planning to enter the fishery should not base their expectations of profitability on taking southern bluefin tuna. </PARA>
<PARA>Earlier in the statement we were told the freeze had been lifted. I really do not understand how the two points of view can be expressed in the one document. In the last paragraph of the statement the Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA> However I will require the South Eastern Fisheries Committee to immediately undertake a study of the tuna and trawl fisheries recommended in my Department's economic study and require it to report its conclusions to the Australian Fisheries Council in September. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not think it is improper for me to suggest that if it is so important that such a study should be undertaken it should have been undertaken and concluded before the freeze was lifted. I think it is quite inappropriate that this action should have been taken at this time bearing in mind the evidence that is currently available to us. I feel it is only right that I should express my concern about this matter. I am sure I speak for a considerable number of fishermen in South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales in particular who are heavily dependent on this fishery and associated fisheries.</PARA>

Senator Archer is the Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Trade and Commerce which at present has before it a reference which was referred to it by me 18 months ago in my capacity at that time as the secretary to the parliamentary Labor Party Caucus resources committee. I was the secretary to that committee for some five years. A good deal of concern had been expressed to the committee about the fishing industry as a whole in Australia. That was the reason the Opposition decided that the Senate Standing Committee should have a look at the Commonwealth's responsibility for the development of the Australian fishing industry. No doubt Senator Archer, as the Chairman of the Senate Committee, apart from his close contact with fishermen in Tasmania, is now the recipient of a good deal of correspondence by way of submissions expressing concern about this industry. I join him in expressing my concern that this freeze has been lifted before the meeting of the Australian Fisheries Council in September and also before the Senate Standing Committee on Trade and Commerce has been able to make a report on the subject to the Senate.

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to amend three pieces of legislation to cover the Joint Sitting of the Senate and the House of Representatives which is to be held to choose a senator for the Australian Capital Territory in the place of the late Senator John Knight. The three Acts involved are the Evidence Act, the Parliamentary Proceedings Broadcasting Act and the Parliamentary Papers Act. These three Acts were amended in 1974 in relation to the Joint Sitting of the Senate and the House of Representatives which was then held pursuant to section 57 of the Constitution. The amendments then made were limited to Joint Sittings pursuant to section 57 of the Constitution and do not apply in relation to the Joint Sitting to be held pursuant to the Senate (Representation of Territories) Act. That Act was amended last year to provide for the filling of a casual vacancy in respect of a senator from the Australian Capital Territory by the Senate and the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of the present Bill will be to extend the changes made in 1974 to cover any Joint Sitting of the Senate and the House of Representatives pursuant to an Act. The effect of the changes in relation to each of the three pieces of legislation concerned will be as follows: With regard to the Evidence Act, the effect of the amendment will be to provide for judicial notice of the signature of the officer presiding at a Joint Sitting held pursuant to an Act and to provide for copies of official records of proceedings of such a Joint Sitting to be admitted as evidence thereof. In relation to the Parliamentary Proceedings Broadcasting Act, the effect of the amendment will be to provide authority for the broadcasting of a Joint Sitting held pursuant to an Act and to give protection against legal proceedings in respect of matters so broadcast. In referring to broadcasting, I intend also to cover the televising of a proceeding, since the Parliamentary Proceedings Broadcasting Act was amended in 1974 to permit the televising of parliamentary proceedings. In relation to the Parliamentary Papers Act, the amendment now proposed would provide for authority for the publication of the proceedings of a Joint Sitting held pursuant to an Act and for protection against legal proceedings in respect of the publication of the proceedings of such a Joint Sitting by the Government Printer. The amendments are of a machinery nature, but it is desirable that the changes should be made before the Joint Sitting takes place next month. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Opposition, I wish formally to protest, as we always do, at this action being taken by the Government. Once again, the Senate is being deprived of an opportunity to debate General Business effectively because of the Government's inefficiency in organising its own program. Tonight we are to deal with legislation which was introduced into the Senate only today and which in fact could have been introduced in plenty of time. In the last few weeks we have spent hours and hours waiting for Government legislation to be introduced. We have taken the opportunity to debate at length papers and reports, which we would not have done in normal circumstances. We have done so to co-operate with the Government, but here we have the Government, as it always does, bringing in controversial legislation at the last minute, demanding that that legislation be passed before a break, and depriving the Senate of the opportunity to discuss General Business. This situation is unsatisfactory. It has been so for the five or six years in which this Government has been in power. We will continue to protest on each occasion this is done.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too voice my strong protest against the motion moved by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner). If my colleague Senator Cavanagh were not at a very important meeting he too would be here to protest against the action of the Government. As Senator Grimes has said, the Opposition protests most vigorously that the Government has decided, as it does on many occasions, to take away from senators their right to debate matters which appear on the Notice Paper under the heading of General Business and to supersede that with the consideration of Government Business. Only the other night I was watching a television program on which the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) was interviewed. He was very emphatic that if the legislation we are to debate shortly, the Airlines Equipment (Loan Guarantee) Bill, were not passed before the Easter break Ansett Airlines of Australia would be financially embarrassed. We now have to forgo General Business to allow the Government, led by Mr Fraser, to keep faith with Reg Ansett or Mr Murdoch, whoever is the owner of that airline. I think it is a travesty of the proper conduct of this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As Senator Grimes has said, the Government has had ample time in which to bring forward this legislation. Instead, it has brought it in at the last minute and taken away from all honourable senators-not only Opposition senators but also back-bench Government senators-an opportunity to speak on matters of General Business. I join with Senator Grimes, and I associate with this my colleague Senator Cavanagh, who unavoidably cannot be present, in placing on record our opposition to this action by the Government. No doubt it will not be the last occasion on which such action is taken. We are getting towards the winter recess, and on almost every Wednesday or Thursday the Minister who is in charge of the business of the day will move that Government Business take precedence over General Business. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to enable the Commonwealth to provide loan guarantees for the purchase by Ansett Transport Industries Ltd of new front line Boeing aircraft to operate on the trunk network. The introduction of this Bill at this stage is required to enable Ansett to finalise the financial arrangements for the purchase of the new generation aircraft. The first aircraft is due for delivery in June 1981. The most significant initiative of this new, competitive era in domestic aviation is the decision by Ansett on the one hand and Trans-Australia Airlines on the other to acquire different front line wide-body aircraft. Trans-Australia Airlines was the first to announce its choice of a wide-bodied-type jet and orders have now been placed for five of the A300B Airbus, a proven and well accepted twin-engined aircraft which will carry approximately 270 passengers. Trans-Australia Airlines will also modify those of its DC9 aircraft which it is to retain to redesign the interiors to be compatible with its B727 aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA> Ansett, on the other hand, chose completely to restructure its fleet, and on 17 March last year announced its intention to acquire 21 Boeing aircraft, comprising five yet to be built B767 wide-body twin jets with a capacity of approximately 210 passengers; 12 B737-200 advanced twin jets; and four long range B727-200 tri jets. These aircraft are the subject of the Bill now before the Senate. Expenditure to acquire these aircraft and associated equipment is over $800m. Completion of delivery of the aircraft on order will not be until around 1985. </PARA>
<PARA> It was recently announced that the Government had taken an in-principle decision to establish TAA as a public company and had decided to establish an independent fare tribunal. The details are currently being considered. The Government proposes to bring before the Senate during this session an airlines agreement Bill which takes into account the Government's decisions on TAA and the tribunal. The Government has also decided to establish an inquiry into whether deregulation is a desirable long term objective. Having in mind that there will be new wide-bodied equipment and a new era of competition between the airlines over this period, with an inevitable impact upon the way in which our domestic airline system will operate in the 1980s, it is logical that time will be needed to make a full assessment of the impact of these changes. In any event, the last of the new aircraft will be delivered in 1984. Therefore, the inquiry will be asked to report within five years so that it can examine the question of deregulation against the experience of our two-airline system using this new equipment. I am confident that both TAA and Ansett will co-operate with the Government in these policy initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA> Deliveries of aircraft in respect of which loans will be guaranteed under this legislation will commence shortly, with the first of Ansett's B737s and TAA's A300 aircraft arriving in June. The second and third A300s will be introduced in mid-September and early November. At the same time, Ansett will progressively introduce the B727s between June and September, and the B737s between June 1981 and June 1982. The proposed delivery date of the first two B767 aircraft is November 1982. The Bill currently before the Senate is to introduce legislation to provide for the Treasurer, on behalf of the Commonwealth to furnish guarantees in respect of borrowings by a wholly-owned subsidiary of Ansett Transport Industries for the purchase of Ansett's 21 new Boeings and associated equipment and spares. Clause 4 empowers the Treasurer to guarantee the repayment of moneys borrowed, not exceeding $US490m, for the purchase of the aircraft and for related interest on that borrowing. Clause 5 provides that the Treasurer must be satisfied that the terms and conditions of the borrowing are reasonable, and provides that appropriate security be afforded to the Commonwealth. The Australian National Airlines Act already authorises the Treasurer to provide guarantees for TAA's borrowings. This Bill is consistent with the principle of according similar treatment in respect of guarantees to the airlines. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Airlines Equipment (Loan Guarantees) Bill is to authorise the Treasurer, Mr Howard, to provide Commonwealth loan guarantees to Ansett Transport Industries Ltd and to an unnamed subsidiary of that company up to a limit of $490m. That is a most unusual course of action to which the Senate is being asked to give its approval and it is based upon the urgency criterion which this Government has placed upon this legislation. It is unprecedented, unnecessary, and is another indication of the will of the Executive being imposed upon the operations of the Senate. It makes a mockery of the attitude of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) during the fateful year of 1975 when he was trying to establish the principle that the Senate was a House of review, of independence and, therefore, capable of making independent judgments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are being forced to a guillotine, to a timetable in relation to this piece of legislation which is quite unsatisfactory in every shape or form from the point of view of the role of the Senate and the Australian people. The fact is that we are responding to the pressures of the Ansett organisation. It appears that we are following even more quickly in the wake of the new operators of that organisation. That is the way in which the Ansett organisation operated during the post-war years. I refer particularly to the Murdoch group which now not only wants to buy American presidents, newspapers, television stations and airlines but also obviously wants to buy governments and parliaments. Certainly it has bought the Australian Prime Minister who has given an undertaking-as was just mentioned by my colleague-that this piece of legislation would be rushed through the Parliament without any adequate explanation and without any proper consideration by the Senate operating as a House of review. It makes a mockery of the way in which the Parliament operates. </PARA>
<PARA> These guarantees enable Ansett Transport Industries to conclude a purchase arrangement for 21 new Boeing aircraft which will be programmed for delivery between June 1981 and late 1985. The 12 Boeing 737 series aircraft which are being purchased are old technology. They are noisy aircraft. This will exacerbate the noise and pollution problems at some of our airports and particularly at Mascot. Therefore, the Government's approval for the import of these aircraft strikes out the major recommendations of the Government's Major Airport Needs of Sydney Committee otherwise known as the MANS Committee. That Committee recommended that new technology, quiet, wide-bodied aircraft should be introduced during the 1980s to replace the smaller and noisier aircraft currently in use. Whilst the Government is critical of the New South Wales Government which does not want to extend Mascot airport and is insisting upon the construction of a second airport in Sydney, the Australian Labor Party is being criticised for the concern it has shown in that area. People living around the Sydney airport have expressed their views to the New South Wales Government. In the dying hours of this period of sitting of Parliament the Government has introduced a piece of legislation, which was incorporated and not even read and which was introduced into the House of Representatives only a few days ago. It is using its numbers to force the legislation through the Senate today. This, of course, is another example of the complete hypocrisy of the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The provision of Australian Government guarantees to Ansett and Trans-Australia Airlines in respect of loans raised abroad to purchase new passenger aircraft is a basic feature of the two-airline policy. This Bill makes a mockery of the so-called rebellion that was in the Government ranks about the two-airline agreement. Similar guarantees have been provided to Ansett Transport Industries Ltd on 21 occasions since 1966-67 and to TAA on one occasion, and that was last year. As at 31 December 1980 the Commonwealth contingent liability in respect of loans raised overseas stood at $US57.2m for Ansett and at $US34m for TAA. </PARA>
<PARA> Traditionally airlines equipment loan guarantee Bills have not been objected to by the Opposition. In the past we have given our assent to them in accordance with the established policies of the Parliament. As the two-airline agreement had been agreed to we were prepared to put into effect the legislative factors relating to that agreement. However, in view of the grave and exceptional circumstances associated with this Bill I will move on behalf of the Opposition at a later stage that consideration of the legislation be postponed. I understand that copies of the amendment are currently being distributed to honourable senators. Before dealing with the Bill I propose to comment on some of the statements that have been made by the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) in the other place. We have to rely on those statements because we have not been shown the courtesy of being provided with a copy of the second reading speech in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister reaffirmed that the Government had decided to transform Trans-Australia Airlines into a public company. Senator Collard, who on several occasions has taken issue with me, will now perhaps agree with the criticism of the Opposition because the proposal has been reaffirmed in the second reading speech. I can appreciate, of course, that he was not aware of that. He probably would not have been reading the speeches made in the other House. There is no doubt now that the Government intends to sell all or part of TAA to its wealthy friends and to stock exchange speculators. The Labor Party regards TAA as an innovative and successful public enterprise. It has been hobbled as a result of the pressures by the Ansett organisation over the years. We will be having a lot more to say about that in the ensuing months. The sale of TAA would rob the 90 per cent of Australians who do not hold shares in public companies of their ownership of this famous airline. This valuable national asset is a symbol of public enterprise achievement and national spirit. Its sale, therefore, to private enterprise would constitute, in our view, gross misappropriation of public property. The Australian Labor Party will resist its sale at every opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister used his second reading speech as a subterfuge to announce that an inquiry would be conducted at some time between now and 1986. Heaven only knows why he selected that year because it is at least two elections away. In his speech to the House of Representatives he said that the deregulation of the airline industry was desirable in the long term. By making that announcement in the late part of the evening he hoped to prevent parliamentary response on a matter which ought properly to have been the subject of a special statement and special debate in the Parliament. It is now evident that following a threatened rebellion in the Government caucus against this Bill last Thursday-I remind honourable senators that a week later the Government is ramming this Bill through the Senate-a deal was concluded to establish an inquiry into airline deregulation if the rebels would support this measure. That is the shady, shoddy deal that has been entered into. These so-called rebels of the Government who insisted upon deregulation of the industry have been conned into believing that such an inquiry will take place some time between 1981 and 1986. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the poor, hapless, embattled and, some might even say, hopeless Minister for Transport told the Government caucus that the Bill concerned the purchase of one aircraft only. Subsequently, he had to be advised, because he did not even know, that there would be a purchase of 21 aircraft. That is what this legislation is about. The rebels in the caucus were jubilant when the Minister conceded that he would have an inquiry into deregulation. Surely it must be obvious to those members who claim to be rebels, who claim to have a different philosophical position to that of the Government, that their victory was a hollow one. They have been fooled and conned again by the Fraser Administration. The inquiry in the form outlined is a sop to those gullible back bench rebels. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister, in announcing the inquiry last Thursday evening, could not even tell the House who would conduct it, when it would be conducted, where it would be held, what its terms of reference might or might not be or even when it would commence. Then he had the audacity to suggest that it would faithfully report back to the Parliament some time before that magical 1986-if by some mischance this Government were to be returned at the next election. That is something beyond the power of the Government. The servile attitude of the Government to the proprietors of Ansett has been shown so many times and has certainly been apparent in the announcement of this inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister told the House that he was confident that TAA and Ansett would co-operate despite the almost unlimited legislative powers that he has to require both airlines to supply all relevant financial and operational information. Honourable senators will recall that the Minister made a similar statement when the Holcroft Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares was announced. The record shows that his confidence on that occasion was misplaced. Ansett did not co-operate or make a substantive submission except to advise the Government to sell TAA. How willingly has the Government taken up that piece of advice. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us turn to the Bill that is before us. The manner in which the legislation has been approved by the Government caucus and presented to the Parliament for urgent passage is surely a matter of grave public concern. The Bill that we are discussing comes as a result of brawling amongst government members following the complete and utter collapse of the Government's aviation policy. That surely is acknowledged even by those who will be prepared to assist the Executive, the Cabinet, in using the forms of the Senate to force this Bill through this evening. We now have a situation in which the Government's aviation policy is being determined day by day or, as a colleague said when he was debating this matter in the other place, on the hour by the hour. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is being handled by a Minister who did not know how many aircraft were involved in the purchase and who, I am satisfied, does not appreciate fully the implications of the legislation. The proposed guarantee of the $US490m borrowing for Ansett involves the largest amount ever sought by any airline in this country's history. In the circumstances Parliament should have been given full information on the loans to be guaranateed and the purchase for which they were to be applied. Unlike previous loan guarantee Bills the Ansett subsidiary concerned with these guarantees is not named. Surely the Parliament is entitled to know that. </PARA>
<PARA> Here we are setting aside the debate on the freedom of information legislation that was scheduled for today. In this piece of legislation we are not told what the unnamed subsidiary is. Why the secrecy? Why can we not be told? Why can it not be indicated in the legislation itself? It ought to have been specified in the provisions of the Bill. Clause 4 of the Bill stipulates that the proceeds of the loans raised by Ansett are to be used for the purchase of 21 aircraft itemised and related spare parts and equipment. However, most interestingly in the publicity associated with the provisions of the United States Export-Import Bank loans to Ansett is the reference to the provision of an amount of money totalling $US34.2m for purposes related to publicity and other matters. What does that mean? What explanation has the Government about that? Has the Caucus of the Government parties been told what that means, or are they prepared to sit idly by and cop what the Executive directs? I will come back to that subject a little later. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 5 sets out the conditions of the guarantees to be provided. It gives the Minister extensive powers which the Holcroft Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares highlighted that the Minister had failed to exercise in the past. He failed to exercise extensive powers over the financial accounts of Ansett and its subsidiaries. Here we have another example of three reputable men who are making certain recommendations as a result of their appointment to the committee. They are giving advice to the Government and that advice is set aside. Let us get it clear and on the record that we do not like what the Government is doing and we do not like the pressure that is being exerted on the Government by the Ansett organisation. It is not right in the United States either. The Ansett loans affair has become a matter of great notoriety, great publicity and great concern even in the United States of America. There the Congress is prepared to exercise its proper powers. It is regrettable that an Australian company should be the subject of such notoriety in the United States Press, such attention, concern and activity by United States Government agencies, especially as it is a company which depends so much upon the legislative decisions and protection of the Australian Parliament for its financial success. It cannot operate without our guarantee.</PARA>
<PARA> A series of loans to Ansett Transport Industries from the United States Export-Import Bank-Eximbank-is involved in this legislation. Yet most of the Minister's second reading speech was devoted to matters not relevant to the Bill. He did not even bother to tell the House of Representatives what it is all about, any more than the Minister did in this place when he had the speech incorporated in Hansard. The second reading speech makes no mention of the individual loans or the series of loans involved. The Minister did not provide any advice to the Parliament of the public concern and investigations in the United States. He gave us no explanations whatsoever about the manner in which the Eximbank loans were arranged or about the proceeds of those loans. We are asked to put our signatures on a blank cheque. There is concern in the United States Congress from both sides of American politics, about these matters. There certainly would be much public concern about the way in which the Murdoch empire was able to exercise its influence in respect of the November 1980 elections for the Presidency of that country. Yet the only concern that is being expressed in this Parliament is coming from the Australian Labor Party. However, when I look at the list of speakers I gather that members of this Parliament, other than Government members, are equally concerned about this whole issue. </PARA>
<PARA> A patently false statement by the Prime Minister was referred to by one of my colleagues a few moments before I started to speak. Last Friday the Prime Minister proclaimed that this legislation must be passed before Easter. Why? Are Government members or the Minister going to tell us why this legislation must be passed before Easter? Is it to get the Murdoch group off the hook in the United States by having some imprimatur from this Parliament? Are we being used as a rubber stamp? Is that what is involved? One is entitled to draw that conclusion because no explanation is given to the Parliament. Yet, the Prime Minister, who claims to support the principles of parliamentery democracy, makes these statements not to the Parliament, either in the House of Representatives or through his spokesman in this place, but in fact on television. I quote from a transcript of his Press conference. In my view it does not read correctly but it is what the Prime Minister said. The transcript reads:</PARA>
<PARA> We have to get this legislation through before Easter, because the guarantees are needed. The Ansett group, in fulfilling that loan with the Eximbank and we are not prepared to run the risk of going over the time scales in relation to that because that would probably force Ansett into a renegotiation with Exim. That would have all sorts of complications and difficulties which nobody would want. </PARA>
<PARA>Certainly Mr Fraser would not want that situation to arise and certainly Mr Murdoch would not want it, but maybe the Australian people and the Australian Parliament want it. Maybe the American Government and the American people want to know a little more about the money that is so freely given outside the normal channels of international finance to an organisation which is under an investigation of some importance in the United States. The people of Australia are likely to be locked into a guarantee for almost $US500m and they will very much want to know, as we want to know, what complications and difficulties are associated with the Eximbank loan being made to Ansett Transport Industries. In those few words the Prime Minister took the course-we do not say this lightly-of concealing what is a very serious issue in the United States, an issue to which this Government does not want to address itself. In other words, it wants to protect an organisation that even within the heartland of American capitalism is in some sort of trouble and under some investigation. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Prime Minister and the Minister representing the Minister for Transport (Senator Messner) to elaborate to this Parliament and to the people of Australia on the complications and difficulties about which the Prime Minister has expressed so much concern in terms that he does not want to risk a renegotiation of the loan. Why is that? Are we not entitled to this information? Surely those members of the Government who speak so eloquently when it comes to the question of access to information would share our concern about knowing what is in the mind of the Ansett organisation and what is in the mind of the Prime Minister but is not in the knowledge of the Parliament. I remind the Minister and those honourable senators who sit opposite that they are sent here by the people of Australia exactly to exercise consideration of these matters. They are sent here to protect the interests of the Australian people, not to protect the interests of the Government's wealthy backers in private commerce. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that in his second reading speech the Minister for Transport-and the Minister representing the Minister for Transport in this place, but I cannot blame him because his words are the words of the Minister he represents-very carefully refrained from mentioning the Eximbank loan. Here we have the Prime Minister talking about it outside the Parliament and the Minister in the Parliament saying not a word. In what sort of degenerative state are the parliamentary processes of this country? Thank God that, as from 1 July, that situation will stop, at least in this place. Explanations will be demanded and explanations will be given, otherwise the Government will not be able to pass its legislation. I am sure that will be the view of the majority of honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has made no mention of any urgency or deadline for the provisions of the guarantees. No evidence has been provided to the Parliament that there is a deadline to meet, nor has there been mention of anything to support what the Prime Minister said last Friday night at his Press conference. Obviously these matters have been the subject of discussion and debate over the dinner table or over the telephone because we all know that people associated with that organisation-and with other organisations, for that matter-have been wining and dining with the Prime Minister and other Ministers in the last several weeks. There was some sort of deal arrangement worked out which, of course, is very repugnant to those people who believe in the democratic process and that the Parliament is supposed to exercise some responsibility. What do we get? We get absolutely no information because the matter has been worked out in some shady, shoddy deal over the dinner table with the Prime Minister. The evidence that is publicly available indicates the opposite of what the Prime Minister said. In fact, the Prime Minister in rushing this Bill through is seeking to protect Ansett in its difficulties in the United States of America. Can the Minister deny that? Can the Government deny that? It is a very serious allegation that we have made. Let us hear what the Government has to say about it. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously the Prime Minister wants to give Ansett Transport Industries' loan application added status by providing that company with Australian Government guarantees before the current United States investigations into the whole circumstances of the Eximbank loans are completed. Obviously the Prime Minister wants to say to the Ansett leadership-the people who after all organised the stock exchange raid on the original Ansett organisation only a year or so ago when this Government refused to help Sir Reginald Ansett and allowed the coup to take place: 'What are you arguing about and questioning? These loans have already received the legislative approval of the Australian Government. There could not possibly be anything wrong, otherwise the Australian Parliament would not have given its assent to the legislation and would not have approved of the manner in which these loans were obtained.' We say that this is just not good enough. </PARA>
<PARA> Around this issue there is a stench arising from the manner in which the Bill has been presented to the Parliament and rushed through. There is a stench arising from the failure of the Minister for Transport to inform the Parliament as to the questionable circumstances associated with Eximbank loans to Ansett Transport Industries. There is a stench arising from the persistent preferential treatment accorded this airline by this Government and a stench which obviously is being examined by the United States Senate itself. There is a stench arising from the relationship between this Government and the proprietors of Ansett Airlines, and the Ansett Press, which is now a powerful part of the Fourth Estate. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a smell of corruption hanging over the whole Ansett loans affairs. That is obvious if one reads the reports available as a result of the investigations in the United States. The course that this Government is proposing to follow may even be illegal; it is certainly immoral and certainly illogical. The Australian Treasury has very strict regulations covering loans and Commonwealth guarantees for loans. Can the Minister for Transport really tell this Parliament that he is proposing to adopt a procedure to guarantee loans by the people of Australia-loans of almost $500m which are presently under active federal investigation in the country in which they have been made-without even waiting for the preliminary report of investigations in the United States? Is this a legal, responsible and proper way for the Parliament to operate? On 25 March this year Senator Proxmire of the United States Senate Banking Committee asked Eximbank to suspend the Ansett loans until the high-powered United States General Accounting Office had completed its investigation into the terms of the Boeing sale to Ansett. Senator Proxmire stated:</PARA>
<PARA> I believe the public interest required that upon completion of the General Accounting Office Report Exim--</PARA>
<PARA>That is the bank-</PARA>
<PARA>re-examine the loans to determine whether approval or denial is the appropriate course of action. </PARA>
<PARA>The remarks of Senator Heinz are most significant as he is now in the majority party in the Senate and Chairman of the Sub-committee of International Finance. He joined Senator Proxmire in calling for a review of the loan. He said that the Eximbank board would be well advised to honour Senator Proxmire's request. He added:</PARA>
<PARA> I think it would be a good idea for the new chairman to look at the whole Ansett financing arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the kind of discussion that has been taking place in the United Sates, where these loans are being raised and provided at a major cost to the United States taxpayers. In this Parliament, under this Government, this Prime Minister and this Minister for Transport, there has not been one word, whisper or even suggestion of that. There has only been an assertion by the Prime Minister outside of the parliamentary processes that some sort of phantom deadline has to apply. The Prime Minister was really saying: 'Let us get this legislation through quickly. Let us make Ansett look better in the light of these investigations. Let us not talk about any of the problems or difficulties associated with the legislation'. </PARA>
<PARA> On 31 March, only a week ago, the Eximbank in the United States deferred to a future date approval of the $US289m loan to Ansett. The American Government has set the matter aside. The Government with which the Australian Government claims to have a close philosophical position and alliance has taken that extraordinary step. We have heard nothing from the Government in our country. The public record shows that the Eximbank loans to Australia are currently under investigation by the United States Senate Banking Committee and the powerful General Accounting Office, to which I have already referred. That organisation is even more powerful in the American set-up than the Auditor-General in Australia or the Joint Committe of Public Accounts of this Parliament. The General Accounting Office is reportable to the United States Legislature. The loans are also under investigation by the administrative officers of Eximbank and the Federal Bureau of Investigation. </PARA>
<PARA> Are we not lightly passing over the seriousness of this issue? Would any Government senator come before this parliament and suggest, if we had a situation where the public accounts section of our Parliament was saying such a thing in respect of some major issue, that we should nevertheless ignore it and push the legislation through? Of course not. The Fraser Government is notorious for its behaviour in respect of matters of public morality. Let us look at what the Australian Broadcasting Commission's AM program reported on 26 March of this year. It said:</PARA>
<PARA> The American Justice Department has announced that the FBI is to begin investigating the circumstances surrounding the $200m loan to Ansett from America's Export Import Bank. The new complaint comes from the Public Integrity Section within the Justice Department and its spokesman, Mr John Russell, said that the FBI agents in particular would be probing whether politics had played a part in the granting of the Ansett loan. </PARA>
<PARA>Does that not make a mockery of what we were discussing today in relation to Senator Carrick's involvement and the Government's involvement in the Government Information Unit? Government supporters seem to have a different interpretation of politics, morality, probity and integrity. They switched one person from the staff of the Unit to somewhere else. That person is catered for in the establishment of the organisation but he is not doing the job. That is a play on semantics and an indication of the way in which this Government handles the taxpayers' money in this country. Public funds are involved in the Ansett loan in the United States. At least the American Congress, with all its weaknesses through having an extremist such as President Reagan running the affairs of the country, has set itself the objective of trying to establish some integrity and probity in its relationships when loans are granted to international commercial organisations. Again I refer to the AM report. It concluded:</PARA>
<PARA> Never before--</PARA>
<PARA>I stress this statement-</PARA>
<PARA>has the American Congress approved legislation or a joint resolution to try to deny one of the American bank's foreign loans. </PARA>
<PARA>Here we have a situation which is so serious that the American Congress, which has more conservatives than the Australian Parliament but which, nevertheless, has established some basis of integrity and morality, is prepared to do something about examining what it conceives to be a stinking mess. But nothing has happened in this country. There was paralysis because this Government, this Prime Minister and the people who sit on the other side of the Parliament know who their political masters are. They are captives of the proprietors of Ansett Airlines and the Murdoch Press. It is significant, as I have mentioned earlier, that Senator Heinz joined Senator Proxmire in expressing concern about the Ansett loan. A bipartisan decision was reached by two senators-they were from opposing sides of the political spectrum-who were members of the Committee which examined this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> That was a rare feat, we submit to the Senate. There are occasions on which we do reach common ground in this place. But, of course, pressure is exerted, is it not, upon those few senators on the other side who are not prepared to toe the party line, who are not prepared to be intimidated by the Executive and who have the courage from time to time to express an opinion substantially different from the majority view in the party? For that I give them great credit because I know how difficult it is in the party system to stand outside one's party position. I know how difficult it is on some issues to have a minority viewpoint, to express that viewpoint and to vote for it. I give those people top marks for doing so. All I am suggesting is that they should be consistent and do the same in respect of this piece of legislation. This is more important than establishing the co-called principles of freedom of information. This is an example of information being denied the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> If two men from different sides of the American political spectrum can come together as, indeed, people have on occasions in this place-it happens very rarely in the other place but it happens occasionally in this place-we have to look at why we are being forced to deal with this legislation. We have to look at the integrity of the men in the United States because they are men who have a great deal of support and who are recognised as being men of high integrity in the United States Senate. Their credentials cannot be challenged by anybody, least of all by the Prime Minister of this country. Their credentials are very highly regarded not only in the Senate of the United States but also by the United States people. But in Australia, in contrast-in secret, in some sort of shady deal-the Australian Prime Minister wants to force the Senate into being subservient to the whims of the Executive. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has sought to gloss over the grave questions raised in the United States Senate on the Ansett loan. Of course, the poor, hapless Minister for Transport does not want to know about it. He does not even talk about it or recognise it. He hopes it will go away and he does not want to debate it. He cannot even get the number of aircraft right when he has to put the matter to those in his party room. Both the Prime Minister and the Minister for Transport have embarked on a process of guaranteeing substantial loans-the highest ever to come before the Parliament-the very probity and legality of which have been called into the most serious question by senior legislators in the United States Senate. That legislature at least has the public courage, integrity and determination to demand answers to the same questions that we are demanding the Government to answer today. I am now asking the Parliament, the Senate and honourable senators opposite to have the courage to support our proposal to defer approval of the loan until satisfactory answers are forthcoming. Very shortly I will be moving an amendment along those lines. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask those honourable senators opposite who have integrity-I believe a great number of them who have integrity must be concerned about this piece of legislation and must be asking why this information is not forthcoming-to support the Opposition in a reasonable proposal to defer consideration of this matter until the outcome of the United States investigations is known. Is that an unreasonable proposition? Is that a revolutionary proposition and one which is so unparliamentary that it cannot be given serious consideration? It is a matter about which another government has expressed serious concern. Can we not take some recognition of its views and say: 'Well, yes, that is a proposition of the Opposition?' Government senators could say: 'We may not agree with the Opposition but it has put forward a prima facie case'. If there were any semblance of democracy in this place or any decency in the Government ranks, the Government would seriously consider our proposal for the postponement of this legislation, not for months or years, but until the United States Senate has completed its investigations. </PARA>
<PARA> It is incredible that Senator Carrick should say that politics should not enter into the matter and that we, as politicians, should not want to talk about politics. Of course politics are involved in the Ansett loan. We want to know whether improper politics have been involved or whether improper influence has been brought to bear. Bribes and corruption have been synonymous with commercial enterprises in many other countries. No one has denied that Mr Tanaka in Japan resigned his position because he received bribes from an aircraft manufacturer. No one has denied that senior members of the Italian Parliament have been forced out because of their acceptance of money from unsavoury sources. Political parties, particularly those on the Right, such as the Christian Democrats have been bribed and sponsored by funds from the United States. Yet the United States thinks that this matter in its very homeland, ought to be investigated. </PARA>
<PARA> If Government honourable senators and honourable members do not agree with our proposal it will mean one thing, that is that they are prepared to disregard the decisions of the United States senators, the Senate committees concerned, the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the many other agencies that I have mentioned. The Prime Minister and the Minister for Transport would be prepared to risk the Government's liability. After all, that is what this debate is about. The Government is to guarantee loans to the tune of $500m in case there is some breakdown or reason for the loans not being met. We are being asked to act as guarantors to the tune of $500m. This Government claims to represent all the people. It is taking steps to cut back on a whole range of social programs. Yet in one go it is prepared to underwrite $500m for Mr Murdoch, Sir Peter Abeles and those associated with the Ansett organisation. Those people are not prepared to put up their own money. They want the guarantee of the Parliament. They want members of Parliament, elected to represent the interests of the Australian people, to give their assent blithely. Of course, Opposition senators will probably be accused by Government senators of procrastinating, not being fair dinkum or trying to make political capital because we are asking the questions which my colleague asked in the House of Representatives to which he did not get answers. I am sure that we will not get answers in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> Where are the men and women opposite with the integrity and stature of Senator Proxmire and Senator Heinz who are prepared to elevate public accountability above cronyism and favouritism to their wealthy friends and political masters in the Government? One of these gentlemen is a supporter of the American President-he is a member of his party. The senators are supporters of American capitalism. They are certainly not radicals or people who believe that labour should have more supremacy than the power of capital in market forces and the struggles that occur in that area. They are men of tremendous courage and integrity. Their words ought to be listened to with a great deal of interest. If any Government senators are as concerned as we are I invite them as people of integrity to join the Opposition and support my amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course we concede that there is no certainty as to the outcome of the United States investigations. The United States Senate might well give its approval for the loan, but it might cancel it. The loan could be endorsed, or the door could be closed. It could make a number of decisions. Many options are available. But one of those options may well cause us to be financially responsible. Not only members of the Opposition but also members of the Australian Democrats, the Liberal Party and the National Country Party and the Independents all have a responsibility in this matter. We may be proven wrong; we concede that. But I think that there is sufficient doubt about this whole issue to say that the public interest has to be protected by ensuring that we do not enter into liability for an agreement that could be found subsequently to be faulty and illegal. It would be utterly irresponsible, wrong and immoral, to pass the Bill before us into law without the benefit of the result of those inquiries and decisions of the United States legislature. </PARA>
<PARA> I have shown that there is no deadline for the legislation. I have shown that serious matters are being questioned in the United States. I have shown that there are serious allegations as to the propriety of the loans and the manner in which they were negotiated. I have pointed out that since the elections in the United States last year the incoming majority party in the Senate has taken up the question of the propriety in these matters. In all of these circumstances, I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That all words after 'That' be omitted with a view to substituting the following words:</PARA>
<PARA>'Consideration of the Bill be postponed pending the outcome of inquiries being conducted in the United States of America by the Senate Banking Committee, the General Accounting Office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation into the circumstances of the United States Export-Import Bank loans to Ansett Transport Industries Ltd and its subsidiary'. </PARA>
<PARA>I commend the amendment to the Senate, and I hope the Senate will give it consideration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We cross that bridge when we come to it. Obviously, if the loan falls through this legislation then becomes null and void because it refers only to that loan. It is as simple as that. I do find myself in some sort of agreement with Senator Gietzelt about the type of aircraft that Ansett wants to buy. As well as the new 767 it is buying 737 and 727 aircraft which are old generation aircraft, although the 727 is probably the most successful commercial aircraft that has been manufactured. I think that probably close to 1,700 have been manufactured and are in service now. They have old generation jets on them-Pratt and Whitney JT8D. I am not sure what arrangements Ansett has made but in my discussions with representatives from the Boeing organisation late in 1979 it was indicated that the Rolls Royce RB211-535 engine which is being manufactured for the 757 aircraft can also go under the wing of the 737 aircraft. I do not know whether Ansett has that in mind but it could certainly make the 737 a better aircraft.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So far as the noise around Sydney goes, I think it is quite significant that the New South Wales Government has broken off all negotiations with the Federal Government on the updating of Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. The New South Wales Government will not even suggest to the Federal Government where a new airport should be. I do not mind because when the skies around Sydney get clogged and our new airport in Brisbane is operating we will get more international tourist traffic. The noise is quite significant. My understanding of the situation from surveys carried out is that about 80 per cent of the people living within the noise footprint of Sydney airport have moved there since the operation of jet aircraft began. Of course, the first jet aircraft were the noisiest. As we get into the new generation jets, even though they are bigger aircraft, they have far quieter engines and are far more tolerant. It is quite significant that about 80 per cent of people living in that area have moved there since jet aircraft have been introduced. I suppose it is conceivable that one of the reasons they moved there was the fact that people wanted to move out because of the noise and so houses could be bought cheaply. I suppose the old phrase caveat emptor is valid in that particular instance. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to spend some time referring to the report of the Holcroft Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares and to all the discussions that led up to it. As I have said on many occasions in this House, in about 1974 it was recognised that there was an inequity on the long haul routes. Since that particular time this Government has been trying to right that inequity. Indeed, it has done so by moving the flagfall up at a greater rate than the distance component. Since that has been going on we have had a fair internal airfare campaign which has taken place in Western Australia. That campaign has put tremendous pressure on our colleagues from Western Australia-pressure the likes of which some of us probably have not seen before. The fact that these colleagues of ours have realised that they had to succumb to that pressure and carry the campaign to this Parliament is now history. I hope that we do not see that sort of situation happening too often. It raises an interesting question. We have probably never seen before such a well orchestrated and well organised campaign to apply such massive pressure. One obviously questions the motives of such pressure and one wonders where the money came from for such a well orchestrated campaign. Obviously that question is going through the minds of many serious thinking people. </PARA>
<PARA> We have reached the situation today where the public is rightfully concerned and perhaps a little bewildered. It wonders what the heck is going on. This can be attributed to the massive Press reports, particularly those which appeared in the Western Australian Press, those which have been carried over here, those which have referred to what has occurred in this Parliament and those which have referred to what has gone on in many meetings behind locked doors. We have tried to wend our way through the ticklish situation to try to ensure that justice is done on the long haul routes and to see whether there was justice in any of the claims made. Unfortunately, as I said earlier, the public is concerned when, in reality, there is no basic need to be greatly concerned because Australia has probably the best, certainly one of the most efficient, cheapest and safest internal air transport systems in the world, particularly when we consider the conditions which exist in Australia. I have mentioned previously that Australia has a small population. Our land area is about the size of the United States but our population density is about one-fourteenth of the population of the United States. What makes it worse is that, if my memory serves me correctly, 70 per cent of our population lives within 35 kilometres of the coast. That means that we do not have the best conditions in the world in which to provide good air services to most of those people. Yet we manage to do that with one of the best airline systems in the world. Currently, because of the fracas raised by the group of people behind the internal air fare campaign, the public is concerned and bewildered about our airline system. I submit that it is unnecessarily concerned and bewildered. By what criteria do we judge our airlines? I suppose the best way is to look at some of the airlines around the world. I refer to a table of comparable Australian and United States fares, which I think has been circulated and which I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not read the whole of the preamble to the table because it is there for those who are interested to see. The source of the United States fares is the February 1981 North American edition of the official airline guide. The significant thing about the table is that, no matter which stage length one looks at, the Australian economy air fares as of last week were below the comparable United States air fares. Of course, we have to have a standard to consider. I know that there are discounts. There are discounts in the United States and there are discounts in Australia, but the economy fare is the standard that is usually considered. Honourable senators will notice from the table that, whichever stage one looks at, our previous air fares were below the current United States air fares. As a result of the last fare increase, fares for journeys of up to about 470 kilometres have been raised above the lowest United States economy fare, and for distances above that the fare is further lowered than the United States equivalent. By that criterion alone Australian airlines stand up fairly well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is significant that, when talking about the Sydney-Perth air fare, nobody as yet has cited the rail fare. The economy rail fare is currently $264. The rail fare has generally been looked upon as the benchmark by which people judge fares. The air fare is now $253.70. It was $268.10 which put it about $4.10 above the rail fare prior to the latest fare adjustment. But the economy air fare is now lower than the economy rail fare. That is another comparison to give us an idea of how long-haul passengers have been treated. I do not know why there is such a hang-up about Perth-Sydney or Perth-Melbourne fares. I do not think Sydney or Melbourne is the centre of the earth, let alone the centre of Australia, but apparently people in the West look at them in that way. I guess that isolation, in this day of quick communications and transport, can be a state of mind. It would probably take a person longer to travel from Winton to Sydney than to travel from Perth to Sydney. That person would have to change planes three times or trains three times. People in the West like to feel that they are part of Australia, but the isolation is not all that it has been painted. When people make comparisons they are always selective. They do not always compare like with like. I refer now to the second table that I have had circulated and ask that that also be incorporated. It examines holiday package deals. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. We often hear the story that it is cheaper to fly from Perth to Bali than it is to fly from Perth to Sydney. That is usually a selective quote, because one can always get a cheap holiday package from Perth to Bali, but it is normally compared with the economy fare from Perth to Sydney. Let me refer those honourable senators who are looking at that table to the details of the Perth to Bali flight. The figures given are those which would apply if one walked into the office of a travel agent and asked for the cheapest holiday package between the named centres, on the understanding that meals would not be included and that the apartment or motel room would be shared. The cost of a trip from Perth to Bali and a stay of seven nights, as offered by Garuda Aeroworld Tour Wholesalers, is $488. The distance involved is 2,579 kilometres. The cost of a flight from Perth to Coolangatta-a distance of 3,963 kilometres-and a TAA Take 7 Holiday would be $480. It is a round trip over a distance which exceeds that from Perth to Bali by 2,700 kilometres but it is $8 cheaper. The cost of the Ansett Well-Earned Holiday, also for seven nights, which involves a journey from Perth to Coolangatta, is $508, or $20 more than the cost of the Perth to Bali holiday.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I invite honourable senators to consider the distance involved in one or two other examples. The Melbourne-New Zealand package offered by Jetset Tours, which involves six nights and a distances of 2,632 kilometres, costs $498. The Adelaide to Whitsunday Village TAA Take 7 Wanderers' Paradise Holiday involves seven nights and a distance of 2,712 kilometres, and costs $459. Therefore, I submit that if we are to be fair in examining air fares or package deals we should compare like with like. Let us not compare a package deal with a normal air fare; let us compare package deal with package deal. Australia's airlines are not doing too bad a job when it comes to providing holiday package deals for the Australian traveller. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the Holcroft report. Now that we have had a look at it and have seen the first implementation of its recommendations and their impact on Australian air fares, I wish to say that their effect has been rather disastrous. I say to the Government: 'Stop right here and now; let us not go any futher; let us look at what we have done already'. As far as I am concerned, we have gone too far in meeting the problems presented by the longhaul route. I and my colleagues from Queensland have been criticised because we have not supported the Holcroft findings. I have not done so for very deliberate reasons. I expressed my reservations about the report in this chamber but it was necessary to wait until one saw what the effect of the air fare formula would be before one could say anything really serious about it. We wanted to see justice done on the longhaul routes. Thus, we have said nothing until this point of time, certainly by way of supporting the proposal.</PARA>
<PARA> One of the reasons I have not supported it is that, even though in Queensland we have long distances, they are made up of a lot of short haul routes, which are our main tourist routes. This is happening just at a time when Qantas, in answering what for many of us has been a dream for a long time, is beginning to operate in and out of Townsville direct flights to and from Honolulu and the west coast of the United States. The routes that are most used by passengers travelling on to our tourist venues are Townsville-Cairns, Townsville-Proserpine, Townsville-Mackay or, if people come in through Brisbane, Brisbane-Rockhampton and then on to Keppel Island or Mackay. They travel the very routes that are now to be seriously affected by the interim implementation of the Holcroft report. So I say here and now: Let us stop; let us not go any further. Let us look at this thing. One of the recommendations that the Government has accepted is that an independent fares tribunal be set up. Let us look at that suggestion before we go any further. Now that we in Queensland are being disadvantaged, I raise this question: What if the Queensland members and senators rebelled and resorted to holding the Government to ransom, or to pressurising it or blackmailing it, or whatever term one might like to use? The whole situation in this Government would then become untenable. So I am saying: Just stop right here and now. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the Holcroft report made much ado about cross-subsidisation. Basically, I have no quarrel with cross-subsidisation, within limits. There is probably not a firm or a government statutory corporation that does not in one way or another cross-subsidise. We cannot iron it out completely. As I said, we did recognise that there was an inequality here and I think it is wrong that long haul passengers, because of the distance they have to travel and the certain amount of isolation involved, albeit with modern transport and communications, should be cross-subsidising those on the east coast. But there is room for cross-subsidisation. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what has happened since the fare increase last Thursday. The third table to which I will refer-I have circulated copies of it-is a bit more complex. I checked with Hansard last night that it could be incorporated and I now seek leave to incorporate it before I speak to it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of this is to establish a basis on which we can look at what the Holcroft recommendations are currently doing and what they ultimately will do to air fares in Australia. For the purpose of the experiment, this table had been drawn up. It is a notional table; I guess one cannot do it any other way. I want honourable senators to imagine that, say, Trans-Australia Airlines and Ansett Airlines of Australia had folded or that all of a sudden we had an increase in population and we were setting up an airline, and we wanted to look at what the fare structure would do and how it would result in cross-subsidisation. I have chosen Sydney-Canberra, Brisbane-Rockhampton, Melbourne-Sydney and Melbourne-Perth as a pretty representative group of sectors in the Australian airline network. I guess I could have picked one other than Brisbane-Rockhampton but, being a little parochial, I picked that one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable senators will see from the table that there are columns headed 'Previous Fares', 'Current Fares' and 'Proposed Fares'. The flag fall and distance components are at the bottom of the table. The first column obviously relates to the fares that existed last week and the second column to the fares in existence now. The 'Proposed Fares' column is an exercise done according to the second Holcroft proposed formula, as mentioned on page 275 of the report. It is an exercise worked out on that basis, taking into consideration the fare increases since that report. We have worked on the basis of operating a Boeing 727 aircraft over this particular route for 12 months at 68 per cent load factor and with an all-economy configuration. We then follow the table down to the revenue that would be earned per flight and the number of stages that could be done in a normal airline day, that is, from 7 a.m. to 10 p.m. Of course, 12 Sydney-Canberra flights could be done as against only three Melbourne-Perth flights. We then look at the hours involved in each flight stage, the total hours flown per year less 5 per cent, loss of time for maintenance, and then the annual direct operating costs at $3,000 an hour for each aircraft, which I am assured is pretty close to the mark. Then we come to the surplus correction for overhead and profit over and above our direct operating costs. I have transposed this to the table at the bottom of the page so that we can see the results. If we look at the previous fare-that is the $21.80 flag fall with the distance component of 7.888c per kilometre-we will see what we have always suspected, that there has been a cross-subsidisation from the Melbourne-Perth route towards the other routes. It can be seen that this would amount to nowhere near as much as what is made out on page 208 of the Holcroft report. But the interesting thing is that we are supposed to have righted that situation. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the interim fare structure-that is, the current one involving a $40 flag fall-we see that the cross-subsidisation has been completely transposed. We are now getting a pretty heavy cross-subsidisation from the short haul routes to the long haul routes. If the Holcroft report were in any way accurate we should be starting to get near to an even surplus over the direct operating costs. To take that transposition further, if we go to a fare based on the Holcroft formula-in other words, the $52 flag fall-we see that the cross-subsidisation is considerably heavier. This is what I am basing our argument on. We have to stop here and now and try to get this wrong righted. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Holcroft formula were in any way correct, by the time we got to this third group of figures we should have reached a situation of somewhere near equal surplus. Although we do not know Holcroft's methodology, we can see from his figures how wrong this approach has been. We can say: 'If it is wrong in that case how wrong is the cross-subsidisation that we see on page 208?'. No one in his right mind would consider that the Sydney-Melbourne run has been cross-subsidised to the tune of $11m. If we were to sell a segment of the Australian airline system, do not tell me that it would not be the Sydney-Melbourne route from which the most money could be made and which would be the easiest to operate and thus be the most attractive. Yet this ridiculous statement is made on page 208. </PARA>
<PARA> I am submitting that it is about time we stopped and took a careful look at this matter. My submission is that somehow or other Holcroft's calculations have gone wrong. As I have said previously, we have a flag fall formula that is far in excess of what it should be. We have departed from the norm. These wrongs are now to be transposed over the whole airline system of Australia. They will have a detrimental effect. If we take these calculations to their ultimate conclusion and air fares go up further, with massive increases on the short haul runs, which is where the airlines make their money, we are going to see a massive swing away from airline travel to buses and trains. There is nothing wrong with that per se except for one thing. The minute the bottom line on the airlines' balance sheets is altered, a fairly heavy air fare increase over the whole network will be needed to bring that bottom line figure up again. So I submit to the chamber that we are in a fair bit of trouble if we go any further. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government should stop here and now. It should even come back to, say, a $30 or a $32 flag fall structure. But let us get our mathematics done pretty quickly. If the flag fall is not reduced, let us at least hold it when we consider air fare increases following cost increases. We should try to right these wrongs. Much has been said about the claim that Holcroft was not allowed enough time to complete his report. I will not debate that aspect of the matter. But I do say that if he has been working on wrong assumptions and wrong suppositions, all the time in the world would not have made this report any better. I ask the Government to cry halt at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude my remarks by referring to one other factor which is of great concern to me as a Queenslander. We recognise that there has been cross-subsidisiation on our F27 routes and that in the near future we have to work this out and provide a service for those people. They are just as entitled to a service as is anybody else. If we have isolated problems with the Holcroft report in regard to the jet routes, obviously it is fair to concede that there is probably a similar situation in regard to the F27 routes. I accept the fact that the F27 routes would probably have to take a pretty hefty fare increase, but let us not go too much further down the track before we sort that matter out. I believe, as the domestic air transport review pointed out, the trunk operators should get out of the F27s. I propose in this chamber tonight that East-West Airlines, running the F27s and consolidating the service to northern Tasmania, could do it better than the two operators are now doing. I think Bush Pilots Airways Ltd in Queensland could do better if it consolidated with one operator and ran the Brisbane to Gladstone service. It could run an F27 route through western Queensland and could supplement that service with commuter-type services. </PARA>
<PARA> I have taken the opportunity to flag the problems, as I see them. The Government has to say halt, that we have more than looked after the long-haul routes. As I said at the beginning of my speech, I support the Airlines Equipment (Loan Guarantee) Bill. For the reasons I mentioned, I reject the amendment moved by the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -The Australian Democrats can see the reasons why the Australian Labor Party moved this amendment. Senator Gietzelt put them very eloquently, but we also tend to dispute their relevance. We will support the Government and will oppose the amendment in this case. The Airlines Equipment (Loan Guarantee) Bill, in summary, authorises the Treasurer to guarantee a loan to Ansett Airlines of Australia of $US490m which will allow Ansett to buy 21 Boeing aircraft and which, in turn, will permit Ansett to compete with the Trans-Australia Airlines Airbus which comes into operation next July.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The circumstances of this loan to Mr Murdoch have been criticised heavily in the United States-that is a matter of record-and the loan has been the subject of a United States Senate Banking Committee inquiry. It was granted by the United States Export-Import Bank in record time. The Bank charged only 8 per cent interest, which is well below the interest charged on other loans by the same bank for the purchase of aircraft. Much has been made of the fact that, three days after the bank had approved the loan, Mr Murdoch's New York paper, the Post, endorsed President Carter's re-election. Last week a senior member of the United States Senate Banking Committee called on the Export-Import Bank to delay payment of the loan to Ansett while it examined whether part of the loan had been used for purposes other than to finance the purchase of the Boeing aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not see this Bill as an attempt to pre-empt the Senate's power to block or to modify the proposed two-airline agreement, although I can see why that suggestion might well have been made. We cannot realistically see airline deregulation being introduced overnight, even if it were feasible or desirable to do so. I think very few honourable senators would think that. This being the case, we are probably stuck with the two-airline system, or something like it, for a number of years. TAA is fully geared up for the introduction of the Airbus in July and already had these guarantess in terms of the Australian National Airlines Act. Is it fair to turn around at this very late stage and say to Ansett: 'Sorry, we will not guarantee the finance which will allow you to compete with TAA by purchasing new aircraft'? What would that do to the Australian airline operation? Certainly, this Bill will serve to prop up the two airline system for a few more years, but I think we all would understand that while we have it we should allow it to function, in the interests of the Australian people. Looking at that crudely and directly, that 8 per cent ought to meant that the cost of aircraft will be lower, and this advantage ought to be passed on to all Australians in the form of lower fares. We have enough problems of our own in this courntry without taking on the internal ones of the United States as well. If we were to make it our business to intervene in the financial affairs of any Australian in regard to loans negotiated abroad, we would probably do nothing else. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Gietzelt raised the matter of guarantees. They are there in the Bill. The aircraft equipment is collateral. Indeed, if there were a tremendous crash of this company I suppose we would end up, interestingly enough, with another government airline. We certainly would have a lot of aeroplanes to which we would be committee. The Australian Democrats' view is that we do not want to mess up the air transport industry any more than we have now-and that is quite considerably. Let us proceed with our approach to the deregulation issue along lines which we all know or should know will take time. I think honourable senators on both sides would see that. Meanwhile, we see no real reason to obstruct this Bill. As a result we propose to support it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The Bill the Senate is debating provides Ansett Transport Industries Ltd a Commonwealth guarantee for a loan of $US490m to purchase 21 new Boeing aircraft. Before I make my remarks on the Bill I must congratulate Senator Gietzelt, who I believe made an excellent speech and got right to the heart of the political machinations behind this Bill. Even though I do not completely agree with everything Senator Collard said in his contribution I must say that he showed an excellent knowledge of the airline industry and the tables that he had incorporated in the Hansard will, I am sure, benefit all honourable senators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> How can the Government expect this side of the Senate unequivocally to support this Bill which guarantees Ansett's $289m loan from the United States Export-Import Bank when the facts surrounding the nature of the loan are being questioned by the United States Senate and by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and with very good reason? The United States Export-Import Bank agreed to grant a loan of $289m to Ansett Transport Industries to buy 5 Boeing 767s but it has now been revealed that of that loan $34m will be used as credit memos for ancillary purposes. Some of the Bank's directors apparently expressed surprise that these memos existed. I suggest that there are probably some people in Australia also who would be surprised that these memos existed.</PARA>
<PARA> I must remind the Senate of the most unusual circumstances surrounding this deal. The loan was approved just six days after Rupert Murdoch's New York Post endorsed President Carter in the New York presidential primary in February 1980. Furthermore, the loan application was approved in half the time that is normally taken and at terms more favourable than those applicable to any similar deal that we know about. I think one of the reasons why the deal was approved was spelt out in an article in the Australian on 24 March 1981 by Bryan Boswell of the Washington Bureau. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> The loan to Ansett was made by the Ex-Im Bank during the Carter Administration, and was done to prevent the order going to the European consortium which builds the Airbus A300, ordered by TAA. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that is a fairly reasonable statement. There were also suggestions that there were kickbacks in the deal. The Australian Financial Review of 26 March 1981 in a report from the New York Times Service in part states:</PARA>
<PARA> The most recent set of allegations regarding kick-backs arose after bank officials learned that $34.2 million, or more than 17 per cent of the loan for the 767s was to go to finance pilot training, spare parts, advertising and a variety of other undefined services that would 'support' Ansett's purchase of the five wide body jets. </PARA>
<PARA> Bank officials say these activities, outlined in two credit memos, one to Boeing and another to General Electric Co. which makes engines for the jets, were not included in the original loan application, which said that the money would buy jets, engines and a limited number of spare parts and services. </PARA>
<PARA> The extra items were not detailed, either, in the loan agreement sent to Congress. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to make some remarks about the Holcroft inquiry because the Labor Party and, I believe, a number of Government back benchers, whether they are prepared to say it or not, were disgusted at the shabby treatment that the three members of the Holcroft committee received from this Government. The report that they did bring forward was a very comprehensive report especially when one considers the short period that the committee had in which to complete its inquiry and bring down its findings. I think the recently announced changes in air fare charges are an insult to the members of the Holcroft committee. We can see that as a token gesture to Western Australian Government back benchers the Sydney to Perth fare of $286 has been lowered by $15. What a joke! What difference will $15 make for the fare between Sydney and Perth? Can anybody reasonably suggest that reduction will create more traffic on that route? If the Government were fair dinkum about this it would be utilising some of the 1,000 seats that Qantas Airways Ltd has available each week on planes travelling between Sydney or Melbourne and Perth. I think it is interesting to read the words of Sir Lenox Hewitt, who of course is the former chairman of Qantas and who now works for Ansett Transport Industries. According to the figures that were given in April 1980 by Sir Lenox Hewitt, passengers would have been able to travel Qantas from Melbourne to Perth for $101 compared with the cheapest domestic fare at that time of $252. They would have been able to travel from Sydney to Melbourne and return for $54, as opposed to the cheapest domestic fare then of $85. The return fare for people from Western Australia travelling to Sydney and out of Australia, going to Honolulu or the West Coast of the United States of America would have been $337, which I believe was a saving of approximately $154 on the domestic air fare applying at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> Compare the miserable cut of $15 with the increase in the fare between Sydney and Canberra. That fare went up approximately $16. A Canberra family that wants to spend Easter in Sydney and does not want to travel on an antiquated train system but wants to travel with either Trans-Australian Airlines or Ansett will now have to pay $128 extra. TAA officials in Canberra have informed me that a number of cancellations have been made over the Easter period for Canberra to Sydney flights. I also found by inquiries I made today of Ansett that a number of school groups that intended to travel from Sydney to Canberra have in fact cancelled and they will now come here by motor coach. We all know that a large proportion of the traffic between the two cities of Sydney and Canberra consists of public servants, Federal parliamentarians and their staff, all of whose air fares are paid by the Government. Ultimately it is the taxpayers who will pay for this massive and unnecessary increase. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make some remarks about the sale of TAA. I think the first question we have to ask is: Why has this Government all of a sudden decided to sell TAA? The Minister claims that the Holcroft inquiry influenced his decision. But Mr Holcroft himself has denied that the inquiry ever suggested such a thing. An article in the Australian Financial Review of 2 April 1981 stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The chairman of the Holcroft inquiry, Mr Warwick Holcroft, last night said that he was positive that the report had not suggested selling TAA, or making it a public company. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that statement speaks for itself. It is quite plain to members on this side of the Senate that the Government had been waiting for any excuse to propose that TAA should be sold. The only people who would gain from a sale would be Ansett shareholders. The public would gain nothing except further fare increases. TAA, whatever anyone might say, is a profit-making enterprise. Its operating profit in 1973 was $6.76m; in 1974 it was $3.71m; in 1975 it was $4.51m; in 1976 it was $4.88m; in 1977 it was $9.51m and for the 1978-79 financial year it made $10m. TAA costs the Government absolutely nothing to maintain and makes a sizeable contribution to public revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest to honourable senators, especially those on the other side of the chamber, that they should check the profits of a number of airline companies overseas, not only international airlines, but also internal airlines, for example, in the United States. I suggest those figures I have just cited show TAA in a very good light indeed. TAA was brought into existence to compete against private interests and prevent undesirable economic and social effects which occur when any industry is controlled by a monopoly of private interests. On a number of occasions TAA has initiated fare cuts. It has been through its link with the Government that it has been able to push through these fare cuts. On occasions it has forced Ansett to follow suit. I do not believe that Australia can afford a situation where companies such as Ansett have to funnel off profits from their airways to prop up some of their other shaky enterprises. In this case I am referring to Ansett's link with Associated Securities Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA> It is totally unrealistic of the Minister to claim that TAA would not be run by a monopolistic group if it were sold. The sort of capital flow necessary to buy an enterprise even half the size of TAA would inevitably result in single corporation control. I believe, no matter what the Minister might say, that in the long term-certainly not in the short term-we would face the great danger of an airline such as TAA falling into foreign control even though it might appear on the surface as if the majority shareholding was still in Australia. Unfortunately, the Government has not seen fit to explain why or how it intends to sell TAA. I suspect that it has little idea but it is waiting for suggestions that might come from Ansett's owners who have been advocating the sale for many months. I do not think this Government can any longer deny that Ansett is running the Government's airline policy. What would happen if TAA became a public company? The Leader of the Opposition, Senator Button, made some remarks on this aspect yesterday. He quoted a statement by the Chairman of TAA. Unfortunately I have not been able to find the quote, but the Chairman said: 'This is marvellous. The first thing we will be able to do is get rid of all the unprofitable routes. We will be able to get rid of all those Fokker Friendship services in Queensland'. As a result of that nobody would win. The public would lose. </PARA>
<PARA> I have spoken here before and advocated a one-airline policy. I have suggested that in the future TAA and Qantas might be amalgamated. I do not believe that Australia can afford two international airlines, whatever Ansett says and whatever it might be trying to do at the moment to become an international airline. I do not believe our population could support two international airlines. We would have massive duplication. The administrative costs would be enormous. One of the big problems that is already faced by Qantas is that of administrative costs. Qantas, which serves a small population in Australia, has administrative centres in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, Brisbane, Darwin and now Townsville. I ask honourable senators to compare that situation with airlines such as the West German airline Lufthansa or KLM Royal Dutch Airlines. Both airlines operate out of single airline countries. Lufthansa's administrative centre is Frankfurt. It has a small operation in Munich. KLM operates only out of Amsterdam. Our international airline has to operate administratively out of six centres yet we are thinking about having a second international airline. Ansett is already saying that it will operate out of Adelaide. This would lead to a massive duplication of administrative costs. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that if TAA and Qantas were amalgamated large savings of equipment would be made. At present many of the aircraft of both companies are not being utilised. I know that part of the reason is curfews and the distance between the west coast and the east coast of Australia. We have idle aircraft at a time when the smaller states of the South Pacific are crying out for direct flights from Australia. A number of these countries have runways which are completely inadequate for the 747s. I give as an example Vanuatu, the newly emerged country in the South Pacific. This country depends desperately on tourism from Australia. It has entered into talks-I do not know that they could be described as negotiations-with Ansett Transport Industries which thinks it might be able to service the country with an international airline. </PARA>
<PARA> I am pointing out that if TAA and Qantas amalgamated, some of the equipment which at present remains idle because of curfews and other reasons-it is not idle because it cannot be fully utilised-would be able to service a number of these small countries. Destinations such as Fiji have tremendous amounts of traffic from Australia but in recent years have been overflown by the main international airlines such as Qantas and Pan Am World Airways. The Airbus equipment that has been bought by TAA is the best and most economic equipment to fly to Fiji and a number of South East Asian countries. As I have said, if Ansett is involved there will be more duplication of equipment, more idle time, and further increases in fares. Again it will be the public who will pay if Australia falls for a two international airline policy. If there were a merger between TAA and Qantas there would also be cheaper package deals for visitors to Australia. They would be able to see more at a more reasonable cost. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year a survey was conducted of all visitors to Australia. This survey indicated that of the people who were visiting here for the first time only 2 per cent went to Hobart and only 1.4 per cent went to Darwin. This is a tragedy, and one of the real reasons for those figures is the high internal airfares. We have a situation now where some visitors from overseas pay half of their original fare to be able to travel from the east coast to Perth. What has this Government done about it recently? It has given a magnificent decrease of $15 in the fare. </PARA>
<PARA> I have spoken here before about deregulation of the airline industry. I have to be fairly careful about this because a couple of years ago I put up an argument that the airlines could be deregulated on the east coast. I limited the deregulation to the east coast-Sydney, Melbourne, the Gold Coast and parts of north Queensland. I am still not sure whether that would work but more and more evidence is coming out of the United States, even though I admit there are conflicting reports that deregulation internally in the United States has not been the success that some people say it has been. We are finding that airline companies within the United States are seeking to amalgamate. Fewer and fewer airlines within the United States have been making profits. More alarmingly the latest statistics show that the safety record among the commuter airlines, which have felt the pinch the most, has been declining. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has no airline policy at the moment. It is bowing to pressure on all fronts except the one that counts, and that is the paying public. Let us examine the Government decision that was recently called a victory for the back bench. The Government back benchers from Western Australia and the Northern Territory gained a very small decrease in fares between Sydney and Perth. The two-airline agreement is to be renegotiated and TAA is to be sold. It is interesting to note the powerful weapon they used to get these concessions. They threatened to oppose the legislation which is before us tonight and which provides for the Australian Government to give guarantees on highly suspect loans to Ansett from the US banks, and it was a very good tactic. They did not waste time in arguing for the public's right to cheaper air fares. They did not waste time arguing about the public's right to better services. They went for this Government's weak spot. This weak spot was complete allegiance to Ansett Transport Industries Ltd. They knew that this Government would defend Ansett's interests no matter what might happen. They achieved more concessions than they could have obtained with any other bargaining weapon. </PARA>
<PARA> The back benchers knew that the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) was trying to pull a quick trick on them by putting all the Ansett loans into this one Bill instead of having them come through in four or five Bills as Government back benchers and the Opposition expected. At the moment we have a Government which one minute opposes any idea of selling TAA and the next offers it for sale. We have a government which one minute is about to present its new airline agreement, and the next minute we are told is to be renegotiated. I think we on this side of the House have to ask ourselves who is running Australian civil aviation. Is it this Government or Ansett Transport Industries?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to say just a few words about the Airlines Equipment (Loan Guarantee) Bill. I think it is quite important that we recognise the significance of the two-airline policy that has been evolved by governments over the years. This policy has its weaknesses, but I think in a country with a limited number of passengers to utilise these airlines we have to have regard to the economy of scale. I was attracted by what was said earlier this evening by Senator Collard who drew attention to the long range effects of decisions we make now. I think he said that he believed that we had gone too far with respect to air fares on long haul journeys. He referred to the matter of cross-subsidisation. I think he has drawn attention to a very important matter, one to which we ought to have great regard in the long term. I am certainly one of those who have not been satisfied that the Holcroft inquiry went far enough. It had a limited time in which to make its judgment. As a result its recommendations, in my opinion, were generalistic and simplistic in content. That suggestion was borne out by a member of the Holcroft inquiry to whom I spoke.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, I really worry about honourable senators opposite who reflect on history. It means that they are not progressive, that they are not up with the times and that they cannot recognise the contemporary winds of change. I support what Senator Collard said earlier. I think his comments have a lot of merit. The recommendations contained in the Holcroft report which have been accepted by the Government are as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> 2. A clear policy on air fare pricing be articulated by the Government in accordance with the guidelines and recommendations in this report. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. Air fare prices be related as closely as is practicable to the costs of providing the services. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. Air fare pricing be applied on a consistent basis on the national network.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. The Inquiry's recommended system for air fare determination be applied to air fare pricing on the national jet network and as far as possible its principles be applied in any regulated air fare pricing arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> 7. The regulatory authority examine airline costing procedures carefully and equip itself with sufficient information about the behaviour of costs and revenues to ensure that cross-subsidies are minimised. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Collard drew attention to that aspect when he said that the issue of cross-subsidisation was perhaps slightly underemphasised in the decisions that have been made. I believe in Australia we have to aim towards a consistent policy which will provide the best service possible to people who live in Western Australia and have to travel to Sydney, Canberra and other parts of Australia which are remote from their home base. I think we have to examine also the implications of the more profitable routes in Australia. The Melbourne-Sydney route is the obvious one to which we should draw attention. I believe people in South Australia are concerned that in the future the Government examine very carefully the total concept of the Holcroft report and have regard to its long term implications. In its report the Holcroft inquiry went on to recommend-this recommendation has been accepted by the Government-as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> 8. The air fare formula consists of a simple expression involving a fixed element and a single distance rate. </PARA>
<PARA>That recommendation also raises some problems. It seems to me to be over simplistic in its content. Nevertheless that is what has been accepted by the Government. Another recommendation that has been accepted by the Government reads:</PARA>
<PARA> 21. Where the Government decides that a community shall be provided with an air service which requires a subsidy of its viable operation, the subsidy be explicitly provided so that its cost is borne by the community as a whole and not only by other air travellers as a cross-subsidy. </PARA>
<PARA>The other recommendation that was accepted reads:</PARA>
<PARA> 23. Air fare pricing provide as wide a range of commercial discounts as is possible without imposing a burden on the full fare paying passenger. </PARA>
<PARA>The report also had regard to children. The Government has accepted the following recommendation:</PARA>
<PARA> The child's half-fare be not confined to economy class or restricted as to time of availability. </PARA>
<PARA>It went on to accept the proposition that:</PARA>
<PARA> The regulatory authority monitor the performance of the industry to ensure that passenger air services are provided as efficiently, as effectively, and at as low a cost as is possible. </PARA>
<PARA>A think that all these recommendations that have been accepted by the Government are very reasonable. However, I believe that the matters that were highlighted in Senator Collard's speech earlier deserve some support right across Australia. I think that in the long term the adoption of total concept of the Hocroft report would not provide the full answer to the future of Australian airlines. I suggest that the Government encourage the Holcroft committee to have another look at the problem and complete the inquiry that it was engaged upon because I do not think that it had sufficient time to take into consideration all implications of the whole question of the airlines in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -The Airlines Equipment (Loan Guarantee) Bill 1981, which is before the Senate now, provides a reason for a more wide ranging discussion on aviation policies and, in particular, the question of aviation charges or air fares, than the strict subject matter of the Bill which, of course, provides a guarantee for borrowings of Ansett Airlines of Australia for the purchase of new aircraft. In the last couple of months there have been a number of debates in both Houses on aviation policy and air fares. I did not previously speak in those debates because the speakers lists were restricted, but as a Western Australian I believe that I ought to take this opportunity to make some pertinent observations about aviation policy in general, and in particular the effects of the present policies which are about to be continued, on people from Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In this society there are two defensible principles of price determination, the underlying forces which determine what prices will be charged for goods or services. The first is that charges should be determined by cost. The second, which is adopted in particular in those areas where there is an element of regulation in price determination, is that people who are disadvantaged, either by geographic isolation or some other factor, will pay less than the full cost of providing the service. Of course that principle is applied in the provision of telephone services and mail services. The distant and sparsely populated areas of the country receive a cross-subsidy through Telecom Australia and Australia Post from the more profitable services which those authorities provide in the capital cities and the more densely populated areas. In my view either of those principles, under certain circumstances, can be applied. Either prices should be set by competitive market forces, unimpeded by government regulation, or under some conditions there is a case for government regulation or government intervention to compensate disadvantaged people for the financial disabilities of living where they do. </PARA>
<PARA> The ironic thing about air fares in Australia, over several decades, is that neither of those principles has been applied. Charges for particular journeys have not been determined by cost. The Holcroft Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares brought this out more forcefully probably than any previous investigation of this subject. But for a very long time it has been a matter of common knowledge to anyone who has taken a serious interest in it, that the long haul journeys are subsidising the short haul journeys. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that is correct. Neither of those principles, either that charges will be determined by cost or that cost will be modified by some principle of disadvantage, has been applied in aviation policy and in air fares. In fact we are in a completely indefensible position. The most geographically disadvantaged travellers in Australia are, of course, those from places such as Darwin and-if we just deal with the larger cities-people who travel to or from Western Australia from the south-eastern States. For many years they have cross-subsidised short journeys. Although the modifications announced by the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) last week ameliorate to some extent that cross-subsidy, it is still there-although apparently Senator Rae wants to dispute the matter. If anything, given that in many other areas this society accepts the principle, where there is a degree of regulation in charges the short haul passengers ought to subsidise long haul passengers because they are disadvantaged simply because they live where they do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The actual reductions in fares from Perth to Sydney and Melbourne in round figures are between $10 and $15 whereas, according to the Holcroft calculations, they should be in the vicinity of $50. The fares have been a long-running scandal which has not been corrected by the changes announced last week. A perhaps quantitatively less important, but in my view morally more important, scandal is the fact that economy class passengers have subsidised first class passengers for as long as fares have been regulated, or at least as long as Boeing aircraft have been used. Evidently Senator Rae does not take the Holcroft calculations very seriously. However he can go into that matter when he has an opportunity to speak. </PARA>
<PARA> Until very recently first class passengers paid a premium on economy class fares of 25 per cent. That was increased last year to 37 per cent, and under the charges announced last week by the Minister it has been further increased to 45 per cent. According to the Holcroft findings, the proper premium to charge first class passengers, if full costs are to be recovered, is a premium of 57 per cent. I would like to know on what economic logic or on what presumption of social justice a system which obliges economy class passengers to subsidise first class passengers and which obliges the geographically disadvantaged to subsidise the geographically advantaged can be justified? I add that, with respect to the cross-subsidy from economy class passengers to first class passengers, I do not believe from a reading of the report that the Holcroft committee considered items such as the provision of VIP lounges at airports. Although this is not quantitatively very important, I think it is symbolically quite important that the VIP lounges are used almost entirely by first class passengers. We have anomalies such as the fact well known by people who work around airports that such personalities as the Minister for Industry and Commerce (Sir Phillip Lynch) are notorious for walking into first class lounges and stuffing their pockets full of cigars. Ultimately, all that is paid for by the economy class passengers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I am not accustomed to such praise or approval. The other matter on cross-subsidies which I want to raise, and which again has particular relevance to Western Australia, is that the major trunk operators, TAA and Ansett, do not operate intrastate services in Western Australia. The main intrastate services--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a subsidiary of Ansett. If Senator Rae, either through his Committee on Finance and Government Operations or in some other way, can provide a detailed breakdown of the costs and revenue, and if he can isolate the MacRobertson Miller Airline Services subsidiary from the Ansett empire and accurately determine both revenue and costs, I would appreciate such an analysis. As far as I am aware, no one has yet been able to do that, and the Government does not insist that that subsidiary operation be isolated from its parent for accounting purposes. That is another matter which, in my view, ought to be cleaned up.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would be quite happy to do that. From the information available, and I concede to Senator Rae that the information cannot be taken as completely definitive, it would appear that MMA's intrastate operations are self-supporting. In other words, there is no cross-subsidy from the Ansett group to the MMA subsidiary. Indeed, if any cross-subsidy is involved it applies the other way. However, that situation does not apply in all States. There are limited services to Tasmania, a service from Adelaide to several points in South Australia, a service from Melbourne to Albury and, of course, numerous services in Queensland which are provided by the major trunk operators, either Ansett or TAA.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has it not? Actually, I did not say that it did. I said that the routes were operated by either Ansett or Trans-Australia Airlines in those various States. The Holcroft committee certainly did document a considerable cross-subsidy from the major trunk routes to the intrastate routes I have mentioned. In particular, of course, it is most notable in Queensland. I think from memory that the cross-subsidy or loss of $5m sustained by TAA-it is only TAA in Queensland which is operating the inland routes-is picked up entirely by TAA. That raises another interesting irony, or contradiction. The Queensland Government, of course, not only blackmailed TAA into maintaining those non-paying inland services but it also stipulated that TAA had to continue to operate those services with Fokker aircraft, when frequently they might have only half a dozen passengers on board an aircraft seating 40 passengers. The penalty for refusing to succumb to that blackmail from the Queensland Government was that that Government would cancel TAA's licences to operate the profitable intrastate coastal routes. As with so many other things that happen in Queensland, it is quite scandalous that that sort of blackmail should be allowed to succeed. It is the ultimate hypocrisy that the Government which blackmails an airline operator in that way should in different circumstances proclaim itself to be a paragon of free enterprise virtue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have said, the statement made last week by the Minister did modify some of the injustices which have affected Western Australians in particular. If I could digress, I want to say a few more words about Queensland. I am not suggeting that Queensland's outback towns should not have an air service. Indeed, they would continue to have an air service. Bush Pilots Airways Ltd is quite happy to provide a service using very much more economical aircraft. Apart from all the hypocrisy and humbug of the Queensland Government, it is on cost grounds completely irrational that for those relatively small, sparsely populated towns an aircraft the size of the F27 should be placed on the route. Very much smaller aircraft should be used. It is not a question of having an F27 service or no service at all but a question of having an F27 service or a service that is far more appropriate to the volume of traffic. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If there is a subsidy necessary, who should pay it?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If a social judgment is made that a subsidy is justified then in my view, since Senator Rae presses me for an answer, it should be paid either by the Government of Queensland or by the Government of Australia. Certainly it should not be paid by other airline passengers. If a subsidy is paid, at least it is out in the open and everyone knows what has happened; whereas only a very small minority, in spite of the publication of the Holcroft report, realise the enormous per passenger subsidy enforced by coercive means, and of course, the burden is being picked up entirely by TAA. The statement last week by the Minister did ameliorate to some extent, although not entirely, the long-standing cross-subsidy from long distance passengers to short distance passengers. I understand that at a Press conference last Friday it was suggested to the Prime Minister by a journalist that the Government's airline policy was indecisive. The Prime Minister vigorously denied that. In a sense, I suppose, he is right. How could one say that a government was indecisive when it makes a decision every day about aviation policy? In fact, that is what it did last week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One day the Minister for Transport issued this statement on domestic air fares. The next day it was announced by the Government, following some pressure apparently from a few people on the Liberal Party back bench and possibly even from somewhere else, that there would be an inquiry into the two-airline policy. Of course, that seemingly repudiated the unequivocal assertions which a number of senior Ministers had made over the past 12 months. When one dug a bit deeper-unfortunately this fact has not been properly reported, especially in Western Australia-it was revealed that the so-called inquiry was, in fact, a fraudulent exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister's statement in the House last Thursday was typically brought in at half past 10 in the evening in the full knowledge that media coverage of it would be minimal, coming in as it did at that time. It reminds me of Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle's sneaking out those Neimeyer statements at 6 p.m. once a month. Following the same principle, at half past 10 in the evening the Minister went into the House with a statement saying that the Government will establish an inquiry into the possibilities of deregulating aviation and that the inquiry will have five years in which to report. The next day, the Prime Minister, at one of his kerbside Press conferences with the electronic media only, said that it will probably take a couple of years to get the inquiry set up anyway from which, of course, it becomes obvious that some time within the next seven years this bogus inquiry into deregulation might actually come down with a report and some recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA> The same Government that truncated the Holcroft report at seven months has the audacity shortly afterwards to announce-and to expect to be taken seriously-that it is setting up an inquiry which will bring down some recommendation some time within the next seven years. On what basis does the Government justify a seven-month time period for one inquiry and a seven-year period for another? Presumably nobody who is aware of those facts will take this inquiry seriously. The reason that announcement was made was that there were a few mutinous rumblings and mutterings on the back bench. The Government was terrified that the Bill now before the Senate would not get through Parliament this week and Rupert Murdoch would not get his $500m guarantee. That inquiry is a bogus exercise, an attempt to deceive the people of Australia and the delivery by the Government of one of the pay-offs to Murdoch for his vigorous support during the last election campaign and in anticipation of equally vigorous support in future election campaigns. </PARA>
<PARA> The last point I want to make concerns the Minister, in particular, and his either abysmal ignorance or irrationality. The National Country Party-I think it calls itself that nationally these days but it calls itself something else in various States; it is the party to which Mr Hunt belongs anyway-had a conference in Canberra on 7 March. Mr Hunt was reported in the Sydney Sunday Telegraph of 8 March as saying that there will be:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . big reductions in air services if the two-airline agreement is dropped. </PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the parts of Australia that will suffer most will be Darwin and Perth. </PARA>
<PARA>He said that these cities:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . would not have access to the more sophisticated wide-body jet services that will be coming on stream in the '80s-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, if the two airlines policy were abolished. His rationale for making that assertion was that these aircraft would be concentrated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . on the most popular routes to make the most possible money. </PARA>
<PARA> Apparently Senator Rae wants to challenge this and I will be very interested to hear what he has to say. Apparently he has a different view. The Holcroft inquiry and everyone else I know who has made a serious attempt to study this matter has come to the conclusion that under the pre-existing fares at the time Mr Hunt made the statement-given that the average load factors on the Perth-Sydney, Perth-Melbourne and Perth-Adelaide routes are above the national average; so the load factor makes the Perth service even more profitable-the most profitable route in Australia given the same load factor, is the route from Perth to the south-eastern States. That, of course, begs the question: Why would any sensible airline manager decline to put aircraft on the route which has the greatest profit potential? Not content with that, Mr Hunt has made another comment. I understand that these answers came out in Question Time at the conference. I have also observed that the wildest statements that Country Party Ministers make seem to be reserved for conferences of the party faithful. I suppose they reason with considerable justification that they are dealing with a more ignorant audience when they are speaking to a Country Party audience than they would be when dealing with the population in general-a conclusion with which no student of the Country Party could seriously disagree. Mr Hunt said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it was not until the two-airline system came into operation that the State--</PARA>
<PARA>He was talking about Western Australia-</PARA>
<PARA> achieved regular scheduled services to the eastern States. </PARA>
<PARA>That just is not true. I am not sure just when regular scheduled services to Western Australia were established. They were certainly established by 1946 and the two airlines agreement started in 1952. Some 17 days later Mr Hunt was questioned in the House by the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) about the empty Qantas Airways Ltd seats which are continually available between Perth and Sydney or Melbourne and about allowing domestic passengers to occupy those seats. Around 1,000 Qantas seats in each direction each week are available. Qantas has publicly stated its eagerness to make those seats available at very substantial discounts. Because of the bureaucratic interference of this self-proclaimed free enterprise Government, those seats cannot be filled. In response to this Mr Hunt said:</PARA>
<PARA> Many people do not understand that if we allow a number of 747 aircraft to fly intermittently over these routes it will ultimately affect the volume of passengers available for the scheduled domestic services</PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate that some of us-it may not have penetrated the consciousness of members of the Country Party-realised that allowing those seats to be filled, although not on a one to one ratio, would, of course, affect the number of passengers available for 727 interstate flights. Indeed that was one of the reasons that we explicitly stated for making the seats available. The Government claims to have a fuel conservation policy. If all those spare Qantas seats were occupied six east-west flights per week would be redundant. That would save one-quarter of a million litres of fuel a week. But the Government is not interested. Not only is it not interested in facilitating that but it also uses its bureaucratic regulatory power to forbid that happening, and obviously has every intention of continuing to forbid its happening. I return to the Minister's so-called answer. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Ultimately this--</PARA>
<PARA>That is the cancellation of some existing 727 services-</PARA>
<PARA>must affect the frequency of the scheduled services to Perth, Darwin and elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA>I guess that is true. It would affect the frequency. But when reading that I wondered whether this fellow had ever actually travelled to Perth or, if he had not travelled to Perth, whether he had any idea of the timetables on which interstate flights operate from Perth. If people in Western Australia want to go to the east by air, they have two basic choices. They can go at midday or they can go at midnight, give or take a few minutes. It is not that some people would not be able to leave Perth at 6 p.m. or at 7 a.m. if some services were cancelled. Moreover, almost without exception, all the services which leave at midday or midnight, give or take a few minutes, operate in tandem. We have this absurd product of the two airlines policy in the form of the TAA-Ansett race on almost every route in Australia. Almost without exception, the services operating from Perth operate in tandem. Does this fellow not know that half of the services could be cancelled from Perth to the east without affecting at all the options that are available to Western Australian passengers? There are only two possible conclusions. Either this Minister is so ignorant of vital matters affecting his own Department that he is unfit to hold office, or this Government is so beholden to the commercial interests of Rupert Murdoch that it is dictating to him that he has to continue to administer a policy the primary objective of which is to protect the Murdoch commercial empire, and to that perhaps one could add the empire-building ambitions of certain bureaucrats in the Department of Transport, or Transport Australia, as I think it calls itself these days. </PARA>
<PARA> With respect to filling empty Qantas seats with domestic passengers, it has been said in the past that international services are not particularly reliable in sticking to flight schedules and so on. I guess there is some truth in that. Obviously a headwind would delay the arrival of an aircraft travelling 6,000 miles more than it would delay an aircraft on a short haul, and it is true that the Qantas international flights that come into Perth probably do not maintain their advertised schedules as accurately as do the domestic operators. But what is wrong with allowing Perth people the option? I have absolutely no doubt that for a discount of 50 per cent hundreds or thousands of Perth people would be quite happy to sit around Perth Airport for a couple of hours waiting for an international flight to arrive and then transport them to the eastern States. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak only briefly. I agree with most of the points that Senator Walsh made tonight, although not necessarily with the manner in which he presented them. We are debating the Airlines Equipment (Loan Guarantee) Bill 1981. This Bill basically guarantees the amount of money that Ansett Transport Industries Ltd will need to purchase 21 Boeing aircraft. Because the debate has widened beyond the strict terms of the Bill, I shall make some points that I intended to save until the Bill dealing with the two airline policy came forward.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Liberal members in Western Australia have been working for well over two years to adjust what they see as the inequities in the fare setting formula for long haul passengers. The Government, to its credit, has acknowledged this problem. Over the last 12 months or so every adjustment made to the fare setting formula has acknowledged this by increasing the flagfall and decreasing the cost per kilometre. But this is happening far too slowly. We have had the active support of an organisation in Perth called the fair internal air fare group. This is certainly a very strong and powerful ginger group. It has supplied us with a tremendous amount of ammunition with which we have been able to support our case. Our group was instrumental in persuading the Government to establish the Holcroft Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares, and we have encouraged the Government to hold up the ratification of the two airlines agreement until it has had the opportunity of studying the results of the Holcroft inquiry. Senator Walsh and many of his colleagues have made a great deal of the so-called truncation of the Holcroft inquiry. Many very important decisions had to be made very quickly by the Government as a result of the Holcroft inquiry. It was fairly important that its report be made very quickly. </PARA>
<PARA> The Holcroft report identifies three major areas of deficiency in the present method of controlling the airlines. The first is the gross cross-subsidisation that occurs in Australia, the second is the deficiency in the air fare setting formula and the third is the lack of accountability of the whole industry. Already interim changes in the fares have occurred. I stress the word 'interim' because it has been recognised by the Government that the changes that have been made recently are only interim. We certainly expect, along the lines of the Holcroft report, that the next change will be much more dramatic and will give greater recognition to the continuing cross-subsidisation on long haul routes. </PARA>
<PARA> I look forward with a great deal of pleasure to the establishment of a lengthy inquiry into the possibility of deregulation of the airline industry in Australia. It needs to be a long term inquiry. Deregulation has been in force in America for only a short while, and I think a longer period is needed before a proper assessment of that substantial move can be made. In passing, it must be remembered that when that deregulation occurred people said that it was a Carter move. But that move was supported by both major parties in the United States Congress. It was supported also by most commentators on the issue. Although many people question the decision, many of the reports now coming out of America suggest that it was a correct decision. I strongly support deregulation and will take some convincing that that is not the right way to go. </PARA>
<PARA> The third achievement has been the setting up of an independent tribunal to establish the fare setting formula. The Holcroft inquiry established that the Department of Transport does not have expertise in that area, that it is quite deficient in the area, and that a tribunal quite independent of government controls is necessary. The sorts of pressures which Senator Walsh spoke about and which operate in Queensland tend to distort the fare setting formula if such a decision is made by a department of a government. But an inquiry independent of those sorts of pressures can more easily and more accurately set future fares. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth area of recent achievement is the promise by the Government to commercialise Trans-Australia Airlines. This week in this chamber we had a debate on what the Australian Labor Party considers will be the disastrous consequences of that move. I suggest that if one of the three options that Senator Collard has been so widely propounding-that is, that a majority of the shares or all the shares should be retained by the Government-is taken up, then the only difference will be in the reporting methods under the Companies Act, which reporting will be much more substantial and much more exacting. This is a matter that I strongly support. But it is my personal belief that the Government would be well advised to sell more than 49 per cent of the shares to the general public. I agree that there should be limitations on the shareholding with the company, particularly by shareholders in existing airlines, and that particular care should be taken with regard to overseas involvement in the industry. If many of the things that we suggest should happen to TAA do happen, particularly in Queensland where there is an enormous amount of cross-subsidisation and unnecessary support of small centres, there is no reason at all why TAA could not become a very profitable organisation whose shares would be highly sought after. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TS7">Senator THOMAS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I am aware of that point. I suggest that still more needs to be done. We need to watch very carefully that the two-airline agreement which will be renegotiated takes account of the matters that Senator Walsh raised with regard to spare seats on international aircraft flying across Australia. We should also take account of the less secure position in which the new two-airline agreement places the third level airlines. I guess that each of us would have received a letter from East-West Airlines Ltd. In that letter, or series of letters, the airline made out a very strong case regarding the disadvantage that it finds itself in compared with its situation under the old two-airline agreement. I point out that the recent changes to air fares incorporated a 9 per cent general increase in air fares. This is not widely recognised. The people who are complaining about quite substantial increases in air fares between Canberra and Sydney or between Sydney and Melbourne must remember that those increased air fares take account of that 9 per cent increase. It has partly removed the cross-subsidisation. I sincerely hope, and assume, that the independent tribunal to be established to look at the air fare formula will remove that cross-subsidisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What else has to be done? Trans-Australia Airlines must be made more business-like, as Senator Rae pointed out. Senator Rae has shown me some of the features of TAA's annual report which show that many mistakes have been made in its operation. If we can make it more business-like, I will certainly support the selling of more than 49 per cent of its shares. I certainly support the removal from TAA of the imposition of having to fly uneconomical routes. I agree that many smaller airlines can fly those routes much more economically. In Western Australia MacRobertson Miller Airlines Services used to service the two coastal towns of Esperance and Albany. It proved, after a number of years, to be totally uneconomical to fly F27s to those ports. So, despite an enormous amount of political and Press pressure, it ceased to fly those routes. In place of the F27s we have quite large and comfortable turbo-prop aircraft which seat about 20 people and which undertakes six or seven flights a week compared with MMA's two or three flights a week. If one asks the locals now, they admit that they were crazy to complain about the loss of the F27s. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh, in his final comments, ridiculed the present parallel scheduling. I suggest that parallel scheduling will be a thing of the past once TAA acquires its Airbus and Ansett Airlines of Australia acquires its new Boeings. When those aircraft are in Australia the problem of parallel scheduling will be a thing of the past. I suggest that Ansett may have made the best decision. It will have a more flexible range of aircraft. I doubt very much whether the Airbus will often go to Western Australia in the near future because such a large aircraft is less flexible for Perth's relatively limited demand. I support the legislation. </PARA>

It is interesting to note that this Bill was introduced in the House of Representatives in the dying stages of a parliamentary week-in fact almost at 10.30 at night-so that no real comment could be made on it; although reading the House of Representatives Hansard I noticed that the shadow Minister for Transport attempted to make some comment but was not able to do so. It is even more interesting to note that the Bill went through the House of Representatives yesterday, which was a non-broadcast day for it, and came to us today, which is a non-broadcast day for us. So very little outside publicity has been able to be given to this Bill by way of broadcast. I do not know whether this is significant, but when one looks at some aspects of the Bill, I daresay it could be significant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This Bill does nothing for those people in Australia whose air transport services are at greatest risk. By 'those people' I mean those who live off the main trunk route. Many people are in that situation in Queensland, the State which I represent. These people have a definite need for air transport as there is no real alternative available. The Bill, as I said, is termed the Airlines Equipment (Loan Guarantee) Bill. I should like to develop an argument which suggests that it could well be termed the rural air services discrimination Bill. The Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt), in his second reading speech, said:</PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday I announced that the Government has taken an in-principle decision to establish TAA as a public company . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This announcement was not well received in Queensland. In fact it was received with a great deal of alarm. Many rural residents immediately perceived that their air services were in jeopardy. In rural centres in Queensland Trans-Australia Airlines has a fairly extensive operation. For instance, in the south-west of Queensland TAA services the towns of Birdsville, Charleville, Mitchell, Quilpie, and Roma. In central Queensland it has extensive operations, and in north-western Queensland it has similar operations. But all of these air routes which TAA services have been at risk. It was mentioned earlier that Bush Pilots Airways Ltd has had its eye on these services for some time. My colleague, Senator Walsh, mentioned that perhaps Metroliners could be used in this area, and that BPA would like to do that. I disagree with Senator Walsh in one respect because these areas in western Queensland, south-western Queensland and north-western Queensland not only have passengers to be taken over those routes, but they also have freight to be taken over those routes. People in those areas want to make sure that they have aircraft which will carry them and freight when necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only has BPA had its eye on these air routes. Senator Thomas mentioned another airline a few minutes ago which also was interested in operating in Queensland. So the air routes which have been serviced by TAA have been at risk for some time. Because of that, when it was announced that TAA would become a public company, many people in western Queensland, north-western Queensland and south-western Queensland looked at this matter with a great deal of alarm. They could see the possibility that TAA would soon abandon these routes. In fact, it took little time for people in TAA management to make up their minds that it would do so. After it was announced that TAA was to become a public company it was soon announced that TAA would pull out of Queensland's rural routes. The Chairman of TAA, Sir Robert Law-Smith, said that one advantage of becoming a public company was that F27 routes could be abandoned. </PARA>
<PARA> In Queensland a number of routes are sometimes called the milk run. They are called the milk run because the aircraft stop at different places en route between two major towns. But TAA is not really interested in having a milk run any more; it is looking for the cream routes, the routes between the capital cities, the routes where the real earnings will be. It seems to me that since TAA is to become a public company the first priority which it will have will be profits and not service to the outlying areas, especially the outlying areas of the State which I represent, Queensland. I acknowledge that some routes in Queensland are not profitable for TAA. In fact, the report of the Holcroft Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares mentioned that there is an $11m loss for TAA on Fokkers throughout Australia. Not all of that loss, of course, is incurred in Queensland. That is quite a substantial loss. </PARA>
<PARA> As a national airline, TAA provided a service to the people of rural Queensland, and it provided that service irrespective of the loss which it incurred. If TAA's services are to be withdrawn from Queensland rural areas it is important that they be replaced by an efficient service. I mentioned earlier that we must make sure that if we have a different airline in western Queensland we have an airline that flies the type of plane that can provide not only a service to passengers but also a freight service. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Transport must recognise that there is more to Australian aviation than the capital city routes. The residents in rural Queensland need a regular and an efficient air service, and they deserve one. Of course, Ansett Airlines of Australia also services some areas of Queensland with Fokkers, but those areas that it services are not away from the coast. The only places it goes to now with its Fokkers are Maryborough, Bundaberg, Gladstone, Rockhampton, Cairns and Weipa. But the point I make is this: This Bill will do nothing to help the people in those areas of Queensland that I mentioned-the north west, the west and the south west. For instance, the Minister, in his second reading speech, said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . new front line Boeing aircraft to operate on the trunk network. </PARA>
<PARA>How much will that interest the people at Charleville, Blackall or Winton? They are not interested in the purchase of new Boeing aircraft to operate on the trunk network; they are interested in the service they require which is an absolute necessity in the areas in which they live. Later on the Minister, in his second reading speech, specified how many Boeing aircraft were involved. He said that there were 21 Boeing aircraft. But nothing has been done to help the people in rural areas. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill, which is a loan guarantee Bill, is way out of the petty cash class. It guarantees repayments for Ansett of up to $US490m. This really is a staggering sum. If one looks at the amounts of loans which have been provided for Ansett and even for other airlines-even for TAA-one can see that this is far beyond anything which we have ever had before the Parliament. In 1972-73 a loan of $US30.608m-in round figures, $30m-was guaranteed for Ansett by the Parliament. In no other year since guarantees for Ansett commenced have we guaranteed an amount in excess of $30m. If honourable senators compared that $30m with what is involved now-$US490m-they will see that it is a staggering sum. It is more than 10 times greater than what we had previously. </PARA>
<PARA> I sometimes wonder, when we have a look at that $490m, what the ordinary pensioner must think when he or she is living on $64.10 a week. If he is paying rent he gets $5 a week to help him pay his rent. He looks at his total income of perhaps $69 a week and then sees that we here in the Australian Parliament are putting through a Bill which will guarantee to Ansett Airlines of Australia, a private company, $490m. I can just imagine what some pensioners think. </PARA>
<PARA> Why does the Government have to guarantee this Bill anyway? The second reading speech of the Minister did not even address itself to this question of why we in the Australian Parliament should have to guarantee such a Bill, a Bill to guarantee $490m to Ansett Airlines of Australia. If we look at the issue carefully and critically I suppose there is a good reason for its being done but I wonder whether that good reason will help the passengers in Australia. I received a document from the Library which did address itself to this question of why the Australian Parliament should consider guaranteeing $490m to Ansett Airlines of Australia. I shall read part of what that document said. It went into the whole affair in great detail. It stated in part:</PARA>
<PARA> One of the effects of giving loan guarantees is to provide an implicit interest subsidy equal to the difference between the actual rate of interest charged on the loan, and the rate that the borrower would have to pay if the loan were raised in the capital markets at commercial rates. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the Federal Government, or rather this Federal Parliament, is subsidising the interest payments of Ansett. If that keeps down Ansett's costs and thus its fares, I think that is fine. I think that is commendable. But would the savings be passed on to the passengers? I believe that this would be highly unlikely. In recent years Ansett has become a plaything of millionaires. Ansett has been bought and sold more times than King's Cross Station has been bought and sold on my son's Monopoly set. </PARA>
<PARA> To illustrate what I mean, let us examine the recent history of Ansett. I will start my illustration with a fairly insignificant but interesting aspect. In 1976, Ansett acquired 50 per cent of the shareholding in Biro Bic (Australia) Pty Ltd and Biro Bic (New Zealand) Ltd. But let us have a look at 1977. In 1977, Ansett acquired a 48 percent interest in Associated Securities Ltd. In 1978, Ansett acquired Avis Rent-a-Car System Pty Ltd. In 1979, ASL, which we will recall was purchased in 1977, was placed in receivership. Ansett lost $19m on the deal. Because it lost this $19m its shares slumped, something like we have seen with a couple of other companies only in the last few days. Because Ansett's shares slumped it seemed to a number of larger purchasers in the Australian market that perhaps this was a good time to get in and purchase some Ansett shares. So the Bell Group Ltd increased its holding at that time to 12.9 per cent of Ansett's issued capital. Ampol acquired a 20 per cent holding, Thomas Nationwide Transport Ltd acquired a holding in Ansett of just over 20 per cent and News Ltd acquired a 5 per cent holding. All that occurred mainly because of Ansett's acquiring an interest in Associated Securities Ltd which two years later was placed in receivership. Ansett lost $19m, its shares slumped and therefore it was ready for a raid from bigger purchasers. After Ampol, as I mentioned, obtained a 20 per cent holding in Ansett, Ansett Transport Industries Ltd itself purchased 20 per cent of Ampol's holding. This was described as a defensive measure. Because Ampol had purchased 20 per cent of Ansett, Ansett purchased 20 per cent of Ampol to defend itself. What followed was quite remarkable. There was a remarkable buying and counter-buying spree involving the Bell Group, Ampol, TNT, News Ltd, Messrs Holmes a'Court and Murdoch and two knights of the realm, Peter Abeles and Reginald Ansett. The hapless Reginald Ansett was out and Murdoch and Peter Abeles were in. </PARA>
<PARA> Who paid for all this trading and counter-trading? Who paid for Ansett's losses on ASL and on Avis too in recent years? I mentioned that a purchase was made of Avis. Who paid for those losses? There is no doubt at all that the travelling public paid for those losses. It would not be possible for anything else to happen. If Ansett is to hold its head above water, the travelling public has to pay for these losses. </PARA>
<PARA> I was referring earlier to fares. This Bill is likely to do nothing for the fare situation, to help those people in rural Queensland and other rural areas that I mentioned earlier who are being slugged anyway. I will illustrate the point by showing some comparisons between Queensland fares and fares between capital cities. I am going to look at economy fares between Brisbane and Sydney and economy fares between Brisbane and Melbourne and compare those with some of the internal Queensland fares-the Brisbane to Charleville figures, for instance. I am looking at the economy fares because I believe that one can really only equate Fokker fares with economy fares. If one travels in a Fokker one realises it is hardly first class compared with jet travel. In fact, I believe that Fokkers became known as Fokker Friendships because people had to sit so close together that if they were not friends before the flight they certainly were when they got off. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some of these fares. From Brisbane to Sydney is 747 kilometres and the fare for that trip is $91.20. If one travels from Brisbane to Charleville, which is 687 kilometres-60 kilometres shorter-the fare is $97.90, which is $6.70 more. In other words, a person travelling within Queensland on a Fokker Friendship from Brisbane to Charleville travels 60 kilometres less and pays $6.70 more than a person on a Brisbane to Sydney trip. Let us equate that with a Brisbane to Melbourne flight. Brisbane to Melbourne is 1,376 kilometres. The economy fare for that trip is $134.20. If one travels from Brisbane to Winton, which is 1,156 kilometres, and 220 kilometres shorter than the distance from Brisbane to Melbourne, one pays $145.50 to travel on a Fokker Friendship-$10.70 more. In other words, in Queensland if one wants to travel intrastate from Brisbane to Winton one goes 220 kilometres less but one pays $10.70 more. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation is the same with a great number of other fares within rural Queensland. Rural Queensland, in this regard, is being greatly disadvantaged. Residents in rural Queensland do not receive a subsidy such as the $5m subsidy for Tasmania. It was mentioned earlier in the debate here that a subsidy could be paid; perhaps that is something we could look at. But it is doubtful that the people in rural Queensland who are paying these high fares anyway will benefit from any cost savings if the Federal Government goes into hock for $US490m for Ansett. I say that they probably will not because any savings will not be passed on as fare concessions. I would say that it is more likely that the funds will be squandered. They will be used to offset car rental businesses and to offset losses on exotic new services such as the service between Tasmania and Christchurch, the one that is supposed to be making such a loss at the moment. I believe that no relief at all will be given to air travellers. </PARA>
<PARA> Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner, Senator Gietzelt said that this Bill has a stench. I was not going to say that. I was going to be a little more reserved and say that it has a nasty smell. I do think it has a nasty smell about it. We have to remember that the loans for these 21 jets are under investigation in the United States. We have to remember that the Bill was brought into the Parliament almost at the death knell on a Thursday night in the House of Representatives so that there could be no debate on it. We have to remember that it was brought into the House of Representatives yesterday, when the proceedings in that House were not being broadcast. It is incredible that the Bill was introduced into this place only this afternoon, given a first reading, and immediately proceeded to the second reading stage. If this were a real House of review we would not put up with that. We would want the Bill brought in here, given a first reading, and allowed to lie for some time so that we could look at it before going ahead with our speeches on the motion for the second reading of the Bill. But that did not happen today. The Bill was brought in today, the first reading was proceeded with, and immediately thereafter the second reading stage commenced. Of course the Bill will go through this place tonight at a time when the proceedings are not being broadcast. The people of Australia will have very little opportunity of knowing what is going on with this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> My colleague Senator Gietzelt moved an amendment to this Bill, and I reiterate the words of the amendment. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Leave out all words after 'that' insert</PARA>
<PARA> consideration of the Bill be postponed pending the outcome of inquires being conducted in the United States of America by the Senate Banking Committee, the General Accounting Office and the Federal Bureau of Investigation into the circumstances of the United States Export-Import Bank loans to Ansett Transport Industries Limited and its subsidiary. </PARA>
<PARA>I support that amendment. I would like to mention one other matter. When I was speaking perhaps five or 10 minutes ago, Senator Lewis was doing his best to interject with comments about the arguments I was using. I deliberately did not respond to him because I wanted to make sure that I kept on the track of what I was saying. However, I will say this to him, through you, Mr President. Senator Lewis certainly represents a State in this Senate. He represents the State of Victoria. I have got into a motor vehicle and travelled almost from one end of Victoria to the other in a few hours. One just cannot do that in a State such as Queensland. From Senator Lewis's comments this evening he obviously does not have an appreciation of the sorts of problems the people in western Queensland, south-west Queensland and north-west Queensland have to put up with in relation to travel. They cannot get into their motor vehicles and travel in a few hours from one end of the State to the other. </PARA>

It behoves people such as Senator Lewis, who comes from a smaller State, to listen to the comments of people from the larger States so that they can understand what the problems in those States really are. Senator Lewis may have suggested that some of the things I was saying were nonsense. I think that is one of the words he used. That is an indication that he just does not know what is going on.

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Parliamentary Contributory Superannuation Act 1948 to rectify anomalies and inequities and to make certain other changes. Honourable senators will recall that the Parliamentary Superannuation Scheme was amended in June 1978, having regard to suggestions made by senators and members and to the provisions of the various State parliamentary superannuation schemes. Those amendments have been in operation for almost three years and, during that time, certain anomalies and inequities have come to notice. </PARA>
<PARA> The most serious anomaly concerns the formula for calculating the retiring allowance payable to Ministers and office holders. One effect of the formula is that some members' superannuation entitlements are decreasing the longer they remain in the Parliament. The Bill introduces new provisions under which contributions and benefits will be expressed as a percentage of the salary payable for each office held. This is similar in concept to the basic pension scheme and will overcome the anomalies and inequities inherent in the existing additional pension formula. Nevertheless, the entitlements of some members will be lower, at least initially, under the new provisions and special arrangements have been made in these cases. The Government decided some time ago that changes were required and the new provisions will, therefore, apply to all members retiring on or after 1 July 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill makes a number of changes in relation to commutation of retiring alowances. These include extending the period in which members may elect to commute their retiring allowances to a lump sum, permitting members retiring on or before the end of the present Parliament to commute without any restriction as to age and giving the Parliamentary Retiring Allowances Trust power to defer a member's election to commute if it considers the member is likely to re-enter the Parliament within 12 months. The Northern Territory Legislative Assembly passed legislation in September 1979 to provide superannuation arrangements for its members. This Bill provides for benefit payable under the Northern Territory scheme to be treated for the purposes of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Superannuation Scheme in the same way as benefits payable under the State parliamentary superannuation schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's attention has been drawn to certain inequities concerning members of this Parliament who have qualified for pensions under State parliamentary superannuation schemes. The Bill does not make any immediate change in these provisions but will enable new arrangements to be introduced by regulation when the Government has had the opportunity to consider the matter fully. The Australian Government Actuary has advised that in the long term the proposed changes should not significantly increase the cost of the scheme to the Commonwealth. The Bill also includes a new delegations provision and a schedule of formal amendments to the Act. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the Airlines Equipment (Loan Guarantee) Bill 1981. I am from the State of Victoria, and the first think I would like to do is to tell Senator Colston, who is still sitting in the chamber, that on the map Victoria may appear to him to be a very small State but, believe me, if he were to drive from Mildura in the north-west to Orbost in the south-east he would be very tired at the end of a 14-hour journey of something like that. It is a long way. Let me assure him that I am well aware of the distances in Queensland. I am also well aware of the need for and the abilities of the small airline companies that provide the intrastate services upon which so many of us-whether we live in Queensland, Victoria, New South Wales, Western Australia or perhaps even in the very small State of Tasmania-rely.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I shall deal first of all with the amendment moved by the Opposition. I wish to point out the humour of the situation. Here we have the Opposition supporting an amendment moved by, of all people, Senator Gietzelt, whom I admire as a speaker but whose philosophy I cannot support in any way at all. Senator Gietzelt, of all people-he is perhaps one of the most trenchant critics in this chamber or in the other place of the United States of America-suggests that this Parliament ought to defer the consideration of this Bill pending inquiries which are being conducted in the United States of America. Good grief, Mr President, if this Government were to put forward that proposition members of the Opposition would rise en masse and protest at what a terrible thing it was that we were going to wait upon something happening in the United States. I intend to tuck aside that matter. One of these days we will get the opportunity again to refer to the amendment moved by Senator Gietzelt to the effect that legislation before this Parliament should await the happening of something in the United States of America. We will see where the Opposition stands on that occasion. Once again it has been proved beyond any shadow of doubt that members of the Opposition are opportunists. Opportunism is all that they are interested in. </PARA>
<PARA> I look further at the Opposition's amendment. Believe it or not, it wants to wait on the outcome of an inquiry by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. Senator Gietzelt, of all people, suggests that the Senate ought to defer its business until the FBI has completed some inquiry in the United States. It is utterly and completely beyond belief. It is one of the greatest jokes I have heard since I have been a member of this place. It is absolutely unbelievable.</PARA>
<PARA> I come back to the Bill and what it is all about. What do the people of Australia want from our airline industry? I put it to the Senate that there are three factors. It is utterly beyond question that the first and most important consideration is safety and reliability. That is what we want, first and foremost, from our airline industry. I think we need to consider two other factors-speed and convenience and the price. It seems to me that speed and convenience, which I have classified as a second factor, and price are related. The question of safety and reliability is independent and not related. It stands alone. It is the area in which there is not the slightest doubt that the Government must regulate the industry. I thoroughly support the regulating of the industry in relation to safety and reliability. That is an important concession on my part, I might say. Honourable senators will be well aware my opposition to regulations. I wish to refer to one aspect of the Holcroft report in relation to safety and reliability. On page 233, paragraph 14.45, the inquiry reported:</PARA>
<PARA> The Inquiry concluded that the matter of the maintenance of safety standards was not directly related to the goals of a regulated pricing policy and should be set aside. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, in considering pricing policies or, indeed, anything else, we can set aside safety and reliability, not because we do not consider them important-on the contrary, we consider them to be of the utmost importance-but because they are and will be matters for strict government regulation, whatever party is in power. We can set aside our considerations of safety and reliability. As the Holcroft inquiry states, they do not come into the question of price. Let us now have a look at what we are left with. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that until now the two-airline policy has served Australia well. Let us look at our aircraft. The latest jet aircraft serve Australia, and serve it well. They have a tremendous air safety record. In particular, I refer to the DC9 aircraft. Let me assure people of the safety of the DC9 aircraft, as told to me by the pilots who fly them. I am speaking of the people who happen to be interested in this debate and who think about the DC9 aircraft or are concerned about flying. A now retired senior pilot of one of our two major airlines told me that for the last five years of his flying life he flew nothing but a DC9 because that is what he considered to be the safest aircraft flying in the world today. Let us look at the runways that we have in Australia. I put it most strongly to the Senate that had we had a monopoly airline 30 years ago when we established the two-airline policy propellor driven aircraft would still be flying around Australia today. Without the slightest shadow of doubt, successive governments would have said that they could not afford the cost of upgrading the runways to carry the extra weight of jet aircraft. </PARA>
<PARA> That is what the two-airline policy has brought us. It has brought us strong, solid runways and decent airports throughout our nation. The two airlines both wanted to advance and both insisted upon introducing jet aircraft. I guarantee that we would still be flying Fokker Friendships or their equivalent around Australia had we not had the two-airline policy. My party has been in power for many years. I can assure the Senate that I have not the slightest doubt that my party would have said repeatedly, year after year: 'We cannot afford to upgrade the runways, so we cannot afford to have jets'. The Labor Party would have been even worse when it was in office. Let there be not the slightest doubt that the two-airline policy has served us well. There has been a cost. The cost has been the protection of fares and routes to ensure that both airlines have operated under a profitable arrangement. Surely, after 30 years of subsidising our national airlines it is about time we reached a stage where there is some reduction in that protection. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Collard earlier this evening I think put fairly clearly, succinctly and properly the proposition that following the recent change in airline pricing formula in accordance with the Holcroft report, passengers in the eastern States are now subsidising those in the West. In any pricing system, whatever it might be, some cross-subsidising is inevitable. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague Senator Rae said, the Holcroft inquiry recommended it. In fact the people in the eastern States, travelling on these shorter routes, are subsidising in a small way the people travelling on the longer routes. I am not being critical; I am merely stating a fact. I also state as a fact that some cross-subsidising is inevitable in any pricing system. I deliberately did not say 'in any regulated pricing system', I said 'in any pricing system'. Senator Collard has said to the Government-I think it is fair enough-'Stop it. You have gone far enough. Perhaps you have gone too far. Stop now and let us have another look at it'. I support Senator Collard completely. I say to the Government: 'Stop it. Let us have another look at it'. I go further than Senator Collard and I suppose I do so because of our different philosophies. We are in different parties and we have slightly different philosophies even though we go along the road together very far. I think it is time for Australia to introduce to the airline industry some influence of free market forces to see what effect they will have on the factors of price and convenience to the service to Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In chapter 14 of the Holcroft committee report the question of equity and cross-subsidy is discussed. It is argued that the Government should decide whether the cost of subsidising air services is outweighed by the benefits derived. It is argued that even when a subsidy is justified in such cases 'as the relief of physical isolation, the encouragement of national cohesion and the enhancement of family ties, or the operation of less efficient aircraft on some routes through airport or other limitations,' a direct subsidy will in general be cheaper than a cross-subsidy. The two major domestic airlines in their submissions to the committee warned of the dangers of discussing cross-subsidies when they involve an arbitrary allocation of costs to different activities. The inquiry could not accept this difficulty although it accepted the following proposition:</PARA>
<PARA> Rarely can a particular allocation of costs be shown to be correct when an organisation is producing more than one product. </PARA>
<PARA>This is true of any enterprise where market forces are allowed to operate. For example, retail stores frequently sell an item at cost or even below cost to attract customers into their stores and away from opposition stores. What is different about an airline? Regulations and, in particular, the arbitrary flagfall component of regulated fares make the new fare schedules suspect, and because of these arbitrary factors it appears that they may have overcompensated for some of the distance sectors. Unnecessary regulation always leads to the smart public devising means of circumventing it. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course we have our tax problems. For example, we know that nowadays many airline passengers from the west book Qantas Airways Ltd to New Zealand, get off in Melbourne or Sydney, cancel the New Zealand component of their fare and fly Qantas return to Perth. They are the smarties. They appear to prefer to travel Qantas, especially first class, as they find it a much more comfortable journey than that provided by Qantas's domestic competitors, Ansett Airlines of Australia and Trans-Australia Airlines. I wonder what would be the results if we introduced some market forces into the field. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Holcroft committee accepted was that regulation would continue and said that some arbitrary factors were inevitable. I question the validity of that proposition. It is clear that the Australian air transport industry is marked by a substantial degree of economic inefficiency. As I have said, the two-airline policy has served us well until now but after 30 years is it not time that we started to try to get some efficiency into the industry to the benefit of the fare paying passenger? I suggest that the new fare structures are suspect and certainly inefficient. Press reports now indicate that both airlines are operating almost empty off peak on their short haul routes such as between Canberra and Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent years the United States domestic air system has been substantially reformed. It has adopted policies designed to place increased reliance upon competitive market forces. Many of the elements stimulating those policy changes in the United States are similar to those currently present in Australia. They include frequent air fare rises, embarrassing comparison of performance between the regulated carriers and the less regulated operators and advances in economic research in the airline industry. I put it to the Senate that it will not be until free market forces have been allowed to operate in Australia that airline prices will be properly determined. Maybe it will then be necessary for the Government to provide direct subsidies to overcome the problems of physical isolation in various remote areas of Australia; but until then let us please have a look at the operation of free market forces in Australia and see what that might do to bring down price and improve speed and convenience for the travelling public of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is of some significance that we go back to considering the Airlines Equipment (Loan Guarantee) Bill 1981 which we are debating. I think that a casual observer could be excused for wondering what is the subject matter of the debate. The debate is about Ansett Transport Industries and its operating subsidiary Ansett Airlines of Australia receiving an international loan guarantee from the Government. That is what the Bill is all about. It is not about the two-airlines system; it is not about the report of the Holcroft Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares; it is not about whether Western Australia has suddenly been converted from getting a minor advantage to getting a major advantage. It is about whether an Australian company-one half of the protected duopoly should be given the advantage of a Government guarantee so that it can take advantage of conditions which it negotiated in the international market with the Boeing company and the American banking system on what might be regarded by many people as favourable terms. The mere fact that Ansett is taking a whole lot of old model 737s on which Boeing may have been very anxious to give favourable terms, is one of the things it will have to live with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The simple question that we have before us is, as a matter of some urgency, to decide whether we should approve of legislation for an Australian company to take advantage of a publicly negotiated position of advantage to Australia. For heaven's sake, could anybody be heard to say that he does not support that position? I find it somewhat amazing that some speakers from the Opposition side of the chamber have given the impression that they want to dispute whether one side of the duopoly under our present system, which they and our side of politics have supported, should get the same advantage as the other side of the duopoly in the form of a Government guarantee for its necessary loans for the purchase of aircraft. I just make the point that that is what the Bill is about. The rest of the debate has been interesting but irrelevant to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point I make is that whilst I support the Bill, it does not mean that I support some of the matters that have been raised. I feel that because others have gone off the track perhaps I should go off the track very briefly-and I propose to make it brief. In my brief excursion I wish to compliment Senator Collard from Queensland for bringing before the Senate figures which give rise to the question whether we have miscued somewhere in applying what people believe is the Holcroft formula. But I have the impression that nobody is really sure what the Holcroft formula is. What Senator Collard has done is to demonstrate that it is certainly open to question whether the Holcroft formula has not converted the situation of possible disadvantage for Western Australia into a situation of major advantage for Western Australians and people on other long distance routes as opposed to the short haul travellers of Australia which includes almost everybody except Western Australians travelling to the eastern States and Northern Territorians travelling-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Thomas for demonstrating that we need to look at the points made by Senator Collard. I will not take the matter any further. There have been some large misunderstandings, and perhaps Senator Collard has contributed to that in a significant way by the incorporation of his table in Hansard. Let us say that it was important to do what has been done to overcome a short term problem, but let nobody think that what has been done is holy writ or that it is the final solution. Let nobody think that Western Australians, as a result of a little political exercise well funded and well publicised, are able to rip off the south eastern States of Australia which are the mainstay of the airline system of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am amazed to hear some of the suggestions that are made. For example, I hear people saying that Western Australia has been subsidising the other States. If any operator or would-be operator of an airline in Australia were asked which route he would most like to have I defy anybody to come up with a person who would say he would like to have the Melbourne-Perth route. I would offer a wager, except that under the Standing Orders that is not permitted, that every such person would say: 'I would like the Melbourne-Sydney route'. Yet, according to the interpretation placed on the Holcroft committee report, the Melbourne-Sydney route has been subsidised by other routes. It is extraordinary that every operator could be so wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the other extraordinary aspects is the fact that if short haul air fares and medium haul and long haul air fares are compared with those of all comparable countries of the world it will be found that our former formula-that is, pre-last week-was comparable as to relativity with those of other countries. Short haul routes attracted a certain fare, as did medium and long haul routes, but suddenly since last week our long haul fares are totally out of proportion with the fares of comparable countries of the world. Everybody is out of step except Johnny Western Australia. That is what it boils down to. I do not want to suggest that we should immediately change the situation. I want to thank Senator Collard for introducing into the debate a degree of sanity and the suggestion that we should test the figures to see whether there has not been a rather horrible mistake which explains why Australia is now in the situation where it is out of step with every comparable country and where, if the situation is compared with the ambitions of every airline operator, all the airline operators are wrong. Everybody is wrong except the Western Australians when they say they will have cheaper air fares. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I simply project my fear that the Western Australian citizens have not been well served by what has been a slick, well publicised, well financed public relations operation which has not had regard to the realities. Unfortunately, the situation has been exacerbated by the interpretation of the truncated Holcroft committee report which did not purport to have determined conclusively what approach should be adopted in relation to the fixing of air fares in Australia. The Holcroft committee set a number of major qualifications to the way in which its report ought to be adopted. This opens the report to a number of major criticisms which may produce results such as those identified by the table which was incorporated in Hansard by Senator Collard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not want to say more than this: Good luck to those who have the advantage now from those of us who in the last seven years saw a 206 per cent increase in air fares before copping the latest 10.1 per cent increase. That concerns the Melbourne-Launceston tourist route which has suffered the heaviest increase in air fares in Australia. We say good luck to the Western Australians but they should not complain about a subsidy because we still got a 10.1 per cent increase from the last rise in air fares. That increase was more than the national average. As opposed to the Western Australian fare increase of 106 per cent in the last seven years air fares on the Launceston-Melbourne route increased by 206 per cent, with another 10.1 per cent increase in fares last week. </PARA>
<PARA> Let not the Western Australians say that they alone are upset about what is happening. The so-called $5m subsidy for Tasmania has turned out to be a $5m subsidy for Hobart. That is good for a part of Tasmania but is not good for equity in the Tasmanian tourist industry. Domestic tourists operate through Launceston because that is the shortest air section to Tasmania. It is not good for the idea that there is equity in fares for the people of the various States of Australia. I think Senator Collard's table simply means that we have to have a short term solution to the problem; I support a short term solution. I support the short term attempt. Let nobody think that that is the long term solution. Let nobody think that this is the end of the matter. Let nobody think that the Holcroft report, as interpreted by some, is holy writ and the final answer. Let it be known that there are those who can demonstrate by figures, as Senator Collard has done, that we have increased the disparities and not decreased them. I support the Bill which, as I said earlier, has nothing to do with what I have been talking about for the past 10 minutes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It was very interesting to observe Senator Rae's remark at the end of his speech because that remark seems to apply to most speakers in this debate on the Airlines Equipment (Loan Guarantee) Bill. Nevertheless, the Bill invited a wide-ranging discussion upon the whole aircraft industry, the purchase of aircraft and so on in this country at the moment. I wish to address the interest of the Senate to one or two matters that concern the Bill which were raised earlier in the discussion, in particular by Senator Gietzelt. He mentioned in particular the problems of the guarantees being applicable in certain circumstances, the number of loans which they covered and the difficulties he saw in the Government's committing itself to such a long range proposal. The agreements have been made at this time in order to facilitate the undertakings which Ansett Transport Industries Ltd is now entering into in order to borrow substantial sums of money to purchase this new generation of aircraft. I think it is the key to the whole matter of obtaining the loans that, indeed, these guarantees are agreed to by the Commonwealth Government. Although the sums of money involved are totally different from those which had been previously arranged, the principle remains substantially the same. The reasons are purely and simply that we are moving into a whole new generation of aircraft development in this country which envisages a new technology in relation to wide-bodied jets. It is one of those substantial moves which, if we are to continue a private enterprise involvement, requires government support of the order that we now are agreeing to by virtue of this legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I point out also that Senator Gietzelt drew attention to the fact that some of the loans which are being made available to Ansett Transport Industries through the Export-Import Bank in the United States of America at what appear to be concessional rates of interest, on reflection, may not be substantially different from those which may be obtainable from other sources. At this stage of the game it is a matter for negotiation, as I understand it. It may depend on the passage of this legislation and the degree of security which can be offered other lenders. In any case, notwithstanding that there may be only minor or even major differences between the rates of interest charged on these loans, the point is that the travelling public of Australia stands to gain substantially by virtue of the fact that this company, Ansett, is able to borrow at a substantially cheaper rate than otherwise might be obtainable on the commercial markets. Of course, that must be so if one recognises that higher interest costs will not be translated into higher fares. </PARA>
<PARA> As to Senator Gietzelt's further point following that line of thought, I think the feeling he was trying to express was, should the Government not guarantee these loans and should Ansett be forced on to the commercial markets and pay a more commercial rate of interest, that somehow would be beneficial to the travelling public of Australia. Quite obviously, the converse is true. The Government guarantee is a substantial factor in ensuring that fares in this country are kept to a minimum by virtue of the servicing costs on the loans for these aircraft being maintained at a minimum. So, in that very real sense, this Bill contributes in a very substantial way to the benefits of passengers that will be travelling on this new generation of aircraft in the years ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> A matter which I do not think has emerged clearly from the discussion tonight is that the guarantees given under this proposed new Act will be, of course, subject to final approval by the lenders being given. In fact, there are matters of negotiation leading up to the final conclusion of the arrangements with lenders. Of course, that includes the Eximbank in the United States. As to the protection of this Government's interests, clearly the arrangements will include provision for security over the loans in the event of default. That will entail mortgages over aircraft and other property, I take it. Australia's interest will be safeguarded by the arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the other matter Senator Gietzelt mentioned-and I think it flowed through some of the remarks of other honourable senators-concern was expressed about the length of time which will be taken by the deregulation inquiry. In fact, the terms of reference of that inquiry will require its report within five years. The fact is that the new generation of wide-bodied aircraft which this company, Ansett, will be setting in place will not be delivered until 1984. In fact, we are looking down the track quite a length of time to when new aircraft will be fully in place. Consequently, having had some experience of the operation of some part of Ansett's wide-bodied fleet-and, of course, of the Trans-Australia Airlines fleet-in the meantime, together with the operation of other aircraft, this will be of substantial benefit to those undertaking an inquiry. It will be taken into account in assessing the future regulation of the aircraft industry in this country. That appears to me to be a powerful argument in favour of giving this matter some time to settle down. </PARA>
<PARA> Essentially, the argument settles into a very clear debate about the stability of this industry and the need for it to have a basis from which to operate in the years ahead. In fact, the establishment of a clear policy directive from the Government, which is in part laid down by this legislation, indicates to the aircraft industry and those who are operating airlines in this country the direction in which we are headed. The inquiry on deregulation opens opportunities for the development of the kinds of policies which I think Senator Lewis mentioned. He spoke of the market forces, the need for those to be developed within the aircraft industry, the need for a freer flow in regard to fares and so on. Clearly, the inquiry on deregulation opens the opportunity for discussion in this regard. I thank honourable senators for all their comments in relation to the Bill. They are all constructive in relation to the development of the industry in this country. I wish the Bill a speedy passage.</PARA>

For many months, even extending now to years, it has been common knowledge among Canberra people that although parking tickets can be issued to drivers who park illegally in areas reserved for disabled persons, doctors, diplomats, and members of parliament, they cannot be fined for it. As a result, there is no legal sanction at all on these offences. Some people offend over and over again, and the situation has become notorious. I believe that only in Canberra could there occur the degree of muddle and crass inefficiency that has led to this situation.

The courts have declined to hear cases which come forward, and there are very many such cases, due to insuperable evidenciary provisions imposed by magistrates. The Registrar of Motor Vehicles in Canberra has disagreed but, as there is no appeal available to a higher court, no other avenue except a redrafting of the Ordinance has been available. </PARA>
<PARA> I first became aware of this situation last year. I forget exactly when it was, but it would be at least a year ago when I became aware of the implications of this matter on the parking situation in front of this very place. The parking areas outside our place of work, the Senate and the House of Representatives, are supposed to be reserved for members and senators but are not reserved for them at all. I gather that parking tickets have been applied 40, 50, 60 or 70 times to the same car and because of the absurd bureaucratic bungle which has been going on and which nobody seems in the least inclined to fix up, the situation has continued. When I raised the matter last year-I think it was about a year ago-I said: 'Please fix it up. If you do not fix it up it will be necessary for someone eventually to raise it publicly which might induce some kind of action'. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand now that agreement has finally been reached. Amendments were proposed and the Attorney-General's Department, I gather, opposed them or took some issue with them for a considerable period, again extending into many months. This delayed the matter yet further. Now I am given to understand that agreement has finally been reached, draftsmen have looked at the problems surrounding authorisation and a final draft is being prepared right now. Nobody in this cloud cuckoo land seems to have any idea when the situation will be resolved because the redraft will be a complete overhaul of Part X of the Ordinance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of the Capital Territory has tried to do its best. It has had the international disabled insignia painted on the ground in each bay set aside for disabled drivers. This at least has induced some sense of responsibility in the community and there has been a drop-off in the number of people parking illegally in such places. Even so, the courts will refuse to hear any action brought forward by the Department in respect of those zones reserved for doctors, disabled persons, members of parliament or the diplomatic corps. Many thousands of people in Canberra are now perfectly well aware that they can park in those places and that no real action can be taken against them. This has created what to my mind is an absolutely Gilbertian situation. I would not really have believed the bureaucracy could have got itself into such a tangle with such a lack of concern for its proper function-its proper functioning after all is to administer this city property; that is what the bureaucracy is paid to do-that it could allow this situation to continue for so long. </PARA>
<PARA> We ask that the bureaucrats involved in this dismal affair now begin to stir themselves from their lethargy and do something to tidy up this mess as soon as they can. We ask that they do this because great inconvenience and indeed some dangers are involved in Canberra whereby doctors and disabled people are not able to rely on parking in areas which have been reasonably and justifiably reserved for them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to refer to a Press release which was issued by the Acting Director of the Commonwealth Department of Education in Queensland, Mr Mackrell. The Press release was undated but it was received at my office on 6 April 1981. In the Press release Mr Mackrell said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . many needy families such as one parent or pension income families stand to miss out on a full term's entitlement of financial assistance for children in Year 11 and Year 12 under the Secondary Allowances Scheme (SAS). </PARA>
<PARA> The deadline for applications for full year entitlement is 16 April, the end of Term 1 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Press release goes on to point out that, because there has been a rearrangement of school terms in Queensland this year-in fact government schools have gone on to a semester basis-we now have four terms instead of three. The deadline for applications for full year entitlement at the end of term 1 is now much earlier than it was in previous years. In previous years the deadline would have been about another two weeks after 16 April. Mr Mackrell points out in his Press release that the number of applications received so far by the Department of Education in Brisbane is about 500 fewer than were received by the end of term 1 in 1980. It seems to me that because there is a new term arrangement in Queensland this year, a number of applications may not have been placed because people may have thought they still had further time to place those applications. I would not be surprised if some people thought they had until the end of the first semester because the word 'term' is used very rarely nowadays. People usually talk of semesters, and of semester 1 and semester 2. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PF4">Senator COLSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The cut-off would have been about the first week of May. The first semester ends about the last week of June and I think many people probably thought they had until then to submit their applications. In fact it is half way through the first semester, some time in April, that the first half-semester, if I can put it that way, ends. That is apparently deemed to be a term. I would like the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) to refer this matter to the Minister for Education (Mr Fife) to see whether it is possible on this occasion to extend the period by which applications may be lodged because this is the first year in which this has arisen, even if it were only for another two weeks. It will be very difficult within the next week or so to get the information out into the country areas of Queensland so that people will be able to submit applications by 16 April.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I realise that there may be some statutory reason why the period cannot be extended. If that is so, it is one of those things that we will just have to accept. I ask the Minister for Education to look at this problem to see whether the period can be extended to give these people the opportunity of submitting an application and, therefore, perhaps being entitled to the $100-odd which is provided under the scheme. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise tonight a matter which I was forced to raise on 5 March; that is, the failure of the Government Whip to make an announcement after the first division on any day giving reasons why a member of the Opposition was not counted in a division. I think the situation is most unfair. I raised this matter on 5 March because that day was two days after the original division when two members of the Australian Labor Party remained out of the chamber and were not counted in the division. That happened because there were two vacancies in the Senate because of two resignations. The Labor Party is very strict with its members. Whenever we are in the Parliament, unless we have a pair, we attend divisions. People reading the Hansard of 3 March would wonder why two members of the Labor Party failed to attend a division in this place. They would have had to read Hansard of 5 March to find the reason.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I first raised this matter after the announcement was made by the Government Whip. I sought an assurance from him that it would not happen again. Today we had three divisions. I think, in all fairness to the Labor Party, the Government Whip should have made an announcement after the first division, as former Senator Poyser did when he was Government Whip. I quote from what he had to say on 12 February 1975. Under the heading 'Pairs' on page 109 of Senate Hansard for 12 February 1975 the following is reported:</PARA>
<PARA> Senator POYSER:I seek leave to make a brief statement in relation to the arrangements of pairs. </PARA>
<PARA> The PRESIDENT:Is leave granted? There being no dissent, leave is granted. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator POYSER:I wish to indicate that in the vote just taken and any future votes taken this evening Senator Bessell will be paired with the vacancy created by the resignation of Senator Murphy. </PARA>
<PARA>We now have a somewhat similar situation because of the unfortunate death of Senator Knight. There is a vacancy in the Senate. The Opposition Whip has been good enough to make the same arrangement with the Government Whip as Senator Poyser made when we were in government. I think the Government Whip failed in his duty by not raising this matter after the first division today. If that was an oversight, there have been two divisions since then when the fact that we had granted a pair and the reasons for granting it were not recorded. If I had not raised this matter tonight a fortnight would have passed without the Government Whip being reminded of his being remiss. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, you may recall that earlier this evening before Senator McLaren spoke I indicated to you that I intended to seek the call to get leave to read a statement as I have done on other occasions. The statement reads: By arrangement between the Whips, Senator Georges did not vote in any previous division to compensate for the vacancy on the Government benches caused by the death of Senator Knight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I acknowledge the situation. Much business has been conducted in the Senate today. I am making no criticism of you, Mr President. I endeavoured to get the call from another occupant of the chair but failed. The occupant of the chair did not see me stand. I intended to read the statement I have just read. I get considerable liaison from the Opposition Whip and other members of the Opposition. I thank them for the courtesies that have been experienced over the last three weeks. I think those courtesies and that liaison have made the Senate work quite well, with the result that we have got through the various debates and the occasional division. I point out to honourable senators and in particular to Senator McLaren that after a division it is not always possible in the hurly-burly of debate to be able to stand, get the call and make a statement. Whips have to check the pairs to ensure that no mistake is made. I absolutely disregard the criticism that Senator McLaren makes. I assure all honourable senators and particularly members of the Opposition that whenever they give me the courtesy of arranging pairs I will acknowledge it as soon as possible. This is what I have done tonight. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have had several contributions to tonight's adjournment debate. I take first the matter raised by Senator McLaren. Everyone on this side of the chamber is grateful for the pair that is available for the vacancy created by the death of Senator Knight. It has been the practice since I have been a member of the Senate that whenever a vacancy has been created an arrangement has been made which cannot appear in the pairs list. Honourable senators will realise that this has been dealt with by the making of announcement. I point out how much I appreciate the co-operation that goes on between the Whips and the importance of this kind of arrangement to the good working of the Senate. I heard Senator Kilgariff's statement. One piece of business has been before the chair tonight. The adjournment was moved immediately that business was concluded. I ask honourable senators to accept what Senator Kilgariff said. Honourable senators want to acknowledge for the record the situation that is made possible by the arrangement that the Whips have made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Colston raised a most interesting problem. It is one which I will refer to the Minister for Education (Mr Fife). I understand that there has been a new arrangement of the school year in Queensland in 1981 and that he is concerned that this may have inadvertently led some people into making assumptions about the closing date for applications under the secondary allowance scheme. I undertake to make sure that the Minister sees the Hansard and that Senator Colston's suggestion is made available to him at an early date. I think the problem that the honourable senator raises is interesting and unusual. I will see that we get an answer for him at an early date. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Mason raised a question about the incorrect use of restricted parking areas by different groups of people and the non-enforceability of the Motor Traffic Ordinance. I think the honourable senator referred to section 155 (4) of that Ordinance, and to the fact that the courts will not enforce it. He made the point, if I understood him correctly, that the new ordinance will be ready for introduction shortly. He urged its early implementation. He described the situation as Gilbertian. The only words of William Schwenk Gilbert that come to mind are these:</PARA>
<PARA> But then the thought of dull MPs</PARA>
<PARA> All milling around in close proximity</PARA>
<PARA> And thinking for themselves</PARA>
<PARA> That no man can face with equanimity. </PARA>
<PARA>I undertake to convey the matter to the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman). Finally, I make an apology to Senator Mulvihill. He said during the adjournment debate last night-it is recorded at page 1267 of yesterday's Hansard-that he had made contact with my office in relation to some matters he wished to raise concerning a survey entitled 'Appraisal and implications of a survey of Abbott's Booby on Christmas Island'. He did inform my office. It was understood incorrectly at my end that Senator Mulvihill was to ask a question at Question Time today. My office had some information. I would have been present had we really understood what was required. I offer my apologies to the honourable senator. I have been advised that there has been much Press coverage of suggestions that the extension of protection of the Abbott's Booby bird will cause cessation of mining operations. This bird, which is an endangered species, is known to breed only on Christmas Island. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is committed to the protection and preservation of the natural flora and fauna of Christmas Island. The Wild Animals Ordinance provides protection against the killing or taking of any wild bird. The Abbott's Booby bird, which is native to Christmas Island, is covered also by the Migratory Birds Ordinance 1980 and the Endangered Species Ordinance 1980. It appears that the Christmas Island Phosphate Commission or the British Phosphate Commission-we can call it what we like-is not under any general direction to restrict jungle clearing for Abbott's Booby conservation. With the assistance of the phosphate commissioners the Abbott's Booby has been under study since 1967 when a survey was carried out by Dr J. B. Nelson of Aberdeen University. Dr Nelson is a world authority on the bird. Because of growing concern to save Abbott's Booby, a detailed survey of its distribution and status on the island was carried out in 1979 and 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the survey was under way and the results were being evaluated a moratorium on further clearing was instituted in certain central and western areas of the island known to be important breeding areas for Abbott's Booby. The moratorium expires some time around now but it can be extended if necessary. I understand that the results of the survey are being appraised at the moment by an expert panel which includes eminent Australians and, I understand, Dr Nelson, to whom I have already referred. Government decisions made will depend on the result of that assessment which, I hope, is progressing towards completion. I hope that answers the matters raised by the honourable senator. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to add to the response of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) in respect of parking at Parliament House. The Usher of the Black Rod has been pursuing the question of the enforcement of parking restrictions on the Senate side of Parliament House since 20 August of last year. On 3 November the Registrar of Motor Vehicles replied to Black Rod indicating that the difficulties involved in drafting an enforceable ordinance appear at last to be overcome. However, it is also stated that increasing the penalties and rectifying the deficiencies which have prevented prosecution for various offences will not lead to a significant improvement in the regulation of parking. That will require a considerable increase in the number of offences which can be dealt with in the courts. Prosecution procedures at the moment are cumbersome and manpower intensive, Black Rod has been advised. It is hoped that all these improved measures will be in force by the middle of this year. It has been a problem which has been looked at over a long period. I think we all realise that. All which can be done is being done as constructively and as quickly as possible.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Under the provisions of the Social Services Act, payments made to a pensioner for or in respect of a child are not taken into account as the pensioner's income in assessing pension entitlement. The Act also contains another concession which, in effect, provides that the amount of income which a pensioner may have without affecting his pension entitlement is increased by $312 a year for each dependent child. However, the additional income allowed under this concession is reduced by any payment received for that child.</PARA>
<PARA> Thus, the payments in question made by the Victorian State Government are not considered as part of a pensioner's income. The payments do, however, reduce the extra income concession extended to the pensioner in respect of the dependent child concerned. Similar payments made by other State Governments would be treated in the same way.</PARA>

Their duties included helping to devise strategies for the relief of victims, gathering necessary information and data relating to losses incurred by individuals and families, ascertaining the most pressing needs of members of the community, and providing general assistance and advice.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No. Under arrangements introduced in 1978-79, the Commonwealth provides assistance on a $3 for $1 basis for expenditures by each State on agreed relief and restoration measures where such expenditures exceed annual base amounts established for the State.
