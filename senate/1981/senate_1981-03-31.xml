<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-All Australians heard with deep shock and concern this morning the news of an attempt on the life of President Reagan. President Reagan has undergone surgery and his condition is reported to be good. His Press Secretary, Mr James Brady, who was also shot, is reported as being in a critical condition. One security guard and one policeman were also shot. A young assailant has been charged with these shootings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is the latest tragic example of the vulnerability of public figures in the United States to the threat of attempted assassination and part of an increasing pattern of political violence around the world which continues to shock all decent people. The news that we have of the President's condition gives us some relief. We have all heard the reports of his bravery and good spirits in the aftermath of this attempt on his life. We salute and admire him for it. We all hope and pray for his speedy and complete recovery. </PARA>
<PARA> At this time of trial, the United States Government and people are demonstrating yet again their great strength and resilience as a nation. The United States people should know that we in Australia respond to this shocking event in a spirit of complete sympathy, support and concern for all those people personally involved and their families. I inform the Senate that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) this morning sent personal messages to Mrs Reagan, to the President and to Secretary of State Haig, expressing our sincere concern and our hopes for a speedy recovery for all those involved. </PARA>

Does Mr Talbot allege that the Government has broken its promises about the provision of sporting facilities? Are there also complaints about a shortage of money for transport of those athletes on scholarships and about the state of the oval at Bruce Stadium in Canberra?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw the attention of the Minister representing the Treasurer to a recent article in the Adelaide Press which suggested that South Australia faces major cuts in tax sharing revenue. In view also of the recent remarks of the Minister for Industry and Commerce at a meeting of the New South Wales Liberal Council that the States would have to reduce their spending, can the Minister indicate whether the Commonwealth does intend to make major cuts in the amount of tax sharing revenue which South Australia receives? Can the Minister further indicate whether the reasons for these cuts are the reported fact that South Australia does not have an expensive country rail network overhead and the income South Australia is receiving from natural gas sales?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame MARGARET GUILFOYLE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There have been some newspaper reports on this matter and they were drawn to the Treasurer's attention. The States (Personal Income Tax Sharing) Act 1976 is presently being reviewed by the Commonwealth and the States. The States have indicated to the Commonwealth that they would not wish the existing tax sharing arrangement to continue unaltered. The Commonwealth Government is presently considering the views of the States with a view to determining its own attitude to the future tax sharing arrangements with the States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This matter is to be discussed at a Premiers Conference on 15 April. In advance of that conference it would not be appropriate for me to make any comment on this matter other than to indicate that it is the Government's general objective to reduce the size of the public sector and to make room for the very considerable opportunities for expansion of the private sector which have developed as a result of the Government's economic policies. Within the context of whatever new tax sharing arrangements are determined, the Government will be considering the share of the total entitlement to be paid to South Australia in the light of the inquiry of the Commonwealth Grants Commission into relativities between the States. The Grants Commission is required to report before 30 June this year and, as the report will not be available until later in the financial year, the question of States' shares will not be determined at the Premiers Conference to be held on 15 April.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Attorney-General. Has a major new crisis erupted in the last few days in the funding of legal aid in Victoria? Is there a shortfall of approximately $1m in the funds required for the Australian Legal Aid Office to be able to grant aid at the normal rate between now and the end of this financial year? I ask the Attorney-General whether he will confirm that the following steps, among others, have so far been taken to meet the crisis: The axing of the position of Family Court duty solicitor, a substantial increase in the contributions required for those granted aid, a redefinition of the notion of merit to exclude numerous applications which would otherwise be within the guidelines, the outright rejection of at least 15 per cent of applicants who would otherwise be within the guidelines, a deliberate delay in the processing of applications and, most importantly and alarmingly of all, the implementation of a deliberate policy of deception in the Melbourne office in which senior officers have apparently directed junior officers to tell lies in response to inquiries-namely, in the case of those to whom legal aid is likely to be granted, that the delay is simply the product of a typing crisis; and in the case of those who are not likely to get aid, that their applications are under sympathetic consideration. Finally, I ask: Does the Minister accept responsibility for the maladministration apparently lying behind this new crisis? Does he approve of the administrative steps which have been taken so far and which I have outlined? Will the Government provide the funds that are necessary to overcome the crisis?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the previous Budget there was a very substantial increase in the provision of funds for legal aid. In fact, I think the increase was somewhat in excess of the rate of inflation, as it has been for many years. Administering these funds is always very difficult. As I have said over and over again, the funds are always stretched because of the demands upon them. Therefore, from time to time in the course of administration situations can develop which require some corrective measures. I am unaware of the particular matters Senator Evans has raised. I will certainly investigate them. I hope I will be in a better position to provide a detailed answer in the next day or two, after I have had the opportunity of doing that.</PARA></TALK.START>

I refer to allegations by the Director of the Bangkok office of the International Red Cross, Francois Perez, that doctors along the Thai-Kampuchean border had treated 65 people with poisoning symptoms between 7 March and 15 March. Repeated allegations have been made over a considerable period that Vietnamese forces are using chemicals and poison gas in Kampuchea and Laos, and in Laos particularly against the Hmong people. In evidence given to the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence a representative of the Hmong people detailed these allegations several weeks ago. Having in mind the fact that last year the United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution calling for an investigation of the use of chemical warfare in many parts of the world, which resolution was predictably opposed by the Soviet Union, Vietnam and Laos, will the Government again raise this matter in the United Nations and press for a thorough investigation of these repeated allegations?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, follows a question asked in this place on 25 March by Senator Kilgariff concerning the proposed makarrata or treaty of commitment with Aboriginal people. The Minister, in his reply to Senator Kilgariff, enumerated those proposals from the National Aboriginal Conference which the Government has rejected out of hand. Today I ask the Minister: What financial and legal issues will the Government be prepared to negotiate on for a makarrata? What steps is the Government taking to negotiate with State governments on these issues? Will the Government announce a timetable for the completion of negotiations concerning a makarrata?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter of negotiations with the States has only recently been opened up at the ministerial Australian Aboriginal Affairs Council meeting in Darwin. The only agreement we have at the moment is the agreement of several of the States to negotiate with the National Aboriginal Conference. The matter is clearly at a very early stage at this moment. I think it will take some time before the States and the NAC are in a position to have any kind of agreed position, and it would not be appropriate at this stage to indicate a proposed date for the makarrata to be finalised. From our point of view, we are keen to investigate with the NAC a number of areas which we can examine together. All that has happened is that we have responded to the first proposals by the NAC by rejecting some of the matters which we felt were not a basis for negotiation. The Government has been prepared to acknowledge a whole range of matters. It has been prepared to acknowledge prior occupation. It has been prepared to acknowledge dispossession and disadvantage, as it has done in legislation which has come into this place. In fact, I have suggested to the NAC that it may wish to put a series of proposals to the Government about outcome objectives which we might aim for in a whole range of Aboriginal advancement programs. The Conference has yet to come back to me on this and other matters, but we are looking to an active participation in developing another proposal for government.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I draw the attention of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to an article which appeared in yesterday's edition of the Courier-Mail wherein it was reported that two Aborigines have died and a number of others have been admitted to the hospital in Alice Springs as a result of what now appears to have been strychnine poisoning. I seek the Minister's assurance that he will use the authority of his office to ensure that a full and complete investigation is made of this incident to ascertain the person or persons responsible and that such person or persons are brought to justice. I further draw the Minister's attention to the closing paragraphs of the article and ask him to demonstrate officially his abhorrence of the callous and discriminatory manner in which the author fails to make any distinction between the death of dogs and the death of my people. Mr President, I crave your indulgence to read from the article to demonstrate why I find it so offensive to me and to other Aborigines. The article is headed 'Poison possible deaths cause' and commences with a report concerning the number of people involved and so on. It then states that police did not know what was the cause at the time. The offending part reads:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been confirmed that an Aboriginal male and female are dead and that six other Aborigines have been admitted to hospital as a result of strychnine poisoning on 29 March. It is believed that the poison was contained in a bottle of wine which was consumed by the group. Samples from the hospital patients and from the deceased have confirmed the presence of strychnine. The group involved was composed of Aboriginals from Papunya, Indulkana and Hermannsburg. The honourable senator asked whether I will use the authority of my office to investigate the matter. The event occurred within the Northern Territory. The Northern Territory police are actively involved. The police investigations are now being carried out under Detective Chief Inspector Pope. They are continuing. Like Senator Bonner, I hope that the investigations will very quickly reveal the cause of the deaths and that if people were responsible they will be apprehended.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have not seen the Courier-Mail article to which the honourable senator referred; and I have not seen the last paragraphs which he has just read out. It is a matter of tragedy that anyone should have been poisoned as this group of Aboriginals were. I think all honourable senators would agree with that statement. I hope that it was not the intention of the Courier-Mail to offend Aboriginal people. If that is what has occurred, I am sure the newspaper will be appropriately apologetic.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister representing the Treasurer aware that Mr Robert Holmes a'Court made a tax free profit of about $16m during his recent share market raid on the Elder Smith Goldsbrough Mort company? Did Mr Holmes a'Court avoid capital gains tax on this transaction by the simple device of buying the Elders shares in the name of a subsidiary company and then selling the company rather than the shares? Does the Minister realise that Mr Holmes a'Court's manoeuvre has deprived the Government of approximately $7.5m in revenue? As this tax avoidance device has been used several times before, why has the Government failed to take any action to close the loophole? Is the Minister aware of prevailing expert opinion that the proposed new catch-all provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act designed to pick up all tax avoidance schemes will probably be ineffective in the case of this device?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The reports of profits made by the Bell group of companies in relation to shares in the Elder Smith Goldsbrough Mort company have been noted. The Treasurer has commented that the secrecy provisions of the income tax law prevent the Commissioner of Taxation from informing either him or any other person about the tax consequences of this case. The Treasurer, however, stated that he is in a position to speak in general terms about relevant provisions of law. Section 23AAA of the Income Tax Assessment Act is one relevant provision. It applies to make taxable profits realised on the disposal of any property that is sold within 12 months of its acquisition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is also section 26 (a) which specifically requires the inclusion in assessable income of profits arising from the sale of property acquired by a taxpayer for the purpose of profit-making by sale or from the carrying on or carrying out of any profit-making undertaking or scheme. There is still another provision-section 25 I-which is of general application and which in broad terms makes assessable any business profits which can be characterised as income as that term is ordinarily understood. I understand that the Treasurer has already indicated that if any undue weakness in the tax law in this area were demonstrated, he would recommend appropriate amendments to the Government.

I am not terribly impressed by an answer which says that that section catches a capital gains tax transaction when in fact this person and his colleagues, by this transaction, escaped paying $7.5m in tax.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Commonwealth Government's policy regarding the subsidisation of both diesel and petroleum fuels relates, first of all, to the freight subsidy scheme which virtually equalises the wholesale price in the metropolitan area and the country. The retail price, of course, is a question for State governments. Equally, there is no road tax on diesel fuel used off roads on farms or in other undertakings. I have received representations from the mining community at Coober Pedy. I sympathise with the miners in their problems. They explain that they now have high costs and, in particular, the high cost of explosives.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I pointed out that the fundamental need for us is to ensure that for the future there is available in Australia a sufficiency of middle distillates-the diesels and gasoline. That is the primary task and the main thrust of our energy policies. Secondary to that we are aiming to produce those fuels and to supply them to the community at a lower cost than virtually anywhere else in the world. We are supplying gasoline at about half the price it is in Europe and Japan.</PARA>
<PARA> I have reiterated to them the freight subsidisation scheme. The primary thing we must do is to ensure the supply of fuels. In a world in which fuel is dear, obviously our fuel cannot be cheap. Nevertheless, we are providing it at prices which are far more competitive than those in most other countries.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. Pensioners receiving a small additional income from superannuation, bank interest on savings or, perhaps, part time employment are being more and more disadvantaged as they move up the income scale, despite the fact that increases in income in no way match the increases in the consumer price index. When does the Government intend to revise the allowable income table for pensioners, many of whom are now losing their pensions or their benefits?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Small increases in pensioners' incomes should not result in their receiving total amounts which are less than the increase in the cost of living. The income test which was introduced by the Government in 1976 provides for the withdrawal of pension income at the rate of 50c for every additional dollar of income. A pensioner who receives additional payments of income therefore is better off, and of course, also has the benefit of the twice-yearly indexation of pensions which was put in statutory form by this Government. There are problems for pensioners who get into the taxable area, and that does result in a higher withdrawal rate than 50c in the dollar. But the fact remains that their position still is improved. It has not improved by as much as they would wish but there is no point at which a pensioner's income actually goes backwards.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a quite separate problem with respect to fringe benefits. The honourable senator opposite is assisting me in making sure that I answer the question totally. It is true that when one gets to the income limits at which the pensioner medical card ceases to be available there is a substantial loss of benefits, and that can be regarded as a matter of considerable hardship by a pensioner. At the same time if we are to maintain any rules which aim to ensure that the available finance is directed to those who are most needy, it is necessary to have income tests and cut-off points. It is difficult to avoid there being cut-off points which are seen as inconvenient or even creating hardship. The matter which has been raised by the honourable senator is one which certainly has exercised my mind and, I am sure, the mind of my predecessor and indeed the minds of her predecessors. To date the Government has not been able to introduce anything which would remove that sudden cut-off of the fringe benefits. I can say, however, that the matter is continuing to receive attention, and it may be that we will come up with some better solution for the future.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry. Is the Government aware of the enormous harm and damage being done to the pig industry through imports of subsidised hams and pig meats from communist countries such as Romania and Yugoslavia under brand names such as Trump and Yugo which has resulted in the closure of canning plants in Victoria and in Queensland? Further, is the Government aware that the firms which are importing these pig meats already have large quantities of labels ready to be used for the importation of canned beef unless the present policy on pig meats is altered?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of concern which has been expressed in parts of Australia about the importing of ham and the effect that that is having on local industry. The matter was indeed raised some time ago in the Senate by Senator Primmer with respect to Victoria and I think I wrote to him about a week ago giving him a response to the matter which he had raised. The honourable senator from Queensland has pointed out that the problem is one which is not confined to Victoria but also one which is of concern to growers in Queensland. As I have already advised Senator Primmer, but not on the public record, in fact the Government has taken action in this area. There has been an increase in the imports of canned ham. In 1980 there were imports of 907 tonnes compared with 126 tonnes in 1979. This gave rise to claims by domestic canners that imports were being dumped.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Department of Business and Consumer Affairs instituted an inquiry into imports from the two countries mentioned by Senator Bjelke-Petersen-Romania and Yugoslavia-which are the main suppliers of the increased amounts of ham being imported. In January the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs announced that its Minister had accepted price undertakings from both countries not to sell below normal values, and the inquiry was terminated. The Government has taken other action, though. The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs sent a reference to the Industries Assistance Commission which included a request to examine and report within 12 months on the need for long term assistance for canned and bottled meats and to report within 75 days on whether short term assistance was necessary for the canned ham industry. The confidential report of the IAC on that matter has been completed. It is not a public document. Consideration of the report by the Government is expected in the very near future.</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the second part of the honourable senator's question, I was not aware and I do not think the Minister was aware of any firm holding large quantities of labels ready for use on imported beef. If the honourable senator has particulars of this matter she might like to let me or the Minister for Primary Industry have them so that the matter can be examined and appropriate action taken.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The introduction of permanent part time employment in the Australian Public Service and other areas of Commonwealth employment is currently under consideration by the Public Service Board and other employing authorities such as Telecom Australia. Consequently, the Department of Finance has been examining the superannuation arrangements that might be provided under the Superannuation Act 1976 to permanent part time employees. Northern Territory employees comprise a relatively small proportion of the number of contributors to the Commonwealth superannuation scheme. It would therefore not be appropriate to consider extending cover under the Superannuation Act to permanent part time employees of the Northern Territory before decisions have been taken in relation to the terms and conditions to apply to permanent part time employment in the Commonwealth generally. Such terms and conditions are primarily the responsibility of the employing authorities. I understand that the matter may take some time to resolve, but arrangements have been made to keep the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory informed of progress. As I said, it is a fairly complex matter and it may take some time but I undertake to keep the Chief Minister informed.</PARA></TALK.START>

I am not aware of the reports from the Northern Territory to which the honourable senator adverted. It is quite clear that any mining in the Northern Territory which is to take place on Aboriginal land would have to take place under the provisions of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976. The Act lays down quite specifically the process to be followed by anyone wishing to mine on Aboriginal land insofar as it requires the land council in question to negotiate upon the instructions of the traditional owners and the Minister to issue certificates stating that he is happy that particular processes laid down in the Act have been properly carried out. I know of no reason why we would be departing from the provisions of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act insofar as they relate to Aboriginal permission, to consultation with Aboriginals and to the other matters of concern to the honourable senator.</PARA></TALK.START>

The facts regarding the arrangements, as I understand them, are that the Commonwealth, in its original offer to the States on the post-1981 welfare housing arrangements, offered base level funding of $200m each year for five years. The Commonwealth stressed that this was a base level funding only and that total funding would be decided each year in the Budget, whereas I believe Mr Baldock was making the point that no such arrangement existed.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Commonwealth, after considering those views, decided that each State should have complete freedom to decide how it would spend these funds. Accordingly, a revised offer was put to the States. That meant the retention of the $200m per annum forward commitment. Of that amount, $54m was for pensioners and Aboriginals. States are completely free to determine the allocation of the other $146m. Incidentally, that money is provided at the highly concessional interest rate of 4 1/2 per cent.</PARA>

It remains a fact, however, that the mining of uranium has proceeded. That fact is evidence of the point which was made by the honourable senator in his question, namely, that a large number of trade unionists are in favour of the mining and export of uranium. It is a matter on which I understand there is some vigorous debate within the trade union movement. Some of its leaders, so-called leaders and ex-leaders have put very strong views in favour of mining, whilst some, including, I understand, the current President of the ACTU, are against it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the papers. </PARA>
<PARA>I take this opportunity to comment briefly on the tabling of these two very important reports of the Tertiary Education Commission and the Schools Commission. By way of preliminary remark, I draw the Senate's attention to the fact that they recommend guidelines for funding for the years 1982 to 1984. The report of the Tertiary Education Commission also reviews tertiary education in Australia from 1975 to 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate of the diversity of the tertiary education sector, which now embraces 19 universities, 69 colleges of advanced education, about 200 major technical and further education colleges with 900 annexes and other institutions. Involved in all these institutions are approxi- mately 800,000 students, including, of course, part time students. Approximately 41,000 academic staff and over 40,000 other staff are involved also. The total financial assistance from governments in 1980 was in the order of $2,100m, of which 80 per cent came from the Commonwealth Government. From these reports it appears that in the tertiary education sector, as might be expected, the rate of growth in enrolments is declining. The balance of the rate of growth is moving away from the university and CAE sectors into the TAFE sector, but overall it can clearly be said that a no-growth position has been reached. </PARA>
<PARA> What I particularly want to draw attention to, what I argue emerges from these reports, is that the Government's education policy is becoming increasingly out of step with its professed development policies. It is frequently said in this chamber, and of course we have debated it from time to time, that we are on the eve of a resources boom. </PARA>
<PARA> This is perhaps in some ways very encouraging but it will not be sufficient. It is not sufficient to say this unless, if I may put it this way, the knee bone is related to the thigh bone in government policies. The implications of this are seen in respect of the education sector. If any honourable senator on the Government side need further detailed information about this, I commend to them a number of papers on these topics which were published by a former shadow Minister for Education and which deal very thoroughly with the areas to which I refer. </PARA>
<PARA> What is needed in the education sector are policies which are designed, in some respects at least to ensure that jobs flow from the development of those education policies, and particularly in relation to high technology industries. We need education policies designed for the 1980s. Somebody said about this country quite recently that we are now beginning to grapple very satisfactorily with the issues of the 1960s and that somebody looking at this society from outside would be pardoned for assuming that we are mildy retarded as a society. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it was the distinguished shadow Minister for Science and Technology in the House of Representatives who said that. I am indebted to Senator Martin for prompting me. I overlooked it for a moment. In connection with the need for policies for the 1980s I refer the Senate to pages 266 and 267 of the summary of the Tertiary Education Commission's recommendations for 1982-84. On page 266, the Commission refers to 'an increased likelihood of structural and technological changes in the economy which may require men and women to change occupations during their working lives'. The Commission went on to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Training institutions should continually examine the relevance of the courses they offer in terms of their broader value as well as their specific vocational purpose . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me, if I may make the comment, that in this report the Tertiary Education Commission is at last getting to grips with the nub of that rather silly argument that has gone on as to whether one is a generalist or a vocationalist in relation to education. I think that is an important step forward because that argument is one in which people have always taken rather fixed positions and sides and it seems to me that what we should be seeking in the education system is broad general education as the TEC report points to, having regard to likely social and technological changes. But within that context, there is, of course, no necessary objection to, no reason why there should not be, quite specific vocational elements related to technological change. In fact, just a few minutes ago I saw a newspaper article about Canada and its specific educational emphasis on high technology and the efforts of the Canadian Government in effect to establish, related to Canadian universities in the west of Canada, a sort of silicon valley complex for Canada in terms of applied and pure research in relation to technology. On page 267 of the report, there is also an important reference to the training of engineers in Australia, engineering being a profession which has become the classic example of lack of foresight in terms of manpower training considerations. </PARA>
<PARA> I would argue that the Government has failed consistently to give any lead in relation to some of the education issues which are now raised in these reports. There have been a number of marginal belt tightening diversions by the Government in terms of restrictions on study leave, fees for overseas students, the pursuit of student organisations for one idealogical reason or another, and things of that kind but they are not in any sense new or major initiatives relating to the important central issues in education which should be concerning us. </PARA>
<PARA> When a government controls, as this one does, the tertiary education sector, it cannot in any sense be laissez-faire control; that is to say, a government has obligations in respect of the overall guidelines and leadership which it sets. In that context, the Tertiary Education Commission report asks for several things. First of all, it asks for broader based courses to cope with technological change. I have referred already to paragraph 9.32 on page 266 in the summary of recommendations which deals specifically with that issue. Secondly, the report deals with the question of rationalisation. There has been a lot of discussion of rationalisation of tertiary education institutions. I think it tends to be conceded across party lines that we have too many such institutions. The question is: What does one do about it? Does one take the steps that the Callaghan Government in Britain took when it closed about five institutions in one week, or does one try to work out other methods of rationalisation?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not five in one week, Senator. It was more like one in five years in Tasmania. The important question is how one tackles rationalisation and on page 268 the report deals with that question. At paragraph 9.42 the Commission, whether one agrees with its view or not, comes to grips with the question of teacher education and, in particular, what it sees as the 'redirection of effort' as it calls it. The report states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commission supports a major redirection of effort in advanced education from teacher education to the technologies and business studies . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In paragraph 9.42 of the report the Commission goes on to say how it believes that result can best be achieved. I quite appreciate that the Commission in dealing with that issue in this way is ignoring the argument about how many teachers are needed in society, what the teacher-pupil ratio should be, and so on. But, within the limitations in which the TEC operates and under the guidelines under which it operates, it at least has grappled with the issue raised in that paragraph to which I referred. </PARA>
<PARA> The views set out in the report of the TEC are in a sense very strongly reinforced and supplemented by the report of the Australian Schools Commission. I, like other honourable senators, have not had a chance to read all of that report. Really, these sorts of reports ought to be discussed in great detail in this Parliament because for the first time, I think, they start to go to the heart of the issues which should be the concern of those involved in the political debate about education in this country. The Schools Commission report at page 14 and in adjacent pages discusses in some detail the question of youth unemployment. One of the things mentioned on page 14-I suppose in a sense it seems to encapsulate something of the problem-is that the Commission feels that terms such as 'new underclass', as used by Husen, and 'residual group' which originated in Denmark capture the essence of the problem. The Commission is talking about the fact that the schools system is not adequately catering for a section of the school population and that this will lead in society to the development of what the Commission in this context calls a new underclass. That has a melodramatic flavour about it, but in a sense it does perhaps capture the important point which the Schools Commission is trying to make. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I agree; it is a point of the utmost importance. The Australian Schools Commission report also talks about 'learning for life' and the question of 'adaptability'. In a sense this complements the reference in the Tertiary Education Commission report to the need for broad educational goals to be set in the interests of adaptability for students of tertiary education institutions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I hesitate to do this but I commend to honourable senators the first chapter of the Schools Commission report because it takes up a number of issues which were dealt with in a document called 'Education and National Aims' put out a year or so ago. I also commend that document to honourable senators to read. If they read that statement called 'Education and National Aims', a speech delivered, I think, at Townsville in May last year, they will see that the Schools Commission has in fact taken up many of the issues raised in that statement, including the necessity for the education system to be concerned with questions of social cohesion and the relevance of the economic relationship between this country and the neighbouring countries of South East Asia in a situation in which the economies of many of those countries are developing rapidly and having regard to the importance for Australia of being able to have a better interchange than we have been able to have in the past not only in terms of language which is very important but also in terms of the exchange of technology and so on. I believe that that is a matter of vital relevance which the Schools Commission has taken up. I noted in today's Canberra Times a report by Professor Karmel, the Chairman of the Tertiary Education Commission, which deals with some of the issues I referred to in both the Tertiary Education Commission report and the Schools Commission report. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> Education should have a broad outlook and cater to the need for social and intellectual development of individuals in areas including politics and economics, the chairman of the Tertiary Education Commission, Professor Peter Karmel, said at the weekend. </PARA>
<PARA>He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . there were dangers in imparting too narrow a vocational perspective to education. </PARA>
<PARA> Knowledge of the world of work, including knowledge of why different kinds of work command different rewards, was not vocational education, he said. </PARA>
<PARA>He further said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is important to emphasise that the teaching of specific skills at schools will not in itself create jobs, although young people with those skills may be in a better position to compete for the jobs available. It is also important to emphasise that vocational training at school is not an essential element in informing students about the nature of work and in creating more positive attitudes to work. </PARA>
<PARA>The article continues at some greater length. I want to make the point that Professor Karmel made in the newspaper article, no doubt with the knowledge that the TEC report would be tabled at this time. The article involves a point which I think we should face up to in the so-called education debate. I refer to the lack of Government response for nearly six years, the parsimony of funding in some areas and the very little imagination shown in relation to education policies. In 1981 with the advantage of these reports perhaps we can get more expressions of hope and new education policies than we have had in the past. Both the reports are forward-looking documents. I believe that it is very much up to the Government to respond responsibly to the reports. </PARA>
<PARA> In referring to the Schools Commission report may I also pay a very sincere tribute which is both a personal tribute and a party tribute to the former chairman of the Schools Commission, Dr Ken McKinnon. Whatever virtues people may see in the new chairman, I think it is true to say that Dr McKinnon presided over the Schools Commission with imagination and compassion and, if I might say so, with a very steady nerve because the Schools Commission, in the last few years, had something of a tightrope to walk. I think that Dr McKinnon was able to keep together a number of forces in education which might have become very hostile and, in a sense, disintegrated. He created in the Schools Commission a state of mind whereby it was capable of appreciating the views of others. </PARA>

But assuming that the Minister had any nerve and imagination then he suffered a crisis in relation to those things when he failed to re-appoint Dr McKinnon as chairman of the Schools Commission. I believe, no matter what anybody else might like to say, that Dr McKinnon has been a great Australian public servant. In his chairmanship of the Schools Commission he displayed his talents to the full. The Government has made a decision about appointing a new chairman. I wish him well and hope that he has the same imagination and nerve as Dr McKinnon had. I hope this Government will not overlook the very real qualities that Dr McKinnon has and what he has to offer to this country and that he will not be left languishing in some research job, or something of that kind, when his talents and integrity are much greater than deserving of that. I hope those matters will be taken account of by the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The only other comment I want to make at this stage is to speak briefly about the relationship between education and the so-called resources boom. It seems to me there are a number of impedimenta which prevent this country from grappling with some of the issues in the resources boom as we ought to do. I think that many opportunities are being lost to Australia because we are not talking about the right issues in the Australian political debate. We are not addressing our minds, as a country, to anything but rather short-term solutions. Countries I regard as more healthy democracies in the sense of imagination do not seem incapacitated by such problems. I refer to countries such as Norway, Sweden and particularly Holland where, for example, there has been for some time a very conscientious effort to relate aspects of the education system to the industrial development of that country. I refer the Senate to a paper on the management of technological change by Dr J. L. Farrands, Secretary to the Department of Science and Technology. To an international conference of the Australian Academy of Technological Science last year he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The prime characteristic of the Australian way of managing technological change in general, and research and development in particular, is the almost unique absence of central planning. We are, I suppose, as close to laissez faire as it seems possible to be in modern societies. </PARA>
<PARA>No doubt for ideological reasons that will strike a warm inner glow in the breasts of some people in this country; the thought that we are as close to laissez-faire as it seems possible to be in a modern society. In relation to technology and education I am not sure that we should be as warmly complacent as that. It seems to be a pretty accurate description of our situation and in my view it is an accurate description of the dilemma we face. Frankly, I believe we have in Australia a respectable research capacity and considerable talent in industry, universities and organisations such as the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. It is a tragedy that a lot of that talent and work is allowed to drain overseas because of the lack of applied skills and imaginative initiatives in Australia. I believe that we spend too little on research and development. If we are to survive and move ahead as a technologically advanced, export-earning country something has to be done. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is true to say that our research and development effort is biased in favour of basic and government-supported research. There is a need for a lot of encouragement in industrial research and development. There is a need for a lot of flexibility in manpower between industry, universities and the Public Service. These are issues which seem to flow from some of the considerations raised in the report of the Tertiary Education Commission. I will give a very good example of where we have had success in these matters. If I might say so to Senator Scott-it is not my wont to hand out gratuitous compliments to the National Country Party-the history of this country when the bias in Australian research effort was very much, I believe, a result of Country Party pressure significantly loaded in favour of rural industries, we achieved quite outstanding results. Very good relationships were established between government, producer organisations and research effort in this country which produced good results and made our rural industries competitive and very efficient. If we are to achieve anything in employment arising from educational effort, if we are to achieve higher export earnings from manufacturing industry, the same process will have to take place in relation to Australian manufacturing industry and Australian resource development as took place in an earlier period of our history when we got that recognition of the relationship of research to industry and the co-operation between industry, government and research institutions which has done so much for Australian rural industry. </PARA>
<PARA> In a small industrial economy such as ours there is a need to make positive decisions to concentrate research and development efforts in particular areas. These are matters which arise from some of the recommendations in the Tertiary Education Commission report. We fancy ourselves, quite properly I think, as a society which has relatively high living and educational standards, much higher than many other countries. Because of the fact that we are European in culture and outlook, we regard ourselves as a developed country. In the economic sense we will not remain a developed country unless we give much more attention to the issues which are raised in these reports. I sincerely commend the contents of these reports for serious consideration and debate in this Parliament in the next few weeks or months. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to make a few remarks on both the Tertiary Education Commission report and the Schools Commission report which have been tabled today. Whilst I disagree with many of the conclusions that have been drawn by Senator Button, there are at least two matters that I do not depart from. One is the importance of providing an opportunity for general education issues to be aired in the way that they are being aired briefly today, although it is extremely difficult to comment when one is faced with a report of the Schools Commission which runs into some 500 pages, and six volumes from the Tertiary Education Commission. Both are substantial reports and set the ground rules which will change the nature and shape of Australian education in the years to come. The other point in which I concur with some of the remarks made by Senator Button, is about the contribution made by Dr McKinnon to the work of the Schools Commission over the years that he was chairman.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will make a few remarks about the Schools Commission report but confine most of them to the Tertiary Education Commission report. If honourable senators look at page 27 of the Schools Commission report, they will see a table which shows the relative enrolment between government and non-government schools. The table shows that from a high point in 1905, when 81.1 per cent of children were in government schools and 18.9 per cent were at non-government schools, the change in enrolment has been quite significant. Now we are looking at 77.7 per cent in government schools and 22.3 per cent in non-government schools. In the period from 1975 to 1980 the change in enrolment between government and non-government schools shows a decline of one per cent at the government level and a corresponding increase of one per cent at the non-government level. </PARA>
<PARA> The Schools Commission, in coming up with its specific recommendations, has turned its attention to one of the funding aspects. It recommended that Federal contribution to recurrent costs for government schools be increased from $230m in 1981 to $237m in 1984 and that the corresponding figure for non-government schools be $317m in 1981 and $369m in 1984. This represents an increase of $52m for the non-government sector, compared with $7m for the public sector. Frankly, if that trend persists I think we will see a revival of the worst form of sectional and sectarian disagreement in the Australian education system that we have been cursed with for a long time. Those sorts of disparities are becoming intolerable. I believe in the provision of government assistance to non-government schools. As a matter of principle, I always have. My education was entirely in government schools. I appreciate the argument put by people in the non-government sector about the amount of catching up that they have to do. That is undoubtedly true. There are still-probably my school in Sydney is one that falls into this category-government schools which are also substantially in need of an increase in their resources and allocations. </PARA>
<PARA> I think in the middle 1960s one of the debates that was bitter and divisive in the Australian community was the general so-called state aid debate. It has been largely laid to rest as a political issue. It has now largely been laid to rest as a constitutional issue. If we are to see $52m spent in the non-government sector in a brief period, compared with only $7m in the government sector-which services roughly four times the number of children at school-we will need a far more penetrating debate about the relative value and merit of the way in which we allocate resources to schools. We made commitments in the policy speech about the way in which the six levels of the old Karmel scheme would be compressed into three and how we would achieve certain targets as far as resource allocation for non-government schools is concerned. I do not cavil for one minute at these views, but I raise a warning that if those figures fail to be understood, analysed and above all justified by governments in the education debate, the issue of community divisiveness which would otherwise be present, but I think not at the highest level in the education debate, would surface again to the detriment of the education system, to the detriment of the political system and above all to the detriment of the kids in schools. That is a very important matter for a government to come to grips with when it is looking at its response to the Schools Commission. The Schools Commission recognises this. In paragraph 3.34, after discussing, in a chapter, the relative public and private schooling issues, the Commission states:</PARA>
<PARA> This is a situation which cannot be left simply to drift to a point where the community is polarised. It is time to consider and introduce gradually to both government and non-government sectors a means of orderly development which meets the wishes of Australian society. Unless this is done, increased difficulties and even divisions are inevitable. </PARA>
<PARA>Nothing could prejudice the future of the Australian nation more than its entering the decade of the 1980s and beyond with a division and polarisation about the rights of kids at school and the necessity to come to grips with those issues. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the Tertiary Education Commission report and congratulate the Commission and Professor Karmel on bringing down what I think is probably the most useful set of reports that the Tertiary Education Commission has produced. This sets us off in a large number of new directions-new areas-and comes to grips, as Senator Button said, with fundamental issues. One of the great problems that has plagued the post-secondary education debate in Australia has been a failure to understand where the various responsibilities of the universities, colleges of advanced education and technical and further education colleges begin and end, where they shade into each other and where they are distinct. One of the things which the TEC report has done-and done most successfully-is to sharpen those lines of delineation, to say what is appropriate to universities, to CAEs, and to TAFE institutions. It has come to grips with that, in particular, on the question of research. Volume 1, Part 1, paragraph 6.28 of the Commission's report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission believes that the academic staff of universities and CAEs should be involved in scholarship, research and public service. Universities and CAEs both have a commitment to teach undergraduates, but universities have a special institutional commitment to scholarship and research and to training scholars and research workers. They are funded accordingly. CAEs do not have such a commitment, although individual staff members should be expected, and indeed encouraged, to undertake activities of this type with an emphasis on practical application. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to make funding recommendations accordingly. I think it is terribly important to start understanding the pressure that is coming from CAEs. They want additional moneys to fund research and the Commission has said: 'No, the research cake is limited and, with only the most minor deviations, that research money is more appropriately expended through the universities'. It goes on to make recommendations about the colleges granting masters degrees, and a very strong recommendation that they should not even think about getting into the doctorate of philosophy process. </PARA>
<PARA> The next thing I would identify in the TEC report is that despite all the wind and rhetoric that we heard on the question of study leave when the TEC's report on study leave was produced and presented, the evidence that comes forward in the report is that the new study leave arrangements have worked pretty well, that there has been a considerable increase in the amount of study leave taken in Australia as distinct from overseas and that, although in some institutions it is still outside the guidelines that the TEC would have liked to have established, the TEC's recommendations by and large are falling into place and the roof is not falling in on the universities or the standard of scholarship at universities. </PARA>
<PARA> The report is significant in making recommendations about the rationalisation and the sharing of library services. This is a very important matter for universities, particularly as the cost of journals escalates year by year. I think the recommendations that the TEC puts forward in this area are again very important. Senator Button has already referred to the rationalisation of institutions. The TEC not only makes recommendations about the teachers colleges at Newcastle, Townsville and Goulburn and various other institutions, but also balances that with an appreciation of what is politically possible, when, like many of us, it says: 'Oh that we had managed to get some sensible solution to the problems of Murdoch University and the University of Western Australia, but we all recognise that there are forces operating in the west which are greater than any of us as far as this particular educational priority is concerned. Therefore we will see whether we can do something about sharing services and recognise that we are not going to win the battle about amalgamation or federation of those universities, but at least we are not going to let it pass without comment'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not referring to anything of the kind. Although Senator Button somewhat made light of the changes that have taken place in Tasmania, I think it is significant that at least in that State, with some considerable disruption to its education system, there has been an attempted rationalisation of the campus facilities-one which again was resisted, as one would have expected, but which has been pushed through successfully. I am delighted to see that a series of new initiatives is recommended by the Commission, even though the general thrust of the report is one of restraint. I think it is very important that we identify these without saying anything substantial about them. It recommends that in some Australian university-not a specific university-a school of fisheries should be established. It recognises the importance of the fishing industry, and its relevance given the new declarations about the management of the coastal zone, the 200-mile limit and the exploitations of resources.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am quite persuaded that the TEC has better and more adequate sources of input than Townsville speeches. I am sure that the TEC would not be persuaded just because somebody happened to be campaigning in Townsville to the effect that some such school ought to be established at the James Cook University. The Commission goes on to recommend the establishment of a school of business studies at the Adelaide College of the Arts and Education, development in community language teaching, an additional 350 places in nurse education, additional feeder courses for CAEs which are becoming involved with the applied sciences and humanity courses, two-tier courses and bridging courses. I think it is very important that those things have been clearly identified as new initiatives, as indeed has been the proposal for a temporary development grant which is dealt with in paragraph 9.42 on page 268 of the summary document. In that paragraph the Commission states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commission proposes that temporary development grants should be provided for the advanced education sector for the two years 1982 and 1983 to enable it to support the expansion of enrolments in the technologies and business studies ahead of the release of resources from teacher education. </PARA>
<PARA>What that says is that teacher education is to be phased down, that when it is phased down to a more appropriate level new resources will become available and that those resources should then be transferred to business courses and management courses where appropriate, but that until that money has been released from one sector these temporary development grants should be made available. The Commission is still working on the centres of excellence program which was announced in the policy speech. We hope that in the not too distant future these will be specifically identified. An amount of $1m in the first year and then $15m over a five-year program is to be expended on centres of excellence. I know that the Commission has that matter well in hand. </PARA>
<PARA> The final general point I wish to make about the Commission's report is that it comes to grips at last with the question of building. It states very specifically that because of the decline in future enrolments-the steadying of enrolments-there is no need for great expenditure on building, but that the building grants will go up from something like $36m to $50m over each of the next three years and that that should be sufficient for maintenance and emergency new works. The other very significant point is that the Commission recommends for the first time a very significant thing for universities in particular-the triennial funding of equipment. In the past universities have had to operate on the basis that if they want a very expensive piece of machinery-a cyclotron or something that will involve the expenditure of many millions of dollars-they might save up their money and in one year make that investment, with no guarantee that in the next year they would be able to pay anything towards that cost. Here is a recommendation for triennial equipment funding so that expensive pieces of equipment and equipment that needs to be repaired can be paid for out of money granted over a three-year period. That is something for which the universities have been pressing for a long time. I know that it will be welcomed by them. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying something very quickly about the patterns that the TEC identifies. One is the enormous change in the nature of the student population in Australia. It is increasingly a part time rather than a full time population. Studies programs are increasingly external rather than internal. There is an increasingly older, more mature group of students than was previously the case and overwhelmingly, the population is now becoming a female one rather than a predominantly male one. Those things are all taken up by the Commission. They are all discussed by the Commission and recommendations arise as to the appropriate way in which to respond to those challenges. </PARA>
<PARA> Universities' rates of growth have declined dramatically. In 1975 they were growing at the rate of 3.8 per cent. They are now growing at the rate of about one half per cent. Enrolments in colleges of advanced education have moved only from 125,000 to 165,000 in the last five years. By contrast, enrolments in the TAFE institutions have moved from 521,000 to 654,000. Their rate of growth, which was 6.6 per cent in 1976, has remained rather steady at 5.8 per cent, 5.5 per cent and 5.5 per cent respectively in each of the subsequent three years. In the triennium 1982-84 which this report covers, universities are projected to have no real growth in student numbers, colleges of advanced education are projected to have 1.5 per cent growth and TAFE institutions 9 per cent growth. If we look at the recommendations we can see that this report recognises the real need of the TAFE sector and goes a long way towards identifying the fact-indeed, it says this-that that is where more and more of our post-secondary resources must be concentrated. The criticism Senator Button made about the relationship of education expenditure to the resources boom I think equally has to be seen in the context of the TEC recommendations on expenditure on TAFE, tradesmen and skilled workers. </PARA>
<PARA> The dramatic change in the behaviour of young people in Australia is reflected in these reports. In 1974 in excess of 18 per cent of 17-year-olds went straight from school to university. In 1980 that figure fell to about 14.5 per cent. That is a fall of something like a quarter of the number of people going straight from school to university. That has enormous social and educational implications. This report starts to come to grips with those implications. I welcome the opportunity to make those few remarks on both of these significant reports. What they mean for the future of education in Australia is dramatic and significant. I hope that the Government will be able to take up the recommendations made. Financially they are modest in terms of organisation, they are efficient and, indeed, they are far-sighted. Both Professor Karmel and Dr McKinnon deserve to be congratulated on their production. I hope that the Parliament and the education debate in Australia will be greatly advanced by having these documents available. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I compliment both Senator Button and Senator Puplick on two very thoughful speeches. I agree with almost everything both of them have said. I too would like to pay a tribute, on behalf of the Australian Democrats, to the retiring Chairman of the Schools Commission, Dr McKinnon. I commend the Australian for an article which appeared in its issue of Friday, 27 March, and from which I will quote. It is a most excellent extract for students of the education debate. It analyses the reports of both the Tertiary Education Commission and the Schools Commission. The article had this to say about Dr McKinnon:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . the report, which will attact interest not least because it is the last by the commission's past chairman, Dr K. R. McKinnon. </PARA>
<PARA> Although not printed until after his January departure, the report still has the flavour of Dr McKinnon's wide-ranging and humane interest in education. </PARA>
<PARA>I am sure that all senators agree with that statement. We are very critical though of Dr McKinnon's removal from the position of Chairman of the Schools Commission. He was making a great contribution to Australian education. We strongly suspect that he was relieved of his post owing to his well-founded criticism of some aspects of the way in which education operates in this country. Of all Dr McKinnon's worries and prognoses the one which seemed to concern him most is the one to which Senator Puplick referred. I want to amplify that matter which is dealt with on pages 26 and 27 of the report. It concerns increased funding to non-government schools and, indeed, the increased number of children attending non-government schools vis-a-vis government schools. I was very interested by, if not surprised at, the vehemence with which Senator Puplick approached the problem. He saw it as being a problem of great division in the future. I had not quite put it in that perspective. Nonetheless I share his concern over it. Let two things be said about the policy of the Democrats. The first paragraph of our education policy concerning state aid states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . our ultimate objective would be to make the State system of education so good that no one would need or want to send their child to a non-State school.</PARA>
<PARA>However, we go on to say that there is a need and an equity of people who choose to send their children to a non-government school to receive some share of the cake. In fact, I have the doubtful honour-I do not regard it as doubtful; some people would-of being the first member of a Federal parliament to have advocated state aid. That was in 1962. It is interesting to reflect that at that time I was almost sent to Coventry by my colleagues in the Liberal Party of Australia and I was certainly ignored by members of the Australian Labor Party for posing such an outrageous suggestion. In politics it is funny sometimes to contemplate how fast matters move. I think one year later then Mr McMahon-this is Sir William McMahon's side of the story-persuaded Sir Robert Menzies to incorporate massive state aid in the 1963 election campaign as a basic policy plank. </PARA>
<PARA> We have grave reservations about present government educational policy in general and specifically about the way in which the Government appears to be undermining the independence of the Schools Commission. We are very concerned about the Government's tendency to increase the funding of private schools at the expense of government schools. The Minister for Education, Mr Fife, announced in January that subsidies to wealthy schools would be effectively increased by one-third compared with an increase of only one-quarter in subsidies to poorer schools. Senator Puplick put it in another way; I think it was clearer than that. Whichever way one puts it I think it leads to great concern about this tendency. Between 1974 and 1979 public spending on government schools increased by 10.5 per cent compared with an increase of 32.5 per cent for non-government schools. On 12 January the Age put it rather quaintly and colourfully when it stated:</PARA>
<PARA> As the . . . Government continues to close the doors on many of its little red schoolhouses, bright, new and expensive private schools are popping up all over the place. </PARA>
<PARA>One wonders whether that is a healthy development in our education system. We agree with the Schools Commission that in a situation in which school enrolments are expected to fall by more than 50,000 in the next three years new non-government schools should not start without considering their impact on the enrolments of existing schools. Now non-government schools must also be able to demonstrate that they will operate at an acceptable standard. I would have loved the Senate to have debated all the education matters at great length this afternoon. There are so many aspects about which I, frankly, do not have a finite or definitive view. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply say without argument that in this connection we view with concern the fact that religious fundamentalist schools have begun to proliferate in Australia. The Schools Commission knew of one of these schools in 1977. Now there are at least 60 such schools. That is a growth of 59 schools in three years. There are also at least two Ananda Marga schools and one Hare Krishna school being funded by the Government. One could make an argument from that. One could be shocked and distressed that these kinds of quasi-religious organisations are being funded by taxpayers' money. One could lead a fairly persuasive argument to put a tremor through people about it. Yet if a person did that he would find himself very quickly on the road of arguing for religious freedom for certain religions and non-religious freedom for other religions. Frankly, I do not know what attitude to adopt towards this question of whether these--</PARA>

I wish that this debate could have gone on a little longer so that at least I could have learned something from it. I wonder why parents are now sending their children to non-government schools or private schools rather than to government schools. The figures on pages 26 and 27 of the report which Senator Puplick read out do not help much, as he will agree. The report says that in the five years from 1975 to 1980 one per cent more children went to private schools and one per cent fewer went to government schools. It does not tell us anything about the number of children involved. Although the figure is only one per cent I think the number of children involved would be about 20,000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over a short period many parents have made an overt decision, even in times of economic problems, and have said: 'I will not accept a virtually free government education. I will now opt to send my child or children to an education which will cost a fair bit of money'. As someone who has sent all his children to private schools-it may be that I sent them to private schools because I was not fortunate to enjoy that privilege-I, along with other senators, know the massive costs involved in sending kids to private schools. Many more parents are making this substantial sacrifice. They are saying that they will not spend their money on a holiday or a second car. They are making an overt decision and saying: 'A significant part of our income and our savings will go into our children's education. We will send them to private rather than public schools'. I would like to have heard Senator Button and Senator Puplick give their reasons. </PARA>

They see the private schools as exercising a function which the parents themselves should be exercising but choose not to.

I was about to make the point that on balance private schools have better sporting, library and other facilities than government schools. I think that that is particularly so in outlying suburbs and is another factor which influences parents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It may be that the clock has swung around concerning permissiveness and anti-religious feelings in our community. Because of nuclear threats and the manic behaviour of certain world leaders of both the Left and the Right, many parents are going back to religion and perhaps are feeling that at least if they have to bring up their children in a world that will blow itself apart their children will die having a healthier attitude towards religion. It may be that I am being unfair to the Schools Commission in saying that it did not canvass these issues more and come before the Parliament and the Minister with more definitive reasons as to why this phenomenon of massive numbers of parents changing their children from state schools to public schools is happening in our community. The Australian, commenting on the Schools Commission report, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> This has been caused by a wide range of factors . . . including increased recurrent and capital assistance from Commonwealth and State governments for non-government schools. </PARA>
<PARA>I take Senator Puplick's point. It is crystal clear that the movement of children from government to non-government schools is being assisted by Commonwealth and State governments. I do not know whether the governments are doing it consciously. I believe that some State governments-as they do with so many things-are doing it unconsciously. I think the Federal Government is doing it subconsciously. It is being done. I appeal to the Government to think of the consequences of such action. I ask it to look at Senator Puplick's speech today and to look at the rather dire prognosis that he put down about what will happen if this trend is not arrested in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA> One could go on for a long time. I want to note a few items that I would have liked to have developed in this debate and which I would have liked other honourable senators to have developed to see the Schools Commission and governments be more strong on giving aid, if aid must be given to non-government schools, to single sex schools. Surely to God we have reached a stage in the twentieth century where governments at least realise that single sex schools are an anachronism and a direct cause of anti-social conduct by young people and that they motivate against young people, at a most difficult stage of their lives, having some form of social communication with their peers. </PARA>

Like the honourable senator undoubtedly, I have been to both types of schools. One makes a judgment of the social consciousness and the educational motivation of students in those schools. As far as I am concerned there is no contest. I think that the single sex school, whether it be for boys or girls, is an anachronism which should have been left behind many years ago.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I agree with Senator Button that there was not enough in the report about mathematics and engineering deficiencies in our education system. I am informed that fewer and fewer children-the proportion is significant-are undertaking mathematics in schools today. That leads to a corresponding diminution in the number of students taking engineering in their tertiary education. The Australian Institute of Engineers is deeply concerned about this trend and points out the inevitability of having to import engineers and technologists within the next five years. I was a little disappointed that the Schools Commission report did not have something new to say about the kind of insanity that we impact on our young children through our secondary education system when they turn 16, 17 or 18 years of age. I am talking about the Higher School Certificate and matriculation. Having had four children who have gone through the agony and having spoken, as have other honourable senators, at secondary schools regularly during the course of the year, I always feel saddened after leaving a school in which we have these beautiful young people to think of their being forced to live the most unnatural year of their life. </PARA>
<PARA> I condemn those educators who have not yet developed the wit to test the intellectual capacity of Australia's 16-year-olds, 17-year-olds and 18-year-olds other than by giving them a work load in their matriculation or HSC year three times greater than that which we would expect a normal person to bear. Young persons turning 17 or 18 years of age feel for the first time a social consciousness not only of their environment-the world-but also, certainly, of the opposite sex and of their responsibilities as young adults, with interests fanning out from the three Rs and the narrow confines of their studies. In that year we allow these people of little wit, the educators, to say: 'During this year of your life we will make you work 6 1/2 days a week. You will go to school at 9 o'clock in the morning and when you rush home, after your sandwich at 5 o'clock we will then make you work until 10.30 or 11 o'clock. On Sunday maybe you can have the night off'. I wish Senator Martin, for whom I have unbounded affection, would not be a smart-Alick about those kinds of remarks. If she is, let her go to schools where matriculation classes are taught. Let her ask doctors in her electorate in Queensland how the graph of kids of 17 or 18 doing matriculation or HSC soars during July, August or September. Am I doing Senator Martin an injustice?</PARA>

Hence we have this massive discrimination against people with intellectual capacity from those lower socio-economic backgrounds who are trying to achieve something which their parents could not achieve. Although we commend the work done by the Schools Commission, we regret the removal of Dr McKinnon, the fact that the Commission did not take up some of the questions it might have taken up and the fact that debate on this matter in the Senate has been shortened-not by deliberate government policy-and has not been encouraged to go further. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to make a couple of comments about the report from the Aboriginal Land Commissioner in the Northern Territory. In the first instance, the Opposition welcomes the report and congratulates the Commissioner, Mr Justice Toohey, on the very competent and sound job he is doing in this very sensitive area of hearing land claims in the Northern Territory and making recommendations to the Minister. In our view progress with regard to Aboriginal land claims in the Northern Territory has been quite satisfactory. Some claims are proceeding very slowly-I think too slowly for the satisfaction of the people involved-but we understand that there are genuine reasons for this and that in any case the slowness of the processing of some claims is in no way criticism of the competence of the Commissioner, Mr Justice Toohey. We welcome Mr Justice Toohey's reappointment for another two years because we believe he has shown great sensitivity and great soundness in his conduct of these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> However, in the Senate this afternoon I would like to raise the concern felt by the Opposition about the attitude of the Northern Territory Government to Mr Justice Toohey and the work he has been carrying out. I have here a copy of a submission made by the Northern Territory Administration of Mr Paul Everingham and entitled 'An Examination of Land Rights Legislation-Submission by the Northern Territory Government'. There are a number of alarming features in this report. In fact it reinforces our concern that the Northern Territory Administration, the Government of Mr Paul Everingham, is fundamentally hostile to the Federal land rights Act. It is not supportive of or sympathetic to the philosophy behind the land rights Act and we believe it is prepared to undermine both the operation of the land rights Act and the work of Mr Justice Toohey. I am very pleased the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) is in the chamber to listen to these remarks. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to us that the land rights movement in the Northern Territory is under some serious threat at this stage. Not only is it under threat from predatory mining companies which, of course, are anxious to assert their rights over the rights of Aboriginal people to land, but also it is under threat in a less active way from the Northern Territory Administration itself which is seeking, we believe, to persuade the Federal Government to water down the provisions of the land rights Act. Of course, it is seeking by this action and by its own participation in land rights claims to stir up within the community in the Northern Territory a great deal of hostility to the whole land rights issue. I would like to quote from this document I have before me this afternoon, which is the Northern Territory Government's submission on the land rights legislation. In particular I would like to read out paragraph 1.5 which states:</PARA>
<PARA> The conduct of the claims themselves by practitioners for the applicants are also a cause for concern. Fierce attempts are made by those representing various Aboriginal applicants to prevent any normal and proper cross-examination of their clients or witnesses as to the reality, or genuineness, of the claim of traditional ownership made by particular claimants. This amounts to an attempt to distort the normal legal process and to emasculate a proper consideration of other interests affected, and indeed, the interests of the community as a whole. To say the least, not infrequently, some of the claims of traditional ownership in the terms defined are specious. There is a consequent acute danger in this situation because of the markedly benevolent view taken by the Commissioner to applications taken under the Act. A strong feeling exists that the Minister should not merely rubber stamp the recommendations of the Commissioner but should carefully examine each case himself. </PARA>
<PARA>A statement such as that coming from the Northern Territory Government, I think, should be regarded by Aboriginal people as a very serious threat to their land rights. First of all, Mr Everingham insults the legal representatives of the Aboriginal people by suggesting that they are pursuing the claims in a way which is distorting-I use the words in the submission-the normal legal process. Secondly, he suggests that the interests of the community as a whole are being ignored by the development of the land rights claims. Then, of course, he goes on to insult and to undermine Mr Justice Toohey by speaking of his markedly benevolent view. I draw the inference that Mr Justice Toohey is making decisions which are not soundly based in law but rather are a result of his benovolence. I think that is a very serious accusation to make against a judge. Mr Everingham also suggests that the Minister is merely rubber-stamping the Commissioner's recommendations. I am sure that the Minister does not take kindly to being described in this way, even though Senator Peter Baume, the Minister at this stage, is fairly new to this portfolio and, I think, probably has accepted only one recommendation for a land rights claim. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Borroloola was accepted. Perhaps it is his colleague, Senator Chaney, who should feel more outraged at these sorts of suggestions. But I raise this matter at this stage because I think it is a serious one. I think the submission-I would be quite happy to table it if the Minister requests it-demonstrates the bad faith of the Northern Territory Administration towards the development of land rights in the Northern Territory. There are other matters which I will not go into in detail because the hour is late but about which I am concerned. For example, recommendation 2.2.1 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . The Northern Territory Government considers that the Commonwealth Act should be amended to prevent any further applications--</PARA>
<PARA>That is for land owned by or on behalf of Aboriginal people to be converted into Aboriginal land-</PARA>
<PARA>for such conversion being lodged. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, as set out in recommendation 3.2.1, the Northern Territory Government believes that immediately upon the commencement of the new amendments to the Act no new lodgment for Aboriginal land claims should be made. I think this is a submission very hostile to the interests of Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory. Indeed it is a submission hostile to the Federal Government and its stated policy and its performance to date in the matter of land rights claims. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope and expect that the Minister, Senator Peter Baume, like me, will congratulate Mr Justice Toohey on his report and for his conduct of the land rights claims. I hope that he will reject in this place the various unsympathetic or hostile suggestions by the Everingham Government, but in particular will reject the suggestion that Mr Justice Toohey is acting in a way so as to allow a distortion of the law. I hope he will reject the suggestion that the Minister is acting as a rubber stamp and perhaps should be an authority over and above the judge in this matter. It is of serious concern to members of the Federal Opposition because our commitment to land rights for Aboriginal people is unqualified. For this reason we have supported the legislation of the Federal Government in the Northern Territory, but we constantly monitor the threats to Aboriginal land rights in the Northern Territory. I believe that the submission of the Everingham Government to which I have referred this afternoon constitutes such a threat. I seek leave to table this document. </PARA>

<PARA> Senator Ryan has drawn attention to a document written by the Northern Territory Government. In fact she tabled the document. I think the honourable senator would want to know that the document is a little out of date at this stage; that there has been some progress. I was able to convene a meeting in Darwin the day before the ministerial council, a meeting consisting of representatives of the Federal Government, of the Northern Territory Government and of the three land councils in the Northern Territory. Those representatives met around the same table to discuss the question of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act and to try to reach a number of agreed positions. The honourable senator is quite correct; that document existed but I must say to her that the views which emerged from that meeting were far more positive and far more conciliatory on all sides, and it would be my hope that in due course we will end up with a series of agreed positions on a number of matters relating to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. That is a development which should be put before the Senate at this stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -Last Thursday I sought leave to continue my remarks on the first reading of these Bills. At that stage I had confined my remarks to the problem abroad at present in regard to salinity in the River Murray, and I had dealt at length with the problems that exist. At page 829 of the Senate Hansard of 26 March I said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am reliably informed that New South Wales is well ahead of the other States in getting money from the fund to control salinity in that State. </PARA>
<PARA>I was referring to the legislation passed in this House three years ago which provided the sum of $200m for water resources. On checking that information I found that I was somewhat incorrect and should not have said that New South Wales was well ahead in getting money from the fund but that New South Wales was ahead in requesting money for water resources. I was able to ascertain that information in discussions I had with people in New South Wales, and I want to correct that slight error. Let me now recapitulate on some of the things I said last Thursday. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Young" NAMEID="HV7">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="HV7">Senator Young</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indirectly, you were not entirely wrong because so much money has been spent on water conservation in those States that they are ahead of South Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4L7">Senator McLAREN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are well ahead of South Australia, I know, but they would be much further ahead if they could get more money from the fund. Even though they have started some of the works, they find great difficulty in getting money allocated. As I said last Thursday when I quoted from an answer given to Mr Jacobi in the other place, although the scheme has been in operation for at least three years, less than $77m has been forthcoming out of a total amount of $200m. With less than two years to go there is still $123m in the fund. Yet New South Wales is being severely criticised by the South Australian Minister for something he says it is doing and which I am convinced it is not doing; that is, putting more salt into the River Murray system. If New South Wales could get access to that money, I am sure it could go ahead more rapidly with the works it has in progress. Of course, I see some difficulties in altering the Constitution to force any State to carry out salinity control within its own borders. I mention those things now becasuse I think they ought to be placed on the record, in view of the answers given last week in this chamber by Senator Carrick.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 3 March, when speaking to the tabling of the Australian Water Resources Council report, I stated:</PARA>
<PARA> If Mr Arnold continues to carry on in the way in which he has been carrying on, . . . he could put the whole agreement in jeopardy. </PARA>
<PARA>I was referring to the amendments to the River Murray Waters Agreement. I said two years ago, and even as far back as 1976 when I spoke on the legislation that made the $200m available, that we had to have a consensus of all the States if we were to improve the quality of the River Murray water. On 5 March, in answer to a question from me about the River Murray, Senator Carrick said:</PARA>
<PARA> South Australia, in arriving at its estimate of 28 per cent of salt in the River Murray being contributed by New South Wales, has updated the Maunsell analysis on the basis of available information on river flows during the period October to December 1980. </PARA>
<PARA>South Australia has based its opinion that New South Wales has an input of 28 per cent of salt into the River Murray on a very short period of two months. I believe it should have based its assessment on a much longer period, and to my mind that figure of 28 per cent is in serious question. Again on 5 March, when I spoke in the Senate about the problems experienced in the River Murray being expanded most unfairly by Mr Arnold, the Minister of Water Resources in South Australia, I said:</PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought that the Minister who lives in that area and represents those people would have informed them that public protests will not assist in any way to secure satisfactory amendments to the River Murray Waters Agreement. </PARA>
<PARA>I was talking about a letter I had received and quoted in my speech in the Address-in-Reply debate, and I said that public protests would not achieve anything. In a series of answers, Senator Carrick has borne out what I said. On 24 March, in answer to a question on the River Murray from Senator Davidson, Senator Carrick said:</PARA>
<PARA> The States and the Commonwealth are currently in full discussion to obtain a complete redrafting of an agreement on the River Murray. There are now only two matters in dispute. We are endeavouring to hasten their resolution. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . but in a federation what is required in terms of progress is a consensus. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what I have been saying here for a number of years. Talking about the Maunsell report, Senator Carrick went on:</PARA>
<PARA> I am aware of the Maunsell report. All these things are under study. </PARA>
<PARA>He was referring to the matters raised by Senator Davidson, but I will not repeat them because they are set out in Hansard. Senator Carrick continued:</PARA>
<PARA> We intend to act upon them. </PARA>
<PARA>He was referring to the recommendations in the Maunsell report. I wish only that Senator Carrick would do what he said he intended to do, and that is act upon the recommendations in the 1979 Maunsell report entitled 'Murray Valley Salinity and Drainage Report'. That report recommended an expenditure of $75.24m to correct salinity in the River Murray. As I said a while ago in answer to an interjection from Senator Young, we now find that New South Wales, which is doing its utmost, is having great difficulty in getting a share of the $200m that was made available for this very purpose. Yet Senator Carrick is on record as saying only last week that the Government of which he is the responsible Minister intends to act upon the Maunsell report. I believe that the Federal Government should take immediate action to make the necessary funds available to each of the States to enable these recommendations to be implemented without delay. Of course, if the Government were prepared to do that, the States might not now be engaged in this dispute. It is most regrettable because the more Mr Arnold and Mr Tonkin criticise the New South Wales Government the longer it will be before a conclusion is reached. As Senator Carrick has said, a conclusion has almost been reached and only one or two points embodied in the suggested amendments need clarification. If only those two people in South Australia would close their mouths for a little while we might get somewhere. Again on 24 March Senator Bishop put a question to the Minister, and in reply Senator Carrick said:</PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Bishop knows, this is a Federal-State matter. The degree to which any kind of agreement can be reached depends upon the good will and the unanimity of views of some four partners in this venture. The aim at this moment is to get the maximum co-operation we can within a re-writing of the River Murray Commission agreement and from there to see whether any further steps are necessary. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on:</PARA>
<PARA> That will be a primary target on our part. </PARA>
<PARA>I only wish it were a primary target on the part of Mr Arnold and Mr Tonkin from South Australia. A further question was asked by Senator Young on that day, and in reply Senator Carrick talked again about the States. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . within their sovereign territories higher up the river system. That is where the nub of the problem lies; they have total sovereignty. Unless we get voluntary co-operation, the journey will be so much the harder. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on further:</PARA>
<PARA> It is a question of a federation and State sovereignty. It is true that we need unanimity of support. </PARA>
<PARA>Everywhere we look we find the Minister responsible using those words. On 24 March, in answer to a question from Senator Teague about the Government's seeking to bring about a moratorium on irrigation, Senator Carrick said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . I do not think any Commonwealth government could intervene at the State level on what are solely sovereign powers. </PARA>
<PARA>So there we have it. We know what the Constitution is, and yet people from South Australia, both in the Senate and from bodies along the River Murray, continually complain and criticise the New South Wales Government, saying that it is that Government's responsibility to give South Australia better quality water. It is no such thing because under the Constitution, as has been clearly stated both in the report of the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources and in answers given by Senator Carrick, each State has sovereignty over its own water resources. If we want to try to come to some agreement under which a State gives away something for which it could be severely criticised by its own residents, we have to do it in a proper manner. We should not get up on a soap box and shout our heads off and fool people, as Mr Arnold is doing, as I have pointed out recently. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said in other speeches I have made, Mr Dunstan and Mr Corcoran, who was the South Australian Minister of Works, as the portfolio then was, could have done the same thing to Mr Askin and to Mr Lewis. They could have made some cheap political propaganda, but they are old hands at the game; they are politically wise. They knew that as the Constitution stands they would not get anywhere by criticising, so they sat down to talk in a rational manner with the Premiers of both New South Wales and Victoria. Both States had Liberal Premiers at that time, and Victoria still does. As I have said, it is remarkable that no criticism has been levelled at Mr Hamer either by Mr Tonkin or Mr Arnold for the amount of salt that Victoria might be contributing to the River Murray. All the criticism seems to be levelled at a Labor government. There is no doubt in my mind that they are using this issue for political purposes as an election is to be held in New South Wales shortly. They think they will be able to gain some political kudos from it. But I can assure them that they will not do so. All they are doing is building up false hopes for the people along the River Murray in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that a meeting was held yesterday at Waikerie. A committee of 18 people was formed and I am informed that the committee hopes to raise about $50,000. I have not seen any reports in the Press on this matter. No doubt it will be reported in the South Australian Press tomorrow. But these people will not achieve anything. As I have said on many occasions-my colleague Senator McClelland will back me up on this-if we want to get South Australia a better deal we had better be prepared to sit down and talk in a conciliatory manner. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Douglas McClelland" NAMEID="EK7">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EK7">Senator Douglas McClelland</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;New South Wales is undertaking a $15m program of works which will further reduce input of salt by New South Wales into the Murray.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4L7">Senator McLAREN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I am aware of that. I am pleased that Senator McClelland has raised it because it brings me back to what I said a few minutes ago, that is, that New South Wales is experiencing some difficulty in getting from the Federal Government more of that $200m provided in the legislation we passed. If New South Wales could get money it would help it to complete the works that it is already carrying out. As members of the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources Senator Thomas, who is in the chamber, and I had the experience of going into the Wakool, Deniliquin and Wentworth areas on the New South Wales side of the river near Mildura and seeing the work that was being done to try to control salinity. I was convinced then that the landholders in that part of New South Wales had a problem and that the Government was doing everything it could to try to correct it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not intend to criticise other States for what they are doing under their sovereign rights even though I live in South Australia. My main concern is to see that South Australia gets better quality water. As I have said in this place on many occasions, I am very much afraid that if the present South Australian Government continues to carry on as it has been doing we will not get anywhere in our efforts to get the River Murray Waters Agreement amended. This is what the Government should bear in mind instead of trying to score cheap political points. I was convinced that Mr Arnold had seen the error of his ways, was prepared to sit down and discuss these matters and not to go public further. But unfortunately for him his leader, Mr Tonkin, went on air on the Australian Broadcasting Commission's 7 o'clock news on Channel 2 on 16 March. I have a transcript of what he had to say. The newsreader said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Premier, Mr Tonkin, today called on NSW to honour its responsibilities to South Australia over the quality of River Murray water. </PARA>
<PARA>According to the transcript of the news item Mr Tonkin said:</PARA>
<PARA> Now, it seems to me that the NSW Government is acting totally without any conscience at all in this matter and if our approach to the NSW Government doesn't succeed, then I hope that the people of NSW will recognise their responsibilities to fellow Australians in South Australia and call on the NSW Government to act responsibly. </PARA>
<PARA>Those statements made by the Premier are completely provocative because he is talking about New South Wales honouring its responsibilities in relation to water quality. No State has responsibility to another State in relation to water quality. That is not mentioned in the Agreement. I shall refer to the extra amount of water which South Australia received under the Dartmouth agreement; there is no mention of quality in that agreement, only quantity. I will refer to that matter later too, because South Australia is doing very well as far as its allocation of water is concerned. I saw in the Weekend Australian a report headed 'States rights go on the rampage'. It was making reference to a meeting of the Federal Liberal Party. I will not quote all of it but one small part of it attracted my attention. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> This growing 'states rightism' surfaced again in the party room last Wednesday, when the South Australians, led by former Premier Steele Hall, forced on a debate on the pollution of the River Murray. </PARA>
<PARA>I cannot verify whether that statement is correct. Only the people who were in the party room know whether that is in fact correct. What we have to bear in mind is that when Mr Steele Hall as Premier of South Australia negotiated the extra water entitlement from the Dartmouth dam-he is a signatory to that agreement-nothing was said in the agreement about water quality. On Thursday he asked of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in the other place a question about water quality and pollution in the River Murray. He well knows he had the opportunity during the negotiations on the construction of the Dartmouth dam to do something about water quality. He could have insisted upon his proposals. The other States might not have agreed with them but at least he could have done something about the problem. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a copy of that agreement which is signed by Mr Steele Hall. The people who signed it include Mr Gorton who was then the Prime Minister, Mr Askin who was the then Premier of New South Wales, Mr Bolte the then Premier of Victoria and Mr Steele Hall, the then Premier of South Australia. All of those people are signatories to the Dartmouth agreement. All that we of South Australia got out of it was an entitlement to extra water; there was nothing in it about quality of water. Now that Mr Hall is in the House of Representatives he is prepared to say in his party room-this is what is reported and I have not heard anyone on the other side of the chamber deny it-that we ought to do something to safeguard water quality for South Australia. I am asking: Why did he not do that when he was the Premier and he had the opportunity when the agreement to construct the Dartmouth dam was being negotiated?</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Sibraa" NAMEID="EJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EJ4">Senator Sibraa</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They were all Liberals then, too, weren't they?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4L7">Senator McLAREN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They were all Liberals. They cannot blame a Labor Government in any State because we had Liberal governments in every State and at the Commonwealth level. But nothing was said. Mr Hall, as Premier of South Australia, has a very sorry record on water issues. Many years ago when Mr Playford was negotiating the agreement to construct the Chowilla dam and Steele Hall became Premier-I think it was in 1964-he was very concerned, so concerned that he put out a pamphlet headed 'The Fourteen Facts About Chowilla'. It sets out the reasons the dam should be built and why it was a good thing. He made great play of it, but then he changed his mind for some reason best known to himself. Of course this brought about his downfall. I even heard him saying at one time that Chowilla would be built even if he had to dig it himself so that South Australia could have an assured water supply. But for some reason or other he changed his mind and supported the construction of Dartmouth. He is on record as saying recently-he was trying to blame the Dunstan Government-that the Dartmouth agreement was held up for two years by Mr Dunstan; no such thing occurred.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having put those matters on the record, I want to say something-I will be brief because one of my colleagues wants to speak before the dinner break-about the River Murray system as we know it and its whole history. The State of New South Wales-I am convinced about this-has followed a consistent course of support for the equitable sharing of the water resources of the River Murray, for the improvement of water quality and for the widening of the present limited powers of the River Murray Commission. New South Wales has always supported that. We are very near the point where we can get some agreement, where South Australia might get a better deal. Yet, Mr Arnold-as I said before-did not see fit to make any submission to the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources when it held a public inquiry into Australia's water resources. He made no submission then when he was a back bencher in the South Australian Opposition, the member for Chaffey and living on the river. He never saw fit to raise his voice or put in a submission to let us hear of all the problems. We never heard from him. </PARA>
<PARA> New South Wales claims-I believe it-it has pioneered salinity mitigation projects to reduce the amount of salt entering the river and has effective systems either in use or under construction at present. Those projects at present under construction are the ones I have mentioned as being delayed because the New South Wales Government cannot get sufficient money from the Federal Government. It has progressively stopped taking applications for new irrigation licences along regulated inland rivers since 1977 despite the fact that it is being publicised now that it is issuing licences willy-nilly for the Darling. My information-I have no reason to doubt it-is that no licences have been granted since 1977. It is perfectly understandable that the people of South Australia, so heavily dependent on the Murray, should be concerned about water quality and the assurance of future supplies for domestic, agricultural and industrial use. The Government of New South Wales finds it very difficult to understand why it has been subjected to an increasing barrage of criticism from the South Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I have stood in this chamber repeatedly to speak about the criticism levelled at New South Wales by certain representatives of that State in the Federal Parliament and interested parties in the Riverland district of South Australia. I have referred to those often. We should not have to keep defending New South Wales; it is quite capable of defending itself. Again, the main purpose for my rising in this place is to get some sense into Mr Tonkin and Mr Arnold and to ask them to sit down to talk with representatives from the other two States to see whether we can reach an agreement satisfactory to everyone. The general tone of the criticism levelled is that in this regard all the problems of the quality of Murray River water effectively relate to salt content and are due to the New South Wales Government and the farmers of that State. This is unfair, inaccurate and unjust. My New South Wales Senate colleagues would back me on that statement. Furthermore, the main thrust of the campaign appears to be endeavouring to secure the flow of as much water as possible along the River Murray in South Australia to flush the salt concentration into the sea. It is implied but not spelled out in detail that the flushing involving vast quantities of water should be at the expense of water users in New South Wales. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4L7">Senator McLAREN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is absolute wastage just to go out through the barrages into the sea. In the late 1979 South Australia took the unprecedented step of sending representatives to appear at two New South Wales land board hearings held to inquire into the desirability of granting individual irrigation licences along the Darling River. The decision of one of these at Wentworth is currently the subject of an appeal before Mr Justice Perrignon of the Land and Environment Court. The South Australian campaign, as I said, has been conducted by Mr Arnold. He is objecting personally to the issuance of 150 licences along the Darling or its tributaries upstream from the Menindee Lakes storage. Mr Arnold claims the granting of such licences would accentuate the salinity problem of the Murray. Why has Mr Arnold taken out a challenge in the New South Wales courts? This is very interesting. I will tell honourable senators why. South Australia is challenging licences granted in New South Wales because in Victoria, a far greater contributor than New South Wales to the salt problem of the Murray, no provision exists for appeals against the issuance of irrigation licences. In Queensland, where the Darling and some of its tributaries rise, the right of appeal against the issuance of an irrigation licence is restricted to people in the immediate vicinity of the licence application area. In both Victoria and Queensland there is no right of appeal. There is no right of appeal in Victoria. In Queensland, unless one is adjacent to the river, one has no right of appeal.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4L7">Senator McLAREN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am saying that. We have evidence to prove that it will not. Clearly, New South Wales is the target State in the South Australian campaign to increase the flow of water along the Murray to dilute the salt content of the Murray. This means that a resource taken away from New South Wales users becomes merely dilution water to be wasted and flushed out to sea through the barrages at Goolwa. I repeat: I have had evidence given to me-I have no cause to doubt it-that any extra irrigation licences granted on the Darling, if they are granted, will not have any effect on the River Murray. This is because certain conditions have been laid down. I have spoken of these.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In criticising Mr Arnold I am backed up by the statements of Mr Keneally, the member for Stuart in South Australia. He is the South Australian spokesman on water resources and is convinced that Mr Arnold is only playing politics. An article appeared in the Adelaide Advertiser on about the same date that Mr Tonkin issued his ultimatum to Mr Wran. I am not going to quote from that article because time is running out and my colleague wishes to speak before 6 o'clock. As I have said, New South Wales is not accepting applications for licences for further irrigation development along the Murray and its regulated tributaries. This is because the Australian Water Resources Council considers that regulated flows capable of being developed in normal non-drought years are fully committed for domestic and stock use, to support permanent plantings and for irrigation generally. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Corcoran himself when Minister made statements which are on record. I have a Press release of his which I might use if we ever have a full-scale debate on the River Murray, which I am sure eventually we will. Mr Corcoran granted an extra ten per cent of licences to people along the River Murray in South Australia because South Australia was getting far in excess of its water entitlement. We do in most years; it is very seldom that we do not get the entitlement. It was only once that South Australia did not get its entitlement. That was in a time of drought and neither Victoria nor New South Wales at that time had their entitlement either. In every other year South Australia gets in excess of its entitlement under the agreement. The Premier of South Australia is continually harping and trying to blame a sister State for causing the problem. As I have said, we will not get anywhere if South Australia continues to do that. I only hope that the time will come when we have a full-scale debate in this Parliament on the River Murray instead of dealing with it in a piecemeal way as I have done this afternoon on the first reading of a money Bill when one cannot devote the full time necessary to it. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Arnold has two colleagues sitting in this chamber-Senator Young and Senator Messner -who, if they are as concerned as I and my colleagues from South Australia on this side of the chamber are that there should be better quality water in South Australia, for goodness sake should explain to the Minister. The honourable senators do not need to quote me but can quote their own leader, Senator Carrick, who has said repeatedly in the last week that each State has sovereign right over its own water resources. The only way to alter that would be to have a federal referendum. Honourable senators know what chances there would be of getting such a vote through. There would be as much chance of carrying that as a referendum to abolish the Senate because only one State is needed to object to negate the question. Tasmania would never vote to abolish the Senate because it would lose ten senators. </PARA>

As I have said on so many occasions, in order to have better quality water in South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales will have to give something to us but they will get nothing in return. It is disturbing to me that in the interview I mentioned with Mr Tonkin, the interviewer asked whether the sort of reprisal being considered by Mr Tonkin concerned the cutting off of natural gas from the Moomba field to New South Wales. Of course, Mr Tonkin said that he was not considering that. However, there must have been some discussion of that or the interviewer would not have raised the subject. Engaging in reprisals such as that will not get anywhere while each State has its sovereign right. Again I make the plea to you, Mr President, to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Senator Messner, and to Senator Young that when you go back to South Australia you point these matters out to Mr Arnold and repeat what Senator Carrick said-not what I have said-that each State has its sovereign rights. He said repeatedly here last week that the only way we will get better quality water in South Australia is for all the Ministers and all the State governments to sit down in harmony and discuss the problems with the Federal Government. We will not get anywhere while we have this antagonistic attitude adopted by the South Australian Government.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I want to speak briefly on two matters. The first concerns a question that I asked in the Senate on 5 December last year. I asked:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My question to the Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate, who is representing the Prime Minister in this place, refers to a statement made in the House of Representatives on 6 June last year--</PARA>
<PARA>That is 1979-</PARA>
<PARA>in which the present Minister for Communications acknowledged that several hundred thousand dollars misappropriated by G. M. Sinclair had been paid into the account of the Sinclair Pastoral Co. and that by a deed of arrangement dated 1 August 1979 the Minister agreed to repay $300,000 commencing on 1 November 1980. Will the Deputy Leader of the Government ask the Prime Minister whether public documents reveal that up to 1 November this year a family company of the Minister for Communications was the custodian and beneficiary of 300,000 misappropriated dollars and whether the Prime Minister approves of the use of misappropriated funds as working capital for private ministerial businesses? If the Prime Minister does not so approve, why did he reappoint Mr Sinclair to the Cabinet?</PARA>
<PARA>That was the end of my question. Senator Durack replied that he would refer the question to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). As no reply was received by 3 March this year, I raised the matter again at Question Time. On 3 March the Deputy President, who is a member of Mr Sinclair's party, demanded that I withdraw the question which was accepted on 5 December. When I did not I was ultimately suspended. However, on 10 March I received what purported to be a reply to my 5 December question. In that reply Senator Durack, on behalf of the Prime Minister, said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has advised that the affairs of the companies you referred to, together with other companies, were investigated under the New South Wales Companies Act. Mr Sinclair was acquitted by the jury on all charges laid as a result of this investigation. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result, the Prime Minister regards the issue as being closed. </PARA>
<PARA>It ought to be obvious, even to the recipient of a third-class Oxford degree, that that reply had nothing to do with my question. Senator Durack's letter on behalf of the Prime Minister referred to the fact that a jury in Sydney, after a seven-hour deliberation, found Mr Sinclair not guilty of three charges of forgery, three charges of uttering and three charges of breaching the New South Wales Companies Act. The letter referred to nothing else. On the other hand my question referred to Mr Sinclair's speech in Parliament on 6 June 1979. In that speech he quoted from a letter written by G. Sinclair, Haylen and Co., accountants, to the directors of Reliance Investments Pty Ltd. The letter stated inter alia:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) The following funds were misappropriated by the late Mr G. Sinclair. </PARA>
<PARA>The Sinclair, Haylen and Co. letter, as quoted by the Minister on 6 June, then listed misappropriations totalling $542,125.05 and the four accounts into which the funds were paid. The greater part of the money, $377,000, was shown as paid to the Sinclair Pastoral Co. Pty Ltd. Ian Sinclair is and was the principal of that company. Mr Sinclair, later in his 6 June speech, quoted from his letter to the Reliance group on 11 April 1979 in which he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> I accept responsibility for the repayment of this amount as trustee of the estate of the late George Sinclair. Repayment will be in accordance with arrangements to be determined with the company. </PARA>
<PARA>A deed of arrangement dated 1 August 1979 was subsequently released by Mr Ian Sinclair in which he agreed to pay $430,000 to the Reliance group. Claims for $130,000 of accountants fees due to George Sinclair were forgone, and $130,000 was deemed to have been paid off the $430,000. Of the remaining $300,000 Ian Sinclair undertook to repay $100,000 on 1 November 1980 and the other $200,000 in the next two years. That is all in the deed of arrangement which was released on 2 August, I think, by Mr Sinclair. As well as being the principal of the Sinclair Pastoral Co., Ian Sinclair was the sole beneficiary of his father's estate and therefore, until such time as those funds are repaid, the custodian of funds which he has acknowledged were misappropriated by George Sinclair. The deed of arrangement released by Ian Sinclair-under his ministerial letterhead-in August 1979 reveals that he was still in possession of 300,000 of the misappropriated dollars when the Prime Minister reappointed him to Cabinet in August 1980, and that he still retains $200,000. </PARA>
<PARA> From documents and statements from Ian Sinclair, it is inarguable that he was the custodian and user of misappropriated funds when the Prime Minister reappointed him to Cabinet. From that it is logically inescapable that the Prime Minister has no objection to the use of misappropriated money as working capital for ministerial businesses. My question of 5 December sought only the Prime Minister's confirmation of that logical conclusion. His answer dodged the issue. If Ian Sinclair had been acquitted of every charge from illegal parking to wilful murder, it would neither challenge nor change the public record which shows that he was still in possession of 300,000 misappropriated dollars when Mr Fraser elevated him to senior Cabinet rank. Even a third-class Oxford graduate ought to be able to deduce that. The Prime Minister's restoration of the member for New England is just one of the multiple examples of his craven subservience to the National Country Party; his evasion of the question is an example of his arrogant disdain for parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> For the last week or so-this is the second matter-we have been subjected to a plague of cant and humbug from senior Ministers. With a public record like that of Sir Phillip Lynch, it takes a very thick hide to accuse anyone of making demands, as he has done twice in the last nine days, based on, as he put it, greed not need. This comes from a man who has a huge ministerial salary and an assured lifelong fat ministerial pension who simultaneously ripped off huge profits from insider trading at Stumpy Gully, and then contrived to dodge tax. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a matter of public record-admitted even by Sir Phillip Lynch, but only after it had been previously disclosed in the Victorian Parliament-that the family company, of which he is the governing director, made huge profits from insider trading on land at Stumpy Gully and then contrived an arrangement to minimise the tax on those anti-social, to say the least, gains. Were actions like that motivated by greed or by need? Does the report on these matters, the publication of which was promised but not delivered by both Mr Fraser and Sir Phillip Lynch, answer that question? Moreover, Sir Phillip Lynch, as Treasurer in July 1977, obtained a very soft loan for $79,000 from QBE Insurance Ltd, a company for which just six months earlier he as Treasurer had approved a foreign investment transaction. Leaving aside the propriety of the transaction, was the Lynch family so destitute that it really needed the capital gains from that Gold Coast apartment? According to Sir Phillip Lynch at the time, the loan was a normal commercial transaction-an assertion inadvertently scuttled by the QBE manager's public statement that loans were never granted for residential property, never granted for amounts of less than $100,000 and never granted for more than five years. The Lynch soft loan breached all of those conditions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The humbug has since been compounded by the Prime Minister himself. The Prime Minister, the principal of a proprietary company, Fraser Properties, the purpose of which is to avoid or minimise taxation, had the temerity to condemn-I use his words-anti-social tax avoidance schemes which are so abhorrent to the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of taxation on a broader scale, the Government's proudest boast is the abolition of inheritance taxes, which were paid by only a small, relatively privileged minority.

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -For some time I have had an interest in whether an allowance can be provided for blind pensioners who have a guide dog. My initial interest in this matter was aroused when an old blind friend contacted me and told me that in order to allow her dog to eat she had to skip meals on various occasions. This blind friend has since passed away but it seems to me that the problem that she faced is still being faced by many blind people who have a guide dog and who have only the pension that is provided to them by the Government to live on. At the moment the single pension is about $60 a week. Out of this pension a number of pensioners who have a guide dog have to care for their dog as well as for themselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Guide dogs, of course, are of tremendous importance to blind people. They give them mobility and a certain amount of independence that they would not otherwise have. I have contacted the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) on this matter on a number of occasions to see whether an allowance can be granted to these people. I want to see that those who are on the basic blind pension receive some allowance to help them with the care of their dog. Unfortunately on each occasion that I have contacted the Minister he has missed the real point that I have been trying to make. What he has said in answer each time is that there is no real need to provide an allowance for people who have a guide dog because the blind receive a pension which is free of income test. The implication there is that because the pension is free of income test blind persons can receive it in addition to having an income; therefore they are receiving some consideration already and should not be paid an extra allowance for their guide dog. The Minister is really missing the point altogether. A number of blind people receive only the basic pension. A number of single people in this situation are finding it extremely difficult not only to keep themselves but also to keep their dog. </PARA>
<PARA> I contacted a guide dog association to ask what it would cost to keep a guide dog. The person to whom I spoke could not answer me exactly but told me that it would cost at least $10 a week, stressing the words 'at least'. One must take into account not only the food that the dog requires but also other costs. The dog needs to have a special shampoo if it is to be taken on public transport with the owner. It needs brushes and it needs coats. There are all sorts of incidental expenses in addition to the food that it needs. I have been told that all this would cost at least $10 a week. If one takes $10 a week from a pension of about $60 a week the pensioner is getting far less than the poverty level, far less than we really believe that single pensioners should have. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PF4">Senator COLSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was outlining how I believed that blind pensioners who have a guide dog should receive an allowance. I mentioned that the guide dog costs a considerable amount for the blind person to keep. I also outlined how the single blind pensioner who has to rely solely on a pension probably receives only about $60 a week. In fact, the pension for a blind person is $64.10 a week. I also outlined how it costs at least $10 a week for a blind person to keep a guide dog. There are not only food costs involved but also other costs. I said that I had approached the Minister for Social Security on a number of occasions suggesting the allowance but that on each occasion either the Minister had misunderstood my remarks or his Department had and suggested that because the blind person receives an income test free pension he should be able to afford to keep his guide dog.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I recently asked the Minister for Social Security a question to find out what it would cost the Government to provide, say, a $10 a week allowance for people who have guide dogs. This was my question:</PARA>
<PARA> What would be the annual cost to the Government of providing all blind pensioners who have a guide dog with an allowance of $10 a week to compensate the pensioner for expenses incurred in caring for the dog?</PARA>
<PARA>The answer I received contained some interesting information, but again, part of the point of the question was lost. The answer read, in part:</PARA>
<PARA> There are currently almost 400 working guide dogs throughout Australia. On this basis, the cost of providing an allowance of $10 a week would be just over $200,000 per year. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me that that $200,000 a year would be well worth while for the people in Australia who have guide dogs. As I will point out later, it probably would not cost a total of $200,000 a year if we were able to institute a scheme which takes need into account. The answer goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> I have already indicated in response to the honourable senator's Question 154 (Hansard, 5 December 1980, page 498) that although blind persons do not receive a benefit specifically for the care of a guide dog, Invalid Pension (Blind) is free of income test and this assists in offsetting the costs of maintaining a guide dog. </PARA>
<PARA>That is fine for those people who do have an income in addition to their invalid pension or what is often called a blind pension. Those who do have an income certainly do not have that income counted against their pension and therefore they are able to keep their dogs. But it does not do anything for the person who has the pension only. The person who has a pension only is not really interested that that pension is free of income test because he has to use that pension for himself and his dog. If that person is a single pensioner receiving only $64.10 a week and he has to take out extra for keeping his dog he will have a hard struggle because he is really keeping himself and a dog which will cost a fair amount each week to keep on that $64.10. The fact that the pension is income test free does not help him at all. The answer that the Minister gave me to my question went on to note that the Minister's Department was directly responsible for funding 25 per cent to 30 per cent of the current output of trained guide dogs through the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service. It is, of course, admirable that the Department does this but one would think that once the guide dogs are trained the Department would help the persons who are going to use them so that they can use the dogs fully and have the fuller life they were expecting when they trained their dogs and used their dogs to guide them around. </PARA>
<PARA> Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I also outlined how this matter was brought to my attention by a blind friend of mine who is no longer with us. She outlined to me the difficulties that she was having. She was on the single rate pension only. She had a guide dog and she was extremely mobile with it. She used to go to many places in Brisbane, unaccompanied, but for her dog. She pointed out to me that so that she could keep her dog and keep it well she had to skip meals occasionally because she just could not afford the meals for herself plus the upkeep of the dog. We should not be asking blind persons to put themselves in that situation. I am not sure whether that spartan existence she had to follow contributed to her death but I could see that it is possible when blind pensioners are placed in that position. If we do not want to commit ourselves to $200,000 a year to provide $10 a week for every person in Australia who has a guide dog, perhaps we can look at some income test whereby we pay an allowance to those who are in real need. If a person is in full time employment-and some blind persons are-and he has his blind pension as well as his normal income, perhaps there may be a case for our not providing an allowance to him. So perhaps we should have a look at some type of income test which would make sure that the blind persons who are really in need do get this type of assistance. I request the Government to consider seriously a proposal like that and if we could give it favourable consideration, as I hope the Government would be able to do in time, it would certainly be a compassionate act which we could provide for the handicapped in this, the International Year of Disabled Persons. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise on the first reading of these Bills to say something about government expenditure in one area of government initiative, that of advertising. I want to talk about three ways in which governments or political parties use advertising. I begin by talking about the conventional way with which we are all familiar-conventional advertisements on television, radio, and in the Press at election time. Only last week there was a matter of public importance in the Senate in which this issue was raised by Senator Chipp. Allegations were made as to how the Liberals and the National Party in Western Australia in particular, had abused the process of political advertising at election times. Both Senator Gietzelt and Senator Chipp spoke about that issue. It is my view that at some stage the Parliament has to do something, in the interests of a viable democracy, about the question of the nature of political advertising and the amounts which can be spent on it. That can be done in a number of ways, either by a limitation on the television time which is available to political parties, or a limitation on radio time because it is unarguable that the conservative parties outspend the Labor Party, for example, by two to three times in every election. It is not just a matter of equity, of course; it is a matter of what the public can stand and what it is entitled to expect and to receive in terms of political propaganda of one kind or another at election times.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second form of advertising to which I refer is that used by journalists who are employed on a regular basis and who are paid out of the public purse in the normal course of events. All governments use Press secretaries as a legitimate way of ensuring that the public has access to a Minister and that requests made by putative members of the public for information are met as speedily as possible. Those sorts of requests and questions should be answered by any Minister in any government as promptly as possible as part of the normal process of communicating a government's activities. In addition to what happens in the national capital of Canberra some State governments-for example, those in Queensland and Western Australia-have large propaganda units, if I can use the word 'propaganda' in this context, attached to the offices of the respective Premiers. These offices are very influential in communicating information in some cases and propaganda in others to the electorate at large. </PARA>
<PARA> A few days ago I asked the Minister for Social Security, Senator Chaney, a question about the activities of the Government Information Unit in Canberra. The way in which the Minister responded to that question was very interesting. He said: 'Well, the activities of the Government Information Unit in Canberra are not really something for you to ask about because when the Whitlam Government was in power it did it too'. That is an extraordinary sort of alibi in answer to a legitimate question about the use of taxpayers' money on what is, in fact, a propaganda outfit. Senator Chaney also said: 'Look at the situation in New South Wales. There is a Labor government in New South Wales. It does that too'. One could say: Look at the situation in Senator Chaney's home State where the Premier of Western Australia has 20 Press secretaries, one for each of his 15 Ministers and five for himself. Presiding over this little empire in Western Australia is Mr John Leggoe, the former State director of the Liberal Party in Queensland, who left Queensland to become a consultant with International Public Relations Pty Ltd in Melbourne where he was attached to the Project Australia campaign. That is something I will mention in a minute. That is relevant in view of the comments I want to make on Project Australia and campaigns like it which I would argue are being funded in a way which promotes conservative governments at public expense. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the answer which Senator Chaney gave me. It is not really a suitable explanation-except, for example, for mafia leaders in the United States of America-in answer to an allegation that they have done something wrong or are doing something which is improper in terms of what should happen in a democratic society to say: 'Well, look, other people do that too'. That is heading towards the lowest common denominator of political standards when a Minister gives that sort of answer to a question. Of course, the Minister for National Development and Energy, Senator Carrick, who is sitting in the chamber tonight, is a master of that sort of answer. The answer to everything that this Government is criticised about is, of course: 'Oh, the other lot did this too'. It is an extraordinary argument to be advanced by a Minister in a government which was elected on the basis that it could do better. </PARA>

That is an absolutely childish proposition-my daddy is a policeman type of argument-and one which, as I have said, is appropriate to the mafia in the United States. It is a 'be nice to us and we will be nice to you' sort of argument. It is not an appropriate argument in terms of political standards and high public life in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was making the point that in a sense the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has taken a leaf out of the Premiers' books-the Premiers to whom I referred-in establishing the Government Information Unit. Of course the whole idea of the Government Information Unit is to prevent the Government being accountable in any real sense. The operatives, if I can use that expression, of the Government Information Unit are placed on the staffs of Ministers in each of the capital cities where they are euphemistically described as liaison officers. During the last election campaign the members of the Unit were engaged in electioneering for the Liberal Party--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Carrick" NAMEID="2U4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I make that charge and I invite the Government to deny it by argument and not by interjection. Those liaison officers wrote speeches, made tapes and were engaged in contact work with media outlets. They were extensions of the Liberal Party's campaign office directed by Bob Baudino and the man hired to run the media campaign, the Canberra lobbyist, Jonathan Gaul. Their activities were quite blatant. Any number of journalists in the Press Gallery in Canberra can tell honourable senators about their activities at various capital cities around the country during the last election campaign. Those people were paid with taxpayers' money and they were asked to work for the Liberal Party. They did work for the Liberal Party during the election campaign. That is an allegation which I make and happily invite the Government to deny it because if it wants to get into the details of the matter it will be able to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have said, the activities of these people were quite blatant. This misuse of taxpayers' money is now to be extended by the expansion of this Government Information Office. More staff are to be engaged, so encouraged was the Prime Minister at the prospect of getting propaganda work carried out at no expense to the Liberal Party during the last election campaign. One of the new recruits for this Unit is to be a gentleman whose job it will be to sell or flog rehearsed statements by Ministers on cassette tapes. These tapes will go to radio stations around the country at enormous cost. Of course, the aim again will be to by-pass journalists and prevent awkward questioning. In doing that the Government will be selling policies like soap. Of course, many of the details of its policies bear a lot of resemblance to soap. But that is what the Government is doing. It will be marketing its policies like soap and it will be circumventing the democratic process by not allowing Ministers to answer questions and not forcing the fact that Ministers sometimes have to face up to difficult questions. All these statements will be pre-packaged in cassettes and sent around the country to be played on radio stations around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the aim is to by-pass journalists, to by-pass one of the most important elements of a democratic society. The fourth estate of the French Republic will be by-passed in Malcolm Fraser's society-Australia in the 1980s. If that is in store for us by cassettes being distributed to radio stations, no doubt it is also in the minds of some of the advisers of the Government that it can be in store for us in a television operation in which the same methods are used-cassette recordings being traded as pre-packaged programs to television stations around the country. I raise this issue in the Senate because it is only 1981. It is not 1984 in Australia and this society should not be behaving as if in 1981 we had reached Orwell's 1984 by instituting this method of disseminating propaganda. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice that Senator Bjelke-Petersen is in the chamber. In all these matters her husband, as Premier of Queensland, has more guts than the Fraser Government in the way he deals with the Press because he is not afraid to answer questions. I do not think he ever answers a question-I must say that-but that may be a political skill which he has. He is not afraid to mix with the Press and be subjected to questions. That is the sort of objection which I have about the Fraser Government: It is afraid to be subjected to questioning. Hence we are to have this sort of pre-packaged programming which will go out on cassettes to radio and television stations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government Information Unit supposedly now costs something under $300,000 a year to run. But the real cost of the upgraded operation will be not less than $500,000 a year. It will cost $500,000 a year to run this creaky propaganda machine. For example, the Government will spend in two years more of the taxpayers' money than the Labor Party Australia-wide spent in the whole of the last Federal election campaign. In two years it will spend that amount of taxpayers' money. As I have said, I am concerned that that is not a good thing for Australian society and not a good thing even for Ministers in the Fraser Government because in time they will get terribly like the product which is packaged-less nimble witted than they have been, and that is saying something. </PARA>
<PARA> This, of course, is not the end of the categories of advertising in which the Fraser Government is currently engaged. It is not the end of the sort of propaganda war which the Prime Minister is concerned to engage in from day to day. The Prime Minister has also tapped another important market-the jingo market-in quite a sophisticated way. Not that I am suggesting that the Prime Minister is sophisticated about jingoes; he has the sophistication, perhaps, to employ sophisticated advisers on this matter. Let us look, for example, at the programs I refer to as being in the third category of advertising, one of which is dealt with in the Australian Manufacturing Council report for 1979-80. I refer to Project Australia. I recommend Project Australia for the gentle attention of the razor gang. The expenditure of some $4m of taxpayers' money could be got rid of with one slash, and this country would be no worse off. </PARA>

I understand that that has been mentioned as a possible victim of the razor gang. I invite the razor gang to turn its Sweeney Todd attentions to Project Australia as well. In my view that is the most damaging campaign to this society. Project Australia was started with the best intentions in the world. They are all revealed in the Manufacturing Council report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The intentions of Project Australia were to encourage people to buy Australian goods. That is very laudable, but the Prime Minister's advisers got hold of the thing and saw it as a way of doing something which this Government has consistently failed to do and which this country really needs. The Government saw it as a canned, pre-packaged method of encouraging community pride, nationalism and so on in this country. The campaign is supposed to generate a positive sense of community purpose as a basis for a reinvigorated Australia. We all share a common concern about a reinvigorated Australia. Millions of voters in this country in 1975 and 1977 voted for a government which promised a reinvigorated Australia. The voters believed, as Malcolm Fraser put it, that he would turn on the lights and create a new and just society in which nobody would be out of work, in which Medibank would be retained, in which we would have good health services and full employment and in which everybody would be stimulated by the private enterprise goal of initiative and so on. That was the sort of society which was to be created; that is why the electors voted for Malcolm Fraser. Five years later, after he has failed in all these aims and does not talk about them any more, a phoney sort of thing called Project Australia is created. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make myself quite clear. Senator Carrick interjected about the 'Life. Be in it' campaign. There is not one tittle of evidence that any Australian is healthier because of the millions of dollars that have been poured into the campaign. Some surveys show that people like the advertisements. They like the character called Norm. Many of them can identify with him, I suppose. They like the advertisements because they are good quality. An important thing to say about Project Australia and 'Life. Be in it.' is that they are examples of good Australian talent at work creating very skilful advertisements. What is the purpose of it all? What is the result of taxpayers' moneys being spent on these programs? Month after month one can see the figures which show higher rates of consumption of alcohol, cigarettes and so on. There is no evidence that society is any healthier at all. There is stacks of evidence that these programs are costing a lot of money and that all the people really like about the campaigns are the advertisements. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn more importantly to Project Australia. Project Australia, through its jingles on television and radio, is saying: 'Look! You Australians out there are a lot of slobs. You are all too lazy. If only you got off your backsides and worked harder this would be a great country'. Such a campaign is turning the responsibility which the Fraser Government accepted in terms of its own rhetoric-it said that it would provide leadership in this country and a new sort of society-on to the people. It is also blaming the failure of the Fraser Government on the people of this country. The Government is saying to the people: 'You get to work, and work harder. That is what is wrong with this country'. The Government is saying that the fault lies with the people and not with the leaders, the politicians and the statesmen, so-called. It is saying: 'We are not wrong. We are not failing to provide leadership. You people out there are responsible for the ills of this country'. I invite anybody to read the jingles of Project Australia and to reach any other conclusion. The jingles of Project Australia are directed at putting the blame for a lack of national leadership and the national crisis on the Australian people and taking the blame away from Malcolm Fraser. The result is that this society will become more and more divided if taxpayers' money at a similar rate-$4m has already been spent on Project Australia-continues to be spent on these phoney campaigns. </PARA>
<PARA> These phoney campaigns are a waste of taxpayers' money. They are attempts to take responsibility off the Government and to put it on the people. Do honourable senators remember the great sayings of Bertolt Brecht, the German playwright, who said that the government had lost confidence in the people; the government had decided to dismiss the people? That is what is happening with Project Australia. The Government has lost confidence in the people. It is not a question of the people losing confidence in the Government-as yet. These sorts of campaigns not only evade responsibility but also, in my view, are calculated to encourage, in the long term, cynicism about the political process and governments in this country. That is a bad thing. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to deal with one other aspect of Government-funded campaigns. Why did the Government, in financing Project Australia, use the Task Quantum advertising agency, one of the Liberal Party's polling organisations, to develop this campaign? One wonders whether Task Quantum, the advertising agency, did its research into community attitudes in Australia for the Project Australia campaign with an eye to the needs of Tony Eggleton, the national secretary of the Liberal Party, and with an eye to the fortunes of the Liberal Party. Did Tony Eggleton have any input in deciding the brief for Project Australia polling? Did he have any input into the questions people were asked about what they thought of Project Australia and what they thought about the sense of nationalism and unity in this country? Was any special research material given to Eggleton by Task Quantum as a private arrangement? In Perth during the recent election campaign allegations emerged of dirty tricks being carried out by George Camakaris, the principal of Task Quantum, on behalf of the Liberal Party. That was mentioned in all the newspapers. I wonder who else got taxpayers' money out of Project Australia? I suspect, for one, International Public Relations. I have referred already to the activities of Mr Leggoe, now in Western Australia, who is a former director of International Public Relations. On March 21 this year the editorial of the Sydney Morning Herald stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Last financial year the Federal Government spent more than $15m on advertising, much of it on television. This year the figure will be considerably higher and there will be more emphasis on television. The not-so-underlying theme of much of it is Australia, the Lucky Country, with some beaut, cheery suggestions on how to make it even even luckier. </PARA>
<PARA>By the end of this financial year Project Australia, as I said, will have cost about $4m. Project Australia is being accused of dealing in hopeful generalities rather than trying to change the actual conditions under which people work. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality of this country, as of every other country, is simply that pride in a country is created by people knowing that it is a just society in which things are done well, in which technical standards are high and in which technology is innovative; when people can look ahead and say: 'My children are going to grow up in a society without two million living in poverty, in a society where there are not unemployed people and work is shared, in a society where there are opportunities for all and there is, as near as possible, equality of opportunity, and in a society which can stand on its own two feet in the rest of the world and say: Here in Australia we do things in a fair way and in a skilled way; we are a lucky country and we are entitled to be lucky because of the efforts we put into it'. They are the sorts of attitudes which will encourage a healthy and forward looking nationalism in this country and which can make us all proud of the society in which we live. The sort of phoney nationalism shown in the attitudes of Project Australia, which are simply, as I said, to divert the blame from the Government to the people of this country and which use these alleged skills of advertising agencies to encourage a sort of false charge in people like a few glasses of beer do for some, is not something we want. The Government, in my view, is to be roundly condemned for wasting the taxpayers' money on this sort of activity-the third tier of advertising in which the Fraser Government engages. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will take note of that. I have plenty of examples of the other. The conspiracy of silence referred to in the Northern Territory News involves plans to use City Council land, Federal Government land, a street in Darwin and the resumption of private land to enable a hotel-convention centre to be built by a foreign company. This foreign company has its base in Sabah. I understand that this hotel-convention centre-performing arts centre will cost about $40m. While referring to this I will also refer to the broader issues, and put this proposition: What protection have people got when local government and State government-in this case the Territory Government-collude against the wishes of the people of that place, if it is against the wishes of the people? I will refer to that later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me give a little background. The former Mayor of Darwin, Dr Stack, arranged for land for a performing arts centre. This was to be her monument-something she would leave behind after her period in office. The land she acquired to do this consisted of the old Town Hall site, a block of land owned by a southern newspaper as the residence for its local correspondent and two blocks owned by the Federal Government. Plans were drawn up for this centre-an excellent proposition-and money was collected. Some money was allocated from the Tracy fund to assist in the building of this place. Unbeknown to the people of Darwin, the Northern Territory Government and the present mayor have been negotiating with a foreign company, the company to which I referred. I read from the 26 March 1981 edition of the Northern Territory News which is a staunch supporter of the Northern Territory Government. In part of the editorial it had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> In one of the most secretive government deals this newspaper has uncovered it appears Darwin's hopes and dreams for a full-scale performing arts complex have been sold out to a foreign company . . . For not until today has the public had any inkling that the Northern Territory Government and Darwin City Corporation have been furtively carrying out a deal with a Malaysian company for a big hotel complex on prime public land previously designated for the arts complex. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposal entails-again I read directly from the front page of the 26 March issue of the Northern Territory News:</PARA>
<PARA> Hotel, convention centre and theatre complex to be built by a foreign company. </PARA>
<PARA> The Darwin City Council to relinquish two blocks earmarked for a community performing arts centre. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government to relinquish two adjoining blocks. </PARA>
<PARA> McLachlan Street between Mitchell Street and the Esplanade to be closed. </PARA>
<PARA> The complex to extend across the closed street and on to three blocks opposite. </PARA>
<PARA> These are owned (1) by a pastoral company of which Tourism and Primary Production Minister, Roger Steele, is a director; (2) architects and town planners Stapledon Vos Pty Ltd and (3) former Northern Territory Port Authority chairman, Captain Tom Milner. </PARA>
<PARA>I understand Mr Steele, the Minister, is quite happy for his company to sell its land. Captain Milner has not been approached and certainly is not happy to sell, but the matter has not been discussed with him at all. What are the major objections I want to raise tonight to the proposition? The first is the secrecy-there has been no consultation with the Northern Territory people. This once again is a concern to us. It was referred to by my leader in the comments he made about the Government's losing faith in the people. The Government of the Northern Territory does not involve the people in its decision-making, and I think this is a disadvantage. I have drawn attention to this previously. There has been no consultation with the aldermen either. Honourable senators will have noticed that I was careful to refer to the Mayor of Darwin and not the Corporation. I read again from the Northern Territory News, this time from the 27 March edition:</PARA>
<PARA> Darwin aldermen are believed to be angry about being left out of preliminary negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA> They knew nothing until the proposal was presented to them as a fait accompli last Friday. </PARA>
<PARA> They were simply told about it and advised that Mr McHenry--</PARA>
<PARA>He is the co-ordinator for the Northern Territory Government-</PARA>
<PARA>would be present to talk to them. </PARA>
<PARA> They were so in the dark they boycotted the talk until they had a chance to discuss it among themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> One alderman told The NT News: 'It appears the Government is railroading the proposal through before anybody can protest. </PARA>
<PARA> 'It was the same with the Mindil Beach casino deal-we were told the day before the Government announcement. </PARA>
<PARA> 'We feel we have been sold down the drain. </PARA>
<PARA> Everything has gone on behind closed doors with no consultation whatever, even with those who will be using the place. </PARA>
<PARA> 'The whole thing has been pretty murky and I for one am very cross'. </PARA>
<PARA>In that instance he referred to the fact that there has been no consultation with the people who will be using it. One of the groups that would be using it would be the Northern Territory Arts Council. I refer to a comment made by Ms Liz Andrew who was administrator of the Council. Again I read from the Northern Territory News of 27 March:</PARA>
<PARA> Administrator of the NT Arts Council, Ms Liz Andrew is concerned at the lack of consultation over the whole affair. </PARA>
<PARA> 'A couple of individuals have come to us and talked about what we think but there has been no sitting down around the table for serious discussion. </PARA>
<PARA> 'It got to the stage we were finding out things because somebody dropped bits here and there. </PARA>
<PARA> 'We certainly have not been shown any plans.'</PARA>
<PARA>My second objection to the proposition is the change in the design. To fit the performing arts complex within the hotel the size of the hall, originally designed for 1,200, has been reduced to a 1,000-seating capacity. This is obviously not economical. A professional theatre director, Simon Hopkinson, made the comment that ballet and similar shows need double the size to cover costs. Ms Andrew, to whom I have already referred as the administrator of the Northern Territory Arts Council, said:</PARA>
<PARA> The reduction from 1,200 to 1,000 means the loss of $3,000 per night for shows like Evita and obviously a little less for shows where the costs are not as great. </PARA>
<PARA>There has been a loss of rehearsal rooms because in the new complex there will be no space for rehearsal rooms. They have been one of the first casualties. This is very bad, because obviously there will be no appropriate training area. The major hall will be tied up for rehearsals which means that the shows produced will not be produced so well. More importantly, young people and those who are interested in the arts will not have an opportunity for rehearsal and, therefore, will not be able to put on shows. Another thing which concerns us particularly is the loss of what in the original plans was called the performing place-a 250-seat auditorium suitable for dance and intimate drama. </PARA>
<PARA> The last point I want to make, although there are other objections, is the association of the complex with the hotel, particularly as it is being built by a foreign group. Certainly there may be advantages-people have claimed advantages-but I would say that the number of disadvantages outweighs them. Ms Andrew of the Northern Territory Arts Council stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The other thing that concerns me is that theatre patrons would have to go to the hotel for a drink during interval. </PARA>
<PARA> Imagine how tricky this would be during a 15 minute interval. </PARA>
<PARA> Frankly I am appalled that Darwin is to get a big, brassy commercial hotel that will only benefit Borneo millionaires. </PARA>
<PARA> That land was earmarked years ago for a performing arts centre for the people, now we're getting a hotel. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government built a museum and art gallery and a craft centre, and is now discriminating against another section of the arts. </PARA>
<PARA>It is disturbing because the Government could have maintained the original concept. It dithered and it lost the opportunity. Building costs now have escalated to between $15m and $17m, and that is beyond the resources which are available to the Council and to the Government. Lest I be accused of knocking development, let me hasten to say that I am not doing that at all. I think the hotel is a good idea. Another hotel for Darwin to boost tourism is an excellent idea. A hotel which provides a good quality convention centre is an excellent idea also. But one must query whether it ought to be in that place and whether it ought to replace the performing arts centre. Obviously, if we are missing this we will lose our free standing cultural centre with all the features that I have mentioned-the rehearsal rooms, the intimate theatre, a fine building which would be an aesthetic addition to the city. We will lose all those things, and the land which was earmarked for a performing arts centre will be used for a hotel. </PARA>
<PARA> But my main objection-let me put it again quite clearly-is to the lack of consultation with the people of the Northern Territory. Obviously, we accept the proposition that business needs some privacy, but when public land is involved-both State and Federal land-and when public money and public ambitions are involved, surely the people themselves ought to be involved. There is a difference between getting a good deal in the paternalistic sense for people and riding rough shod over them. My feelings are summed up in the editorial comment which states:</PARA>
<PARA> The furtiveness of negotiations between the Northern Territory Government, council and Bena Holdings is staggering considering the involvement of public money, public land and the destruction of the original performing arts centre concept which was long heralded as bringing Darwin to cultural maturity. </PARA>
<PARA> Whatever the motives, there has been a conspiracy of silence as far as the public is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> While a major new hotel would certainly be in Darwin's best interests, the trade-off for private development, the lack of public accountability and the buddy-type negotiations require explanation. </PARA>
<PARA> As an exercise in how not to go about winning the confidence of people this must rank as a public debacle without peer. </PARA>
<PARA>I hasten to add that the Federal Government is involved. It obviously was a party to the deal because Federal land was involved. It must have been a party to the negotiations; it must share some of the criticism. </PARA>
<PARA> The action which was taken by the Everingham Government is paternalistic in the worst sense. It is the sort of thing which I have criticised before. The question which must be asked is: What sort of protection can a Federal government offer to citizens of the Territory in an issue such as this? It is not sufficient to say: 'Toss them out at the next elections'. That is not the answer. State and Territory governments obviously must have some autonomy. We accept this and we have worked for it. We have worked to get our own legislative assembly. What concerns me is that I see a situation in which the Federal Government is involved in negotiations and then does not require any assurance that the project which was to go ahead enjoys the support of the Northern Territory people. It must be of concern to us sitting in this chamber to see that the Federal Government is giving to a foreign company land on which to build a hotel. I have said in this place before that an electoral mandate goes only so far, and this has gone beyond it. </PARA>

<PARA>Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability) Bill 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth Government has, over the years, pursued policies that are aimed at protecting the Australian coastline. In keeping with that history, I am now introducing a package of legislation entitled Protection of the Sea. The package represents a major advance in marine pollution prevention and combat in Australia. These matters have been the subject of detailed discussion with the States in the Marine and Ports Council and also with industry. Australia has been participating for more than thirty years in international organisations that develop international conventions on maritime matters. Australia has a good record in implementing these international agreements after they come into force. Australia as an island continent has a long coastline that, in places, is environmentally extremely sensitive and I believe it is now opportune to introduce legislation to augment the existing law. </PARA>
<PARA> The 'Protection of the Sea' legislation package contains the following Bills:</PARA>
<PARA> Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability) Bill, Protection of the Sea (Powers of Intervention) Bill, Protection of the Sea (Discharge of Oil from Ships) Bill, Navigation (Protection of the Sea) Amendment Bill, Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy) Bill and Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy Collection) Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Understandings on Offshore Matters reached at the Premiers Conference in June 1979 provide for Commonwealth legislation on certain matters relating to ship-sourced marine pollution. The six Bills accord with the Understandings. The Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability) Bill will implement the provisions of the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage 1969 and the 1976 Protocol to that Convention. The Convention requires ships carrying more than 2000 tons of oil in bulk as cargo to maintain insurance to cover liability for pollution damage. The Convention and the Bill provide for ship owners to limit their liability to an amount determined by the size of the ship. The maximum level of compensation available under the provisions of the Convention is in excess of $A14.9m but this amount relates to tankers with a register tonnage of more than 105,000 tons. No tankers of that size trade to Australia. The maximum liability for an incident involving the largest tanker in the Australian fleet would approximate $A7.8m. The Bill preserves the operation of State and Territory laws that give effect to Convention requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is appropriate to outline the other measures that are envisaged by the Protection of the Sea legislation package so that honourable senators will be aware of the interrelationship of the various Bills. The Protection of the Sea (Powers of Intervention) Bill will implement the provisions of the 1969 International Convention Relating to Intervention on the High Seas in Cases of Oil Pollution Casualties. The Bill will also implement the provisions of the 1973 Protocol to that Convention. Where pollution or a threat of a pollution incident exists the Bill empowers the Minister to take any appropriate action on the high seas or in territorial waters in regard to Australian or foreign ships. The Minister will be required to have regard to Convention constraints which are incorporated in the Bill in using this power. The Bill preserves the operation of State and Territory legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1970, Part VIIA of the Navigation Act 1912 has included provisions based on the Civil Liability and Intervention Conventions. The Navigation (Protection of the Seas) Amendment Bill will repeal Part VIIA of the Navigation Act so that the Bills I have just outlined can give full effect to the provisions of the respective Conventions. Part VIIA of the Navigation Act currently contains intervention powers which are broader than the powers conferred by the Convention or Protocol. Australia has always asserted that customary international law provides a nation with powers to protect its territory and coastal sea. The Protection of the Sea (Powers of Intervention) Bill will continue to apply these provisions in Australian pollution legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Protection of the Sea (Discharge of Oil from Ships) Bill will repeal and replace the Pollution of the Sea by Oil Act 1960. That Act gives effect to the provisions of the 1954 International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil. The new Bill picks up the provisions of the 1960 Act and, in addition, will implement the requirements of the two 1971 Amendments to the Convention. The first amendment will provide increased protection to the Great Barrier Reef by prohibiting the operational discharge of oil within or near the Reef by redefining the Convention term 'nearest land'. The new arrangement will ensure that oil is not discharged within 50 miles of the outer edge of the Great Barrier Reef. The second 1971 amendment to the 1954 Convention imposed limits on the size and location of cargo tanks in tankers. The new Bill applies these provisions to Australian ships. </PARA>
<PARA> The Navigation (Protection of the Sea) Amendment Bill repeals Part VIIA of the Navigation Act 1912, as I mentioned earlier. It also inserts a new Division 12 in Part IV of the Navigation Act. The new Division imposes requirements on tanker owners and masters in relation to survey, certification and production of certificates. These provisions are included in the Navigation Act to maintain the various survey and construction requirements in one piece of legislation. In addition the Minister will have power to direct foreign tankers to take certain action while the tanker is within the Australian jurisdiction. These powers will be exercised only insofar as it is necessary to do so to protect the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> The remaining Bills in the package are the Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy) Bill and the Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy Collection) Bill. These Bills respectively repeal and replace the Pollution of the Sea by Oil (Shipping Levy) Act 1972 and the Pollution of the Sea by Oil (Shipping Levy Collection) Act 1972. The new Bills maintain all the provisions of the existing Acts, but change the titles of the legislation to maintain uniformity with the remainder of the legislation package. </PARA>
<PARA> The Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy) Bill includes a new provision to ensure that the minimum amount of levy able to be collected will be maintained at an economic level. In addition, the definition of oil in the Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy Collection) Bill has been extended to include a wider range of hydrocarbon pollutants. That establishes the relationship of this Bill to the other Bills in the package. I now commend the Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability) Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA>Protection of the Sea (Powers of Intervention) Bill 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>As I indicated in my second reading speech for the Civil Liability Bill, the Powers of Intervention Bill will implement the 1969 International Convention Relating to Intervention on the High Seas in Cases of Oil Pollution Casualties, and its 1973 Protocol. The Bill contains powers that the Minister may invoke to intervene in an actual or threatened pollution incident. I commend the Bill to Honourable Senators. </PARA>
<PARA>Protection of the Sea (Discharge of Oil from Ships) Bill 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The Protection of the Sea (Discharge of Oil from Ships) Bill brings the existing provisions in the Pollution of the Sea by Oil Act 1960 into line with other measures in the Protection of the Sea Legislation Package. These provisions implement the 1954 International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil. The Discharge of Oil from Ships Bill makes provision to bring into force the 1971 Amendments to the 1954 International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil. These Amendments relate to cargo tank sizes and location in tankers and also make provision for the protection of the Great Barrier Reef. The Pollution of the Sea by Oil Acts 1960, 1965 and 1972 are repealed and replaced by this Bill. I commend this Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA>Navigation (Protection of the Sea) Amendment Bill 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The Navigation (Protection of the Sea) Amendment Bill repeals Part VIIA of the Navigation Act 1912, which contained provisions based on the International Conventions relating respectively to civil liability and intervention on the high seas. In addition, the Bill inserts a new Division 12 in Part IV of the Navigation Act 1912. The new part incorporates certification, survey and certificate production requirements in relation to tankers. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA>Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy) Bill 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The Bill repeals and replaces the Pollution of the Sea by Oil (Shipping Levy) Act 1972. The title has been changed to reflect the unity of the 'Protection of the Sea' legislation package. A provision has been included in the Bill which will allow the minimum levy payable by ships to be set by regulation. This minimum levy is not to exceed $25. The purpose of this provision is to ensure that the legislation will not require the collection of amounts of levy that are uneconomic to collect. I commend this Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA>Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy Collection) Bill 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>As with the Shipping Levy Bill, this Bill has a changed title from its 1972 predecessor to conform with the 'Protection of the Sea' legislation package. The Bill also includes an amendment to the definition of 'oil' in the 1972 Shipping Levy Collection Act. The new definition of 'oil' extends to both persistent and non-persistent oils. I commend this Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I extend my congratulations to Senator Button, who utilised the first reading of the Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability) Bill 1981 and associated Bills to highlight some of the acute problems facing our country and the deficiencies of the administration of the Fraser Government. I also commend the various speakers on my side of the House who have taken advantage of the first reading in order to raise similarly a number of their criticisms about the way in which the Government is proceeding. I think one only has to look at the paucity of legislation which the Parliament is currently considering to realise the inept way in which the affairs of this country are being administered by the Fraser Government. Here we are, for example, in the fifth week of the third Fraser Ministry with the House of Representatives still dealing with the Address-in-Reply.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RG4">Senator GIETZELT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The criticisms to which I refer flow from the frustration of the Opposition and the complete irrelevance that the Parliament has in the process of government in this country. We are dealing with legislation which deals with the protection of our seas and with pollution. Even this legislation had its origins in processes which were begun in 1975 and continued in 1978. It is 1981 before we actually have the legislation before the Parliament. The Opposition is entitled to believe that the Government has very little to place before the Parliament and therefore it is taking every step within its powers to deal with legislation which it considers to be more relevant than the sort of legislation to which Senator Button referred. In no way do we criticise the Government for putting this legislation before the Senate; in fact, the legislation is long overdue. It is the sort of legislation that should have been dealt with by the first Fraser Government, certainly by the second Fraser Government, and should not be dealt with at this stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The first three of the six Bills we are dealing with seek to implement the provisions of the long-established international conventions and protocols and therefore seek to deal with the civil liabilities arising from pollution, the powers of intervention and the problems occasioned by the discharge of oil from ships. The Navigation (Protection of the Sea) Amendment Bill contains provisions relating to those parts of the three Bills to which I have referred. The other two Bills that we are debating relate to the collection of a levy imposed on the shipping industry to maintain supplies of equipment to combat pollution of the sea by oil. These two Bills, the Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy) Bill and the Protection of the Sea (Shipping Levy Collection) Bill, which also are important, are related to the other Bills to which I have referred. These two Bills also seek to repeal and replace existing Acts. </PARA>
<PARA> Because Bills similar to these have been considered by the parliaments of many other countries and by international agencies obviously the Opposition will not oppose them. Rather, we will support them. After all, the objective of the legislation is to prevent the pollution of our maritime areas. As Australia is a maritime power, an island continent, it is important that we take steps to protect from pollution our foreshores and other important environmental areas. </PARA>
<PARA> The Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability) Bill seeks to implement the provisions of the 1969 International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage and the 1976 Protocol to that Convention. The Convention has been operative in many other parts of the world since 1975. It operates as an international treaty. The Protocol referred to in this legislation will come into force on 8 April 1981. This Convention and the Protocol were drawn up under the auspices of the Inter-governmental Maritime Consultative Organisation, which is a specialised agency of the United Nations, and acts as the international secretariat or governmental forum, if you like, which debates and drafts all kinds of conventions on maritime matters. In the modern world of today this indicates how important it is for agreements to be reached between governments at the international level on a whole range of matters, particularly those that relate to issues which have some interdependence on and co-operation between countries. It highlights a view that has been expressed so often in the past by those who believe that we need to see the development of a much wider form of a world parliament to handle so many of these issues. With the growth in the internationalisation of industry and of capital and the development of the multinational type corporations in the international sphere which owe allegiance to no particular country and which act in their own interests and often against the interests of individual countries, it is becoming more and more important that we establish some form of international control, some form of international co-operation, some form of international decision making which will establish general forms of behaviour which will mitigate against the sorts of problems of pollution dealt with in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem of pollution caused by ships is a matter which has concerned many countries for decades. It has taken a good deal of time and energy and understanding on the part of many countries and the companies involved in the transportation of oil by sea to sort out and to establish a code of behaviour which would prevent pollution of the type we have seen in so many parts of the world as oil in particular is moved from one part of the world to another. The IMCO conventions do not themselves constitute maritime law. That maritime law operates in the member states of IMCO. Over 100 countries base their laws upon the agreements to which I have referred. This results in consistent standards being adopted and from time to time amended for the international shipping industry to the advantage of all concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> The Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability) Bill requires ships carrying more than 2,000 tonnes of oil in bulk as cargo to maintain insurance certificates to cover their liability for pollution damage that they may cause. We have read from time to time of the tremendous damage that has been done in various parts of the world by ships which for a variety of reasons have created pollution of great magnitude. The Bill enables ship owners to limit their liability to a rate of approximately $142 per tonne of the ship's registered tonnage up to a limit of about $14.9m. The Bill preserves the legislation of a State or Territory and consequently its provisions do not cover intrastate trading vessels. Government non-commercial vessels, basically warships, and Australian fishing vessels on non-overseas voyages are also exempt. The Bill contains adequate penalties against vessels contravening or not complying with its provisions. Ships can be detained by the Minister until the penalty is paid, and that includes foreign ships still within Australian territorial waters. The legislation does not provide for a time limit in relation to prosecutions. When we consider the number of ships that travel our shores and when we consider the problems that could arise for example in the northern part of our continent, particularly around the Great Barrier Reef area, we can appreciate the grave oil pollution difficulties that could arise should a ship's captain not have regard to his obligations under this legislation or to the agreements that have been reached at the international level. The passage of this legislation will establish a standard by which ships, ships' captains and shipowners will accept a greater liability than they have had to accept in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as I have been able to establish, Australia is not a contracting state to the IMCO Fund Convention, the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage; neither has it ratified the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships which was signed way back in 1973, eight years ago. The Australian Government does not have a good track record in ratifying these conventions and protocols; nor does it have a good record in relation to implementing the recommendations of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation in its report into the prevention and control of oil pollution in the marine environment, which report was tabled in 1978. That Committee recommended that the Australian Government ratify the International Convention on Standards of Training, Certification and Watchkeeping for Seafarers of 1978, which I believe is still unimplemented. </PARA>
<PARA> The Protection of the Sea (Powers of Intervention) Bill 1981 seeks to implement the provisions of the 1969 International Convention Relating to Intervention on the High Seas in Cases of Oil Pollution Casualties and the provisions of the 1973 Protocol to that Convention. The Convention was ratified by most countries as far back as 1975. Honourable senators can understand why I have made some criticism of the failure of the Fraser Government to take the sorts of steps that should have been taken years ago to bring these matters before the Parliament. This Bill will permit the Minister to take any measures on the high seas deemed necessary to prevent, mitigate or eliminate dangers to the coastline or related interests of Australia from pollution or the threat of pollution by oil and noxious substances. This covers not only Australian ships but also foreign ships. In cases outside the scope of the convention or protocol reliance is placed on customary international law. Again, the penalties for a breach of the provision or the directions are considered adequate. </PARA>
<PARA> The second Bill, the Protection of the Sea (Discharge of Oil from Ships) Bill 1981, will give effect to the provisions of the 1954 International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Sea by Oil or its subsequent amendments. This Bill will repeal and replace the Pollution of the Sea by Oil Act 1960 which gave effect to the provisions of the 1954 convention. The two 1971 amendments are of great significance. One of these provides increased protection for the Great Barrier Reef by prohibiting oil discharges within 50 miles of the outer edge of the reef. When this matter was discussed in the Opposition party room some concern was expressed about the fact that we could well have adopted a much stricter limit than 50 miles, bearing in mind that we could have a major pollution problem occurring in that area and that 50 miles probably was not a sufficient distance to ensure safety from ships polluting the reef by discharging substances. </PARA>
<PARA> When we had regard to our existing policies of sovereignty in respect of the 200-mile limit the view was expressed that it ought to include 200 miles to the east of the Great Barrier Reef. That, of course, is not provided for in the legislation but I think that it is a matter that the Parliament at some future stage ought to re-examine from the point of view of protecting that wonderful part of our natural heritage, the Great Barrief Reef. Under our federal jurisdiction the Bill, of course, strictly prohibits the deliberate discharge of oil or oily substances into the seas. The Bill preserves the operation of State and Territorial legislation which covers territorial seas and island waters. Overall, the Bill is an important piece of legislation. It establishes processes by which the States, in co-operation with the Commonwealth, will exercise new powers over the control of pollution. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that there is enough empirical evidence to show that there is an important need for the legislation to be operative as quickly as possible and to establish the processes and procedures by which we can keep under surveillance ships operating in our waters. For example, the Department of Transport, during tanker inspections between 1 August 1977 and 31 December 1978, discovered that out of 230 ships inspected 122 demonstrated deficiencies. That accounts for over half of the ships inspected. Moreover, there were 480 deficiencies from the 122 inspections. A great many of the problems or deficiencies arising from the inspections were found in flags of convenience vessels. I think we know enough about the way in which vessels flying a flag of convenience operate to know that they are largely irresponsible and largely do not properly apply themselves to areas of responsibility as far as member states and governments are concerned. They take an independent position. The purpose of this legislation, of course, is to bring them much more under the influence and control of countries in which they operate. </PARA>
<PARA> Another reason for the legislation's importance is demonstrated by the figures showing that between 1 June 1976 to May 1977 there were almost 90 reported oil pollution incidents from ships around Australia. For example, from 1 January 1978 to 31 December 1980 there were 85 oil spills in Botany Bay. This is an area with which I have very close relations because it is near where I live. According to the Maritime Services Board of New South Wales 309,400 litres of oil were spilt in Botany Bay in the decade 1970-80. Whilst it is conceded that many of these spills were small the continual slow release of oil from repeated spills in a confined space such as a harbour or bay, as happened in Botany Bay, is detrimental to marine development. Of course, it is well known that Botany Bay is one of the most important oyster producing areas of our country. It is not only a favourite recreational area but it also has particular significance for the oyster farming industry. Of course, many varieties of birds and fish, as well as mangrove swamps, exist in that area. Despite this we have had continual problems of pollution in this area from oil carrying vessels. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, with the holing of the ship World Encouragement in September 1979 in Botany Bay 20 tonnes of crude oil escaped. The costs of oil pollution in environmental damage, clean-up costs and civil damage suits were high indeed in that area. These areas need to be protected and the persons responsible for these mishaps have to be put in a position where they pay the penalty. This legislation will go some way towards combating pollution of the sea by oil as a result of the establishment of Australian joint Federal-State machinery to combat oil pollution from ships in our waters. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it strange that in the second reading speech not once did the Minister mention the national plan which, after all, is a very important part in protecting the environment of our Australian waters. This is a co-operative process by which Commonwealth and State administrations will play a considerable and important new part in protecting our natural environment from the sort of pollution so prominent in our Australian waters in the last 20 or 30 years. The legislation will take some steps toward establishing important new processes by which those responsible for the mistakes of the past will now be subject to a process under which they will pay the penalties deserved for their inconsiderate treatment of our environment. If there is a deficiency in the legislation certainly it will be shown up. To the extent that the Opposition has considered the legislation, it believes there are some deficiencies, nevertheless the legislation will be given its support. We in the Opposition express the hope that the absolutely vital co-operation between the Commonwealth and State instrumentalities will result in important improvements in protecting our marine environment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is discussing the package of what is known as the protection of the sea legislation. Certainly, at this stage of the evening I am not going to enumerate all the Bills involved. As everybody knows, Australia is an island continent. As a result, it has a very long coastline. It is generally recognised that we can attribute our vast tourist inflow to part of that coastline. Indeed, we have some of the best beaches in the world, as anybody who travels will recognise. Oil spills can cause devastation to those beaches and some of the coastal wonders.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In a speech on 28 February 1979 I went into more detail than I will go into tonight on the effects of drilling on the Great Barrier Reef and what would happen if something went wrong and there was an oil spill or a blowout. I pointed out that as bad as it was, it was not necessarily as devastating as one would first think. It is quite noticeable that since then I have been joined by some very good company. As recently as about a week ago I noticed that famed television naturalist, Harry Butler, agreed with my general assumption. The point that I made in that speech was that generally a vastly different amount of oil comes from a spill than from a wrecked ship. I said:</PARA>
<PARA> The supertanker Amoco Cadiz, which went down off the cost of Brittany, released 220,000 tonnes of oil. The Torrey Canyon, which went down of the coast of England, released 100,000 tonnes of oil. The blowout on the Ekofisk Bravo Oil platform in the North Sea which continued for some days released only 22,500 tons of oil. The Santa Barbara blowout released only 10,000 to 20,000 tons of oil. </PARA>
<PARA> To that point in time that was a good argument, but I must confess, being rather objective, that the Ixtoc oil well leakage in the Gulf of Mexico even though it was a one-off situation has shot those statistics a little to blazes because that well unfortunately was unable to be capped. It went for about nine months and I believe in total it released approximately 410,000 tonnes of oil. We could probably look at that as a one-off situation and still come back to the fact that I concluded with in that speech. I stated:</PARA>
<PARA>Even if we do not drill the reef for another thousand years the very thing that we fear could happen tomorrow, the next day or the day after because of all the shipping movements up and down the coast. We have a far greater problem on our plate because of ship movements around the world than we are ever likely to have from any oil drilling. </PARA>
<PARA>On 9 October 1980 the New Scientist which looked at the results of the Ixtoc well a few months later stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Ixtoc oil well in the Gulf of Mexico began leaking in the summer of 1979</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the northern summer--</PARA>
<PARA>and wasn't capped successfully until the spring of this year. During that time, about 150 million gallons of crude oil-</PARA>
<PARA>Or 410,000 tonnes-</PARA>
<PARA>spilled into the Gulf, leaving many of the beaches along the south coast of Texas awash with goo. Scientists now say that, despite the massiveness of the spill, little permanent environmental damage was done. </PARA>
<PARA> Both the commercial fishing industry and the many recreational sites are coming back to normal already, according to Edward B. Overton of the Centre for Bio-Organic Studies at the University of New Orleans. The main cleansing agent has been the environment itself, particularly the co-operative weather patterns that helped to disperse the oil and render it more vulnerable to natural degradative forces. According to most preliminary findings, the Gulf is proving itself remarkably resilient, as Overton and the other participants at an assessment symposium agreed. </PARA>
<PARA>We dislike intensely any possibility of any oil spills along our coast. We know the immediate aesthetic problems that result from oil spills on the beaches and the devastation caused among bird life, but all is not as bad as it could first be construed. The environment does have a natural cleansing effect. </PARA>

<PARA> As Senator Gietzelt mentioned in relation to the Barrier Reef, the amendments cover two important aspects. The first gives improved protection for the Great Barrier Reef by prohibiting operational discharge of oil within or near the outer reef by measuring nearest land from the outer edge of the Reef. In other words, there can now be no operational discharge by any tanker or ship cleaning bilges within the area of the reef. I believe this must take place outside 50 miles of the outer edge of the reef which will give us more protection than we currently have. Probably people who are unscrupulous enough to do it will do it in the hope that they can get away with it. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that the major maritime nations, other than the United States of America, are amongst the 40 parties to this Convention. I understand that the United States prefers a global scheme that deals with oil spills from any source, for example, off-shore oil spills. That concerns me a little. I understand that insurance is carried, but I hope that the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Carrick) will give me more detail on the United States as it sees its responsibility regarding oil spills on the coast. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It may not be anti-American, it may be that America wants to see a better regime in force, but in the meantime I hope that we have adequate protection. This legislation also gives the Minister power-I take up the point that Senator Mulvihill discussed with me-to take action where pollution or a threat of pollution exists. The Bill empowers the Minister to take any appropriate action on the high seas or in territorial waters in regard to Australian or foreign ships. I think the incident which stands out most in our minds is the Amoco Cadiz which I have mentioned-when it lost steerageway off the coast of Brittany. As I understand it a haggle was going on between salvage tugs and the marshal of the vessel. They could not reach agreement and in the meantime the ship went aground. This resulted in a massive oil spill which, I think everybody agreed, was basically unnecessary. If a similar incident happened off an Australian port-I believe a similar situation happened off Newcastle-the Minister is empowered to do something about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would also like to think regulations are now such that there is a back-up or an emergency system whereby a ship can be steered. Another thing that concerns me is that it appears that with very large, modern tankers in certain conditions, such as tidal rips in the English Channel, the anchors are not capable of holding the ships. That situation probably goes beyond the provisions in this legislation, but if the Minister has any information on that matter I would be pleased to hear it. I certainly want to hear about the situation regarding the United States and whether shipping that plies within Australian waters is now bound to have any emergency steering system available. I support the Bills. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I state my views on this legislation I will clarify a couple of matters that emerged in the dialogue that ensued between Senator Collard and me.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GM7">Senator MULVIHILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We all have our place in the sun. I want to clarify the reference I made to the United States. I did not want it to be construed that I was critical of the United States. On the contrary, when the Davidson committee was in full flight, we were indebted to the Senator from Maine, Senator Ed Muskie, who later held a very high office in the Carter Administration. He is a man well known to Senator Wheeldon. He always emphasised in correspondence I received from him, maximum damages. They are referred to in this legislation. He visualised a situation, which I will come to later, about the indemnification for jumbo tankers not being as full as we imply it is in this legislation. At the time of the Oceanic Grandeur disaster a very efficient Minister for Transport, the Honourable Charles Jones, made amendments to the Navigation Act. Of course there was provision for a government to claim damages but there was little to assist owners of small craft.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must say in fairness to Senator Carrick that those of us who attended a briefing on the matter were given to understand that the Navigation Act and TOVALOP, the Tanker Owners Voluntary Agreement concerning liability for oil pollution-a private oil company indemnification scheme-have been consolidated to give a far more effective cover. </PARA>
<PARA> Like my colleague, Senator Gietzelt, I still remain unconvinced that sufficient provision has been made to cover oil slicks left by unknown vessels. It may be argued that Australian taxpayers are not ready to pay for an effective coast guard service such as the United States and Canada have. It may be argued that better aerial surveillance is the answer but I notice from the statistics that Senator Gietzelt referred to-they have been available to me for a couple of years-that there is a grey area, or a puzzling area. On occasions we suspect who is responsible for certain oil slicks but we cannot sheet home a prosecution. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Gietzelt also mentioned, even small spillages have a cumulative effect on marine life. This is a great problem we are confronted with at the moment. I know that recently there appeared in the National Times a series of articles which indicated what was going on all round the world. Probably every couple of months in New South Wales what is called a minor spillage occurs in Botany Bay. Of course, the effect such a spillage has on marine life is enormous. </PARA>
<PARA> These are things that I hope the Minister will take on board. Coming from the premier State he will recall the master of a Liberian tanker who had a verbal fracas with the Maritime Services Board. I am not questioning whether the ship's master had all the necessary qualifications to pilot his own vessel, but after the incident he disappeared out of the port of Sydney. I hope that a permanent black ban has been placed on him so that if he should arrive at Fremantle or come in to a northern port we would insist that he take his ship away. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to put what may be a hypothetical case to the Minister's advisers. Senator Collard, quite rightly, was concerned about pollution of the Great Barrier Reef. The Bills refer to documentation. As I read the legislation, the master of a vessel entering the port of Fremantle would have to produce documents at Gauge Roads so that we could see whether they met our standards. I often wonder what would happen if a jumbo tanker-I use that term in a broad sense-on a maiden voyage had a mishap in the Torres Strait. In my dialogue with Senator Collard I referred to the Oceanic Grandeur. I do not know whether one would call it nature or divine providence, but the currents took all the oil slick from that tanker to Papua New Guinea, not to Australia, as the Minister would know. </PARA>
<PARA> I have several questions that I did not get answers for in my briefing. I think there was a broad out of court settlement in relation to the Oceanic Grandeur but had the case gone to court it would have been determined in Hong Kong. I am certainly not so ultra-nationalistic as to suggest that such cases should not be heard in foreign courts but I would like to know what would happen in the event of any subsequent oil disasters in the Torres Strait or off the coast at Fremantle. Even if a spillage occurs outside our 200-mile limit, I wonder whether the offending oil company, with its multinational legal eagles behind it, would be prepared to defend itself in an Australian court or whether it would want to take the case to a court in Colombo, Hong Kong, in which case we would have to put up counsel and fight the case on neutral ground. I think it is very important that, despite all the verbiage in this Bill, we are sure of these things. </PARA>
<PARA> I interjected during Senator Collard's speech because of what happened following the Torrey Canyon disaster in the English Channel. The United Kingdom Government and the French Government used different methods of coping with the situation. We can get into difficulties of terminology when we talk of dispersants and detergents. I know there are now even more modern treatments. It depends on which popular science journal one reads whether one can believe that the marine life on the French and British sides of the English Channel has been rehabilitated. I know that my colleague, Senator Georges, has always been a very strong guardian of the Great Barrier Reef. It is inevitable that there will be human failures. It is no use running away with the idea that that is not the case. I know that Senator Collard in response to an interjection claimed that the Queensland marine authority was very critical of the Federal Department of Transport and its officers. There was some difference of opinion. In fairness to Senator Carrick's advisers, I acknowledge that during a briefing we were told that a united front is to be adopted to ensure that we use the best possible dispersants or detergents. I say that with some feeling, because during the Davidson committee proceedings it was made apparent that some States, to be blunt, were conned by various overseas oil companies as to which company could offer the best treatment. When my party's environment committee was briefed by the Minister's officers we were told that we had a very tight ship now. That statement was reinforced by what Senator Collard said, namely, that every State of the Commonwealth takes a hard line before it adopts a new technique. I would like some confirmation of that. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Gladwyn Hill, national environment correspondent for the New York Times, summed up the crux of my reservations when he wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> A major reason tankers have been coming to grief at a world wide rate of one or two a month is cheap-john practices of some oil and transport companies. Adequate antispill features are skimmed in vessel construction; tankers are handed down like used cars to less and less scrupulous operators until they are ready to fall apart, and manning and navigation are sometimes shockingly bad. On top of this, many vessels have made a practice of flushing their tanks at sea, releasing tons of waste oil at a time. </PARA>
<PARA>There is a very fine work of fiction entitled Rotterdam Delivery, which is about hijackers taking over a tanker. The fact is that the less time a ship is in port the more exhausted a crew becomes. Smaller crews, of, say, four top master mariners and others who do not quite have the necessary skills, are more accident prone. When I say that I am fortified by the Merchant Service Guild of Australia. I have tabled correspondence from the Guild at Estimates committees. I know that when the Estimates for the Department of Transport were under consideration the Department argued that it was aware of these things but that it had the situation well in hand. </PARA>
<PARA> This brings me back to my original interjection about United States reservations during Senator Collard's speech. I certainly do not underwrite every United States Government utterance but I know that if this country were to insist that any oil tanker that was over five years old, such as those old Liberian and Panamanian flag ships referred to in the article from which I have quoted, should be banned from Australian coastal waters, there would be less chance of a maritime mishap. What happens at times-I have had correspondence with Ministers about this-is that we take the attitude that there is a very tight market for fuel and that if we get tough with some of these oil companies we will not get any oil at all. It is a debatable point. An oil company failing to observe efficient seamanship and old tankers may say: 'The ships are not allowed to operate in the United States on either coast; send them out to the antipodes'. It would not be the first time that Australia has been sold short. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to feel that we will get very tough with every oil company. Anyone can study the record of the international trade union movement in relation to Panamanian ships and Liberian ships. Under the International Labour Organisation convention, the masters of those ships are the mavericks. The crews are overworked and inefficient and incompetent people are employed. Some of the people on the bridge are working excessive hours, which can cause all sorts of problems. I say that because some honourable senators would well remember that last year a scenario was published in the Australian of what could go wrong and cause a navigation mishap in Bass Strait. I believe that as a result of that script procedures were tightened up. We know that owing to human frailties mishaps can occur. I argue that if we purge ourselves of the old tankers-say, the ones built more than five years ago-we would have lesss chance of these mishaps occurring. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the matter of penalty provisions. I do not know how far they should be enforced. I know the words 'ministerial discretion' always appear. I will not enumerate the various oil companies and all their charters. People can go to a Minister and ask for clemency. We know what can happen in that situation. I suppose that sort of situation is not covered in this legislation. I know of several aras on our coast which could be involved. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) went to Japan over three years ago to negotiate the migratory bird treaty. I do not think it had to be ratified by all the States. I have not asked lately how many States have not fulfilled their commitments. I say to anyone who gives lip-service to wildlife and bird conservation that we know what has happened in the North Sea and the English Channel. Senator Collard mentioned all the carnage of bird life that occurred off the coast of the United States of America and in the Gulf of Mexico. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention one other point, namely, costs which the polluter must pay. I do not see that there should be any fears about levies and how far we really screw these people. I do not say that in an impolite way. I think people know what I am getting at. We do not want to have any inhibitions about the imposition of levies. The legislation deals with the matter of tanker mishaps. While we have off-shore drilling in Bass Strait, we will probably have other development projects carried out by Esso-BP off the Australian coast. Senator Carrick, who is the Minister in charge of these Bills would be delighted if that were to occur, and I suppose in some ways Australia would be delighted. </PARA>
<PARA> I have with me a document from the Louisiana Wildlife and Fisheries Commission. I remind the Minister that the Commission puts on the oil company which has a lease a levy in relation to wildlife and conservation. I will not go into the details about what will happen in relation to this legislation because the President might call me to order. We have our own views about what a State government should do in relation to an area within a certain distance of the shore and what the Federal Government should do. I would like to believe that if we were to conduct off-shore drilling of the sort carried out in Bass Strait we would emulate the Louisiana wildlife people and impose a special levy for wildlife conservation. The Commission has established a fund. With the money it receives from companies operating in off-shore areas it is able to buy other land. The system probably operates something like the system covering our own conservation grants. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we all welcome this legislation. I received a letter in October 1979 when the then Minister for Transport, Mr Nixon, promised this legislation. I know we were caught up with all the nations in discussions on conventions of the sea and that sort of thing. I conclude by saying that I hope the Minister in reply will clarify some of the fears I have about jumbo tankers. Also I ask: If a mishap occurs in Torres Strait involving a foreign registered vessel or a chartered vessel, can we test the case and claim our damages in Australian courts or do we have to take our chances in a court in Hong Kong where justice might not be the same?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-The Senate is debating a package of Bills which could be described briefly as protection of the sea legislation. It is a pleasant circumstance that all honourable senators are in agreement with the legislation. Therefore, I direct my remarks to the journey and to some of the questions raised. I acknowledge that all honourable senators have a virogous interest in the protection of the sea, protection of flora and fauna and, in particular, in this energy age, protection against oil spills. Speaking as a responsible Minister I say that I have the keenest interest in ensuring that any kind of exploration in this country is under most strict environmental protection. I invite Senator Mulvihill to come to some of the best fishing grounds in Australia, that is, around the oil platforms in Bass Strait.</PARA></TALK.START>

I say that by way of aside.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Gietzelt rightly mentioned that there was a House of Representatives oil spills report. Indeed, it was a very good report. Many of its recommendations have been implemented. This package of legislation is evidence of that and other recommendations are still being processed. I shall deal with a number of other matters. The matter was raised, I think by Senator Collard, of the American attitude to civil liability. I am advised that the United States of America does not consider the limits of civil liability sufficiently high and, therefore, it has imposed a levy on all oil. This is aimed at providing a fund of $200m to deal with oil from any source. The United States takes that view. The Australian attitude is that we should not take unilateral action but seek to work within the international forum. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of matters have been raised. I will refer to liaison with the States. There is, of course, close liaison with the States. This liaison has been developed through a national plan. The latest development is a working group involving the Commonwealth. The States and the Northern Territory. This group will provide proposals for the purchase of oil combat equipment for training and funding. Equipment and training will be available throughout Australia for use by the Commonwealth, the States and the Northern Territory. Indeed, one of the first functions of the Australian Maritime College in Launceston was to consider tanker handling to avoid spillages and to obviate risks in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Mulvihill's interest in the age, quality and nature of tankers is well acknowledged by me. Indeed, I have responded to him before. I share his views. But I must say that the age of a vessel is not necessarily a mark of whether it is good or bad. What is important is how well a vessel has been maintained, how well it has been managed and the training of the crew. There are rigid inspection rules in Australia. We would be second to none in wanting to prevent any substandard vessels from coming to Australia. Of course, there will always be dangers in a very real world. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Mulvihill asked me what might happen if an incident were to occur off Australia. I think he mentioned Torres Strait in particular. I am advised that in the case of a vessel creating an incident off Australia, if the flag state of the vessel is party to the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage, action can be taken in the country which is a signatory to that Convention. If the vessel is party to this Convention Australia can take an action within--</PARA>

I am advised that if the flag state of the vessel is not a party, action in Australia would be ineffective if there were no assets in Australia of that shipping line. However, it would be possible to pursue a cause in the flag state, although life might be a little more difficult. In general terms, let me say that wherever it is possible, whether in our very latest attempts to make the platforms in Bass Strait more secure against not only their own spills but also disasters from shipping or otherwise, or in the protection of the Barrier Reef, this Government aims to set the highest possible standards. As new technologies emerge, so we will adapt to them. I acknowledge the work that has been done over the years by committees of both Houses of this Parliament. I commend the legislation to the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>

I understand his point about an oil tanker from a country that is a signatory to this Convention and how we can go to arbitration on the matter of damages. However, as I understand it, the Minister then said that if a country is not a signatory it is obviously a lot more difficult. Accepting the Minister's argument that, contrary to what I had implied, if old tankers are maintained they are not a hazard, what is the Government's attitude to the possibility of saying that the only oil tankers it will accept are those whose countries of origin are signatories to this Convention, where it can get a quicker legal adjustment? What would happen if we banned countries which are not signatories? In view of the fact that the Minister said that 20 nations are a party to the Convention, not many countries will be left outside it. Do we have to live with that?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Cavanagh</PARA>
<PARA>1. Question (p. 761 Hansard)</PARA>
<PARA> My main concern is who decides the criteria for redundancy? I think the procedures for redeployment or compulsory retirement need explaining. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. Answer. The procedures for redeployment and compulsory retirement are provided for in the principal Act, in the regulations made under the Act which deal with the processing of appeals, in the administrative procedures which the Board will notify, and in Determination 509 of 1977. (Appeals are referred to in detail later in response to Senators Button and Harradine). </PARA>
<PARA> 3. Broadly stated the CE (RR) Act</PARA>
<PARA> is about the economic and efficient use of staff in Commonwealth employment</PARA>
<PARA> provides arrangements for voluntary retirement from age 55 and for the declaration, redeployment and compulsory retirement of staff who can no longer be used by departments because they are surplus, medically unfit, inefficient or incompetent. </PARA>
<PARA> requires the Public Service Board to notify administrative procedures for each of those arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> requires Permanent Heads to declare staff for redeployment followed by the Public Service Board either redeploying or certifying that redeployment is not practicable. If redeployment is not practicable, the Permanent Head retires the officer. </PARA>
<PARA> creates an independent Commonwealth Employees Redeployment and Retirement Appeals Tribunal to hear appeals against actions made under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. Determination 509 of 1977 provides additional arrangements for handling surplus staff situations only. It provides for consultations with unions (the range of these consultations being specified in the administrative procedures). It provides for maximum efforts towards redeployment with notice to permanent officers of 6 or 12 months (depending on age and length of service) income maintenance of 6 or 12 months for temporary employees transferred to a lower level or terminated, and a further one month's notice on full pay before a permanent officer can be transferred to a lower level or terminated. </PARA>
<PARA>5. I would mention particularly the administrative procedure made by the Board as these are binding on Permanent Heads. The procedures in relation to redundancy situations, medical situations and situations where staff are inefficient or incompetent have been drafted and circulated to Peak union Councils. They will be discussed with them shortly. </PARA>
<PARA>6. In relation to redundancy situations, the procedures specify that a redundancy situation can occur because</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the functions of the department are altered as a result of changes to the Administrative Arrangements order</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) a function or activity of a department, as changed or altered or the priority accorded to the function or activity changes</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) a review of the Department indicates that there may be more staff than is necessary for efficient operation</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) the workload of, or staffing provision of the department changes significantly</PARA>
<PARA> (v) staff decline to transfer with their function to another locality or</PARA>
<PARA> (vi) an unattached officer on return to duty cannot be permanently placed within a reasonable time. </PARA>
<PARA>7. The administrative procedures require the Board to give the relevant staff organisations advice and information about the redundancy situation and to arrange discussions. Such discussions would cover the Boards views about the change in the Department which has resulted in an actual or potential excess staff situation, and the criteria which will be used in identifying which staff should be declared eligible for redeployment-Usually the criteria used is relative efficiency. The discussions with staff organisations can also cover measures to avoid the need for declaration, including</PARA>
<PARA> retention or modification of existing systems of work in department</PARA>
<PARA> suspension of the filling of vacant positions</PARA>
<PARA> restrictions on overtime</PARA>
<PARA> reviewing the extent of outside contracting, and</PARA>
<PARA> use of natural wastage. </PARA>
<PARA>8. In short, staff organisations are advised of all actual or potential redundancy situations and there is the opportunity for meaningful consultations between the Board, the Department and the staff organisation about the effect of the redundancy situation and about the criteria which will be applied to identify the staff members who are surplus. </PARA>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>9. Question-The amending Bill effectively removes the Arbitrator's ability to settle disputes arising in the redeployment and retirement area. In the absence of the Arbitrator, what redress does an employee have, especially at the point of termination, against action taken against him?</PARA>
<PARA>10. Answer-The CERR Act establishes under s.16 an independent 3-man Commonwealth Employees Redeployment and Retirement Appeals Tribunal comprising a Chairman appointed by the Governor General, a person nominated to represent the employing Department, and a person nominated to represent the employees. </PARA>
<PARA>11. S.15 of the act provides that an employee may appeal to the Tribunal against:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) a declaration that he is eligible for redeployment that is his services can no longer be reasonably used at his current level;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) any redeployment action taken in respect of the employee;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) a certificate by the PSB (a) that it has not been practical to redeploy the employee, or (b) that by virtue of the employees physical or mental incapacity he should be retired; and</PARA>
<PARA> the Tribunal hears and determines the appeal. </PARA>
<PARA> (i) In the case of a redeployment declaration the Tribunal may confirm or revoke the declaration, or revoke the declaration and declare another employee</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) In the case of redeployment action, the Tribunal may confirm the redeployment action, or set aside the action and remit the matter to the Board. Where the Tribunal sets aside redeployment action, the Act requires that the Board restore the pre-existing situation of the employee. Any subsequent redeployment action by the Board is subject to appeal. </PARA>
<PARA> (iii) In the case of a certificate, the Tribunal may confirm or revoke the certificate. </PARA>
<PARA> 12. Very considerable redress is therefore available to the employee, unless and until-</PARA>
<PARA> (i) a certificate referred to in 3 (ii) above has been issued; and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) any appeal against the certificate has been heard and the issue of the certificate has been confirmed. </PARA>
<PARA> It is impossible therefore for an employee to be retired against his wishes without him having the opportunity to have his case heard by the independent tribunal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The only conceptual difficulty I have with the answer is that if one looks at paragraph No. 6 in relation to Senator Cavanagh's question, the procedures of the Act relating to a redundancy situation, as it is called, are set out. It is stated that a redundancy situation can occur because, by way of example, the functions of the department are altered as a result of changes to the Administrative Arrangements order. If one reads the rest of the answers one notes that it is quite clear that a department could, theoretically, be cut in half or abolished altogether. I think it is in that connection that I find conceptual difficulty with answer No. 10. The procedure of appeal really seems to relate to a sort of one-off or two-off situation. That is the area in which I have difficulty. Let us assume a situation in which half a department is wiped out-something which is possible. Do members of the staff involved go to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and, under the appeal provisions, say: 'I am appealing. I should not have been made redundant. He over there should have been.'? That shows the difficulty I see about the appeal procedure. It is a matter the Government might look at if the razor gang were contemplating anything too drastic.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> 13. Question 1 (Hansard, page 761)</PARA>
<PARA> 'Does the combination of this Bill and Determination No. 509 provide to a public servant who is to be compulsorily retired on the decision of the Public Service Board redress ultimately to any authority other than the Public Service Board?'</PARA>
<PARA> 14. Answer-Yes:-there is redress to the independent tribunal as in paragraphs* above in response to Senator Button. </PARA>
<PARA> 15. Questions (Hansard, page 761)</PARA>
<PARA> 'Section 16 of Determination No. 509 provides a right of appeal procedure. It sets up a committee which is the right of appeal committee. Sub-section (3) of section 16 states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee shall report its findings to the Public Service Board with a recommendation for action appropriate to the case. </PARA>
<PARA> They are recommendations. Under what obligation is the Public Service Board to accept these recommendations?'</PARA>
<PARA> 16. Answer-Clause 16 of the Determination relates only to an appeal against an administrative decision taken in relation to an employee's eligibility for benefits under the determination, or to the amount of such benefits. That is the only right of appeal established by the Determination and, not-withstanding the CERR Act, remains unaltered. The Determination does not oblige the Board to accept the Committee's recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA> 17. By contrast, the CE(RR) Act has established the very comprehensive avenues of appeal described earlier. The Act has added very considerably to an employees right of independent redress. </PARA>
<PARA> 18. At page 751 of Hansard Senator Harradine states that 'nobody else but the PSB has any effective final say over whether or not redeployment is feasible'. In reaching this conclusion, he is considering only Determination 509 of 1977 and is disregarding the appeal provisions of the CERR Act itself. Under the CERR Act the actions of the PSB to redeploy and retire are subject to appeal. </PARA>
<PARA> The PSB is not the final arbitrator. </PARA>
<PARA> 19. There is only one area within the appeal mechanism in which the Tribunal itself is not the final arbitrator irrespective of the views of the Board. That is where action is taken to redeploy an employee, such as moving him to another Department at a lower salary. The employee may appeal to the Tribunal which must if it disagrees with the action, 'remit the matter to the Public Service Board to take such other action by way of redeployment of the employee as the Board thinks fit'. The reason for remitting to the Board is that it is the Board, not the Tribunal that has the expertise and knowledge necessary to identify suitable alternative jobs for the employee. It should not be thought however, that the Board on having the matter remitted to it is then free to act in disregard of the Tribunal's decision. Any subsequent action taken by the Board by way of redeployment will itself be subject to appeal to the Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> 20. No redeployment action taken by the Board is capable of implementation unless consented to by the employee or the Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> 21. At page 761 of Hansard, Senator Harradine raised questions in relation to the Government'a attitude to preference for unionists in employment. He sought to imply that the Government's attitude was inconsistent. He contrasts the disallowance of Determination No. 503 of 1980 with the non disallowance of a determination applying similar terms to the Health Insurance Commission and its action to introduce legislative provisions which, in his words 'virtually means that a person working on the waterfront must be a member of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia to be entitled to the provisions of that legislation.'</PARA>
<PARA> 22. Senator Harradine omits to mention the other relevant part of the comparison. </PARA>
<PARA> 23. The waterfront is in very large measure an area of private enterprise where union preference is a fact of life and in the circumstances it is not sensible to legislate without recognition of this. </PARA>
<PARA> 24. Similarly the Health Insurance Commission has also been placed in a sitution where it has to function and compete in the market place. It is part of this process that it accept all that goes with it including what might well be disadvantages. </PARA>
<PARA> 25. The Government however does not accept that union preference is a matter which should be applicable to the Public Service. In another place the responsible Minister stated that:</PARA>
<PARA> '(Union) preference is completely contrary to the objects of the Act and to the principle of merit, a principle which is the cornerstone of the personnel management system of the Service. Preference to union members is quite unacceptable to the Government. Non union members who find themselves surplus to the requirements of the Service would, under the Determination, have lesser rights than union members. Where is the equity and protection of the non union member in this? The Government if it were to accept Determination 503 of 1980 would, in effect, be abandoning those who have exercised their freedom of choice not to belong to a union. This the Government will not countenance. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the inequity of preference the operation of preference under the Determination would mean that the union member could be retained in employment in preference to a more efficient non union member. That is surely the very antithesis of the efficient management of the Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is not alone in believing that union preference is incompatible with the merit principle. Our view is shared by Mr Deputy President McKenzie, a member of the Full Bench which considered the unions' applications. In a dissenting opinion on the question of union preference he said 'Notwithstanding the practical impact of granting the claim is likely to be marginal, the use of union membership to choose between employees even in that context is quite inconsistent with the present concepts of the Australian Public Service. I therefore reject the claim'. This Government also rejects the concept of union preference. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is not prepared to see the Public Service become a closed shop.'</PARA>

I will come to the other matters shortly. The Government has made a very weak attempt to deal with the matter I raised on page 761 of Hansard. In order for the Senate to understand what I am talking about I will read out the answer that the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Carrick) has provided. The answer reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At page 761 of Hansard, Senator Harradine raised questions in relation to the Government's attitude to preference for unionists in employment. He sought to imply that the Government's attitude was inconsistent. He contrasts the disallowance of Determination No. 503 of 1980 with the non-disallowance of a determination applying similar terms to the Health Insurance Commission and its action to introduce legislative provisions which, in his words 'virtually means that a person working on the waterfront must be a member of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia to be entitled to the provisions of that legislation.'</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Carrick then continued:</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Harradine omits to mention the other relevant part of the comparison. </PARA>
<PARA>I am not quite sure what the phrase 'the other relevant part of the comparison' means. I assume it relates to the next part of the answer which reads:</PARA>
<PARA>The waterfront is in very large measure an area of private enterprise where union preference is a fact of life and in the circumstances it is not sensible to legislate without recognition of this. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister was right when he said that this is a fact of life. The original legislation concerning the Australian Stevedoring industry authority came in in about 1967. Senator Elstob will correct me if I am wrong. I think that section 29 of the Act contained a provision which required that, before a person was registered by the Authority as a waterside worker, the person would have had to have applied to be or be a member of the Waterside Workers Federation. The legislation to which I refer is the stevedoring industry legislation of 1977 which incorporated, in effect, and extended the provision, as I understand it. Every Government member voted for it. Do not let us have any misunderstandings about that. Every Government member is supporting not only preference for unionists but also compulsory unionism. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Button is right. He reminds me that Senator Wright did have something to say about the legislation. The Minister's answer continued:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Similarly the Health Insurance Commission has also been placed in a situation where it has to function and compete in the market place. It is part of this process that it accepts all that goes with it including what might well be disadvantages. </PARA>
<PARA>I have quoted the Minister's reply verbatim. The Health Insurance Commission did not place itself in a disadvantaged position. The decisions made by the Government affected the Health Insurance Commission. Commissioner Watson in his decision made a very valid point when he awarded preference on that occasion. There would be absolutely no difference between the position of, for example, the staff of the Health Insurance Commission for whom Determination No. 769 was established by Commissioner Watson and that of the employees or officers of the Australian Development Assistance Bureau if anything happens to those people as a result of Government decision. The point I am making is that no Government member objected when Determination No. 769 of 1978 came into the Senate and was laid on the table. No Government member objected to the provisions for preference of unionists contained in that legislation. Yet Mr Viner, the Minister involved, made this a matter of great importance in the House of Representatives when he was dealing with this subject. </PARA>
<PARA> The response of the Minister for National Development and Energy includes part of the second reading speech of the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr Viner). I will not quote it. The Minister said that union preference is com- pletely contrary to the objects of the Act and to the principles of merit and so on. Of course, that is different from what Commissioner Watson said when bringing down Determination No. 769 of 1978 under the Public Service Arbitration Act. Commissioner Watson, Acting Public Service Arbitrator, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> It is reasonable to assume that since determinations of the Arbitrator can only apply to members of an organisation, the Public Service Arbitration Act is structured on an assumption of strong union membership. It is true that the Board can by regulation confer determination benefits on non-members, but in my view this is an administrative action which, when taken in respect of a determination, must be as a consequence of and therefore follow that determination. </PARA>
<PARA>These are arguing points. I do not want to make anything further of them. I do not think the Government can claim again what it has claimed in this statement. It is claptrap for it to claim that Determination No. 503 in some way goes further than Determination No. 769 in respect of union membership on the grounds that preference could be given to a union member irrespective of the relative efficiency of that union member, because the preference clause in Determination No. 503 specifically refers to Part II of the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act and indicates that the preference clause should be read in conjunction with that Part which deals with the necessity to ensure the efficient and economic use of the services of the employees. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us get back to the other matters which I think I can cover in the next five minutes; and I thank the Committee for bearing with me thus far. The problem I had previously in the Committee stage concerned this whole question of appeals. The way in which the appeal provisions are structured in the principal Act virtually requires the individual, for whom a declaration has been made that he is eligible for redeployment, to dob in his work. mates in order to appeal against the declaration. In order to make a satisfactory ground for appeal he has to say why he ought not be redeployed. Of course, in so doing he has to say: 'It is not I who has to be redeployed. It is Fred Nerk who has to be redeployed. I am more efficient than he. He is less efficient than I'. Alternatively, if the Public Service Board issues a certificate that it is not practical to redeploy that employee, that again encourages this business of one employee's saying: 'Why should I have to get the axe and not the other employee?' There may be some reasonable answer to that, but, that aside, I still maintain that ultimate redress means not only whether a certificate is proper or whether a person is to be redeployed but also what redress, including payment of wages and other benefits, should accrue to that person. Of course, under the Act and the regulations there are provisions in respect to that matter. They do not go to the main issue that I was concerned about; that is, technological change. </PARA>
<PARA> I appreciate that any large organisation has some problem employees. I would not like to see the Board, in order to overcome these problems, getting itself into a situation in which it cannot deal with major problems such as automation and technological change without having to go through the hoops of the CE(RR) legislation. I understand the Government's answer with regard to automation and technological change and I have with me the Public Service Board's circular. I would like to be reassured, in any situation of automation, technological change or redeployment arising out of discussions between the organisations and the Public Service Board, that, firstly, there is a right of appeal by groups of people to the appeals tribunal; secondly, that the organisation which represents those employees as a group can appear before the tribunal; and, thirdly, that the tribunal or some other organisation independent of the Board can ultimately determine the conditions which the persons to be redeployed or retired will receive. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -As no other honourable senator has risen, I shall continue my remarks. My final point is this: I know of a case of a person in the Public Service who has had a heart attack. One of the problems that this person perceives in the legislation is that persons who are eligible for invalidity retirement benefits tend to be lumped in with what she calls malingerers. There is a suggestion that some departments are already considering manipulation of this situation. For example, a person who is employed in a government department and who has been away for six months on, say, sick leave can be placed on the unattached list and that position can then be filled. When that person comes back from sick leave, he or she can be declared to be in excess of staff requirements because the position has been filled.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I read with considerable interest the report in Hansard of Senator Harradine's original speech. I know his experience in trade union matters and, therefore, I respect his experience. I also had been at pains to make sure that he was given full answers. In some regards it is a matter of the approach. For example, whether or not we have been technically accurate with a waterside worker's comment, the fact of the matter is that fundamentally the Government believes that in the Public Service the preference to unionist provisions should not apply as they do in other areas. I do not think that Senator Harradine wishes me to pursue that matter. I simply acknowledge his comments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As others here do-I do not single Senator Harradine out-I acknowledge that there is some background of experience and expertise in the trade union movement. I will arrange for both the Public Service Board and the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr Viner) to study the Hansard and if there are useful points and if indeed the Act does not work fully in the humane and reasonable way that we want it to, we can always resort to appropriate amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Harradine mentioned malingering. I am assured that the provisions as to the medical identification of invalidity are designed to identify true invalidity and nothing in the Act will create hardship. Again, if any such thing at all should happen and evidence can be brought to my attention in the execution of this legislation I shall certainly be happy to take it either through the normal process to the Public Service Board or elsewhere. What I am saying is that I invite the Senate to accept the bona fides of that and we will iron out any lumps or bumps as we go. </PARA>
<PARA> Groups and individuals may appeal and the Board can decide in the end whether it is simpler to hear it by group or by individual and that I think will work itself out in the procedural wal. But I give another reassurance; I have had recourse to go through the Hansards.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that the Government has created history by its attitude towards industrial relations, a history of which nobody could be very proud. I doubt whether another government in the world at any time has offered employers payroll tax concessions to resist the workers' struggle to better their own working conditions. It is almost like paying mercenaries to fight your battle for you. On top of that, the Government intends to spend $2m on a publicity campaign against the 35-hour week. King Canute had to convince his counsellors that he could not hold back the tide. It appears to me that the Government is trying to convince its counsellors that it can hold the tide back. The Government's attitude towards the 35-hour week campaign is paranoic. I heard on the news tonight that this campaign, if successful would jeopardise a $400m ICI Australia Ltd project. A $400m project will be in jeopardy if ICI in any way concedes to the unions to negotiate for the 35-hour week. The workers were threatened with the withdrawal of tariff assistance. Referring to resources development, Senator Chaney stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . as resources development intensifies . . . economic growth is consolidated. </PARA>
<PARA>We all know the Government's attitude towards the so-called impending resources boom. The way in which it is handling it shows a complete disregard for the workers in Australia. It intends to bring tradesmen into the country. That is despite the 1976 census results. They show that more than 300,000 qualified male tradesmen work in non-tradesmen's jobs in Australia-and the Government intends to bring more tradesmen into the country. The report of the Williams Committee of Inquiry into Education and Training shows that in Western Australia 39.4 per cent of apprentices do not finish their apprenticeships. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely, in the hard, cold world of reality, we must recognise from these facts that people should not be guided by ultruism and nationalistic needs in the selection of a career but rather that they move into the direction of a job which offers them far greater returns, job satisfaction and security. I feel that the call to import skilled workers is an attempt to avoid the issue. It is a short term answer to a long term problem. I think the Government is handling the resources boom very badly indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government claims-I think it has underestimated the figure-that 36 per cent of all full time non-managerial employees are currently working less than a 40-hour week. It does not follow, however, that the economy can stand an across-the-board application of a 35-hour week or even a 37 1/2-hour week. There are 300 State and Federal awards providing for a 35-hour week already in existence in this country, and yet the Government does not say that the people who are working a 35-hour week should increase their hours of work to 40. The Government prefers to pick on the process workers and the people who have the soul-destroying jobs and to keep them at the grindstone for 40 hours a week rather than consider a 35-hour week, irrespective of productivity. Referring to the Altona case, the Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government intervened in this hearing and strongly argued against the settlement. It continues to oppose the productivity bargaining concept in its application to reduce working hours. </PARA>
<PARA>Irrespective of productivity, the Government will continue to object to the unions putting up such an argument. How in the name of heaven does the Government expect these workers to put their case? What does the Government expect them to base it on-what the Government thinks is correct or what they think is correct? The Government talks of productivity. The mining industry was responsible for 28 per cent of exports in the nine years ended 1975-76. The value of mineral exports rose during this period from $353m to $2,651m. The work force grew from 54,000 to 76,000, an increase of 40 per cent in a work force which produced an 800 per cent increase in export values. Does the Government expect the unions not to bring this matter into court because the Minister says not to? It is just not good enough for the Government to state that it refuses to accept the productivity argument. What other argument can the unions base their case on if they cannot base it on productivity? Productivity has been defined by the Australian Council of Trade Unions in a number of other cases as value added per employee adjusted for increased prices, which means that it has calculated the value added per employee at constant 1968-69 prices. In the glass industry, in the five years since 1973-74 productivity grew by 21.5 per cent while employment fell by 21.5 per cent, which represents a loss of 1,900 jobs. Cannot the unions bring these sorts of figures into the Court? Cannot they use these figures in their arguments? According to the Government they must not use these figures. During the 1970s productivity in the glass industry increased 70 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a similar situation in the electronics industry. In the five years since 1973-74 employment dropped by over 35 per cent, which represents 12,023 persons, while productivity increased by 35 per cent. Cannot the unions bring those statistics into the court? Cannot they use those statistics in their arguments and negotiations? For the manufacturing industry as a whole, productivity, based on the value added per employee at constant 1968-69 prices, grew by 15 per cent over the five years since 1973-74. Over the same period employment in the manufacturing industry fell by 194,553 or by 14.5 per cent. I think it is ludricrous for the Minister even to entertain let alone put in writing the idea that the Government will continue to oppose productivity bargaining as a concept in union applications for reduced working hours. On page 15 of the statement the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> If unions believe they have justifiable claims let them come forward and have them tested by arbitration . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has just killed the umpire. How can the Government expect anyone to have any confidence in the umpire? No matter what an umpire decides it is pretty obvious that this Government will either try to undermine the umpire or just go against his decision. Therefore, the whole concept of industrial relations has been worsened by the fact that the Government has already killed the umpire. Page 16 of the statement-I think this one is a real lulu-reads:</PARA>
<PARA>We are inviting the ACTU to sit down and talk and we will explain in detail the reasons for our opposition to reduced working hours, higher wage demands and the economic consequences of such actions. </PARA>
<PARA>I have never heard such a one-eyed, arrogant attitude in all of my life. The Government will bring in the unions and tell them why the Government has adopted this attitude. Quite frankly, 90 per cent of the members on the opposite side of the House would not be where they are but for the early struggles of the trade union movement for representation in the Parliament. The members of the trade union movement are the pioneers in this respect. </PARA>
<PARA> For the Government to carry on with its attitude of opposing a reduction in the 40-hour week is really wasting time because there is no way that the Government can stop the reduction. I can assure honourable senators that Australia is not alone in this fight. Internationally there is a move to reduce working hours which parallels the campaign that is currently taking place for a reduction in standard hours in Australia. France, Italy, Germany and other developed economies are experiencing trade union campaigns for a 35-hour week. In Japan workers in the manufacturing industry are already working fewer than 40 hours a week. The ACTU has made it quite clear it does not intend to bring in a 35-hour week in a few days or in a few months. It expects a fair share of increased productivity where industry can afford the 35-hour week, but the Government is determined that the 35-hour week will not come in at all because it is absolutely paranoid in its opposition to the trade union movement. It is intent on causing confrontation in the country instead of taking a more sensible attitude. It should at least allow the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to be free of the bias of the Government and allow the unions to have more confidence in the process of arbitration. But the Government has undermined the confidence of the unions in the arbitration of the campaign for a 35-hour week. This is pretty obvious according to what Mr Dolan has to say. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) The Aboriginal population in Darwin fluctuates in response to a number of factors. It is difficult therefore to state accurately the number of short term visitors, who, at any one time, are dispersed among a number of unofficial camping sites where some form of temporary shelter only is available. My Department estimates that at present there may be 120 such visitors in Darwin without permanent shelter and approximately 140 more permanent residents of recognised camp areas at Knuckeys Lagoon, Railway Dam and Kulaluk without permanent housing.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Commonwealth is making available to the Northern Territory Housing Commission in 1980-81, through the Department of Housing and Construction, $9m in advances and $5.5m in grants, including $1.1m in earmarked grants for Aboriginal housing. The Commission's 1980-81 program provides for construction expenditure on 934 houses including 701 in the Darwin area.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, my Department has allocated $7.925m in grants-in-aid to Aboriginal Housing Associations in the Northern Territory for 1980-81.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator Chaney</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are currently almost 400 working guide dogs throughout Australia. On this basis, the cost of providing an allowance of $10 a week would be just over $200,000 per year.</PARA>
<PARA> I have already indicated in response to the honourable senator's question 154 (Hansard 5 December 1980, page 498) that although blind persons do not receive a benefit specifically for the care of a guide dog, Invalid Pension (Blind) is free of income test and this assists in offsetting the costs of maintaining a guide dog.</PARA>
<PARA> It should also be noted that the dogs are trained and supplied without cost to their blind owners and that such a service costs in the vicinity of $5,000 per dog. My Department is directly responsible for funding 25-30 per cent of the current output of trained guide dogs through the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service, and in addition provides substantial financial assistance, by way of subsidy under the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act, to the principal guide dog training organisation in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industry has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (a) Agricultural research, including genetic development of salt tolerant crops, is undertaken by a diversity of research institutions throughout Australia. Principal organisations are the State Departments of Agriculture/Primary Industries, the CSIRO and the Universities. Precise and comprehensive information from these and other organisations is not available. In regard to the Commonwealth Department of Primary Industry, it is directly involved through the support to individual research projects by the statutory and non-statutory research funds it administers.</PARA>

<PARA>CSIRO</PARA>
<PARA>25,000</PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the CSIRO Division of Horticultural Research, as part of its program of crop improvement, is currently engaged in the development of techniques for the selection of more salt tolerant plant types. Crops under study include grapevines; a range of tropical and sub-tropical fruit and nut species such as the avocado; citrus; and the Australian natives, macadamia and quandong. Previous work by the Division with rootstocks has led to the release of salt tolerant rootstocks for sultanas.</PARA>
<PARA> I also understand that the CSIRO Division of Plant Industry is developing a salt tolerant lucerne cultivar for use in previously valuable country where increasing salinity has resulted from a rising water table. The same Division is also embarking on an examination of mechanisms which bestow salt tolerance on dryland crops.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) As in the case of plant breeding, irrigation research, both of a technical and economic nature, is undertaken by a similar diversity of organisations in Australia and precise and comprehensive information from all sources is not available.</PARA>
<PARA> The Bureau of Agricultural Economics has undertaken a detailed analysis of the economics of irrigation and in February 1980 published its report entitled 'Irrigation Issues for the Eighties: Focusing on Efficiency and Equity in the Management of Agricultural Water Supplies'. Main conclusions of the report are:</PARA>
<PARA> the most important issues concerning irrigation in Australia in the 1980's relate to management of established water supplies rather than to development of new supplies.</PARA>
<PARA> water quality issues and the formulation of more appropriate pricing and institutional systems will be of increasing importance.</PARA>
<PARA> current practices of pricing water below its economic value and restricting exchange between users, do not encourage efficient use of water.</PARA>
<PARA> development of more appropriate management systems will require improved information on the benefits and costs of alternative uses.</PARA>
<PARA> In conjunction with the New South Wales Department of Agriculture, the CSIRO Division of Plant Industry is developing a comprehensive on-farm computer-based management strategy system for cotton growing which focuses on the use of insecticides, fertilizer and water. The system, known as SIRATAC, has proven highly successful to date in trials on commercial cotton farms and CSIRO is investigating means of making it generally available throughout the industry.</PARA>

<PARA> (5) There is no award for domestics in the Northern Territory but Aboriginals employed by the community and by Northern Territory Departments are paid at award rates.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) My Department has no evidence that any part of pensions paid to Aboriginals on the station is retained by the station management. The Napperby store allows purchases on credit and recoups the amounts owing from pension cheques, subject to the payees' approval.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Yes, the station store is open six days a week.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) Any complaints of discrimination against Aboriginal residents of Napperby Station would be investigated by the appropriate authorities.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Foreign Minister has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) (i) The United States Administration has not as yet obtained legislative authorisation for its participation in the sixth replenishment of the International Development Association (IDA 6). Following reports last month that the new United States Administration was considering cuts in the IDA 6 pledge made by the previous United States Administration, Australia along with a number of other countries made formal representations in Washington urging the United States Administration to maintain its negotiated contributions. It was subsequently confirmed that the United States Administration will request Congressional authorization for the full amount previously pledged to IDA 6. As mentioned in the answer provided to question No. 3030, most other IDA donors agreed to participate in a bridging arrangement by making advance contributions to IDA. This bridging arrangement which became effective in October 1980 involves 17 countries and advance contributions totalling $US1.74 billion. Australia has made available an advance contribution of $67.8m.</PARA>
<PARA> (1) (ii) In December 1980 the United States Government paid to the Asian Development Bank the second instalment in the amount of $US111.25m of its contribution to the second replenishment of the Asian Development Fund. Payment of this instalment by the United States released the third tranches of other donors' contributions for loan commitment on 1 January 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (i) The bridging arrangements described above have allowed the lending activities of IDA to continue normally. However, IDA commitment authority is expected to run out early in April 1981 before United States Congress is expected to have taken action to allow IDA 6 to become effective. Accordingly, IDA donors will meet again at the end of March 1981 to consider action designed to allow IDA lending activities to continue unimpeded.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (ii) The second replenishment of the ADF is still on course and the Bank's concessional lending program continues to progress normally. Consequently, the question of bridging arrangements does not arise and donor countries have not reassessed their contributions.</PARA>

<PARA> The Prime Minister has supplied the following information for answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> As part of our election policy in 1975 we promised to assist the Tasmanian Government to establish a national park of world significance in south-western Tasmania which would include a substantial wilderness area. In accordance with this commitment the Commonwealth allocated $350,000 towards meeting the cost of a detailed resources survey of the south-west. The survey aims to identify to the Tasmanian Government those attributes of the area, including wilderness values, which might require reservation and management as a national park.</PARA>
<PARA> The Tasmanian Government has also been advised of the Commonwealth's undertaking to consider requests for assistance for specific proposals associated with the protection of the region as soon as the survey is completed.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government does believe, however, that land management and land use decisions are primarily the responsibility of State governments and decisions on the development of the south-west are therefore the responsibility of the Tasmanian Government.</PARA>
<PARA> The Tasmanian Premier and the Prime Minister have a clear understanding that decisions on power development in Tasmania are a matter for the Tasmanian Government.</PARA>
