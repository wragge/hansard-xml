<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the following petition from 570 citizens of Australia:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That the projected repeal by the Queensland State Government of the Aborigines Act 1971-1979 and the Torres Strait Islander Act 1971-1979 will almost certainly lead to the degazettal of all Aboriginal reserves in Queensland, as happened with Aurukun and Mornington Island.</PARA>
<PARA> That, if the Aboriginal communities from these reserves are placed under similar shire council legislation on fifty year leases, they will be exposed to serious encroachment on their land by mining and tourist interests.</PARA>
<PARA> That, on past evidence, these interests will clearly have the full backing of the Queensland Government and the rights of Aboriginal people to land rights and self-management will not be granted by that Government.</PARA>
<PARA> That the Commonwealth Government has the constitutional power to legislate and acquire land for Aboriginal people since the amendments to the Constitution in 1967, but it is your petitioners' sincere belief that it has already failed in its duty before the people of Aurukun and Mornington Island.</PARA>
<PARA> That the Aboriginal people of Queensland have stated that they want land rights and self-management.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, should make use of its constitutional and legislative powers to grant full land rights and self-management to the Aboriginal people of Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Bipartisan concern exists in the Australian community over involvement of Australian military forces in the Middle East where those forces are not under United Nations auspices;</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Concern is also evident about Australia's military capacity to provide those forces without weakening Australia's defence;</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Sinai is not an area within Australia's sphere of influence; and</PARA>
<PARA> 4. Australian agricultural export markets may be adversely affected by Australian military participation in Sinai.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Australian Parliament does not ratify Australian military participation in the proposed Sinai peacekeeping force, unless that force is fully controlled by the United Nations.</PARA>

<PARA> 3. Request that the Government ensure one department to administer all funds for the above under the heading of women's services;</PARA>
<PARA> 4. Propose that future funding should be on a guaranteed triennial basis taking into account inflation and indexation increases;</PARA>
<PARA> 5. Ask for a positive policy commitment for a substantial injection of funds to consolidate existing services and to develop new initiatives for women and children in the Australian community.</PARA>

<PARA> That it is clearly apparent that Australian society is becoming more polarised-that the rich at home and abroad are becoming richer, profiting from Australia's mineral wealth, whilst, pensioners and the disadvantaged, some three million people, are becoming a race apart.</PARA>
<PARA> That, of necessity, the Federal Government take action that all Australians share the wealth of their country by the transfer of resources to income security, health care and housing and therefore, your petitioners urge that.</PARA>

<PARA> Many Australians depend almost exclusively upon Trans Australia Airlines for the provision of essential air services.</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Liberal Party policy objective of selling Trans Australia Airlines within four years is contrary to the national interest.</PARA>

<PARA> Whilst pensions are indexed twice yearly to keep pace with the C.P.I., no adjustment is applied to the permissible income limit or the fringe benefit limit.

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate, in Parliament assembled. We, the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth, do humbly pray that the Commonwealth Government:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Note that legislation establishing plant breeders' rights in other countries has had serious adverse effects, namely:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Virtual monopoly control of seed production has passed into the hands of a few large international corporations seeking to profit from the exclusive rights over plant genetic materials created by such legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The varieties of seeds available have been restricted mainly to hybrids which will not reproduce truly and will not grow without the aid of artificial fertilisers and pesticides, thus maximising corporate profits without regard for the interests of growers and consumers.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The genetic diversity of crops has been eroded, rendering them vulnerable to disease and other environmental threats.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Recognise that maintenance of the genetic diversity of plant varieties is crucial to the continued well-being of the Australian nation, and take all necessary steps to preserve and promote such genetic diversity as a public resource and to prevent exclusive control over plant genetic materials from falling into private hands.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Defend the vital interests of Australian farmers and gardeners, independent Australian seed companies and their employees, and consumers of Australian farm and garden produce, by rejecting any proposal to legislate for the establishment of plant breeders' rights in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Health. Is it a fact, as claimed by the New South Wales Labor Government, that the Federal Government is responsible for the closure of some New South Wales hospitals because of lack of funding? I ask: Could the Minister inform the Senate what financial grants are available to New South Wales for hospitals from the Federal Government?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="556" SPEAKER="Baume Sen The Hon P.E." NAMEID="ME4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not true that New South Wales hospitals had to close because of lack of Federal funding. The facts are that New South Wales will have additional funds available to it this year from the Commonwealth, when compared with previous years. It will have more money this year than in previous years. I remind honourable senators that the basis of this year's Commonwealth funding is as follows: It is the 1980-81 funding levels, plus a 10 per cent amount for escalation to take account of changes in prices during the year, together with an estimate of 40 per cent of the increased revenue flowing from the new charging arrangements. On that basis, New South Wales will have extra money. In dollar terms this should mean that New South Wales will have available to it this financial year an additional $51m in real terms in revenue potential. In the light of that extra revenue potential, it is quite fanciful for New South Wales to claim that, if it is closing hospitals, that is in any way related to the funding coming from the Federal Government. It will have $51m in extra revenue potential.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Health in New South Wales, Mr Stewart, has previously announced a plan to rationalise hospital services. He announced this plan well ahead of any funding arrangements. He is on record as saying that the rationalisation in New South Wales which he has initiated and which he is planning will not result in any lowering of standards of hospital services. The New South Wales Government has to face the fact that if it wants to carry out a rationalisation of hospital services, that is all very well, but it has got extra revenue potential available and it cannot try to put the blame for what it is doing on the Commonwealth Government.</PARA>

<PARA> It is extremely difficult to trace money that comes into this country . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Is it a fact that his Government has ceased the collection of statistical information relating to the level of foreign investment in Australia, and on foreign ownership and control of Australian industry, in areas inclusive of life insurance, finance companies, mining, manufacturing industry, advertising agencies and the tourist industry, to name only a few? Does the Minister agree that this action by his Government has accentuated the difficulties involved in tracing foreign investment and has opened the way for a massive, covert takeover of Australian enterprises and resources, as well as land? In view of this, why will the Government not take action to have the compilation of such statistics reintroduced?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was not aware that the statistics were not available. The Government is very keen to ascertain and to make known the basis of the direction of investment capital coming into Australia. In the last year, it was shown upon analysis that of some $6 billion of foreign investment capital a substantial amount was for basic industrial development purposes and that a very large part-almost half or more-went out of Australia again to buy imports in order to establish industries and to develop employment in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question asked yesterday concerned land. What I said yesterday was that, first of all, land is under the sovereignty of State governments and that knowledge of the purchase of land-that is, the existing title and the name of the proposed purchaser-is a matter for the direct information of and action by State governments, except in any territory in which the Commonwealth is involved. Therefore, the control of foreign ownership of land falls wholly within the capacity of the States. I also said that, apart from its primary purpose, some money that comes in can have, after a time lag, secondary or tertiary purposes, and be directed towards the purchase of land without the knowledge of the Commonwealth Government. It is within the capacity of the States of Australia to ensure the ownership of land within their sovereignty.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the ownership of industries in Australia, the Foreign Investment Review Board guidelines have been laid down and are well known. The Government has been able to achieve a majority Australian equity. We aim to try to continue that in the future. Our aim is that there should be not only a majority equity, but also a managerial input, by Australians. As to the first part of the question regarding the statistics, I will seek further information and let the honourable senator know.</PARA>

Before I refer to the Mudginberri matter, I will take a moment to inform the Senate that there are now court challenges in relation to the Finniss River land claim as well, and some time will elapse before those challenges are heard. Coming back to the Mudginberri and Munmalary leases, in June 1978 the Commonwealth acquired those two pastoral leases mainly for inclusion in the Kakadu National Park and partly for uranium mining purposes. The acquisition has been challenged by the former lessees, Northern Pastoral Services Ltd, in the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory. There is to be a preliminary hearing next Monday, 14 September. At that time, the court will be asked to set a date for the hearing of certain questions of law. That is the stage the challenge has reached.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable senator will be aware that in order to ensure that we had adequate Commonwealth title to the lands, the Parliament, at its last sitting, passed the Lands Acquisition (Northern Territory Pastoral Leases) Act 1981. I might add that this Act has not yet been proclaimed because negotiations are continuing with Northern Pastoral Services Ltd in order to settle the matter of compensation for the acquisition without further recourse to litigation. Negotiations with the company are expected to take place shortly and will include discussions on the future operations of the abattoir which is on Mudginberri property. In the meantime, the company has closed the abattoir on Mudginberri station and has transferred the operation, I think, to the Point Stuart abattoir.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. Under the new health scheme a health care card is available for six months. I have been informed by the Department of Social Security that the qualifying income will be calculated on the amount earned in the four weeks prior to an application. I ask the Minister: What special arrangements have been made for casual workers who may have a large income for the four weeks prior to an application but little or no income for the following months and whose average earnings for the year would be less than the specified qualifying amounts?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator correctly indicates in his question that when an application is made for a health care card on the basis of low income the assessment will be made on the basis of the income in the four preceding weeks. If somebody applied and their income in the four preceding weeks was higher than the limits, a card would not be issued. The exception to that is the case of people who are self-employed where a different procedure is adopted and the income over a longer period-I think a full year-can be taken into account. So, there is an attempt to deal with people who may have quite cyclical income because of their self-employment. But in the case of somebody who is in the sort of factual situation indicated by the honourable senator there would be no problem if the person needed medical attention during a period in which there had been a lowering of income because, of course, there is an entitlement to apply after one has sought medical attention. In any four-week period where there is a qualification a person can apply for a health care card. So, if a person applied after a period of high income and was told that he could not have a card but subsequently in a period of low income sought medical attention he would be able to apply even if he did so after he had sought medical attention.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> By this Bill the Government seeks to provide for the confidentiality of personal information collected during the conduct of the epidemiological study of Vietnam veterans and when necessary other Government sponsored epidemiological studies. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will recall that last year my predecessor as Minister for Veterans' Affairs the Honourable Evan Adermann announced the Government's intention to conduct a scientific study of the possible effects of exposure to herbicides on Vietnam veterans and their children. A pilot study is well under way. Its purpose is not to yield findings relating to possible effects of herbicides but to test a number of possible ways of carrying out a major survey. It is being carried out on a small sample of veterans living in Sydney and their families. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the questions being tested in the pilot study and which might also be asked in a later major survey are on personal subjects such as drug abuse and interpersonal relations. Some of the answers given by the veterans or members of their families might bear on any claims a veteran might have for compensation or for repatriation benefits. Still other answers if disclosed might affect their opportunity for employment in particular occupations, or could be used to their detriment in courts. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of veterans have expressed reservations about participation in any study where absolute confidentiality of information cannot be guaranteed. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government accepts the fact that for epidemiological studies to have scientific validity, response rates must be high. The concerns over the confidentiality of the pilot study indicate that unless confidentiality is guaranteed, the Vietnam veterans study will meet with a significant degree of non-response. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill therefore would provide for the confidentiality of all information collected in the course of a study that is identifiable with particular persons. Clause 4 of the Bill would create an offence with a maximum penalty of $1,000 or imprisonment for 6 months for the unauthorized disclosure of personal information. This restriction on the divulgence of personal information would extend to the disclosure of the existence or non-existence of a document concerning the affairs of a person and to the disclosure of the whereabouts of such a document. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, clause 8 of the Bill provides that a person who has assisted or is assisting in a study shall not be required to produce in a court documents concerning the affairs of another person acquired during the study. Similarly, there can be no compulsion to divulge to a court personal information acquired during the study. </PARA>
<PARA> This prohibition would not however extend to the production of documents to the Ombudsman. I think that it is proper to allow access by the Ombudsman for the purposes of an investigation which he might make following a complaint. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw honourable senators' attention to clause 7 of the Bill. That clause would provide that in a few limited circumstances it would not be an offence to divulge information. Under that provision information might be divulged</PARA>
<PARA> To the person who provided the information in the first place, or</PARA>
<PARA> To the person to whom the information relates provided that where the information deals with more than one person, the permission of all the persons involved has been obtained. </PARA>
<PARA>Clause 7 would not give a right to the information. It will simply provide that it will not be an offence to provide the information in those circumstances. A person's rights to information would be provided under the proposed Freedom of Information Act. That Act would of course protect the information if it would be a breach of confidence to make it available. </PARA>
<PARA> Although all personal information is protected from disclosure in a court, clause 11 would permit the publication or disclosure to a court of conclusions, statistics or procedures used in a study. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 12 would provide that in the case of the Vietnam veterans study, the new Act would extend to information acquired, and documents prepared or obtained, before the commencement of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Although expressed to apply to the Vietnam veterans study the confidentiality ensured by this legislation will be a valuable tool in the conduct of other Government sponsored epidemiological studies. The legislation has therefore been drafted to allow other studies conducted by or on behalf of the Commonwealth to be declared by regulation as studies to which the confidentiality provisions apply. The provisions would also apply to information acquired and documents prepared or obtained before the commencement of the relevant regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, this Bill is an important measure and essential to the success of the Vietnam veterans study and similar epidemiological studies. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the adjournment of the debate last evening, I was pointing out that the Government's intention in introducing this sales tax legislation was to broaden the taxation base and to take the emphasis away from personal income tax and place further emphasis on indirect taxation. I indicated also the percentage of tax revenue that Australia and other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries derived from indirect taxation. I pointed out that Australia derived 6.7 per cent of its tax revenue from this source compared with France, for example, which had the highest rate at 23.7 per cent. I endorse the principle of sales tax as a legitimate way in which the Government should raise revenue. However, I pointed to some problems associated with the way the sales tax had been introduced and the confusion and disruption created, particularly in South Australia, as well as other parts of the country. I illustrated by way of example a pharmaceutical wholesaler who attempted, by telephoning the Australian Taxation Office in Adelaide, to find a list of goods to which this 2 1/2 per cent increase would apply, only to learn the office did not have a list available. He was placed in a rather awkward position. His position was not isolated by any means as I have had a number of letters through my office, telephone calls and personal representations demonstrating that other people have been caused the same confusion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also indicated that it was unrealistic to expect businesses to cope immediately with decisions first announced the night before. For example businesses had to have invoices reprinted at considerable expense and they faced long delays in having computers reprogrammed and so on. I highlighted this confusion through individual examples and from the advice given to me by the Sydney Sales Tax Discussion Group. The South Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry also made comment on this matter in the Press soon after the Budget was announced. I will quote from the article in the Adelaide Advertiser of 22 August. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The SA Chamber of Commerce and Industry yesterday urged the Federal Government to delay the introduction of the increases sales tax announced in the Budget until January 1. </PARA>
<PARA> The chamber's general manager Mr A. C. Schrape said if the Government could not delay the tax introduction, it should consider introducing the tax progressively. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision to introduce a sales tax of 17 1/2 per cent on 20 previously exempt items, and to increase the rate from zero to 30 per cent on one item, was causing confusion in the business community. </PARA>
<PARA> Also a number of manufacturers, faced with what in effect was a 17 1/2 per cent price rise, were finding substantial cancellations of orders, which was disrupting production and causing economic losses. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Schrape said the chamber agreed the sales tax increases on the 21 items were justifiable on equity grounds, but it condemned the heavy-handed manner in which they had been introduced. </PARA>
<PARA>As a result of this widespread confusion the Treasury introduced a number of fact sheets designed to clarify many of the matters. However, in my opinion it failed in that task. In South Australia a special Press release was issued by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) at the request of myself and others in an attempt to improve the situation. It set out details of when the taxes applied. In part it reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The Sales Tax on goods previously exempt from tax will be applied from midnight, December 31, 1981-that is, they will apply from the first day of January 1982. </PARA>
<PARA>As a result of this release articles appeared in the Adelaide newspapers. However, far from having the placating and clarifying effect, they raised more questions. When looking at a list prepared by the sales tax office of previously exempt goods now taxable, glace fruit appeared. In the light of the Treasurer's release just quoted we would assume that this item was not to be subject to tax until 1 January 1982. Yet this was not the case. This exempt item became taxable from Wednesday 19 August. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe also that the changes to the legislation have thrown up more anomalous situations of the type they were intended to overcome. Another anomalous area relates to manufactured pet food. One letter I received within the last fortnight from a pet shop owner highlights this point. He related how manufactured pet foods such as boned kangaroo meat is to be taxed at 17 1/2 per cent. Yet the same meat, unpackaged and sold either by butchers or supermarkets over the counter, will not be subject to the tax. Again, he related how plain bird seed will be subject to 2 1/2 per cent tax but if it is mixed in parrot or canary seed it will be liable to a 17 1/2 per cent tax. Clearly, these situations appear anomalous and discriminatory against the small pet shop owner and manufacturers of pet foods. Of course, what he must keep in mind is that these areas are employers of people. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area that I believe should receive urgent consideration relates to the circumstances of farmers using grain carting vehicles. Under the changes, as I understand it, a 17 1/2 per cent tax has been imposed upon, 'motor vehicles of the kinds ordinarily used on public roads when used in grain carting'. The reasoning behind this move was that in many circumstances exemptions were claimed for vehicles-including the so-called ordinary vehicles only used in grain carting part of the time. Yet the implementation of the measure will burden a farmer in pursuit of his livelihood. A York Peninsula farmer was written to me explaining how after 23 years his old truck had irreparably broken down during last years harvest. Having failed in an attempt to purchase a suitable second hand replacement he is now faced with a 17 1/2 per cent tax on any new vehicle he buys. In his letter he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> As you know, in all cases, increased costs are passed onto the consumers, but in the case of primary producers there is no one to pass these costs onto. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that decision to increase sales tax on such equipment appears unjust on the face of that complaint. Perhaps the most crucial consequence for South Australia is in regard to the decision to impose a 17 1/2 per cent sales tax on glace fruit. This particular item has not been the subject of sales tax up to now. It has been classified, and I think should remain classified, as a food rather than a confectionary. I have written to the Treasurer pointing this out and making the point that it is a significant industry in South Australia. There are three main producers of glace fruits in Adelaide. They purchase Riverland products and until now have competed successfully against overseas imports. I think the Budget decision will jeopardise the industry. Many of the concerns of the glace fruit industry were set out in a submission sent to the Treasurer after the announcement of the increase. Last night I showed the submission to Senator Button. He agreed with my proposition that that submission and a table indicating the fruit purchased from these three companies should be incorporated in Hansard. I seek leave to incorporate these documents. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The documents read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>SUBMISSION OF A CASE FOR REPLACING 'GLACE FRUIT' ON THE LIST OF EXEMPT FOODSTUFFS FOR SALES TAX PURPOSES</PARA>
<PARA> Under the proposed amendments to the Sales Tax Act set out in the Federal Budget Glace Fruits has been placed in the schedule of items attracting 17 1/2 per cent tax to correct ''anomalies/inconsistencies''. We submit:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) That putting it on this list is creating an anomaly or inconsistency, not correcting an existing one. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) As Foodstuffs in general are exempt from tax and as Glace Fruit, as manufactured by the South Australian industry, is basically fruit,-it consists of 50 per cent fresh fruit and natural sugars, with 50 per cent of added cane sugars and glucose-it must be exempt. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that the finished product is predominantly fruit is the reason that exemption was granted, pursuant to the submission to the Sales Tax authorities when commercial productions commenced in the 1945/1946 season. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) The industry was not consulted before this present amendment was made and consequently no opportunity was granted to put the case for retention of the exemption. </PARA>
<PARA> (4) The product without Sales Tax is high priced, requiring a large manual labour input; with Sales Tax added it will become almost prohibitive in price.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Since Fruit production is an important outlet for fresh fruit grown in the irrigation areas of the River Murray in South Australia, already hard hit by the collapse of the only remaining cannery in the area. The drop in demand which must occur as a result of the large increase resulting from the imposition of 17 1/2 per cent Sales Tax will drastically reduce the ability of this industry to remain viable and continue to use the following tonnages of fresh fruit annually. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of this will be to accentuate the very real difficulties facing the growers of tree fruits in the coming season with the eventual lower employment opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> (6) A considerable quantity of the total production sold, estimated at 50 per cent, is used in combination with ordinary dried fruits and other products to make such items as fruit bars and fruit cake sold extensively in health food stores, supermarkets and delicatessens. </PARA>
<PARA> (7) Attached is a schedule of fruit purchased by the industry during the 1980/81 season and of value of labour used. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the House. The table points out the direct labour cost to Toora Vale at Berri, Sunnyland at Adelaide and Gawler Park at Angaston. The wage bills associated with those three organisations are $552,337 a year at Berri, $296,834 at Adelaide and $300,829 at Angaston. Already the Budget decisions have had an adverse effect on this industry. I noted last week in the Adelaide Advertiser an announcement that one order worth $12,000 had already been cancelled and that others were sure to follow. The increases have placed in jeopardy this industry which last year had domestic and overseas sales of $7.5m and which, as I have already said, collectively paid in labour costs $1.15m a year to a work force of 300 workers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The indiscriminate application of these rates will have disproportionate effects upon some sections of the population. I refer particularly to home buyers, whom they will severely affect. It is estimated that the 2 1/2 per cent increase in the sales tax on building materials could add between $1,000 and $3,000 to the cost of an average house. That would be on top of the recent increases in home loan interest rates. It will obviously affect also the building industry. One interested party stated in a letter:</PARA>
<PARA> The one major exception to the investment stimulus which will be provided by increased sales tax may be the housing industry, and this may have been specifically intended by the framers of the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not agree with that; I think the party concerned feels somewhat cross about it. The letter continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The Housing Industry Association estimates that sales tax on building materials will add between $1,000 and $3,000 to the cost of a new home. </PARA>
<PARA>The Master Builders' Federation of Australia claims that the increases:</PARA>
<PARA>are specifically intended to hit an industry that does not enjoy the incentives or bounties or other protections given to manufacturing and primary producers. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, that criticism is perhaps a little severe but one genuinely put forward in the emotional situation that the increased sales tax has created. The Master Builders' Federation also states:</PARA>
<PARA>it must result in a further fall in the number of houses built . . . it will increase the cost of houses, hospitals, schools as the costs cannot be absorbed and will have to be passed on to consumers. </PARA>
<PARA>Much of the reasoning for the move has not been spelt out and claims such as the ones I have mentioned require explanation. The increases will particularly affect young married couples with children, and single parent families. Apart from suffering the effects of increased housing costs, they will have to cope with the increased tax on shoes and clothing. We all know the high cost of clothing growing children. This latest increase will add to the financial burden of parents. This is especially true of those who have children attending school. Parents will be faced with not only an additional cost for school uniforms but also a tax on stationery, books and magazines. </PARA>
<PARA> I said earlier that I would refer again to the letter to me from the Treasurer (Mr Howard) on the sales tax issue. I incorporated that letter in Hansard last evening. In the second paragraph Mr Howard wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> I feel that I must emphasise that the sales tax legislation has been, in much the same basic format as it is today, in operation for more than 50 years. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA>Increases in rates of sales tax have never operated retrospectively. </PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer then detailed changes in sales tax rates since 1961. In mentioning the 2 1/2 per cent increase contained in the 1964 Budget, he wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> The new rate operated on and after 12 August 1964. The relevant Bills received the Royal Assent on 5 November 1964. </PARA>
<PARA>Obviously, that is in effect retrospective legislation. Further, the explanatory memorandum to the Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1-9) 1981 states, in relation to clause 2 of the Bills:</PARA>
<PARA> By this clause of each Bill, the amending Acts will come into operation on 19 August 1981. This accords with normal practice for changes in the rates of sales tax. But for clause 2, the amending Act would-by reason of sub-section 5 (1A) of the Acts Interpretation Act-come into operation on the twenty-eighth day after the date of Assent. </PARA>
<PARA>It would thus appear that special provision is being made in the sales tax Bills to permit retrospective application. Further, it should be recognised that certain sales tax charges are not to be put into practice until 1 January 1982. According to the Treasurer, this is being done, so that Government administrative arrangements can be organised and so that business can gear up to cope with the changes. Yet, at the same time, the Treasurer says that this could not be done for all sales tax increases because there would be a massive buying up of goods. On the one hand, he states one thing but in respect of other goods, seems to be contradicting himself. Perhaps mass purchasing of goods will occur up to 1 January 1982. The Treasurer should extend this principle and allow industry and his Department time to come to grips with all sales tax increases. It seems to me that the whole thing was hastily conceived and that proper regard was not paid to the flow-on effects throughout the community. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that, just because we have been making bad mistakes for 50 years in this particular matter, that sort of practice should not continue. I have said before that I am supportive of sales tax as an alternative to increasing personal income tax. I think that is a wise move so far as the Government is concerned. However, I felt it was imperative that I point out the difficulties associated with an indiscriminate approach to this matter, and the need to research fully the implications for the community at large-particularly, as I have already mentioned, the plight of young families and those people in the categories to which I referred earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the Government in future will have regard to what I have had to say and to what a lot of people have had to say, through the media, on this matter. They include supporters of the Government, chambers of commerce and industry and others who have been loyal to us for a long time. They have expressed their concern. I would like to think that in future the disruption and disorganisation amongst industry which can occur when these sorts of measures are contemplated will be avoided. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;These sales tax Bills have to be justified by the Government on their own merits, a task which was clearly not embarked upon with very much enthusiasm by Senator Jessop. The situation may have been otherwise if the Government could reasonably have been able to claim some kind of mandate from the electorate for the significant new burdens being imposed on the community by these taxes. Of course, by that I do not mean-nor does the Australian Labor Party mean-when talking of mandates-that every last detail of this kind of Bill should have been foreshadowed. What I do mean is that if the Government wants to claim immunity from parliamentary scrutiny of these Bills, if it wants to claim immunity from amendment for them, if it wants to claim immunity from rejection for them, it should have given, at or before the last general election, some broad indication of its intention to rely more on indirect taxes. Of course, the Government did nothing of the kind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Early in 1979, after the major internal investigation then carried out, it expressly ruled out as too inflationary any increase in indirect taxes. It remained quite silent on the whole question in the run up to the 1980 Federal elections. It explicitly ruled out again any increase in indirect taxes or change in the indirect tax base prior to the Queensland election which followed last year's Federal election. For good measure in March of this year it ruled out yet again, as too inflationary, any across-the-board increase in indirect tax. Far from obtaining any kind of endorsement for the approach involved in this package of legislation, the Government rather has embarked upon what looks in retrospect to be nothing more or less than a systematic campaign of deception. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the merits of these Bills, as we should, it is apparent that they leave very much to be desired. Senator Jessop, in his speech just concluded, made a very effective critique of one aspect of the legislation, namely, the hopelessly disorganised, confused and dislocating mode of implementation of the changes to the tax law involved in these Bills. Yesterday Senator Walsh in his contribution looked at the macroeconomic and fiscal management implications of these legislative proposals and indicated against that general perspective, just how disastrous and unfair they in fact are. What I want to do quite briefly, because the task has been done very ably elsewhere particularly in the contributions to the debate from Labor spokesmen in the other place, is to focus on the regressive implications for the community of this package of legislation. Like any package of indirect taxes this package, of course, does have a regressive impact, a point that Senator Jessop in his evaluation of the merits of the legislation chose either to ignore or overlook. He certainly did not regard it as anything of any consequence. </PARA>
<PARA> It is evident that these sales tax Bills are no exception to the notorious general rule of regressivity so far as indirect taxes are concerned to the extent that no attempt has been made to confine the impact of the legislation to luxuries rather than necessities. Rather, the provisions of the taxing clauses in these Bills bite equally in their operation right across the whole of the community. The kinds of goods that are the subject of these Bills are, with few exceptions, those goods that have to be purchased by people at all levels in the community. People right across the community will pay exactly the same dollar sum-whatever their income level. Whether they are unemployed school leavers on $36 a week or the Prime Minister on $2,000 a week they will make exactly the same dollar and cents contribution to the revenue in respect of the goods that they purchase. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions of this package of legislation operate at several different levels. The first element of the package are the Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1 to 9). The effect of these is to impose an all-round increase of 2 1/2 per cent on the existing sales tax categories. That means in the first place a doubling of sales tax on such everyday items as furniture, crockery, glassware, cutlery, washing machines, vacuum cleaners, radiators, toasters, kettles, brooms, garbage cans, floor coverings, blinds, bedding, light fittings and candles-goods which clearly are items in every household in the nation and which are important in people's daily expenditure patterns. They are the kinds of expenditures that simply cannot be avoided. </PARA>
<PARA> Moving to the second level of taxation that is accomplished by this group of Bills, we see that the sales tax on cars is to increase from 15 per cent to 17 1/2 per cent which will add something like $150 to the price of an average four-cylinder car and around $180 to the price of an average six-cylinder car. Again, even at the top level of taxation of 27 1/2 per cent, which is now to be increased to 30 per cent-the so-called luxury category-we find subsumed such everyday items as shaving goods, combs and brushes which I think hardly come within the description, except perhaps for you, Mr Acting Deputy President, of luxuries. To the extent that things like radio and television are encompassed by this highest level of taxation, it reflects a rather outmoded view in this community as to what in fact are luxuries as distinct from necessities for households right around the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> The second grouping of Bills in this very large package before us are the Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos. 1A to 9A) 1981. These Bills are especially iniquitous to the extent that they impose for the first time sales tax on a whole group of items hitherto exempt. This is the notorious group of provisions which is to impose a tax at 2 1/2 per cent now, but of course it is wholly plausible that this is but the thin edge of what will become a very large fiscal wedge indeed. This package of provisions taxes for the first time such crucially ordinary articles as clothing and shoes. There is also the whole category of building materials, as large and diverse as that is, with the result taking into account what I had said previously about the increase in sales tax on furniture, that it has been reliably estimated by the building industry that the additional cost for building and furnishing a new house will be something like $1,000. </PARA>
<PARA> This group of Bills taxes for the first time packaging and wrapping papers which are of course relevant to foodstuffs. Even though foodstuffs remain exempt on the face of it from the operation of these Bills, the packaging with which they are surrounded will not be so exempt. That will have a small but cumulative effect on the price of groceries and other foodstuffs. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also the particularly iniquitous taxation of books, newspapers and magazines for the very first time in the country and what appears to be for the very first time in any Anglo-Saxon country. Hitherto it had been thought absolutely unconscionable to embark upon anything that could be described as taxation of knowledge or information. That inhibition is not one that has in any way overcome this Government, perhaps inevitably given the kind of insensitive crew it has in these matters. The result is that the book publishing industry, which is already in some difficulties, will be placed under additional strain. A further result is the prospect of the disappearance literally of a very large number of small magazines, particularly small literary magazines, which are always struggling for survival in the market-place. Most of these, having already set their subscription rates for the next 12 months or so, cannot adjust at this late stage to take account of the extra costs that will be involved and certainly they cannot carry them. This whole question of the tax on books, newspapers and magazines is one that will be taken up later in this debate by the shadow minister for the arts, Senator Ryan, and deservedly so because it needs an enormous deal of attention brought to it because of the extraordinary, unprecedented and insensitive character of this imposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The third and final category of taxes imposed by this package of legislation relates to the redress, so called, of anomalies that have previously existed. A pretty one-sided form of redress has been adopted with some 34 different items being covered by the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill. Some 29 of the items involve increases in taxation and only five in fact redress anomalies by way of a decrease in taxation. The overall result is that something like $142m in new revenue will be fed into the Government coffers in the next financial year. Among the categories of items of goods, many of them again satisfying this description of goods which are purchased by people right across the community spectrum including those at the lowest income level, that are now to be taxed for the first time at a rate of 17 1/2 per cent going up to 30 per cent are pet foods, insecticides, confectionery of various kinds including, as Senator Jessop and others have already pointed out, glace fruits which only rather implausibly satisfy the description of a confectionery rather than a foodstuff. Also oil for the car is now to be taxed for the very first time at 17 1/2 per cent. Even in this category we find things like picture tubes for television sets are going to be taxed for the first time. Perhaps it is arguable whether television sets can be described as a luxury or a necessity these days, but what is clear is that picture tubes are to be taxed, and taxed at a rate of 30 per cent which will result in the cost of an average television set increasing by some $80. </PARA>
<PARA> In looking at the impact of this legislation it can be seen that it operates in a way that is thoroughly iniquitous, thoroughly inhumane and thoroughly insensitive to the real financial needs and the real financial pressures that are already on a very large segment of the community. The only categories of goods that now escape the sales tax net altogether are food, medicine and wine. It is a real question, given the attitude of this Government, as to how much longer they will escape the net. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other inequities associated with the operation of the system, one of which deserves a brief mention; that is, the differential burden that is being borne in the operation of this kind of legislation by those living in rural and regional communities around this country. That differential or additional burden follows from the fact that there is a very large freight component in most of the goods that are purchased by such people. To the extent that sales tax is determined on the price at which goods pass from wholesale to retail and that the freight component is for the most part built into the wholesale price of goods, certainly when goods are delivered for distribution to major regional centres, the tax is payable not only on the good itself but also on the percentage price of that good which is attributable to the freight cost. That represents, as I say, a differential additional slug to a group of Australian taxpayers who are all too long-suffering in so many other respects. It is a slug which becomes particularly significant in quantitative terms when one talks about things such as building materials, and the operation of the building industry and house prices in regional centres, such as Townsville. </PARA>
<PARA> Many speakers in the course of this debate in the other House and no doubt in this chamber, not to mention commentators outside the Parliament, have drawn and will continue to draw attention to the inequities, inequalities, iniquities and anomalies which are involved in this package of sales tax legislation. With such voice as remains to me, I want to say a few words on a question other than the merits of the legislation with which I have been dealing; that is, the canard that opponents of the Australian Labor Party have insisted on perpetrating during the whole course of this debate-and a canard perpetrated, so far as I was concerned, in a particularly offensive and inaccurate way by Senator Missen in his contribution to the Budget debate a couple of weeks ago. I am referring, of course, to the description of the Labor Party as being hypocritical, inconsistent and acting in breach of its own long articulated principles in opposing this legislation, given the attitudes that it has so visibly espoused in the past-from 1972 to 1975-when it has been on the receiving end of legislative obstruction of its own program, particularly when it was on the receiving end of the blockage of Supply by the then Opposition in 1974 and 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> Like Senator Walsh, I believe that our position on this needs reiterating-in fact, it cannot be reiterated too often-to get what is really a fairly simple message into the heads of those who will not accept that we are behaving and acting as members of a party of principle. Let me state again why I think that is so by putting forward a succinct, I hope, series of propositions. Firstly, there is a clear distinction in principle between Bills on which the survival of a government depends and those on which it does not. In the former category are crucial money Bills, such as the Supply Bills which were blocked in 1974 and the Appropriation Bills which were blocked in 1975. In the latter category are not only all non-money Bills but also lesser money Bills, such as those imposing particular fees or taxes or appropriating moneys for particular limited purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> The second proposition is that although most Labor spokesmen, including myself, have used the expressions 'Supply Bills', 'money Bills' and 'Budget Bills' more or less interchangeably in speaking in the past of the need to limit the Senate's power, what we have always been talking about was the way in which that power was exercised in 1974 and 1975, when the money Bills in question were ones of life or death importance for the Government. The real distinction is not between 'money' and 'non-money' Bills, between 'Budget' and 'non-Budget' Bills or between 'appropriation' and 'non-appropriation' Bills. Rather it is between 'survival' and 'non-survival' Bills. I do not believe that those distinctions will be taken or treated in a merely semantic manner, as Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle put it yesterday, by any reasonably objective or fair-minded observer. </PARA>
<PARA> The third proposition relates to the language of the Constitution itself. Despite the Australian Democrats' apparent fascination with it, it is quite irrelevant to resolving the issue of principle which underlies this controversy. Nothing turns in principle on whether anything is or is not a money Bill. Section 53 of the Constitution does spell out which kinds of money Bills the Senate can initiate and which it cannot. It also identifies those money Bills which can be amended and those-for example, taxing Bills-which can merely be the subject of requests for amendment, a distinction which is important perhaps in theory but which tends to be fairly meaningless in practice. The Constitution also makes clear, as we discovered to our cost in 1975, that there is no legal barrier to the Senate delaying or rejecting outright any Bill at all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is not the point, I suggest to you.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I fully acknowledge that. I prefaced my remarks on this point by saying that the language of the Constitution is quite irrelevant. What matters is the moral question-the question of principle. As to that question, the Constitution is absolutely silent. If Senator Mason's intervention in this debate means that we will cease to hear from him and his colleagues this absurd preoccupation with the precise language of section 53 and this agonising as to whether some provision is within the category of money Bill referred to there, I for one will be absolutely delighted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I now turn to the fourth proposition. There is no doubt that the present sales tax Bills are in the non-survival category. The revenue that they will generate amounts to just $500m this financial year and $892m in a full financial year out of the total planned Budget receipts of $40,000m; in other words, just one-eightieth of the total this financial year. The Government, as we know, has budgeted for a surplus this year of substantially more than $500m-indeed, more than $892m. This financial year the Government has budgeted for a surplus of over $1,100m. So there is no question of government services not being paid for if these Bills are rejected, as we ask the Senate to join us in doing. For all those reasons, they cannot be described, however important they might be for the Government's financial strategy or for the brand of politics that the Government wants to communicate to the populace, as survival Bills. They are unquestionably utterly irrelevant to the question of the Government's capacity to survive. </PARA>
<PARA> The fifth proposition is most important. I think it is very important that the Labor Party's attitude be absolutely clearly understood. The fact that the sales tax Bills are, as I have described them, non-survival Bills is not necessarily the be-all and end-all of the matter. If we voted against Government legislation of this kind just because we did not like it, because we thought it was obnoxious, without having any regard to the total context of that legislation, we would not be in any more secure or attractive a moral position than was the then Opposition between 1972 and 1975 in dealing, as it did, cavalierly with all those elements in the Labor Government's legislative program which it did not like, which it found obnoxious to its own principles. The critical question for these non-survival Bills is whether the Government can reasonably claim some kind of electoral mandate-explicit or implicit; direct or indirect-for them. If it can, I believe we should, as a responsible Senate and as a responsible Opposition in the Senate, let that legislation through, however much it hurts our own perception of what is in the best interests of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The sixth point I want to make is that there can be no question of a mandate of any kind for these particular sales tax Bills-direct or indirect, specific or general, or implicit or explicit. As I have said already, the possibility of more indirect taxes either as a supplement or as an alternative to income tax simply was not floated at the time of the last election, and to the extent that it has been the subject of Government statements over the last two years that concept has been specifically repudiated. The final point I make, although it is by no means the least important, is that there is a whole series of precedents in regard to revenue measures in recent Budgets which the Australian Labor Party has voted against in both Houses, without anyone raising cries of inconsistency, hypocrisy or constitutional impropriety. For example, to take just the 1978-79 Budget, the ALP opposed the income tax surcharge, the increased tax on long service leave, the abolition of the tax deduction for home loan interest, the removal of tax exemption from Commonwealth post-graduate awards and the increased excise on beer, spirits and cigarettes. As well as all those items in that Budget, we have voted against other items in other Budgets. As Senator Walsh says, during Senator Mason's tenure in this Parliament he has voted against some of these things without anyone making the claim of hypocrisy or without anyone suggesting to him that he was in breach of his statutory declaration or his principles, or whatever it is that moves him so substantially. The only thing that is different about the 1981 Sales Tax Amendment Bills is that this time there is a chance that our vote will actually mean something. </PARA>
<PARA> I assure the Senate that for all the various reasons I have mentioned the ALP certainly will vote, on the merits, against these Bills at the second reading stage. What action we take thereafter in the Committee stage of the Bills remains, as Senator Walsh said, to be determined in the light of further discussions among all the relevant parties and interests concerned. Whatever we do in this respect will be designed to reduce as far as humanly possible the impact on the community of these notoriously inhuman taxes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating today a number of Bills relating to increasing or introducing sales taxes on a variety of items, to a variety of degrees of imposition. I remind the Senate that yesterday Senator Harradine questioned the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) on the reason behind the Sales Tax Amendment Bills being put forward in the particular way they have been presented. Specifically, he asked whether she was aware that the Bills had been drafted in a form entirely different from any other form in which similar Bills have come before the Senate in the past 50 years; in other words, on this sole occasion machinery provisions along with provisions imposing taxation have been included in the one Bill. He further asked her what was the purpose of that unique step. I remind the Senate also that he had to put that question to the Minister twice before he got even half an answer. Although the Minister talked around the issue, under pressure from Senator Harradine, she seemed reluctant, despite the comments in this morning's Australian Financial Review, actually to confirm or deny Senator Harradine's suggestion that the form of the Bills was a matter of tactics; in other words, that the declaration not to block Supply or money Bills made by the Australian Democrats in the weeks prior to the election last October-I remind both Senator Walsh and Senator Evans that those declarations were signed in the weeks prior to that election and not any earlier than that--</PARA></TALK.START>

If this is the case, it is unfortunate, if not actually reprehensible. Despite this, for the benefit of Senator Evans and others, I must reiterate that not one of us regrets the spirit, at least, which prompted us to make that pledge when we did. On the other hand, I acknowledge that it has got us into a certain amount of difficulty in that the Australian Labor Party and others seem to be unable to understand why we did it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, that is not so. I take the opportunity to engage in some backchat with Senator Button because he insists that we change our minds daily. I understand his leader changed his mind within the 10 minutes it took to go from one radio station to another. I suppose that makes the Australian Labor Party one up on us. As far as the Australian Democrats are concerned, the actions of Malcolm Fraser and others in 1974 and 1975 were nothing short of a disgraceful abuse of parliamentary power. That the Australian electorate subsequently appeared to endorse those actions at the polling booth does not make right the wrong perpetrated by the Liberal Party of Australia. It is therefore of no credit to the ALP, although I am sure that its members are acting within their principles as they see them, that it is hell-bent on taking or manufacturing the first opportunity which presents itself to get even. Even worse is the point scoring exercise undertaken by some members of that party in their actions on a matter over which they had control when they were in Government but did nothing about. If, when the ALP was in office, it had taken any steps to lower sales taxes generally it would be possible to take the present huffing and puffing of its members far more seriously than we are able to do. Senator Evans mentioned the sales tax on cars. I remind him that in 1975 it was the ALP which increased this tax, and it did the same thing in 1973 in relation to non-alcoholic beverages. Furthermore, if in all the debate in the Press lately any member of the Labor Party had pledged to remove or lower sales taxes in the highly likely event of that party winning the next election, his integrity would not now be called into question. In the equally likely event that we of the Democrats are in the same position during the reign of a Labor government as we are in with this Liberal Government, our actions on its budgetary initiatives will be the same.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Finally, if the ALP had elected to be selective in its opposition to the sales taxes, one could assume that it had taken the time to think the issue through. That has not occurred. This must puzzle any thinking member of the public. I can assure the Labor Party that there are a great many thinking members of the public. In fact, I would like to assure the Press, too, that that is the case. The public will be puzzled because the Labor Party is agonising-I unashamedly take Senator Evans's word that he used earlier about us-over the imposition of a higher sales tax on such things as furs, gold-plated cutlery, jewellery, cosmetics, artificial flowers and fruits and the machinery used by multinational mining companies. This hardly fits the Labor Party image of being a party for the working man. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats do not intend to compete with the ALP for the title of the new Australian conservatives. We have no wish to win the Toorak vote by bribing the Toorak voters by preventing an increase in the proposed tax on furs and other luxuries used by them to flaunt their wealth. If members of the ALP wish to do that, so be it. The decision is theirs. But I suspect it is a useless attempt on their part to capture an exceedingly elusive market. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not seen any evidence of that yet. Our Party states quite clearly in its policy that it supports the imposition of indirect taxation, provided it is in conjunction with certain income tax concessions. But we do not under any circumstances support the increase in tax rates on the necessities of life. I remind the Senate that what the present Government is doing is directly contrary to Articles 25 and 26 of the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights. For the benefit of honourable senators who are not familiar with those Articles-I suspect there is an extremely large number of them who have never heard of them-I will read them to the Senate. Item 1 of Article 25 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Everyone has the right to a standard of living adequate for the health and well-being of himself and of his family, including food, clothing, housing and medical care . . . </PARA>
<PARA>As Senator Evans pointed out, the Liberal Government has not as yet got around to putting a tax on food and medical care. But, one presumes, it is only a matter of time before that occurs. Item 2 of Article 25 states:</PARA>
<PARA> Motherhood and childhood are entitled to special care and assistance . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Item 1 of Article 26 states:</PARA>
<PARA> Everyone has the right to education . . . </PARA>
<PARA>But I contend that one cannot be educated if one does not have access to information. Item 2 of Article 26 states:</PARA>
<PARA> Education shall be directed to the full development of the human personality and to the strengthening of respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. It shall promote understanding, tolerance and friendship among all nations, racial or religious groups, and shall further the activities of the United Nations for the maintenance of peace. </PARA>
<PARA>None of those things is possible if adequate information is not available to all people and if it is not available to them at a reasonable price. I would therefore, of course, have to endorse-quite willingly-Senator Evans's condemnation of the new tax on information and on the other things that we define as the necessities of life. Senator Harradine, I understand, is in a similar position. We gather that he intends to move amendments in order to make sure that those sorts of things are not hit by a new tax. Senator Button has described Senator Harradine's amendments as ingenious. I prefer to think of them as being rather exotic. There is certainly nothing the matter with them. We support his intention. We find, however, that it is unnecessarily complicated. Nevertheless, we commend him for what he is planning to do, but believe that in the first instance at least there is an easier way to achieve the results that Senator Harradine is aiming for. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate, as we all know-constitutional arguments aside-has a legitimate piece of machinery available to it other than simply blocking the legislation in the first instance. It can, and has in the past, and will in the future, refer parts of legislation back to the House of Representatives requesting that it amend anomalous or objectionable sections. We signal quite clearly our distaste-indeed, our contempt-for the new sales tax impositions. We have also indicated our proposed actions. The Australian Democrats indicating proposed actions on anything has proven in the past to be somewhat disastrous. The ALP has a tendency to sweep our initiatives out from under us. I think that on those grounds alone people can see why we are loth to signal our intentions too early. We have, of course, been given no reason to change our minds about the legislation. We will refer certain sections of certain of the sales tax Bills back to the House of Representatives and if they are sent back--</PARA>

We intend, at the appropriate time-and it will be a time that the Senate decides upon-to seek the co-operation of so-called Liberal rebels in the other place in rejecting the taxes imposed on previously exempt items. I dare say that there are some rebel Liberal members in this place who may be persuaded to support the view that we take. Certainly Senator Jessop, in his speech earlier today, expressed disquiet. The problem, of course, is to persuade enough Liberals to put their votes where their mouths are and do something about this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Democrats intend to request the House of Representatives to amend the Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1A to 9A) by deleting a number of items on which these Bills impose a 2 1/2 per cent sales tax, and which were previously exempt under the Sales Tax (Classifications and Exemptions) Act. The amendments requested will delete certain goods from the amendments, thus leaving them exempt. They are covered by various items in the First Schedule to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1935 and include No. 51, books; No. 54, newspapers-and those of course mean the dissemination of information- Nos 82-90F inclusive, covering building materials, specifically those building materials for use in private dwellings; No. 96, wrapping materials; and No. 120, clothing and footwear but not drapery, et cetera. It is our intention, therefore, to support the second reading of these Bills in order to be able to put those amendments during the Committee stage of the debate on the Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that the taxes to which I have referred do not come into effect until 1 January, unlike those which increase taxes on luxuries or close loopholes in the sales tax law. There is, therefore, no need for haste. There is no need for the indecent hurry exhibited by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) to force these Bills through the Parliament. We all know that there are many Liberals with principles. Senator Evans is not the only member of this chamber with principles. The ALP is not the only party with principles, nor are we making any assertions to that effect. There are members of the Liberal party with principles. It is simply a matter of persuading them to exhibit those principles in public. Therefore, we are aiming to get these decent Liberals to object in the party room and on the floor of the House to the tax imposition on clothing, building supplies and other things which we regard as essentials, things which, unlike furs, artificial flowers, gold-plated cutlery and so on affect the average working man or woman and his or her family. Referring those clauses back to the other House will give those Liberals with a conscience-and I am assured by the Liberal party that there are one or two Liberals with consciences--</PARA>

That process indeed makes Parliament receptive and accessible to the general public. Most importantly, however, the referral of those clauses back to the other House will prevent the Government from precipitating this country into a state of confusion by giving the Labor Opposition the opportunity to block the sales tax Bills in their entirety.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Government I wish to support the sales tax amendment Bills. Today we are cognately debating three groups of Bills. The first group increases by 2 1/2 per cent the existing rates of sales tax. The new rates of sales tax will be operative from the date of the Budget. It is necessary for these rates to operate from the date of the Budget as otherwise not only would the Government lose revenue but also the more wealthy section of the community would have an opportunity to stock up to the disadvantage of those who are less well off. The next group seeks to correct certain anomalies and inconsistencies in the present sales tax laws. I will give one example. Is it right that alarm clocks should attract a lower rate when compared with ordinary clocks and watches?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The third Bill imposes 2 1/2 per cent tax on a number of items which were not subject to sales tax. These items include clothing, footwear, drapery, soft furnishings, manchester, building materials, books, magazines, newspapers, packaging, wrapping, hand tools et cetera. A number of items were previously exempt. I will give a couple of examples. Traditionally, saddlery and harnesses were associated with primary production. This was the case when the Act was introduced in the 1930s. In recent years their use has changed substantially and these items are now used predominantly for recreational and sporting purposes. Therefore, it is appropriate that sales tax be applied to these sorts of items which were previously tax free. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us move now to the mining industry. There were certain types of motor vehicles and trucks which could have been used on ordinary roads but which were exempt from taxation if used in the mining industry. Our Government believed that in this day and age it was no longer appropriate that the mining industry should be entitled to exemptions on these sorts of ordinary vehicles when such exemptions were not open to other sectors of industry. There was another case where, for example, forklift trucks used by stevedores were exempt. This was in line with the fact that this type of equipment was exempt when used on board ships. But with changes in stevedoring and the like, forklift trucks are now an integral part of the stevedoring and transport industry and they should attract a tax rather than be exempt. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the community has come to recognise that there is a need for a change in the tax mix, that is, a change in the ratio of indirect to direct taxation. For example, in 1975 the Asprey Taxation Review Committee made a comprehensive review of the taxation system. It came to the general conclusion that the taxation system should place a far greater reliance on taxes of goods and services by the inclusion of a broad based tax. Our Government believed that a broad based tax was not appropriate. It believed that some extensions of the sales tax system was appropriate in line with that sort of thinking. </PARA>
<PARA> We have not extended sales tax to services in line with the recommendations of the Asprey Committee. We have not extended it to food. I think it is important to recognise that wholesalers pay the sales tax on an ad valorem basis and, therefore, with inflation there is some adjustment to changing prices. What have we actually seen? The actual share of wholesale taxes as compared with total revenue has actually declined, particularly since 1953-54, largely because of the rapid escalation in the collection of personal income taxes. What has this led to? It has led also to a situation where many wage earners in the community do not have an incentive to work overtime because of the high penalty taxes that are imposed. It has led to a situation of a high level of tax avoidance practices. We are seeking as part of this legislation to change the sales tax mix. </PARA>
<PARA> The other factor is that over the years there has also been what we refer to as a narrowing of the tax base itself. This has been achieved over the years because exemptions and reclassifications have effectively reduced that base. These pieces of legislation seek to widen that base to give recognition to the findings of the Asprey Taxation Review Committee in regard to widening the impact of taxation. I remind honourable senators that while we in Australia are exempting food, apart from confectionery items-that exemption includes biscuits-overseas there is a growing acceptance of this sort of tax, even on food. The Government has been accused of being inhuman and that sort of thing. But look at most of the European countries. In the main they tax food; we do not. Admittedly some of them tax the items at a concessional rate. Look at the United States of America. The majority of its States uniformly tax food items at the retail level, but this is not the case here. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government regards these packages of Bills as fundamental to its overall Budget strategy. I think this must be regarded as important. It would be very dangerous if this Senate were to determine for itself those money Bills which it, but not the Government, regards as important or significant; that is, the Senate selects those Bills which the Government needs for its very survival and those which this Senate believes are not necessary for its absolute survival. This could be an inappropriate and dangerous precedent for this Senate to take upon itself the responsibility of saying which Bills are essential and of whittling away a lot of the Budget provisions it feels are not absolutely necessary. We must look at a Budget as a whole package and not as a series of unrelated items. Every item is related to the whole. Therefore we have to recognise that the Budget is a package in itself. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that the Opposition would very much like to see inflation rise at the expense of the Government presently in office. The Opposition could achieve this by whittling away these sales tax Bills because the effect would be to reduce the domestic surplus. That cannot be denied. Whittling away this domestic surplus would bring money supply problems and consequently affect inflation. That cannot be denied; they would be the consequences. I ask honourable senators to look at the consequences of their actions and not to look at the Budget in a piecemeal fashion. </PARA>
<PARA> I think we should also look at the consequences of this Senate selecting and separating a machinery section which is a component of a taxing Bill. It is well recognised that this Senate does not have the power to amend taxing legislation, but a technique which is going to be devised is that we in this Senate will attempt to pull out certain sections of a taxing Bill and call them machinery sections. I submit that inevitably in every Bill that passes through this Senate there must be some machinery sections. If those machinery sections are of a major nature the government puts them through as a separate Bill, as a machinery piece of legislation. But does this Senate have the constitutional authority to decide arbitrarily which machinery sections are appropriate to be pulled out of a taxing Bill and which are not? That leads us to the question: How far can the Senate go? I submit that the whole Budget strategy of any government could be reduced to tatters if we accept this principle whereby a Senate has power to whittle away legislation and to decide: 'Ah! This section, this word, these few lines, can be deleted and we will create another machinery Bill so that we, in our so-called honest interpretation, will not knock back a taxing Bill. We will whittle it away and effectively create another machinery Bill'. That is the actual effect of what is going to be done. The Government has to be judged by its overall Budget strategy. I think everybody, on either side of Government, can always identify a piece of legislation that does not suit his or her particular philosophy or his or her own interests. But what we have to do as a Party is stand by our overall Budget strategy and support it. This is what I am attempting to do today. I therefore believe that there is a need to change the tax mix. France, for example, relies very heavily on indirect taxation-to the extent of about 23 per cent. We have not attempted to extend this tax to the service sector. Our increase is a modest one compared with taxation levels in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries which I have mentioned. We have an increasing reliance on personal income tax which is taking away people's incentive to work. With the anticipated decline in revenue resulting from the crude oil levy we will see a need for some alternative revenue sources in the future. But, as I say, the increase is a modest one; it is not a major shift. The extra income is, I think, something like $553m so it is not large in the Budget context. Sales tax will now account in real terms for only something like 7 per cent of government receipts. A study, carried out by the Australian Taxation Office, showed that approximately 26 per cent of purchases of lower income groups are for food, but food for human consumption is exempt from sales tax. So we will find that this legislation will not have the impact it is alleged it will have by many of honourable senators opposite. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me look at a couple of contentious items. For example, although it is the Government's intention that sales tax be payable on books, magazines and newspapers as from 1 January 1982, it has never been the Government's intention that bibles and prayer books be subject to sales tax. I think there is a long established ruling by the Commissioner of Taxation, under item 65 of the first Schedule, which exempts items which are related to religious devotion. I also point out that schools and universities are exempt from paying sales tax on items which would have been subject to tax if they had been bought by other users. I think it is important to remember those facts. </PARA>
<PARA> Many honourable senators have said that there has been condemnation across the board of a lot of these sales tax increases, but I refer honourable senators to an article in the Age of 21 August, in which the Chief Executive and Managing Director of G. J. Coles and Co., Mr Bevan Bradbury, is reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> The 2.5 per cent increase in sales tax in Tuesday's Federal Budget would help build confidence and stabilise the community, . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Here is a person who is at the forefront of merchandising in Australia; a person in a position to know. On the other hand, we find that other companies are actually going to agree to absorb the sales tax rises. I think I should mention again that this is a fairly modest increase. It is important to state that the Federal Government alone imposes sales tax. But the tax, being a component of cost, is a deductible expense so far as income tax is concerned. It is-a single turnover commodity tax which is levied in respect of goods produced in Australia, other than exempt goods. It does not apply to secondhand goods which have gone into consumption in Australia. It is also payable on goods other than exempt goods which have been imported into Australia. I believe that it is appropriate for the Government to legislate in this area. We have to recognise that our ratio of indirect taxes compared with those levied by other countries is quite low and that it is appropriate for Australia to change its tax mix so that it becomes less reliant on personal income tax. I commend the Bills in their present form to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the package of three sales tax Bills which have been introduced into this place by the Government. It is the intention of the Opposition to oppose all three Bills outright at the second reading stage. My colleague Senator Evans has already made this clear. The taxes are iniquitous, they will be inflationary and they are not justified in any economic or social way. The range of people who will be badly affected by them is enormous. I do not propose at this stage to refer to all of them. What I would like to do is draw attention to a particularly iniquitous and inegalitarian effect of the taxes, and that is the effect on the book publishing and magazine industry of this country. I think it must be fairly clear to all Australians now that the Fraser Government is the most anti-intellectual and anti-cultural government this country has seen. I remind honourable senators of the cuts in arts funding, which have meant that by now most major theatre companies, for example, are in financial crisis, that smaller companies are going out of business or will go out of business, and that people in rural areas, such as those whom Senator Coleman represents, have less and less access to cultural activities. I remind honourable senators of the cuts in education, which have particularly affected the innovative arts education steps that were being taken during the period of Government and for a little time after the Whitlam Government. I remind honourable senators of the drastic deterioration in the output of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, which again has had a most deleterious effect on intellectual and cultural life in this country and on the access of Australians living outside the metropolitan areas to the sorts of things that the ABC once could provide.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We really do have a very anti-intellectual government. In fact, the only serious attempt the Fraser Government has made to assist creative activity in this country has been a major botch up. I am referring, of course, to the concessions for investment in the film industry. I will not waste the time of the Senate at this point in reminding honourable senators of the incompetence, the bungling and the changes of direction that accompanied that measure. Suffice it to say at this point that the scheme is not operating; that the industry, instead of being assisted and supported by this scheme, is in chaos; and that people who depend on the industry for their livelihood are facing unemployment or erratic employment. The whole thing has been totally disastrous. The only people who have been assisted by this measure have not been the creative people-the performers, the actors and the writers-but have been the tax evaders, the brokers and so on. That scheme, chaotic as it is, really involves the sum total of what the Fraser Government has been prepared to do for the creative arts and for intellectual activity in this country. Of course, there have been cuts in research budgets and cuts in university budgets as well. </PARA>
<PARA> Now we have this new and particularly iniquitous tax on books and magazines. I want to make a point in line with the claimed ideology or alleged philosophy of this Government. The Government often likes to present itself as a friend of small business or as a friend of Australian business which, of course, is mostly small business. Most Australian publishing is small business. Most producers of small magazines are small business people. Yet they are the people who are going to be put out of business by this new tax on knowledge, this new tax on books and magazines. They are the people who have been in a very low profit area, usually because of commitment to a particular idea, commitment to Australian publishing, and commitment to an independent Australian intellectual life. They are the people who will be put out of business. Of course, as usual, the multinationals will move in, take up their customers and take up their operations. The multinationals will increase their monopolies. That is the sort of thing that happens again and again under the Fraser Government while it pretends to be a friend of small business. I have had many representations from small publishing houses. Clearly these tax measures will be the last straw for a lot of the small independent Australian publishing houses. I think that is a tragedy for our country. </PARA>
<PARA> In the history of Australia no government has ever taxed or dutied books because, as Al Knight, the President of Hyland House Publishing Pty Ltd pointed out to me in recent representations, it has been realised that such taxes are an affront to civilised society. In the early 1930s the Commonwealth Government initiated a primage duty on books. However, it was forced to withdraw this tax in the face of a widespread protest. The point has been made several times in recent weeks that no other democratic country-the kind of country with which we like to compare ourselves-taxes knowledge, taxes books. I think that point was made very colourfully by the British author, Lord Ted Willis, when he spoke recently at the National Press Club. Lord Ted pointed out that about 150 to 200 years ago riots took place in England when a stamp duty was proposed on newspapers. At that stage the British people accepted the principle that there should be no tax on knowledge. We have a government that seems so keen on the British connection and so keen on maintaining British institutions in this country, but it is a very selective keenness and it is a very selective enthusiasm for British traditions. It seems that very fine democratic principles, such as the British principle of no tax on knowledge, can be abandoned. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the serious things, of course, is the effect that this tax will have on employment. It is very clear that the downgrading of the whole book publishing and magazine printing industry which will result from these tax measures will result in a loss of employment in the printing area. As we all know, printers and people working in the industry have been facing increasingly high levels of unemployment because of the effect of new technologies on the printing industry. Now we have a further attack on employment not only in the printing area but also in small publishing houses and businesses concerned with the production and circulation of magazines and so on. There is also an attack on employment in all sorts of art and community activities that depend for support on being able to inform people about their activities through small magazines. We are also concerned that the tax will hit small newspapers, particularly those of the ethnic Press. Such publications also face, as a result of the Fraser Government policies, increases in general postage rates, increases in category B postage rates and increases in telephone and telecommunications charges. It is a great and unexplained irony that the Fraser Government is prepared to spend millions of dollars on ethnic television and yet is about to penalise the ethnic Press in this way. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the case can still be argued that the ethnic Press serves a community quite different from and much more extensive than the community that can take advantage of ethnic television because, of course, ethnic television exists only in Sydney and Melbourne whereas ethnic newspapers have been long established in this country and have given very fine service to a whole diversity of ethnic people living in Australia. I think in many cases this Press will have its existence jeopardised by this tax. </PARA>
<PARA> While most libraries are exempt from sales tax and from the effect of the tax on the buying of books, the effect on the purchase of newspapers and periodicals by the Australian public and non-exempt libraries will be significant and will cause a serious decline in the book publishing industry. Despite the fact that the cost of books and magazines in this country is very high Australians have a tradition, or have until now, of buying books at a very high rate. If that is to stop, which it will because of these tax measures, then the book industry will be very badly affected. I point out, in reminding the Government of the fact that Australia is isolated from the principal sources of published material in English, that the prices of books in Australia are already much higher than elsewhere. This is a matter I have raised on other occasions and will raise again in this place on many future occasions. To buy books in Australia is already a very expensive business. But to add an additional tax is, of course, totally unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out that although the Government is talking about a tax of only 2.5 per cent many people who speak for the book industry have already pointed out that the effect will be more like an increase of 10 per cent. I quote Mr Richard Walsh the Managing Director of Angus and Robertson Publishers who said:</PARA>
<PARA> The price of books could increase by up to 10 per cent because of administrative costs associated with the Federal Government's 2.5 per cent sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA>I am persuaded that that will be the case. It will also be the case because many small wholesalers and retailers of books are in great confusion about what the tax will mean to them; there is a whole range of complicated procedures because schools, universities and libraries will be exempt and that will affect the wholesale buying program and so on. It is a very confusing area. Wherever there is confusion, as has been the experience in this country and elsewhere, prices go up. If people, whose livelihoods are fairly tenuous anyway, feel faced with a whole lot of increasing costs they will certainly put prices up for consumers. In fact we are dealing with something much bigger than the 2.5 per cent sales tax legislated for in the Bills before us this evening. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the most serious point of opposition that the Australian Labor Party has for the tax on knowledge is its concern for a diversity and availability of information and access to information which is absolutely essential if democracy is to function. What will happen as a result of these measures if they are proceeded with is that there will be financial barriers in the way of citizens seeking information. By making information more expensive the Government is creating a situation where those with limited resources will be unable to obtain it. Of course this is in line with the general thrust of Fraser Government policies which is to hit hardest those with least resources.</PARA>
<PARA> I speak particularly about the access to learning and to text books which is something that poor families are already having enormous difficulty with. That is a situation which will deteriorate very badly. It is all very well for the rich to say, 'we can afford to pay a bit more for books' but we have a situation where the cost of education to the ordinary Australian family is being increased virtually with every government decision. We have had university fees re-established, student loans schemes coming in to replace proper support for students, and in every government school in my own electorate here in the Australian Capital Territory almost compulsory fees are charged to provide essential text books, chalk and things of that kind. We now have families hard hit with increases to the cost of books that they might like to buy to assist in their children's education. So it is a very anti-democratic measure. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe too that in the tax's anti-social and anti-cultural effects at least the spirit of the legislation is in breach of the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organisation convention on the free flow of educational and cultural materials. As I said, small magazines and newsletters will be put out of business. Subscriptions will decline and proprietors will be required to undertake time-consuming exercises preparing sales tax returns. Subscriptions to small magazines and newsletters contain a major component to cover postage. Will this also be taxed? Many subscribers to such magazines pay several years in advance. Is sales tax to be paid on subscriptions received before the sales tax was announced? It is clear that the sales tax will cause immense problems for small magazines and will wipe many of them out. To reiterate my point about information in a democracy, this of course will reduce the diversity of views and information and will be Australia's loss. </PARA>
<PARA> The time allowed for this debate I know is rather tight but I want to place on record the names of some of the organisations which have made very urgent representations to me on this matter because I feel that all their representations are serious, are to the point and ought to be responded to by the Government. I have had representations from the Bibliographical Society of Australia and New Zealand which is concerned about the effects of the tax on research material and by Forward, the New South Wales newspaper of the Uniting Church in Australia. That representation was signed by Paul Lynch, Vice-President of the Australian Religious Press Association. I have had other representations from other people concerned about the effect on religious newspapers. Of course, the Treasurer (Mr Howard) has made it clear that Bibles and prayer books will continue to be exempt. That is not enough. People who are involved in organised religion are concerned with ideas that change and adapt to changes in society. Religious organisations need the opportunity to make their views known on certain political matters, for example, land rights for Aboriginals. It is not just a matter of saying to people who are members of organised religions, 'you don't have to pay tax on your Bibles and prayer books'. It is a whole range of other publishing activities about which I have had representations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Magazine Publishers Association is taking action to resist the sales tax. Hyland House Publishing Pty Ltd has also made representations. Lloyd O'Neil Pty Ltd, another small Australian publishing house, is of the kind whose survival I believe will be seriously jeopardised by this measure. I have had a number of representations from ethnic newspapers including the Europa Kurier Publishing Group which publishes the Maltese Herald which is a weekly publication based in Bankstown and which also has a Melbourne office. The Overseas Periodicals (Aust.) Pty Ltd also has drawn to our attention the deleterious effects on the ethnic Press of these proposals. The Australian Advisory Council on Bibliographical Services has made representations. </PARA>
<PARA> I have had very detailed representations from the publisher of a small and very unusual magazine called Cantrills Filmnotes. That is the kind of alternative information about independent film in Australia which is of great importance to the independent Australian film industry. I am informed by the editors of this magazine that they will not be able to survive the imposition of the tax. The Library Association of Australia has condemned the proposed imposition in the Federal Budget of the 2 1/2 per cent sales tax on books, magazines and newspapers as it places a tax on access to information. I could go on but time is short. I reiterate very simply the point that in a democracy access to knowledge should be something that all governments have as one of their primary concerns. In this country we already have too great a monopoly in the area of telecommunications. We have too little diversity in television and radio. We already have too many difficulties in the way of people seeking access to a diversity of views and knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA> The democratic fabric of our society has been greatly strengthened by the activities of small publishing houses-by people who bring out magazines, be they on matters of concern to ethnic communities, religious communities, political parties or relating to cultural events. We do not want a society in which there are only a very few sources of information, ideas and activities, and most of those overseas controlled. We do want in Australia an independent cultural life, an independent, strong democratic intellectual life and tradition. If we want those things, we should not place financial obstacles in the way of people's access to knowledge, or in the way of those who are in the business of providing such diversity of information and cultural activities through publishing and other means. For that particular reason, as well as for all the other reasons that my colleagues will present to the Senate during the course of this debate, I express the strongest possible opposition to the sales tax Bills, and in particular their effects on books, magazines and publishing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a senator elected by the people of Queensland, and one who wishes to represent their best interests, I must say that I am not very happy at the proposed increases in sales tax contained in these Bills. However, I feel that the Australian Labor Party is hypocritical in setting itself up in a self-righteous way to complain about sales tax. Let nobody imagine that a Labor or socialist government would be a source of lower taxes. In one year, Mr Whitlam increased the take from personal income tax by 40 per cent. The platform of the Australian Labor Party includes the re-introduction of death duties, capital gains tax and wealth tax-and no doubt, as we heard in Question Time today, also a resource rental tax. If one sells a home and makes a profit, that profit falls under the capital gains tax. In regard to a wealth tax, the value on one's property is assessed and, as it appreciates in value, one pays a certain percentage of tax. That is similar to the tax imposed in Sweden. Indeed, it is a frightening tax and I am sure that if Labor came to power it would increase taxes, certainly not lower them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is probably the first time in almost a decade that a Federal Government has shown the country something akin to a balanced Budget. It is quite an enviable example of tight, even austere housekeeping in undeniably tight times and in that respect is to be commended. Another matter for commendation is that this Government has reduced income tax from a seven-tiered to a three-tiered system. Over the years, as incomes have increased, this has no doubt meant quite a saving in tax. However, I do question the means by which our Government is achieving a balanced Budget. The increases in sales tax will lead in this country to a greater, and in many cases unbearable, burden of taxes on Australians now and in the future. Doubtless the Government is building up its surplus so that income tax cuts can be offered, probably next year. In what I believe is a wrong means of obtaining a surplus, the Government is burdening consumers with the task of providing an additional $553m through sales tax in the remainder of 1981-82, and $892m in 1982-83. What is even more disturbing is that the hoped-for income tax cuts may be mythical because total Federal taxes will not fall. We will all be paying the same amount but in a different mix of higher indirect taxes to offset lower direct taxes. The Commonwealth Government will probably then tell the States: 'What a pity that income tax has been reduced and your share along with it'. The Government will tell the States that if they want the revenue for their schools, roads, hospitals and other essential community works, they will have to impose their own income tax. That means that we will have additional income tax imposed on us at the State level. That, in my opinion, is not honest. </PARA>
<PARA> We have been promised tax reform by every government since that of Sir Robert Menzies. What we see is inflation pushing Australians of all income levels into higher and higher tax brackets. We see Governments, both Labor and non-Labor, obsessed with bigger and better government spending, more and more bureaucracy and more regulation. Unfortunately, we see less and less incentive for private enterprise and worker alike to be more productive. Why bother when the Federal Treasurer(Mr Howard) simply steps in and confiscates the fruits of one's labour. </PARA>
<PARA> We now see this further tax impost of 2 1/2 per cent, and in many cases 17 1/2 per cent, putting further pressures on low income families, reducing their buying power and crippling small businesses throughout the country. One need only look at the explanatory notes to see how many items will now be subject to sales tax at varying rates from 2 1/2 per cent to 30 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> I am well aware that family allowances are to be raised by increasing by 50 per cent the rates of assistance for the third and subsequent children; also that assistance to children in institutions is to be increased. However, in my opinion, it is really a case of giving with one hand to the few and taking with the other from the many. I believe that every family, regardless of the number of its children, deserve and is entitled to the family allowance. I have said, and still say, that a mother who stays at home with her family should be given a realistic tax allowance and also receive a tax rebate for each child. Despite the Treasurer's assurances, via television, current affairs programs and the like, that he is aware of the difficulties facing Australian families today, his wife admitted that he really has no idea at all, and I am inclined to agree with his wife. </PARA>
<PARA> I wonder whether the Government realises the responsibility and cost involved in parenthood for the average Australian family. Society demands that parents accept the financial and emotional responsibilities of parenthood and pay the costs, yet governments continue to make those parental responsibilities harder and harder to meet. In many cases parents simply cannot cope. Mr Deputy President, I put it to you and to honourable senators that these increases mean that further pressures will be placed on our already over-burdened social security system. The 2 1/2 per cent increase in sales tax brought down by the Treasurer in his Budget has probably been the last straw for many people who want to set up home and for families who simply want to keep house. Recent interest rate hikes dealt a heavy blow to many Australian households. In fact, a letter I received from Forest Products Marketing Pty Ltd states:</PARA>
<PARA> We are writing to voice our utter dismay at the Federal Government's Budget as it affects our industry. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the building industry. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the 2.5 per cent Sales Tax on building material, home buyers will have to save at least an additional $500 to enable the purchase of a modest new home. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA>Not only should the Government be removing the application of a 2.5 per cent Sales Tax on building material, it should take progressive measures. For example, a 4 per cent subsidy on interest rates would assist in the order of 20,000 Australian families to purchase a home at a cost of $20 million in the first year. </PARA>
<PARA>I feel that it would be a very good idea if the Treasurer gave consideration to a tax deduction for interest payments on a person's first home. A news release by the Master Builders' Federation was headed:</PARA>
<PARA> NO TO HOME SEEKERS' TAX</PARA>
<PARA>The Federation feels that it was not justified and would impose further burdens on those less able to afford home ownership. It maintains that the increased costs of the tax itself and of the administrative burden it will impose will have to be built into the final price. The news release continued:</PARA>
<PARA> It must result in a further fall in the number of houses built. </PARA>
<PARA> It will increase the cost of houses, hospitals, schools as the increased costs cannot be absorbed and will have to be passed on to consumers. </PARA>
<PARA>Now, with less disposable income and with the higher interest rates, the added burden of sales tax on essential day-to-day items like household appliances, building materials, soft furnishings, clothing, footwear and manchester, to name but a few, will really affect the family, particularly the low income earners. I actually got a letter from the Queensland Sugar Board which states that the Board feels the sales tax increase will harm the sugar industry. I am sure all honourable senators will know, as I do, the important part that the sugar industry plays not only in Queensland but also right throughout Australia. It plays a real part in maintaining Australia's overseas credit rating. The Board feels the sugar industry will be affected because of the increased sales tax on soft drinks and confectionary. Even more alarming and not as well publicised is the 17 1/2 per cent tax now imposed on items which previously were exempt. </PARA>
<PARA> One thing I was very amazed about was the fact that sales tax is to be levied on newsletters issued by charitable and social organisations as a result of the proposed changes. I suppose that is why members of parliament are receiving quite a lot of mail from clubs and organisations throughout Australia such as Lions and Apex complaining very much about the sales tax. I certainly feel the tax in this regard is not necessary. Like the previous speaker, Senator Ryan, I also have had many letters regarding the imposition of sales tax on books. </PARA>
<PARA> The sales tax will apply to items such as manufactured pet foods. It will be levied at a rate of 17 1/2 per cent. I am sure that all honourable senators will agree that many pensioners and elderly folk keep pets. Even I have a couple of dogs at home that I have to feed. I know exactly what the increased price for manufactured pet foods will mean. The changes to the sales tax provisions also apply to the motor vehicles used in the mining and grain industries. Many people in Queensland will be affected by these changes. The tax will also apply to motor vehicle seat belts and household insecticides. It is disappointing that a government, of which I am a part, has increased the burden of the financially disadvantaged Australian. </PARA>
<PARA> I read a report on the comments of the President of the Australian Chamber of Commerce in which he drew attention to the fact that sales tax receipts would rise by a massive 38.6 per cent at the same time as receipts from personal income taxes would rise by 18.9 per cent. Mr Wills was reported to have said that the Government had earlier stated that it would not proceed with a broad based indirect tax because of its inflationary consequences. He said that in the present Budget it had opted for a broad based tax with acknowledged inflationary consequences but without the benefit of any trade-off in the form of reduced personal income taxation. He said the Government merely stated that it had enhanced the potential for further personal income tax relief in future years. At least that is something for which we can be very grateful. The Emerald Chamber of Commerce wrote to me and said that its members felt that the sales tax would do little to stay inflation and in fact it would have the reverse effect. The Chamber considered that much of the sales tax on items was unjust. It said that sales tax was introduced as a revenue raiser for war purposes and has never been lifted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Actually, as I said at the beginning of my speech, it is all very well for Labor supporters to talk about opposing sales tax because the Labor Party puts on higher and higher taxes all the time; that is obvious. I mentioned that when Mr Whitlam was in power in one year the increased take from personal income tax was 40 per cent. So, I do not think Senator Gietzelt should interject in that way. In the Senate yesterday the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) stated that these sales tax Bills were part of the Budget before the Senate. Through them the Government is seeking to raise additional Budget revenue. I acknowledge this, and as a supporter of the Government of course it is necessary for me to support it. But I am not at all happy with the additional sales tax on so many items many of which affect the one income family, families in the lower income groups and the pensioners. I hope that the Government and the Treasurer will take another look at clauses of the sales tax Bills to ascertain whether it is possible to amend them in some way and perhaps to exclude from sales tax the basic family needs such as footwear and clothing and particularly building materials.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I was previously debating the Budget Papers for 1981-82 I was making the point that we were faced with a mean and miserable Budget; we were faced with a Budget that was contemptible to the extent that it was transferring wealth from the poor to the wealthy and that it was showing a callous disregard for the rights of the ordinary people in our community. Since that time we have been inundated, as Senator Bjelke-Petersen has said, with a great number of protests from a great variety of people in our community who are beginning to see how they will be affected by the economic considerations of this Budget. I was making reference to the complete dishonesty of this Government which has broken a great number of other promises in respect of economic relief for the Australian people. I was drawing attention to the comments that were being made in the daily newspapers about the double talk of the Treasurer, Mr Howard, and the Prime Minister, Mr Fraser. I was dealing with the effects that the Government's Budget would have upon consumers. I said we should therefore ask Mr Howard how he sees the householder being affected by the sales tax proposals and by the increased revenue resulting from the great increase in the pay-as-you-earn taxation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Householders, of course, will be paying out a good deal more for a wide variety of things which now are to attract a new sales tax rate. Pet food, as has been said, will cost an extra $1 a week. Clothing prices will rise. The cost of shoes will rise. The price of books, newspapers and magazines will rise. Many of those people who work in the publishing and associated industries will be forced out of work in the rush to save costs, as has been suggested by one of our main publishing organisations. Despite the claim that food costs will not rise they cannot possibly escape the flow on of associated rises as a result of this Budget, particularly the new 2 1/2 per cent sales tax on packaging and wrapping materials. Home owners and builders will be stung by the increased cost of building materials. These increases alone will add at least $700 to the price of an average new home, according to the New South Wales Master Builders Association. The cost of modestly furnishing such a home will rise by another $300. All this on top of the interest rate hikes will soon make home buying an impossibility for more and more Australians. That is the strategy of this Budget-to make it impossible for the average person to maintain his current standard of living. </PARA>
<PARA> According to the latest survey conducted by the Australian Bureau of Statistics into household expenditure, total household expenditure on food averaged 19.5 per cent. Housing costs averaged 13.7 per cent; household equipment, 10 per cent; clothing and footwear, 8.3 per cent and; recreation and education, 9.2 per cent. In addition, families on the poorer end of the income scale pay out a greater percentage of their income on essential items, such as food and housing, than their more wealthy counterparts. Furthermore, these poorer households more often than not spend more per week on basic household items from their total weekly income. These figures underline the fact that indirect taxes, such as those contained in this Budget, are inequitable, hitting those who can least afford to meet such increases. That is the bottom line for this Government. I inform Senator Bjelke-Petersen that the inequity of the taxation strategy of this Government is further underlined by the fact that between 1975-76-the last Labor Budget-and the 1981-82 Budget indirect taxation as a proportion of total tax revenue has risen from 28.9 per cent to 30.3 per cent, an increase of 1.4 per cent. In the same period pay-as-you-earn tax as a proportion of total tax revenue will rise by nearly 4 per cent-from 41.7 per cent to 45.1 per cent. That is the highest level of PAYE taxation in Australia's history. While this is coming out of the pockets of ordinary people, company income tax as a proportion of total revenue will fall by 1.4 per cent. At the same time the Treasury notes that the profit share of the economy is increasing. In fact, since 1974-75 the profit share of gross domestic product has increased by more than one percentage point while the wages share has come down by 3 per cent. This indicates that living standards have been reduced and will be further reduced, as has been said by honourable senators in this debate, as a result of the decisions of this Budget. There is no doubt, therefore, that the rich and powerful friends and backers of the Government are gaining in this redistribution of wealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The redistribution is evident also in the ruthless cutbacks in the public sector, the sector which services ordinary people with their daily needs, such as health, housing, welfare, and urban and regional development. All of these areas have been slashed considerably under the Liberal-National Country Party Government over the years and once again in this Budget. They have been reduced almost to a small proportion of Government outlays. Time will not permit me to mention many of these cuts into the social wage, but they underline again the philosophy of redistribution advancing the cause of the wealthy whilst leaving the average individual to fend for himself. The attitude of this Government to the health needs of the community is one of the blatant examples which I would like to emphasise. Total health spending for 1981-82 is to increase by just below the expected rate of inflation. I suggest that this is an effective cut. But this bland figure does not reveal the real extent of the confidence trick being played. I ask honourable senators to consider the extra $2 to $11 a week that most families are being forced to pay to private health funds as a result of the most recent changes to the health insurance system, the increased charges that the sick will face for medical services in hospitals and by general practitioners, and the increased pharmaceutical costs. It will cost an extra 45c to have a prescription dispensed. All this was provided for in this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us consider also the fact that, in shifting specific health grants to the States from the health heading to general revenue grants, these grants will show an actual cut of 19.7 per cent, forcing additional burdens upon the States. The States will be forced to raise health charges to users of the facilities. Again that indicates how the social wage is being affected. In plain terms this means that health costs will now be passed on to the States in such a way that they will have to raise their own revenue, their own charges, to provide health services. This government has set up a system whereby community health is no longer a community responsibility. The user-more often the poor, the sick and the disadvantaged-will pay for himself or herself. There we have the Fraser philosophy in a nutshell. It is a case of cut the expenditure, palm off the responsibilities to the States, let individuals fend for themselves, forget compassion, ignore social needs and hang the consequences. That is evident in every area of the public sector as provided for in this Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent times Opposition members and those involved in community welfare work have spoken about the horrendous decision made by Mr Howard in this Budget to abolish the Community Youth Support Scheme and about the neglect that his Government is showing for the unemployed. Let me say that a number of measures have been introduced in the Budget that will not fail to produce further unemployment in this country. The cost increases forced by the tax increases have already been mentioned. The resources investment boom is not job productive. The Minister for Trade and Resources, Mr Anthony, has said that. The further dampening of the public sector will mean that no new jobs will be available in the Public Service and government sectors. But less than zero is proposed by this Government to cope with this problem. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not need to invoke the situation which currently exists in the United Kingdom to appreciate the devastating social effects that mass employment has upon communities. We need only to look at our back yard, our own cities, to see the problems of alienation, growing anti-social attitudes and increasing cynicism amongst our unemployed young people who are left on their own without the assistance which CYSS provided. The Community Youth Support Scheme provided one small element of assistance for unemployed young people. But Mr Howard callously announced the end of this scheme with a quick turn of phrase and a stroke of the pen on Budget night. Under the heading of 'Social Security Programs', unemployment relief was dropped in this Budget by a staggering 65 per cent. The Government has claimed-honourable senators have said this in the debate on the Community Youth Support Scheme which was held a couple of weeks ago-that money is being spent on retraining schemes. The Government has said that for the future these education and training schemes are to be given a higher priority than supportive activities. This sounds fine until one realises that much of this money goes on handouts to employers predominantly to employ labour for short terms and at lower costs. The Government may be cutting its costs but it is hardly providing a real solution to the unemployment crisis. </PARA>
<PARA> The long term solution to the problems of unemployment can come only with the development of a strong, diverse Australian-based manufacturing service sector and export economy. Immediately we need relief and job creation schemes to cope with the present realities of 400,000 people being unemployed. This Budget does not seek to provide either of those alternatives. Of course, we are aware that in real terms this Government has passed still further on to the States the responsibility of providing some relief in the various areas of the public sector. We have only to look at what has been said. The New South Wales Premier has made it clear that he regards the Budget as disastrous. South Australia's Liberal Premier, Mr Tonkin, accused the Government of economic double standards. The Queensland Premier, Mr Bjelke-Petersen, called it a jumble sale operation and predicted that it could bring down the Fraser Government. The Victorian Minister of Housing, Mr Kennett, said plainly: 'I think the Federal Government is going to have to be judged very harshly indeed'. The Minister for Employment and Training in that State, Mr Dixon, said that his Government was being forced to pick up the social costs of Federal economic policies. So the Liberal-National Country Party Government is condemned out of the mouth of its own people in its own States. </PARA>
<PARA> As we are aware, in respect of housing and health, this Government has failed dismally to provide any incentive for the States. This Government has failed to provide any financial encouragement for the States to increase their funds for the development of a decent health system or scheme or for a picking up of public and welfare housing. Consequently, one has to say that this Budget is no longer to be seen in the context of providing relief to the citizens of this country. To the contrary, it will worsen the economic outlook for each and every citizen in our country. It is no wonder, therefore, that the opinion polls show this Government's public support to be at its lowest ebb ever. In recent weeks, two public opinion polls have shown that this Government would receive less than one vote in three-less than 33 per cent of the Australian people have any faith in the credibility of this Government. Honourable senators must be aware, as are all of us on this side of the chamber, that various groups in the Australian community-academics and students at the universities, people in the education system, people in the health system, the unemployed and people in the social welfare areas-are protesting in one way or another, as indeed are the people who are affected by the sales tax increases that have been referred to in this debate. Included are those involved in manufacturing soft drinks, in publishing organisations, master builders, home owners and the Housing Industry Association. They have all made stridently critical statements about this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, it is on the basis of this Government's failure to accept its responsibility to provide economic direction for this country that this Budget will seem to be, as it is, pursuing a path that will depress further the living standards of the Australian people. We make no apology for the fact that we will oppose by every means available to us the sales tax propositions, because they will affect the consumer movement and the average citizen in our society. We will oppose also the Budget because we believe it will bring ruin to our citizens, to the small business sector, to the farmers and to the various other groups in our community which have expressed dismay and dissatisfaction with the 1981-82 Budget of the Fraser-Howard-Anthony Administration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Thank you, Mr President. I rise with pride but yet some trepidation to address the Senate for the first time. Pride-I am pleased to be here as a Liberal elected by the people of South Australia. Trepidation-I am taking the place of two South Australian Liberals who contributed so much to this place for many years. Sir Condor Laucke has set a tremendous example to follow. I particularly recognise his humility, the high standard of personal integrity he maintained and his sense of fair play. Gordon Davidson likewise brought to the Senate a commitment of service to the public and a deep concern for people. They are qualities that the community has a right to expect of its elected representatives and to be remembered for such qualities is, I believe, high praise. But apart from their personal qualities, they both sought to enhance the high standards of the Senate; in the case of Sir Condor particularly through his role as President and in the case of Gordon Davidson, through his commitment to what can be achieved through the Senate committee system. If I could emulate both the personal qualities they brought as well as their commitment and contribution to the standing of this chamber I would be pleased.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr President, with the retirement of Sir Condor the Senate lost a highly regarded President. I am pleased to see him succeeded by another South Australian of not dissimilar qualities, and I congratulate you, Mr President, upon your appointment. </PARA>
<PARA> I am speaking to the Budget and I want to concentrate on the mix and levels of particular taxes that are being utilised to raise necessary Government revenue. I understand, however, that I have on this occasion certain liberties, and for a few minutes I wish to make reference to the State I represent. In an article appearing in the Australian of 22 August 1981, columnist Max Harris claimed:</PARA>
<PARA> South Australia is probably more politically volatile than any other State, because it is dying. The process is inevitable for obvious geographic and demographic reasons. </PARA>
<PARA> That, Mr President, is incorrect. It is true that South Australia is not blessed with abundant surface water. It has, however, vast and largely untapped underground resevoirs. It is true that it is located away from its major markets. However, with modern transport the nation is shrinking. An international airport and completion of the Stuart Highway will dramatically open new outlets. It was thought that it was poorly served with mineral resources. What is now apparent is rather that their discovery has been slow. Roxby Downs presents a potential as one of the world's great mines and our supplies of liquid and gaseous hydrocarbons are appearing more impressive practically by the day. It is true that times are currently difficult for South Australia. It has this century developed an industrial base in white goods and vehicle manufacture, employment within which has been severely hit by automation and the technological revolution. Government support through tax and other incentives has been largely lost and the protectionist policies, upon which the industry was established and its survival arguably depends, are now challenged. But with the Government it now has, which is both enthusiastic and positive, and given time and patience of the Federal Government and the other States, South Australia will find new directions, readjust and expand. </PARA>
<PARA> It was stated by Charles Fenner in a history produced by the Royal Geographical Society for the South Australian centenary nearly 50 years ago:</PARA>
<PARA> There is probably much justice in the claim that the people attracted to South Australia by the Wakefield scheme of colonisation were an unusual and peculiar people, who had chosen to carry out a novel experiment in a remote land. </PARA>
<PARA>That, I think, is true today. We are an unusual and peculiar people who have overcome adversity before and will do so again. Look briefly at our early history as the most non-conformist and radical of the Australian colonies. We were the first State to introduce a motion for the ballot. Open voting was however causing some trauma. Take for example the election for the seat of West Adelaide in 1855 when Forster opposed Fisher. A fight took place in the booth soon after it was opened. Sixty police were requisitioned to keep order. When, from a hotel balcony, Forster was declared elected, Fisher supporters rushed forward, pulled down the Forster flags and descended on the crowd with sticks, stones and chairlegs. Down went the foot police before the attack. The Commissioner of Police thereupon threw in his mounted men, who as was reported in the Register of 21 September 1855:</PARA>
<PARA> Galloped with drawn swords into the thickest of the fight, and the admirable and determined movements of this body had a very salutary effect upon the infuriated partisans, several of whom were captured. </PARA>
<PARA>It cannot be said that we do not take our politics seriously! But the most liberal of the first constitutions led the colonies also with manhood suffrage, single voting and triennial parliaments. There followed the first full adult suffrage for the lower House and the extension of the right to vote to properly qualified women for the Legislative Council, notwithstanding that shocked legislators contemplated that the proposal would disrupt marriages and society by unsettling women from their place in the home. </PARA>
<PARA> Earlier, the first elective Legislative Council had abolished State aid to religious bodies-a debate which indirectly has never ended. Then came the great experiment of the Torrens land system. It was implemented, although leading legal figures warned of its impracticability, which they are still doing in some places. The reformer, Charles Cameron Kingston, sponsored the first compulsory arbitration legislation of any colony, which was later to become a model for this Commonwealth. He recognised that strikes did not settle disputes, only prolonged them, that the public had a right to be protected and that the victors in an industrial conflict did not necessarily have right on their side. The answer was that the matter should go to a court for decision, just like any other civil dispute. Now this unique industrial system is under challenge. Kingston was of course a great character. Before becoming Premier and subsequently a Minister in the first national Parliament, it is reported that he had been arrested in Victoria Square when, armed with a pistol, he proposed to fight a duel with Legislative Councillor, Richard Chaffey Baker, who later became the first President of the Senate. Both were instrumental in the strong support given by South Australia to the new Federal Parliament, which it was hoped would solve many problems such as control over the River Murray, and for which we are still waiting. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, might I remind the Senate that in 1887 we saw the wisdom of paying salaries to back bench members of parliament. Ministers had of course earlier been paid. Mr President, we were the most non-conformist and radical of the Australian colonies and in that heritage Mr Harris will find a determination which will again lift South Australia to among the forefront of Australian States. But we share with all Australians an interest in our taxation system upon which, as I indicated, I wish to speak briefly. It was in 1884 that South Australian Legislative Councillors had to yield to a direct tax on the unimproved value of real estate, imposed because urban reformers and discontented farmers believed, and I quote from the South Australian parliamentary debates, 1883 page 1439:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . that owners of property and wealthy men had escaped taxation long enough. </PARA>
<PARA>It may be argued that such is still the case. Certainly it is a debate which has been rekindled by the Budget decision to broaden the sales tax base. It is generally difficult to find academics in agreement. But in the area of the Australian taxation system there is near unanimity that reform is long overdue. This is not principally a debate on the lowering or increasing or real taxation which is a different subject. Tax reform is concerned with the rearrangement and redistribution of taxes to achieve stated policy objectives. Thus the role of the tax reformer, given the objectives to be achieved, relates primarily to the critical assessment of the correct mix of taxation. It is a field in which there is always inertia against change. The mass of letters of protest being received by honourable senators in relation to the extended sales tax bears witness to this fact. Any new tax will always act to someone's detriment. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus taxation reform requires a certain courage on the part of government, a reassessment of objectives and a re-examination of the correct tax mix to meet those objectives. </PARA>
<PARA>The report of the Asprey Taxation Review Committee brought down in 1975 saw equity, simplicity and efficiency as the primary objectives of any worthwhile tax system, and this is rarely challenged. By equity it meant not only horizontal equity, that is, that the person in the same situation should be equally treated, but also vertical equity: Those who are more favourably placed should be required to pay more. Both concepts reflect the principle of ability to pay. Vertical equity, however, encompasses the more controversial subject of the extent to which the taxation vehicle should be used to control or limit inequality. At a time when the gap between the 'haves' and the 'have-nots' of our society appears to be widening this objective and the social, political and ethical judgments for which it calls may well be assuming a new importance. </PARA>
<PARA> It is stated that simplicity also points to a complex of ideas. However, if the assessor and the assessed can each establish with certainty what is due in tax, one canon of simplicity will be attained. Efficiency was explained to require, on a narrow plane, that the tax dollar suffers from minimal waste in its transfer from the private sector to the public sector. On a broader plane, taxation considerations should not interfere with the otherwise most efficient economic decisions. Asprey recognised also that for the purpose of successful economic management a taxation system needs to be flexible enough to change and vary according to economic circumstances. A proper tax mix demands the inclusion of some taxes which can be increased or decreased with a minimum of administrative difficulty while at the same time having the potential to exert as large an impact on economic activity as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> On our side of politics where we see the disadvantaged best served by a strong and growing economy, we would accept also that the objective of economic growth should be pursued through the instrument of taxation policy. This objective may call for lower rates but not necessarily so. A more equitable, efficient and simple taxation mix may provide as much encouragement to increased levels of saving and investment as a general tax cut. How does our taxation system meet those objectives? The consensus of the major investigations and of the academics is to argue that we have fared poorly. It can be argued that our taxation system is inequitable, complex and inefficient and does not have sufficient flexibility. In many ways it discourages economic growth. Professor Russell Mathews of the Australian National University states that the taxation system 'has been thoroughly discredited as a policy instrument for achieving the redistribution of wealth'. It is inequitable in that it taxes some wealth increments and not others. It taxes income to the extent that it increases wealth but not capital gains or windfall gains and results in a heavy bias towards the taxation of income. In 1978, 43.7 per cent of our total tax revenue was raised through personal income tax compared with an Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average of 38.5 per cent. Thus those whose wealth is increased by capital gains rather than by income do not share in the taxation burden. No other highly developed country has our almost complete absence from some form of taxation of capital gains, net wealth taxes or death duties. </PARA>
<PARA> The taxation system is inequitable in that a taxation of income has largely become a taxation of wages and salaries. Those whose income has been derived from property or business have been afforded opportunities for avoidance through income splitting and the like not available to the recipients of wages and salaries. Thus in the year 1980-81 net pay-as-you-earn instalment payments represented 80.49 per cent of the total income tax on individuals. A more vivid example was given by Professor Mathews in an address to the Australian Institute of Political Science in January 1980 when he pointed out that, although the proportion of wages and salary incomes to total household income had remained roughly constant at two-thirds over the previous 15 years, the share of the taxation burden had increased from the original two-thirds to approximately four-fifths. Thus it can be argued that some $2,715m would appear to have been lost through schemes of avoidance and evasion in the year 1978-79 alone. </PARA>
<PARA> The taxation system is inequitable when, in the absence of tax indexation, inflation alone and not any increase in real income lifts taxpayers into a higher tax bracket. No one could argue that the system is not complicated. When the Honourable W. B. Rounsevell introduced the 1884 taxation Bill in South Australia he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill has been so drafted that honourable members who were not of a legal turn of mind would be able to clearly understand it. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators could reflect upon recent tax avoidance legislation and ask how such amendments would stand the test of simplicity. On the criteria of efficiency the system again fares poorly. Income tax tends to discourage growth and company income tax discriminates between companies and other business vehicles such as partnerships and trusts. When considering the object of flexibility, the lack of a broad based consumption tax and the continuing emphasis on personal income tax have considerably limited the flexibility open to government. As was stated by Professor Groenewegen, Professor of Economics at the University of Sydney, in a Taxation Institute of Australia research and education trust newsletter in June of this year:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . there was so much dissatisfaction with many aspects of the current tax system, and especially with its increasing reliance on the taxation of wages and salaries, that further increases in that reliance will just not produce the required revenue to meet government expenditure needs of the 1980's on even modest growth forecasts of that expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA>The failure of any attempt at redistribution of wealth is seen in the abolition of death duties on the one hand and the regressive nature of petrol taxes and excise taxes on such items as beer and tobacco on the other hand. Such taxes hit the not so well off to a greater extent than the wealthy. Added to a progressive income tax rate which bears little relationship to the nominal progression, Professor Mathews has in fact gone so far as to assert:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . it is plausible to argue that the taxation system has become a major instrument for redistributing incomes and wealth in favour of the rich. </PARA>
<PARA> On the objective of economic growth one need look only at the double taxation of dividends and earnings which is an obvious disincentive for savings and investment. The failure to meet reasonable objectives derives from the hotchpotch way in which the system has developed. It has been a system of grafting new on to old, resolving short term problems with long term amendments. It has not developed as a deliberately conceived and structured system. In fact, as the Asprey report states, the word 'system' is a euphemism when discussing the Australian taxation structure. </PARA>
<PARA> If the case for tax reform has been made out, how should the tax mix be altered? To find the answer it is unnecessary to undertake further major investigations. Works and reports on the subject abound. In fact, it is worth noting that the significant United Kingdom reforms of 1971 did not follow a major report. Reforms were announced, discussion papers were published and public debate followed. Overseas reports of recent times have tended to approach reform from a clean slate and, therefore, offer more radical alternatives. The Meade Committee of the United Kingdom which reported in 1978 favoured transforming the personal income tax into a personal expenditure tax, arguing that it was simpler, more equitable and more neutral to tax people on what they take out of the common pool rather than what they put in. This would be accompanied by a flow of funds revenue base for corporate taxation, a progressive wealth tax and major changes in the social security system. The United States Treasury 'Blueprints for Basic Tax Reform' study of 1977 looked at a comprehensive income tax which would integrate corporate and personal income taxes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian studies have rather been concerned with making the existing system work more effectively. The Asprey report recommendations included a simplified personal income tax, a tax on capital gains as an increment of wealth to improve equity, and a more neutral broad based value added tax in lieu of the narrow based sales tax. The Mathews Committee of Inquiry into Inflation and Taxation also of 1975 called for tax indexation and valuation of stock on a current cost basis. Together, they made up a package for conservative, although worthwhile, reform. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has tended to follow the latter path. Edmund Burke said:</PARA>
<PARA> All virtue which is impracticable is spurious. </PARA>
<PARA>In tax reform the ideal may not be possible. Virtue which is practical should be admired. Thus it is necessary to view reform in a spirit of realism and with an acceptance of necessary political restraints. Clearly in that spirit, the Government has reduced the progressive steps in income tax, making a contribution to the objectives of simplicity and economic growth. In addition the tax threshold has been lifted and the spouse rebate increased thereby contributing to equity. Similarly the desire for greater equity has led the Government to provide the most comprehensive avoidance and evasion legislation of any government, I believe, in Australian history. Finally the Government has by this Budget extended the narrow sales tax into a more broad based consumption tax, although without the neutrality or flexibility of a value added tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government should be given credit for the steps it has taken but the major inequities remain. The bias against the taxation of income remains, high marginal rates still act as a disincentive to economic growth as does double taxation on dividends and earnings to investment. Wage and salary income earners are still prejudiced as against business and property income earners, inflation is again drawing taxpayers into higher tax brackets. These inequities, yet to be overcome by governments of either persuasion, call for action. </PARA>
<PARA> Options abound within the more moderate package. We cannot forever remain the only highly developed nation without some form of capital or equivalent taxation at the Federal level. Linear income tax being advocated by some academics can combine vertical equity with incentive. A switch from a wholesale sales tax to a retail tax or value added tax remains available. </PARA>
<PARA> As was found by the Asprey committee, the exact mix of a restructured taxation system requires a value judgment by the Government as to the best balance of objectives. Attempts at taxation reform in Australia have generally occurred at times of economic difficulty. Distortions in the economy have brought changes in the taxation system in the hope of solving particular problems. Yet the overall deficiency of the system has remained. But now in the early 1980s we have a strong and growing economy with prospects that Australia will be a growth leader of the industrialised world during the next 10 years. What better time is there for us to grasp the nettle and restructure the taxation system to a fairer and more equitable basis. I thank honourable senators for their courtesy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr President. It is with both pleasure and a certain degree of excitement that I make my first speech in the Senate. The pleasure comes from standing here with colleagues as a member of the Australian Labor Party, the only party which represents truly the hopes and aspirations of the Australian people. The excitement comes from being here at what is a watershed for the conservative forces in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australians are presently watching the last of three conservative governments, and it is a government in its death throes. It has conned the Australian electorate with a succession of three-card tricks for long enough. Already the public is seeing that indeed the emperor has no clothes. The sight of this particular emperor without his clothes is not a pretty one. It is a sight which, at the next election, the public will pronounce as extremely obscene. So it is perhaps timely to ask a question, and that question is: How will history judge these three conservative governments? When the dust from the present settles, how will the historical profile of the last six years appear? Who will be the winners and who will be the losers?</PARA>
<PARA> In any political game there are winners and losers; of that there is no question. But what we have watched during the past six years of conservative oligarchy is a cold, calculated reduction in the number of winners and an equally deliberate and viciously cruel expansion in the number of losers. Nowhere was this fact exposed more blatantly than in a recent major series of articles in the Sydney Morning Herald. This series examined poverty in Australia and confronted its readers with depressing fact after depressing fact. One in seven Australians are struggling for survival, it said. And I would suggest that is a conservative figure. The Australian Council of Social Service adds up the real losers in our society and arrives at the figure of 1.9 million people living in poverty. I would suggest that on top of that figure there are close to another 1.5 million living so close to poverty that to them each day is also a depressing and demeaning struggle; a struggle just to live. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a disgrace, Mr President. It is a disgrace to all those who have served as members of the three conservative governments which are responsible for this social tragedy. But it is this type of Australia which has been created by this succession of conservative governments. This is how they will be judged by history. This is how the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) will be judged by history. He will be recorded as the man who, when rejected as Prime Minister, left the country with more than two million of his fellow country people living in poverty. He will be remembered as the man who created two Australias and shattered our egalitarian image by entrenching wealth on the one hand and poverty on the other. </PARA>
<PARA> This Prime Minister has presided over a theatre of deception. He went to the people three times and conned them into believing he was going to maintain the Australian way of life. He did not. He presided over the destruction of the traditional way of Australian life, and he did it by deliberate policy initiatives</PARA>
<PARA> These policies ensured that unemployment would become an entrenched part of the Australian way of life. The official figures show that there are about 410,000 Australians unemployed. On top of that there are the hidden unemployed-those people who, for one reason or another, have either not registered as unemployed or have simply dropped out of the work force. Only last week the Australian Bureau of Statistics, estimated this number to be 607,900. That means that there are more than one million Australians unemployed. It is this unemployment figure which will hang heavily around the necks of the members and senators sitting on the conservative benches. That is one way in which the conservative governments have changed the Australian way of life. </PARA>
<PARA> Before moving on to the next example of how these people have changed society, I am reminded of a suggestion I once saw for a solution to unemployment. Mr Ted Wheelwright, a Sydney economist, suggested a new index for unemployment. He said that every time unemployment rose by one percentage point, five Treasury staff should be sacked, starting from the top down. I think such a plan would soon put a halt to the monetarist voodoo worship which is practised in that institution. </PARA>
<PARA> So, to the next example of how the conservatives have changed society. The policy of keeping interest rates high has perhaps done more than anything else to alter the way Australians approach life. It has demolished the great Australian dream of owning a home. The Housing Industry Association, hardly a radical body, estimates that every time interest rates rise by point five of one per cent in the home loan sector, 4,000 Australians are excluded from the housing market. Therefore in the past 2 1/2 years at least 24,000 Australians have been excluded from the home buying market. That is another measure of how history will judge this conservative Government. It was the Government which shattered the Australian dream of home ownership for thousands of Australians in just 2 1/2 years. </PARA>
<PARA> By destroying for many the basic aspirations which lead to a full life, the conservatives have re-shaped the social profile of this country. Using the approaches of financial oppression, through a cruel reduction in real wages and the social wage and an abdication of funding responsibilities by the Commonwealth, these governments have hit hard. These economic policies have meant that women are still denied an equal place in society. That in 1981 women still do not have real economic, social and political equality is an indictment of this Government. The same story can be told for the other socially and culturally impoverished: The migrants, those in the ethnic minorities, the Aboriginals, and the poor, and especially the children of the poor. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth and final measure historians will use in judgment of this Government is the one with perhaps the most far reaching ramifications. This is the question of foreign investment and the intrusion of transnational corporations into the Australian economy. Where is the money going? We are told by the puppets on the conservative benches that it is funding the resources 'boom'. But now economists and business leaders say either that the boom has boomed or that it did not exist at all. They say that the economy is running out of steam and that from here on it is downhill. But the conservatives cannot cope with serious economic analysis. This confusion about whether the boom has boomed, or even whether there was a boom to boom about, is causing great problems in the Government parties. </PARA>
<PARA> In January of this year, in his New Year address, the Prime Minister said that we were in an 'energy and resources rush'. During last October's election campaign, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) said: 'Australia's coming resources boom could turn into a bust under a Hayden Labor government'. It has turned into a bust but it has done so under another Liberal-National Country Party Government. But this confusion about when is a boom not a boom continues. In the Budget Speech the Treasurer (Mr Howard), a man who one would hope would know a boom when he saw one, said that the 'resources investment boom' was 'proceeding apace'. But now the Acting Prime Minister, as he is at the moment, tells us that he does not like the word 'boom'; it is 'an unfortunate term'. So in just a few weeks we have a boom which is moving apace, which is a mirage and which the Acting Prime Minister does not really like. But, despite this, the money keeps coming in at levels higher than those in the corresponding periods of last year. </PARA>
<PARA> Where is the money going? The record level of $6,500m worth of overseas capital which flowed into Australia in the last financial year did not go into any resource boom in any substantial way. A great deal of this money was hot money. It was here for short term speculation. It was here to buy up our internationally cheap real estate, urban and rural. It was here in anticipation of a revaluation of the Australian dollar. It was here, in short, to make a killing: A killing at the expense of the Australian people, their hopes, desires and aspirations. It was here at the expense of Australia's future, and that is the most damning pronouncement historians will make of these conservative governments. In just six years these governments have sold Australia's future to the big time amoral, international gamblers. All of this has done something quite horrible to Australians today. It has taken from our daily lives two vital ingredients for a full life which can make some kind of contribution to society. These are hope and imagination. What hope is there for the young people today with no job and no chance of owning a home and with the distinct possibility that, if they are lucky enough to have a job or a home, they will have a foreign boss and a foreign landlord? What room is there for imagination in today's Australia? There is none. People are being bludgeoned into a dull, grey, pedestrian life pre-determined by the economic thugs who are in collusion with this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> It is fair to ask now what lies behind this perversion of the Australian way of life. I believe we can only come to the conclusion that behind it all is the hand of the Prime Minister, a man born to riches and closeted by them ever since. He and his application of his party's conservative philosophies are the main forces behind this change to the Australian way of life. The Prime Minister parades on the international stage as the champion of monetarism or the trendier supply-sided economics. He has raised control of the money supply and its use as a panacea for all economic ills to the level of devil worship. Let us analyse this philosophy. If it were real monetarism, if it were the gospel according to the Chicago economists led by Milton Friedman, we would see the amount of money in the economy being reduced year by year. But that is not happening; it is going up. If it were real monetarism we would have seen inflation drop away to something quite small. We have not. It is again climbing. If it were real supply-sided economics, as practised by the Reagan Administration's resident guru, David Stockman, we would see tax cuts. We do not. We just see taxes rise year after year. If the Prime Minister were fair dinkum about boosting the supply side of the economy, we would see consumer spending leaping ahead. We do not. We just see real spending power reduced again and again. I would suggest that this Prime Minister has no economic theory. He is indeed an emperor without clothes in every sense. </PARA>
<PARA> Without a credible or workable economic policy, Australians have, for the past six years, been subjected to a series of economic gambles which have not paid off. They have not paid off and the Australian people are the ones who have had to cash in their chips. First we had tax indexation. Never has a government sold so much rhetoric on an issue and given so little in return. After being promised full tax indexation, Australians received half tax indexation and now we have the last few dribbles of a discounted form of half indexation. So, from promising full tax indexation, the Government has now done a 180-degree turn and instituted a secret inflation tax which will this year see pay-as-you-earn income tax rise about 80 per cent faster than incomes. Then we had the famous prices and incomes freeze. It must have seemed like a good idea at the time. But it was so ill-thought out and unplanned that it was soon denounced not only by the trade union movement but also by leaders of commerce, employer groups and most State governments. It very soon collapsed. </PARA>
<PARA> What of the tax cuts we are so often promised? All this talk has proven to be just that, because year after year taxes rise at a rate much faster than wages. As I said this year it is expected that taxes will rise about 80 per cent faster than wages. Every time this Government has announced a tax cut it is possible to prove that more income earners will be worse off than will benefit. Those who are worse off are the low income earners and the ones who really benefit are the rich, the masters of capital, those who are in fact represented in this Parliament by people like the Prime Minister and his Cabinet colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already mentioned interest rates and it is here that this Government has lain down and let itself be run over by the real manipulators of the economy-the transnational corporations. These corporations are the ones which, through their unbridled pumping of money into this country, have necessitated restrictive economic measures within Australia. Government inactivity, either by design or because it does now know what it is doing, has led it to make Australians pay for the profits from foreign investment-profits which go overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> This leads into another economic gamble which has not paid off for the Australian people; that is, the huge loans which have been necessary for resource development and the capital works needed to get it moving. I am not saying that resource development is a bad thing, but it is obvious that the way it has been handled by this Government has not helped the Australian economy. In fact, it has done the opposite. The way this inept Government has handled resource development has led to monetary target after monetary target being over-shot, and it has fed inflationary expectations by keeping interest rates much higher than inflation rates. In his book Exit Full Employment, Dr Barry Hughes say this of the 1977 prices-wages freeze:</PARA>
<PARA> It was a piece of political theatre that with the aid of illusionists the country mistook for serious economic policy. </PARA>
<PARA>I would suggest that Dr Hughes has hit the nail on the head. Indeed, his words can apply to the whole charade of economic policy which the Australian public has had to swallow for six years. They have now had enough and I am sure they will say so demonstrably at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA> What then is needed for Australia? I think this is obvious. What is needed is real democracy of, by and for the people. Democratic socialism as promised by the Australian Labor Party is Australia's only hope for survival in the 1980s. The Australian Labor Party stands for many things but I believe there are five basics which have been denied to the Australian people under these three conservative governments and which the Australian Labor Party alone can deliver. These are liberty, democracy, social equality, co-operation and reason. Put together these principles represent an expression of freedom and participation in society, something Australia merely glimpsed during the three years of the Whitlam Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The people of Australia are now realising just what benefits there were under the Whitlam Labor Government. If Medibank had continued we would not now be in this terrible mess about health insurance which is hurting those least able to pay. If spending on housing had not been cut back so savagely we would not now have the crisis we have in trying to house the poor and the lower income earners. If Clyde Cameron's imaginative policies in the field of industrial relations had been allowed to continue we would not have the mas- sive division between employers and employees that we have today, or the economic oppression of workers. If the late Rex Connor had been allowed to put into practice his ideas for resource development we would not be running around like headless chooks wondering what this 'boom' is all about. </PARA>
<PARA> Where has this Government, led by this Prime Minister, provided any real participation for the Australian people? In six years of conservative rule Australia has moved closer and closer towards being the most unequal society in the world. Let us examine just one aspect of what is being denied to the Australian people. The notion of reason is one which encompasses good and compassionate management and social interaction. It is possible only under a Labor Government because the record shows the conservative forces to be totally unreasonable. How can they explain the following manoeuvres? They put more people out of work in their efforts to solve unemployment. They raise interest rates in an effort to make money more accessible to home buyers. They propose to take away protection and jobs in order to rationalise the manufacturing sector and somehow to create more jobs. They take away any notion of universal health cover in order to create a health scheme which will benefit the consumer, but make consumers, the poor, the sick and the needy pay most. They invoke Draconian anti-labour legislation in order to protect the free market for capital. How members of this Government can sleep at night with this series of bewildering paradoxes swirling around in their heads is amazing. Against this record it makes me feel proud to stand here as a senator representing the Australian Labor Party and representing the aspirations of the majority of Australians. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party is the oldest political party this country has and every other political party has been a reaction to it. All members in this chamber who are not in the Australian Labor Party are here because the ruling class became frightened of real democracy and set up one political party or another to protect the interests of capital. Since our party was formed in the 1890s every social, political, economic and legal achievement of any consequence in Australia can be traced back to action by the Labor Party or the broader labour movement. Some examples are: The 40 hour week, the basic wage, the operation of the arbitration system, aged pensions, child endowment, maternity allowances, the principles of full employment, recognition of the rights of migrants and women, movements toward equality for women, the Commonwealth Bank, the Australian Navy, the Snowy Mountains Scheme, Qantas Airways Ltd, post war immigration, Medibank, Aboriginal land rights, a fairer electoral system and the list can go on and on. It is the Australian Labor Party which has provided the real benefits of being Australian and living in Australia. It is the Australian Labor Party which has consistently and without hesitation fought for the rights and aspirations of Australians. It is the only political party which has the interests of Australians at heart. </PARA>
<PARA> My predecessors in this chamber, Senator Bishop and Senator Cavanagh pursued these interests and ideals, and did so effectively. They, together with amongst others, Clyde Cameron, the former Member for Hindmarsh, and ex-Senators Jim Toohey and Don Cameron, provided strong and effective representation for Australians generally and South Australians in particular. I pay tribute to them for their efforts and in doing so thank them and Senator Elstob for their advice and assistance. I have worked with them all, whether officially or unofficially, and know I have learnt much from all of them. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia is at the crossroads. It has to choose between democratic socialism, through the Australian Labor Party, or barbarism. The last time we saw this scenerio played out was in the 1930s. By this I am not saying the economic models are the same but the recipe for disaster has all the same ingredients being added by like-minded chefs. Then we saw financial disaster followed by economic collapse. This spurred the rise of fascism, unchecked in some parts, and an unparalleled world war. This is barbarism and it is the road down which this Government is taking all Australians. It is a form of barbarism-the barbarism of social jungle warfare-which is being introduced into Australia in the guise of economic rationality. Faced with this choice-democratic socialism or barbarism-I am confident the Australian people will make the right choice. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the outset may I be the first to congratulate Senator Hill and Senator Bolkus for their maiden speeches both of which I think we have been impressed with in one way or another. I am sure we will hear very spirited speeches from both of them at times when we can interject. Tonight I will say a few things about some different matters. First of all I want to say something about the sales tax legislation. At the outset I say that I believe that a sales tax is one of the things we should be aiming for. I think that a user pays tax is something that could benefit the whole of this country. I feel that any increase in sales tax has to be associated with a decrease in personal income tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have said before that I believe the top rate of income tax should never exceed 50c in the dollar because obviously that leads to people trying to avoid income tax. Actually, I am one of those people sometimes called a flat-earther. I believe in a flat rate of tax that rewards those who work harder in a day in a fair way and in a system which does not have the disincentive I believe our present system has. I do not really believe those who say it cannot be done because excises and a lot of other taxes are indeed flat rate taxes. Anyone with an ounce of sense can see that a similar system can easily be applied to income tax. Actually it is already done in some countries; a couple that come to mind are Hong Kong and Switzerland. Both are very successful and yet quite different in structure but each with the advantage to their residents of low rates of flat tax. </PARA>
<PARA> I also believe that a flat rate of tax should be our aim in sales tax. That is something we should strive for. Whenever indirect taxes go up personal income tax must come down with the eventual aim of having a flat tax rate for personal income tax and sales tax. I also believe that if we ever have any savings in government expenditure that that should result in reduced personal income tax. I believe that is what the people of this country want. They want reduced taxes so that they can decide how they spend their money. They do not want to see it spent in ways over which they have no control-as I believe is the case in some ways now. I will mention a few of those cases in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently I saw a newspaper article that pointed out that if the savings of the so-called razor gang had been passed on we could have had a tax cut of some $560m. That could have been applied as a 2 per cent reduction for the bottom marginal rate and 5 per cent reduction on the top rate gradually getting it down towards a flat rate. It is my belief that we must gradually aim for that flat rate of taxation and that also we should gradually shift the weight of our taxation from personal income tax to indirect taxation such as sales tax. But with each shift I believe that personal income tax should come down. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that I will look for a moment at some of the expenditure on things like social security and welfare. This Government believes in protecting those in need in our community. If honourable senators look at pages 100 and 101 of the Budget statements for 1981-82 they will see that age pensions and allowances will increase by $600m this year; service pensioners will receive an additional $136m; assistance to the handicapped in invalid pensions and allowances has gone up by over $100m; supporting parents' benefits and allowances have gone up by nearly $200m; we all know that assistance to families by way of family allowances has gone up by about $90m and assistance to the unemployed by unemployment benefits has gone up an additional $94m. I have rounded those figures off. None of them are to the nearest decimal point. If we look at the total for social security and welfare payments we see that there has been an increase in the Budget of nearly $1,500m from nearly $10,000m. That is a sizable part of our Budget. We have to remember of course that there are 27 pay days in this financial year. But even then we are spending a very great deal of the Government's income on this important area. I think it comes to nearly 28 per cent of all outlays. The actual expansion in effect is only 12 per cent during the present year. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are looking for savings there are some areas where I feel some cutbacks should be made. As the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) well knows I have been very much against sending Australian pensions overseas. By that I do not mean that we should not send pensions to somebody who makes a holiday trip overseas but I mean to those people who choose to live in other countries. Some of those countries have a much lower cost of living than does Australia so a person can live quite well on our pension. Also a pensioner living here is subject, first of all, to income tax if that person is earning more than a certain amount. Secondly, we have to be sure that that pensioner is alive. How on earth can we ascertain we should be taking income tax out of a pension if we do not have a ghost of a chance of checking whether the person is working. I have no doubt that there have been many payments to persons overseas well after they have died. I think we are quite crazy to be sending good Australian money overseas to pensioners when we cannot check for that type of thing. I think it is time we stopped such payments. I know a great number of people who work long hours, and hard, to earn their income, some of which goes in government taxes. For example, I can think of some farmers I know who work hard growing and delivering vegetables. They contribute to government coffers, but some of that contribution goes towards the payment of pensions overseas. The Government should review that practice. </PARA>
<PARA> Another aspect is that if a pension is spent in Australia, it contributes to Australia's economy. If it is spent overseas, it does not. I hope that the Government will reconsider the whole question of pension reciprocity. If it decides to continue such reciprocity-I hope it will not-it should deduct from pensions paid overseas an amount to compensate for loss of income tax and the loss to the Australian economy as a result of the pensions not being spent in this country. I wish to make it quite clear that I oppose money being sent to people who live permanently overseas. It should be given only to those who live in Australia, but if it must be paid abroad, let us at least retain enough to compensate for loss of income tax and loss of benefit to the economy because the pension is not spent in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area of social security payment in respect of which people keep telling me that this country is crazy concerns the method of payment of the unemployment benefit to people from New Zealand. Upon their arrival in Australia, if they have been receiving unemployment benefit in their own country, they immediately become eligible for our higher unemployment benefit payment. In contrast, an Australian citizen who seeks the unemployment benefit must go through a qualifying period. Obviously, that situation should be changed immediately. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, it is high time that this country had a system of social security numbering. From advice that I have received I cannot believe that some people are not receiving more than one payment for unemployment benefit. I understand that, provided they keep their trap shut, it is not easy to catch them. A system of social security numbering would help to avoid such practices and to identify illegal immigrants. I realise that some people are against being given a number of any kind but invariably my response is that if a person has nothing to hide, why should he complain?</PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the expenditure upon ethnic radio and television services, a subject on which one or two questions have been asked in the Senate today. I repeat that I do not like the idea of the Government spending money on such services, which I feel should be absorbed by the Australian Broadcasting Commission. At page 133 of the Budget documents reference is made to the fact that this year some $6m is to be provided for ethnic radio services. That sum is $1.2m greater than the expenditure in the last financial year. Also, $20m is to be provided to meet the estimated cost of the first full year of operating the new ethnic television services in Sydney and Melbourne. Obviously, that too represents an increase in expenditure over the previous year. I am strongly opposed to the idea of providing special television and radio services for people who come to live in this country. I believe equally strongly that they should be prepared to live in the way that other Australians live and watch Australian television-bad as it is at certain times. </PARA>
<PARA> It is good to note the Government's support for the youth, sport and recreation program, expenditure upon which has been substantially increased to $20m, an increase of 87 per cent over the provision for last year. I would be quite happy if all of the money that is now devoted to ethnic television and radio were to be devoted to sport and recreation, and particularly for capital works in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to discuss now the way in which this Budget affects Tasmania. Let us be clear that it has been very good to my State. Over the years Tasmania has had a great deal of assistance from the Federal Government in the form of freight equalisation payments. This year the provision for that purpose will amount to almost $33m. The assistance given air travellers by way of passenger subsidy and the subsidy paid in respect of the Empress of Australia total almost $40m a year. Freight equalisation helps to encourage people to set up in Tasmania businesses that employ people. The air subsidy is designed to encourage travel to and from Tasmania and, until other matters are attended to, it does represent an appropriate response to the problem of the considerable cost of travel to and from the island State. The subsidy in respect of the Empress of Australia also helps tourists travelling to and from Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> I have mentioned a few of the special payments which Tasmania receives but one or two other items are also worthy of special mention. They demonstrate this Government's concern for the people of Tasmania and its determination that that State will not become an economic backwater with second-class citizens. One must not forget that the Federal Government is funding the entire cost of providing a second bridge across the Derwent River. The total cost of that project, based on present prices, will be about $43m. Of that sum, about $17.5m will be made available during this financial year. The bridge is expected to be completed in 1984 and I only hope that the Tasman Bridge is not knocked down again before that date. I hope that there is no immediate need, once the second bridge has been completed, to replace the other bridge on the connecting link between Hobart and Launceston, just south of Bridgewater. </PARA>
<PARA> In Hobart some $6m is to be spent to upgrade the airport. One reason for the expenditure is to permit the larger Boeing 727 aircraft to bring in tourists and take out Tasmanian travellers. There are, of course, other ways in which Tasmania is being looked after by this Government, but the few that I have mentioned remind us that the Government does worry about, and look after, Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish now to touch on three other matters. The first concerns housing, a subject which has been mentioned previously today. Housing is still the most urgent need of many thousands of Australians and should be accorded a very high priority by the Government. There is a need for government houses to be made available at the lowest possible rates of interest for people of little means. There is a need to survey lands that are suitable for housing developments. </PARA>
<PARA> Such land should be purchased and the provision of services such as transport, drainage, and roads should be arranged. At the moment the prospective home buyer is faced with high interest rates because of competition for available money. It is to be hoped that before long it will be possible to reduce the rates that are presently charged. I believe that it is better to have money available, even at high interest rates, than to have none available at all. Unless Australia's interest rates are comparable with those in other parts of the world, money will leave Australia; none will be available here. The Government must always regard the provision of a sufficient number of houses, for young people in particular, as one of its highest priorities. I have raised the matter before and I hope that the Government will continue to consider it. </PARA>
<PARA> I must agree with the earlier remarks of Senator Jessop and Senator Bjelke-Petersen concerning the proposed sales taxes. I said earlier that I agree with the imposition of sales taxes and with the widening of the application of those taxes, but I believe that the imposition of a 2 1/2 per cent tax on building materials might well have been deferred until interest rates came down. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe it is extremely difficult for most young people to rake up the deposit for a house and the higher the cost of a house becomes the harder it will be to get together a deposit. Another matter with regard to housing that should be recognised is that home building is essential. When houses are built the fittings and furnishings that are required have to be bought, so not only the building industry but also in many ways the entire economy are stimulated. I am sure the Government recognises the importance of what I am saying. The Government has looked after housing in the past. I can only request the Government to continue its support for housing as strongly as it can and, when possible, to re-examine the cost to housing as a result of the sales tax changes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As an engineer and as a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment I want to make some personal comments regarding the Kakadu National Park which is in the Northern Territory. As background may I say as an engineer that I believe the technical problems of atomic power plants will be solved and that these plants are preferable to coal burning plants. I well recognise the problems of these plants. I visited one in the making and I have seen the excellence of the engineering designs and the operation controls. I feel they are desirable because they are less polluting than coal burning furnaces. The fall-out of acid from coal burning plants is well documented and the extreme health risk in winning the coal for the use of those plants, I believe, makes the atomic power plants the lesser of two evils. Of course there are some dangers in the conversion of material to energy, whatever it may be, but my judgment is that the atomic plants have less total danger to the community than the coal burning plants. Having said that, it obviously flows that I believe in uranium mining. I do not believe we should stop such mining provided it is done with care. The Northern Territory has about 80 per cent of Australia's known uranium ore reserves. They have been found in a very small area. There is about a 400 kilometre strip of possible mineralisation in the area known as Stage 2 of the Kakadu National Park and to date only about 15 kilometres of that 400 kilometres has been adequately examined for mineralisation. So we have some 385 kilometres to drill and test. I do not believe companies will do that if an area that they wish to test is likely to be declared as a national park. </PARA>
<PARA> The area of the Territory where the uranium ore is likely to be found should, I believe, be thoroughly examined. As a first stage I believe the Federal Government should remove itself from control of the Kakadu National Park. As a Tasmanian senator, I take very strong exception to the Federal Government trying to control a national park in Tasmania. So I feel the Federal Government should abandon its control of the Kakadu National Park to the Northern Territory and let the people in control of that Territory decide what should be done there. </PARA>
<PARA> I now want to say something about South Africa. Much has been said about it in the news over the last few weeks. We should, I believe, remember that South Africa was one of our allies in the last war. We should remember that it is strategically important both from a location point of view and as a source of minerals. It is my belief that the Soviets are behind the attempts to take over South Africa. If they get control of that country they will have control of several very important minerals including chromium and a couple of other strategically important minerals. Their availability in the world will be controlled almost totally by the Soviets if they get control of South Africa. </PARA>
<PARA> South Africa is important from a defence point of view. It is quite clear that any country which controls the Cape by which a ship goes every 30 seconds will have a very important area under its control. I believe we should be recognising that South Africa is gradually changing and gradually doing more for all of its people. If things are so bad for the blacks in South Africa why are so many blacks trying to get into the country from other African countries? The answer is obvious: Blacks in South Africa obviously are better off than are the blacks in many other countries near South Africa. I believe it is time we looked again at our attitude to that country. I believe it is time we sent Qantas flying into that country--</PARA>

<PARA> We should keep the situation of South Africa in a sensible perspective. An article I read in Notes on the News dated 30 June documents the situation well, I think. I have shown the article to the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) and to the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Button). To save the time of the Senate I seek leave to have that article by Mr Ian Hancock, Senior Lecturer in History at the Australian National University, incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The Nigerian Foreign Minister is reported to have said in Nairobi, where he was attending a summit meeting of the Organization of African Unity, that New Zealand would not be missed from the Commonwealth. After all, it only had a population of 2 1/2 million people. He almost sounded like those Australians who so irritate New Zealanders by their haughty disdain. The Foreign Minister however, had his own reasons for such a display of arrogance. Nigeria is probably the most self-confident country in Africa, the second richest after South Africa on the continent, an exporter of oil wooed by the West and notably by Britain and the United States. Nigeria also seems to have assumed Tanzania's role as the conscience of Africa, as the State which admonishes the West for racism and neo-colonialism and insists on tougher action over South Africa. And like all self-confident States, Nigeria is not greatly troubled by double standards. Although it still holds the record within Africa for killing more of its own citizens, although two of its largest growth industries are corruption and violent crime, Nigeria does not hesitate in commenting on moral lapses, domestic misconduct and the violation of human rights whether they occur in Africa or abroad. So New Zealanders must learn to live with a high moral purpose and uncompromising principles of a distinctly unprincipled giant of the Commonwealth. Yet they could complain that the Foreign Minister did overlook New Zealand's outstanding contribution to Black Africa. For Mr Muldoon has achieved for Africa what Africa finds so hard to do for itself. He has forged an impressive unity, at least in relation to the proposed Springbok rugby tour of New Zealand. Nothing brings Africa's political leaders together quite so readily as a small country thousands of miles away whose Government will not forbid a sporting organization sharing the national religion with a few hefty South Africans. The New Zealand Government is plainly puzzled and annoyed by the African attitude. Notwithstanding the remarks of the Australian Foreign Minister, it has conformed to the Gleneagles Agreement. More important, New Zealanders, with a better race relations record than say Australia, find it peculiar that they should be singled out for attention. Perhaps one reason is that their country is small and isolated. Even then, why get worked up over a game of rugby which Africans to their credit don't play anyway, and ignore the flagrant breaches by African States of supposed embargoes on contact with South Africa. Robert Mugabe, the Prime Minister of Zimbabwe, an avowed socialist and current revolutionary hero in Africa, is open and unashamed about it all. </PARA>
<PARA> Arriving in Nairobi for the Summit Meeting, he said Zimbabwe had to continue trading with South Africa. He supported a liberation movement and he hoped that the Organisation of African Unity would take steps to advance the cause. But Zimbabwe's economic survival depended on buying and selling in South Africa. Ninety per cent of Zimbabwe's trade went through the Republic. Current relations between Zimbabwe and South Africa are deteriorating but this is no time for brave words let alone suicidal action by the Zimbabwe Prime Minister. Nor is Zimbabwe alone in Southern Africa in its dependence on the South African connection. What is perhaps more significant is the number of African Commonwealth States to say nothing of the rest, who trade openly or under cover when they have no desperate need to do so. And on this point, the Nigerian Foreign Minister might well look at his own country's besmirched record, for the moralists are so often pragmatists in the region around the pocket. The bitter hatred of apartheid is genuine and deep but it competes with what is sometimes called realism. If New Zealanders are understandably upset by what they see as double standards and are hurt about being singled out for attack, Mr Muldoon has indicated a willingness to hit back. He wants to raise the issue of human rights at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Melbourne in September. Already, he has been preempted by the Commonwealth Secretariat which has pointed out that this issue is at present under investigation. Such an investigation need not look very far. The most recently published African Research Bulletin, which assembles political material on a monthly basis, mainly from the press, suggests that Africa as a whole had another disturbed month in May. There was a report of 600 tribesmen being killed in Ghana, renewed fighting in the north eastern border area of Kenya where Somalis wish to establish their right to self determination, continuing fighting in Uganda as opposition groups try to upset last year's election result, a result incidentally, pronounced fair and reasonable by a Commonwealth observer group which must have been looking the other way at the time, a border clash between Nigeria and Cameroon, a pending treason trial in Zambia. Among the non-Commonwealth countries we learn of continued attempts to persuade Colonel Gaddafi to vacate occupied Chad and the Summit Meeting in Nairobi now proposes to replace the Libyans with a peace keeping force. The continuing war in the Western Sahara, which the Nairobi Summit hoped to end by overseeing a referendum whereby the people themselves will actually be asked who they want as governors, the dissolution of the equivalent of the ACTU in the Central African Republic which has also postponed elections, the arrest of plotters in Equatorial Guinea and 6 men sentenced to death in Angola for opposition to the Government. On the other hand, there's a prettier side to the picture. Two men in Kenya were actually found not guilty at a treason trial. The former Egyptian Vice President was released 10 years after he attempted a coup against Mr Sudat. Members of the exiled opposition party in Lesotho have been given an amnesty and political prisoners in Liberia and Sierra Leone have been released. So the story is not one of unrelieved gloom but the month of May was nonetheless a typical one, typical that is, of an Africa which is politically unstable and uncertain, where much is said about human rights and where violations seem endemic whether initiated by Government or by opposition. Mr Muldoon in that no nonsense way of his; may be tempted to make some of these points in Melbourne. Whether this would achieve anything is another question. Few countries are restrained by the presence of motes in their own eyes, they merely point out that such considerations are irrelevant, that the overriding issue in this case is the persistence of apartheid in South Africa and that the overwhelming need is to isolate South Africa by means which don't greatly hurt the Black States themselves. Two principles stand in total opposition. New Zealand's belief in the right of sportsmen not to be subjected to political control, Africa's conviction that Pretoria is so much of an enemy that other considerations are secondary. The one hope is that the Commonwealth performs another of its healing miracles, that the prophets of doom have overlooked the remarkable track record of snatching reconciliation from the jaws of confrontation. </PARA>

<PARA> I would like to commence my remarks by expressing my appreciation to the members of the Printing and Kindred Industries Union and the Australian Labor Party who have been so encouraging to me all my life. I am grateful to the many friends I have made in the Labor movement over 25 years, and I am grateful for their generous support. I will do my best to reflect the aspirations of the Labor Party in giving voice to the needs and hopes of the citizens of New South Wales and Australia. It is ironic that as a young apprentice I spoke for the first time in public at a meeting of apprentices convened by the printing trades union. At that meeting I moved a motion condemning the Budget of the then Treasurer, Sir Arthur Fadden, in the Menzies Government. The Budget was known as the horror Budget of 1951. That Budget's salient features were a 10 per cent surcharge on income tax, increased sales tax and the restriction of credit for home builders and small business. It has a familiar ring, has it not? I was able to persuade my fellow apprentices and the motion was carried. I wish it was as easy tonight. Subsequently, I was elected an organiser of the printers union and eventually State secretary. On many occasions I led delegations to this place protesting at the Budgets of Liberal-Country Party governments. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1971 I was elected Assistant General Secretary of the Australian Labor Party in New South Wales and I had the satisfaction of participating in the election of the Whitlam Labor Governments of 1972 and 1974. I was proud to see the Labor Government return Australia to the world scene as a strong, independent nation. This was in sharp contrast to the subservient mentality of Liberal Country Party governments of the previous 23 years. This mentality led to a profound neglect of the true needs of the Australian people. The Whitlam Labor Government, with its fundamentally different priorities, raised the standards of health, housing, education and social services to a decent level. The Labor Government, had, in a three-year period, a wealth of achievements. Three that I regard as particularly significant were the fostering and development of Australian national identity and culture, the recognition of the needs of non-British speaking citizens and equal pay for women. History records that in 1975 the Establishment could not tolerate the reforms of the Whitlam Labor Government and it was sacked. We learned the bitter lesson of the difference between being in government and being in power. The Fraser regime commenced. In August 1977 the National Times said of the Fraser Government's second Budget:</PARA>
<PARA> He has set himself a target of sharply changing the balance of power in our society by diminishing the power of the unions and setting out to redistribute the national wealth up the salary scale to those whom he believes are the productive members of our society. </PARA>
<PARA>The National Times described the Budget as one that could 'endanger the stability of the country'. The National Times then went on to say that the Budget was a 'declaration of class war'. The Budget we are discussing tonight can be understood only within the context of the Fraser Government's economic strategy from when it came to power until now. The Government's strategy is a class war, the class war which the National Times prophesied. The Fraser Government, of course, makes the Menzies-Fadden Government look amateurish in what it has done to the Australian people. This Government is waging this class war by using all its resources to boost the profits of the foreign dominated corporate sector at the expense of the Australian people, particularly the wage and salary earners. This Government has attacked the working people by its opposition to wage indexation. It has also amended the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to the detriment of the economic interests of wage and salary earners. At the same time, this Government has cut back savagely on expenditure on the essential needs of the Australian people in health, housing, welfare and education-what could be called the social wage. </PARA>
<PARA> Even worse, this Government has abandoned the actual provision of many of these essential services to the jungle of so-called private enterprise. For example, whilst the funds for public health have been slashed, the Government in this Budget has given an enormous increase in subsidies to private surgical hospitals. Perhaps the most blatant example of the Government's inhumanity to the casualties of this society is its total withdrawal of the provision of funds to women's refuges-refuges which protect the lives of some of the most vulnerable people in our society. This Government is practising class discrimination because it is using the money it has taken from the Australian people to give massive subsidies to the corporate sector, particularly the multinational companies. This Government's strategy is to encourage an uncontrolled spread of the foreign controlled resource sector of our economy. In doing so, this Government has locked Australia into a pathologically one-sided development path. The Fraser Government is fulfilling the role of a comprador in that it is facilitating the takeover of Australia's resources and industry by multinational companies. So this Government is causing Australia increasingly to resemble those Latin American countries which have lost every vestige of independence. </PARA>
<PARA> The two key sections of the Australian Bureau of Statistics that covered foreign investment and capital flows-the foreign participation section and the import orders section-have been closed down. When they were established by the Labor Government they had a total staff of 60. Now there is one person left in the import section. This is the answer in part to the question which my colleague Senator Bolkus asked this afternoon and which the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Carrick) could not answer. This means that we do not have anywhere near enough information to make an intelligent decision on how to deal with the rapidly increasing foreign presence in our industry. In contrast, let us look at my own industry, the printing and packaging industry. It is part of the vital manufacturing industry base of the New South Wales economy. The printing industry is only 10 per cent foreign owned and is characteristically the industry of small and medium sized factories. My industry, in common with all manufacturing industries, is being damaged by this Government's economic strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my belief that this comprador Government has coldly and deliberately implemented the will of the multinational companies by squeezing the domestic economy, dismantling the established industrial base, particularly in manufacturing and home building, shifting the labour and capital out of it, cutting back the public sector's demand for funds, making room for foreign investment and transferring Australian investment to other sectors, promoting exports and removing the barriers that prevent a flood of imports into this country. Thanks to the cringe mentality of conservative governments, half of our industry is subject to foreign ownership and control, and that proportion is rising. Three of every four dollars in foreign investment in this country is designed to take over existing Australian businesses and remove their profits from Australian hands. Two of every three dollars of total company income is being paid overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some detailed figures which support my argument that the Government favours the corporate sector at the expense of wage and salary earners. What has happened to individual taxpayers since this Government began its strategy in 1975? Looking at individual taxation alone, we find that while wages and salaries have gone up by only 71 per cent, tax paid by those workers has risen by 101 per cent. On the other hand, while wealthy non-pay-as-you-earn taxpayers' income from rent, interest, dividends, et cetera, has risen by over 80 per cent over the period, tax paid rose by only 55 per cent. As an example, let us take two workers at opposite ends of the scale. In 1975 one worker earned $3,700 and the other $30,000. How have these two taxpayers fared under this Government? The first is now earning $6,000 a year and has had his after tax income cut by $113 in 1981 terms. Twenty-eight per cent of our citizens are receiving salaries of $6,000 or less. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us take the person at the upper end of the scale. That person is now receiving $50,000 and has had his or her after-tax income lifted by $2,400 a year, nearly $50 a week. A person in the middle of the range on, say, $10,000 a year, with a spouse and two children, is, even taking the family allowance and the spouse rebate into account, still $266 worse off, compared with 1975. Looking at total tax collections, personal income tax has risen from 41 per cent to 45 per cent of the total. Company tax, however, has declined as a source of revenue from 15 per cent to 13.7 per cent of tax revenue. This year alone personal tax receipts will rise by 22 per cent while wages will rise, at the most, by 13.5 per cent. Company tax receipts will rise by only 10 per cent as against a jump in profits of 18 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Two industries have been selected by the Government for special attack. One is the printing industry and the other is the home building industry. They are both threatened to be slugged by a ruinous sales tax. Tomorrow I will present another petition signed by officers, executive members and delegates of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. That petition opposes sales tax increases on printed goods and paper products and suggests that the loss of revenue be made up by a resource rental tax. The trade union leaders know what a threat to the cost of living these sales tax increases are. That is why they are supporting this petition against the sales tax increases. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to illustrate what this new sales tax threatens in the printing industry. In spite of our ocker image, Australia is a nation of readers. Australians, with an annual book expenditure of $530m, are second only to New Zealand as book buyers in the world. That is only books. It is therefore all the more pernicious for an Australian government to put a sales tax on books, magazines and newspapers. In effect, it is a tax on knowledge. It is likely that the retail price of books will rise by 10 per cent and the impact of this on struggling publishers will be a burden they cannot stand. How hypocritical the Government is. Last month the Prime Minister, at the anniversary of Quadrant magazine, said that Quadrant was to be congratulated for struggling against all odds and surviving. The next day the Government introduced a sales tax on magazines. I am not concerned about the wealthy Quadrant but I am concerned about the social, sporting and community publications as well as local papers, newsletters and club magazines, all of which are the very heart of our democracy. They are an essential part of the printing industry. They make our democracy strong. This Government has the thin end of the wedge with this tax because there is no stopping any of these increases, except by defeating the Government itself. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost of learning to students will rise, our culture will suffer and students will have to pay more for their books. It is typical of how out of touch this Government is with young people and their problems. I started by speaking about my youth but I know how hard it is now for young people to survive, how difficult it is for them to exist in this society at present. What do we have from this Government? We have a kangaroo strategy. It has removed a program of proven quality-the Community Youth Support Scheme-and has substituted an inferior product, in this case the School to Work Transition Program. It is kangaroo strategy all the time. </PARA>
<PARA> Just as serious as the sales tax is the complementary problem of escalating interest rates. This is best illustrated in human terms by the increased mortgage payments which already are causing Australian families to worry about the forced sale of their homes. It is incredible, but people are actually having it posed to them that they should sell their houses and go to districts that they can afford. Escalating interest rates also threaten small and medium size business. It is my belief that the main cause of this serious threat is the imbalance in the Australian economy resulting from the activity of multinational companies. The multinational companies are buying up Australia at an alarming rate. They are doing this by using Australian money to finance their operations and make their profits. Even when multinational companies use overseas money their investment puts pressure on interest rates because of the Government's fanatical obsession with containing the money supply. Last year Australia had $6 billion in foreign investment and because of this Government's policies, interest rates rose. If money comes in one way and the Government drains it off to elsewhere at the expense of small business and housing, we have problems. The Government has sat back and allowed foreign companies to ship out of Australia from 1975 to 1980 $1.5 billion more than they have invested. The Vernon report, commissioned by the Menzies Government in 1965, prophesied this development. It said:</PARA>
<PARA> Once an economy has a substantial body of overseas investment, it is in a sense 'on the tiger's back' unless the trade balance is improving sufficiently to meet the additional income payable overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> The continuation of capital inflow becomes seemingly more and more desirable as a means of offsetting the increasing payments on the latter account. </PARA>
<PARA> As the annual amounts become larger, the immediate consequences for the economy of an interruption of the capital inflow, either contrived or occurring by reason of external circumstances, become more and more serious. </PARA>
<PARA>This Government is riding that tiger. Last year, for the first time in seven years, Australia received a lot more investment than the amount of profits shipped out, but the money has to be repaid in profit and dividends again and again. Nobody knows whether the inflow of foreign money will be halved or doubled in the future. The effect of such unpredictable changes in capital inflow on the ownership and viability of Australian industry could be devastating. </PARA>
<PARA> The general theme of my comments has been the danger of reliance on foreign investment. I strongly criticise the lack of balance in the development of our economy and the lack of planning in the allocation of resources. I question the biased direction of what little planning does occur. The vital questions-who will benefit and who will lose-are not being faced by this Government. The Australian Labor Party is facing these questions; that is the difference between it and the Government. We have proposed stringent measures designed to establish majority Australian equity in all projects, as well as the careful monitoring of foreign companies and especially their transfer pricing practices. Labor would organise a greater mobilisation of Australian capital, including public sector equity holdings through the Australian Industry Development Corporation, to ensure greater Australian participation and control in the development of our resources and industry. As a great British democratic socialist, Aneurin Bevan, said, 'Not even the apparently enlightened principle of the greatest good for the greatest number can excuse indifference to individual suffering'. A conscripted army of two million unemployed or underemployed Australians is living in or on the edge of poverty. Big business has enough friends in this Government. I hope my voice on behalf of the Australian Labor Party will improve the odds for those people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I add my congratulations on the excellent maiden speeches delivered to the Senate this evening. This is a debate on the 1981-82 Budget and I intend now to direct my remarks to that infamous document. The 1981-82 Budget shows that the Government is determined to take Australia down the same grim monetarist path as Thatcher's Britain. In budgeting for a domestic surplus of $1,542m the Government has used almost every trick in the book to take money out of the economy. For example, this Government will be the first in Australia to tax the free flow of information, with a tax on books, magazines and newspapers, and the first to tax the basic necessities of life, such as clothing, footwear, shelter, education and wrapping materials for food and medicine. One hopes it will be the last.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The increases in sales tax, whilst reprehensible, are not the most powerful sting in the Budget. The greatest hit will be in personal income tax. This Government will take $3,300m more than it took last year-an increase of 19 per cent in one year. Someone receiving average weekly earnings of $295 a week now pays $68 a week in tax. The Government predicts that this same person will be earning $334 by the end of June next year and, because this Government has abandoned tax indexation, that person will be paying $81 in tax. By June next year people earning only 2 per cent more than average weekly earnings will be paying a marginal tax rate of 46 per cent. Truly, in Mr Fraser's famous words, 'circumstances change'. Three years ago, almost to the day, the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . we said that we wanted to end for all time the deceit of a tax system which, through the process of inflation, brought larger and larger funds to the coffers of the Government. We said that if governments wanted more funds, they should tax for them openly and plainly . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In the Australian Democrats' alternative Budget, we allocated $1,100m for personal income tax indexation and the restructuring of income tax. This was to be paid for by a resource tax and the abolition of the investment allowance. But tax indexation was not the only area in which circumstances changed. The Treasurer, Mr Howard, earlier this year emphatically denied that the Govenment intended to introduce a value added tax. True to his word, he has not introduced it. Instead, he has introduced a broadly based sales tax, with very similar effect. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to some of the less obvious taxes and imposts that the Government has introduced. Before doing so, let me briefly mention interest rates. In the last seven years, interest rates for new housing loans to individuals have increased from 8 per cent to as high as 14 per cent. Interest repayments on a 20 year loan of $30,000 are now around $40 a week as a result of the Government's policy, which has brought about the highest domestic interest rates in Australia's history. Families are now compelled to insure their health to avoid the risk of bankruptcy. Last year, a person could take the risk of not taking out health insurance, because he received free treatment from a public hospital and paid no more than $20 to visit a doctor. This year the Government has changed the rules for the fifth time, so that that person must pay at least $15 if he obtains treatment at a hospital; and now the Government will not pay that person a cent for visiting a doctor if he does not already have medical insurance. Hospital and medical insurance will cost about an additional $10 a week. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8R7">Senator SIDDONS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I press on with another very important indirect cost, that is the cost of owning a motor car. The failure of this Government to tackle seriously the problems of urban transport forces most families to own at least one motor car. The cost of running a motor car has greatly increased, thanks to the Government's crude oil levy. This year the Government expects to receive more than $3,400m from the crude oil levy. This is money which was not raised eight years ago. It is money which any reasonable person would consider should be made available for spending on housing, roads, education or health. If one aggregates the cost of the tax increases that I have outlined-the real costs and not just the inflated boosted value and the cost of the new health insurance arrangements-one finds that taxpayers will be paying something like $13 a week more under this Budget, just in those tax increases. If one adds in the cost of the crude oil levy, taxpayers are each $22 a week worse off. Together, this adds up to $1,200 a year that the householder is worse off. Sales tax has increased by nearly $600m in real terms, and income tax has increased by $1,400m. Health insurance will cost the community around $1,800m while the crude oil levy is expected to raise more than $3,400m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> How is the Government proposing to spend this enormous increase in revenue? Sensible people might assume that at least some of the money would have been directed to labour intensive sectors of the economy such as housing and road building. Sensible people might think that the Government ought to be interested in alleviating unemployment by employing people in socially useful projects. Instead, this Government has decided to buy expensive toys such as aeroplanes for the Royal Australian Air Force and ships for the Navy; to withdraw unemployment benefits from the spouses of the people on strike; to decrease the real living standard of the majority of Australians. Funds to the States for welfare housing have been cut by 25 per cent. The States are now paying back more in interest on previous loans than they receive from the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Democrats' alternative Budget, grants and loans for welfare housing to the States would have been increased by $165m. In addition we would have allocated $200m to subsidise interest rates for home buyers. We would have allocated $35m to assist housing co-operatives, cost-rent housing associations and other innovative means of providing shelter. In addition, we would have restructured the housing grants scheme to provide loans of between $1,000 and $5,000 to approximately 15,000 first home buyers to assist them in overcoming the deposit gap. These measures would have cost a total of $400m. Our Budget would have selectively stimulated the economy. Employment, living standards and company profits would have increased, as would income tax receipts, despite indexation, and we budgeted-I stress this-for a domestic surplus of $300m, not $1,500m. </PARA>
<PARA> In this Budget spending on roads has been cut to such a degree that municipalities throughout the country can barely afford to maintain existing roads, let alone improve the road network. For example, it has been estimated that capital works costing in the region of $100m need to be undertaken before the year 2000 to provide an adequate road network in Diamond Valley, near Melbourne, the area from which I come. Yet the funds available are likely to amount to no more than 40 per cent of this figure. </PARA>
<PARA> Per capita spending on education and health has not increased in this Budget. This Government seems determined to de-educate Australia. During its period of office, participation rates in post-secondary education in Australia have fallen to amongst the lowest in the industrialised world. In Australia, 5.7 per cent of people in the age group from 20 to 24 are attending university. The average for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries is 17.3 per cent. That is three times as many. In the United States between 1960 and 1980, 75.8 per cent of people aged from 15 to 19 participated in full time education. In Australia, only 46.2 per cent participated in full time education, and this figure has declined. The difference is dramatic. In the 1980s and the 1990s we will surely reap a tragic harvest of under-education and under-employment, increasing social unrest, violence in the streets and radical political movements committed to the destruction of our society. Nowhere in this Government's mean and short-sighted approach is it more evident than in its attitude to student assistance. Student allowances are still basically the same as they were in 1974, during which time inflation was cut and their real value is now only 50 per cent of what it was. It is no longer possible for tertiary students to survive on payments under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme alone. The Government's refusal to recognise the value to the community of well educated people is tragic. The Democrats, in their alternative Budget, would have increased spending on student allowances by $70m in real terms, enabling an appropriate increase in TEAS and other student allowances. </PARA>
<PARA> For many years conservative politicians used the construction of hospitals and dams as crude electoral devices. Obscure corners of Australia are littered with hospitals and dams-it has herds of white elephants. In a sense, this Government is to be congratulated. Porkbarreling in the hospital construction business has ceased. Hospital construction has virtually ceased also. Indeed, with the exception of Victoria and Tasmania, States throughout the Commonwealth will probably have to close some hospitals to meet Commonwealth requirements. The waste of resources is gross. The inefficiencies revealed by the Jamison Commission of Inquiry into the Efficiency and Administration of Hospitals are an indictment of health planning. The refusal of the Government to provide adequate services for the elderly, who now comprise up to 50 per cent of the patients in general acute hospitals, is a national scandal. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to realise that the Government's changes to the way hospitals and health care are financed have not reduced the cost to the community. In fact, the cost will probably increase. But the Government is not returning its saving to the community. In the true spirit of its so-called new federalism the Government has thrust responsibility for the community health centre and school dental programs onto the States and has then refused to fund them directly. The Democrats would have increased real spending on health by about 7 per cent and funded community health centres and women's refuges. We would have also introduced a concessional card for pharmaceuticals for children under 10 years, elderly people 70 years and over and the chronically ill. The estimated cost of this initiative was $30m. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn briefly to social security. This Government has not increased unemployment benefits to unemployed people under 18 years of age since 1975. If they had risen with the consumer price index they would now be about $64 a week. Instead, they are still only $36. The Government is very proud of having increased from $3 to $8 a week supplementary assistance payable to pensioners who pay rent. However, in future, pensioners who receive assistance as public housing tenants will not receive a supplementary grant, so many of them will not be better off. The Government has also decided to amend the Social Services Act 1947 to prevent payment of unemployment benefits to the spouse of persons engaged in industrial action. In our view this is inhumane and confrontationist, and we will oppose the amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> To have in one Budget such a massive increase in the tax take and, at the same time, a massive squeeze on the essentials of life is in our view, reprehensible. Not even the most right wing, conservative President in the United States since the Herbert Hoover has increased taxes while slashing spending. At least he has substantially reduced taxation. This Government has done the exact opposite. It has had the temerity to hit the ordinary man both ways. It has taken from him and reduced what it is giving back to him. No Government should be allowed to get away with this approach. The Democrats will not stand by and allow it to happen without taking some action. We have given undertakings to the Australian people not to block Supply and we will honour those undertakings. We will also not interfere with government revenue raising because it can be argued that to stop government revenue raising is tantamount to stopping the Government spending it. The Democrats are not prepared to act in the same disgusting manner in which the conservatives brought about elections in 1974 and 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate does, however, have the power to amend Appropriation Bill (No. 2), although it may not increase the total amount the Government plans to spend. For example, the allocation to the States for public housing could be increased at the expense of the new Parliament House or the capital program for the Australian Atomic Energy Commission. The Democrats have no intention of abrogating their rights as senators to amend this Bill and other Bills with which they fundamentally disagree. Our undertaking not to block Supply can in no way be construed as affecting our freedom to act as we see fit in moving amendments to Appropriation Bill (No. 2) and other Bills. We believe, however, that the first step the Senate should take is to request the House of Representatives to alter its Budget strategy to spend more on housing by reducing the size of the $1.5m surplus. If the Government takes no heed of such a request from the Senate we will make it clear that we intend to move to amend Appropriation Bill (No. 2). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I would first like to congratulate you on being elected as President of the Senate and I also extend congratulations to the Deputy President who has recently left the chamber. I say, firstly, that I am deeply honoured to take my place in the Senate and to speak in this debate on behalf of the Opposition and my party. The debate on the Budget gives members the chance to range broadly in their treatment of individual issues. I intend to take full advantage of this privilege but in commencing my remarks I will make some general philosophical comments about my own presence in this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say at the outset that I regard it as a great honour to represent in this Parliament the Australian Labor Party and the people of South Australia who selected me as their member to follow in the footsteps of my friend and colleague, Reg Bishop. As a newly elected member one has to look very seriously at the privileges and the obligations of parliamentary life. Some argue that the Parliament is no longer relevant and that the answers to political problems lie outside the institution of parliament. It is my firm belief that with all the faults the parliamentary system has served the Australian people well. I see no substitute for it if the Labor Party is to achieve its great goal of social equality. </PARA>
<PARA> I have served my apprenticeship in a number of occupations. This is only the beginning, I hope, of the apprenticeship I will serve in this Parliament. Before looking in some detail at the broader issues I would like to take the Senate back to my apprenticeship in the car industry and afterwards to the time when I worked as a representative of those workers in that industry as a trade union official. That is an experience which many members of the Labor Party have had before me. A number of my colleagues who have since retired served their industrial training and received their early grounding in politics in the vehicle industry. I refer to Mr Fred Birrell, who was the member for Port Adelaide, and two former senators, Clem Ridley and Jim Toohey. But for the dedication to hard union politics stimulated by car industry life I am sure I would have never made my way to this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> At this point I would like to indicate that besides spending most of my working life in the automobile industry, I was born in the mid-north country town of Clare in South Australia where my parents had a vineyard and later a business. Before I go any further I wish to express appreciation to my children, Luke and Lindy and to Shirley Lewis and her daughter Tracey, who are all present tonight, as well as to other members of my family for their assistance and understanding over many years. I also indicate that three former members of parliament have travelled from Adelaide to be with us this evening. They are Mr Clyde Cameron, the former member for Hindmarsh, his brother the former Senator Donald Cameron and former Senator Jim Toohey. To those loyal and dedicated members of the Australian Labor Party in South Australia I extend my sincere thanks for their support and assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the car industry. I believe that massive industry unemployment would follow if the Industries Assistance Commission proposals to rationalise the industry were put into action. Once again the IAC had lived up to its nickname of the Industries Assassination Commission. Some of the recommendations of the report are: An end to the industry's manufacturing plan from 1985; an end to the 80 per cent share of the market reserved for locally produced vehicles; an end to quota restrictions which presently stand at 20,000 units; tariffs to be wound down from 57 1/2 per cent to 35 per cent between 1985 and 1990; components to suffer a similar reduction in duty; export facilitation to be increased by an additional 10 per cent, on top of the 7 per cent, due to come into operation by the end of 1985 as already announced; passenger vehicles derivatives to be reduced from 45 per cent to 35 per cent by the end of 1988; CKD components to be treated as components; and component producers to be granted 20 per cent credit for imports. These recommendations will leave the industry wide open to a flood of imports which would have a devastating effect on employment. Even the IAC's own figures show that employment in the whole of the industry has been slashed in the past five years by 25,000 jobs. The removal of quotas will accelerate this trend. As we have seen already over the past 12 months, imports have increased dramatically, aided by the appreciation of the Australian dollar. </PARA>
<PARA> In the whitegoods industry, where quotas do not exist, the market share held by Australian produced washing machines has fallen by 11 per cent over the last 12 months. This was due to appreciation of the dollar and dumping of goods by Japan. The same thing will happen to the motor vehicle industry if quotas are abolished. Of course, importers point out that prices of cars would come down-but for how long? Only until overseas companies had achieved a satisfactory market share. The cost to those Australian families whose livelihood depends on this industry would be enormous. In my State alone between 15,000 and 20,000 jobs directly involved in motor vehicle or component manufacture would be threatened, increasing the State's unemployment rate to over 11 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The South Australian economy is highly dependent on the motor vehicle industry. Nearly 20 per cent of the State's manufacturing work force is dependent on motor vehicle assembly or component manufacture. Even the study by Professor Parry of the University of New South Wales, commissioned by the importers group, admits that Adelaide will be a major problem when it comes to coping with job losses caused by IAC recommendations. The demise of motor vehicle manufacture in South Australia will have repercussions for the rest of the State's economy and through multiplier effects thousands more jobs would be threatened. Indeed, the South Australian Liberal Government's Minister of Industrial Affairs stated that a further 80,000 jobs would be lost in South Australia through these multiplier effects. This would be disastrous for the people of South Australia. I believe we should resist to the bitter end any attack on employment in the industry through the proposed restructuring. </PARA>
<PARA> The people aspect of this industry has not been considered at all by the IAC. This is despite the fact that the employees' representatives in the industry, the unions, have appeared before the Commission on numerous occasions and put that point of view. Neither the IAC nor the Liberal Government is interested in what happens to people. I believe it will now have to be up to the Labor Party and the unions to demonstrate that the people are the most important part of the industry's wealth and of the country's resources. The IAC is content to put the profits of the multinationals first. But what it does not take into account is the cost in human terms. It is not only a question of the cost to the economy of an additional 30,000 people on the dole queue, but also a question of the loss of skills within the community and a loss of manufacturing capacity and design and technical skills which are vital in the maintenance of a strong manufacturing base and for essential defence industries. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the Government should be called upon to initiate a national inquiry into the effects on employment of the proposed changes announced by the Government. The IAC's proposed changes make earlier proposals look like chicken- feed. The time for a national inquiry is ripe. There is no family which has not been affected in some way by Fraserism. Apart from the IAC proposals, Australian workers will suffer greatly from the combined effects of the razor gang, the decision to reduce Federal grants to the States, interest rate jumps and increases in taxation. The Fraser Government claims it is fighting inflation, but something is drastically wrong with its formula. As it slashes away at Government spending, inflation is not falling but rising. The consumer price index rose by 7.6 per cent in 1979-80 and 8.8 per cent in 1980-81 and is predicted to increase by more than 11 per cent in the next 12 months. Of course, the figure which the Government uses to measure inflation, excludes petrol and hospital and medical costs. The best measure of inflation across the economy is the gross non-farm product deflator which rose by 10.7 per cent in 1980-81, considerably higher than the 8.8 per cent claimed by the Government. One-fifth of all inflation which has occurred since 1975-and this was before the latest change in health insurance-has been caused by Government decisions. Goods which cost $1 in June 1976 had inflated to $1.63 by June 1981. Twelve cents of this increase has been deliberately added by Government decisions, such as the petrol pricing policy, which has helped to depress the car industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's oil parity pricing policy under which petrol prices have risen by more than 74 per cent in the last three years, has made a major contribution to the rate of inflation. The average Australian family is now paying $5.60 a week more to use its car than it paid a year ago. This policy has added more than $11 billion to Government tax revenue since it was introduced and this year alone it will add a further $3.4 billion. This Government has been deliberately using world oil prices to tax Australians for oil which comes mostly from Bass Strait. Of course, what it does not tell us, is that the price of petrol in Canada, which like Australia produces a significant proportion of its oil needs, is considerably lower than in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to health. The change in the health insurance system has brought this country back to the situation which existed in 1971 before the Whitlam Labor Government introduced Medibank. Workers will now be paying up to $11 a week for basic family health cover to provide the minimum security for their families in the event of sickness or injury and this includes those families which are just a few dollars above the cut-off line for free health care. This money is going to an array of inefficient privately-owned health insurance funds which are making profits out of people's health. A single more efficient government-owned health scheme could provide the same service at a much lower cost to the public. Australians have been deliberately misled by this Government's propaganda machine. They are paying a fortune just to choose between a variety of inefficient health funds which essentially provide the same service. The West German health system makes ours look like a backyard operation. </PARA>
<PARA> On the subject of health, industry is under threat much more from an overall decline in workers' health than from unions or strikes. The figures show clearly that more people lose time at work through sickness and injury than through strikes. For every day lost because of strikes, one or two days were lost through industrial accidents, three due to alcoholism and seven due to other sickness. Workers and families need protection through a universal and cost efficient insurance scheme, which Medibank was before Fraser and his gang dismantled it. Also, I believe that the scaling down of Government-owned enterprises not only would further prove a false economy but also would cause great distress among workers employed by such operations as the Australian Government Clothing Factory in Coburg and the Ordnance Factory at Bendigo which have been listed for cut backs and closure. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of wages, while resisting worker demands for higher wages on the ground that they cannot afford them, the bosses continue to give themselves generous increases. The latest figures show that chief executives' wages increased by 14.8 per cent during the last 12 months-exactly double the indexation rise paid to the workers. These figures were contained in a six-monthly survey by Chandler and McLeod Consultants Pty Ltd, which reports on salaries and executive remuneration. The survey, across a range of managers from foremen to managing directors, showed that all of them had greater pay rises in 1980 than in 1979. The range of salary increases to the bosses was 52.7 per cent greater than the indexation increases to the workers in more than half the cases. The companies even had the cheek to say that the indexation decision had been a major factor in the fixing of their own increases. They clearly used indexation as the starting figure and built on that. Indeed, if the Government had got its own way, and real wages had not increased in the last 12 months, retail sales and economic growth would have suffered. Clearly, the increase in real wages contributed substantially to economic growth in 1980-81-about 70 per cent of gross domestic product growth.</PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the question of employment and I particularly refer to the unskilled young. Continuing unemployment could form a new underclass of have-nots. Such a class could be a destabilising element in society, producing problems like those now being experienced in Britain. What some believe is happening is the formation of a new underclass of people who are permanently out of the mainstream of society. They will not have the education or skills to get a foot on the ladder. The new underclass which some people thought would emerge could easily be a group of disspirited young people not able to get work at the beginning of their careers and possibly no longer suited to work after a few years of unemployment. We may find a high proportion of the young at the most energetic period of their lives aimless and without anything to do. The abandonment of the Community Youth Support Scheme will only exacerbate the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Recent statements made by the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown) show that he has a total lack of understanding of the problems facing young unemployed people. Unless there is something more concrete done, we face the prospect of their being sufficient numbers of young unemployed people to act as a destabilising element in society. If we want very vivid evidence of how quickly this can become a problem, we have only to look at Britain. Jobs have to be generated, not just an array of dressed up training schemes which are designed only to give handouts to employers. The National Employment and Training scheme is a prime example. It has been exploited by employers seeking to make a fast buck and get cheap labour, while the training aspect has often been neglected. Other schemes seek to equip young people with more skills, but they still do not give them jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only are young people out of work, but also the number of jobs available to them has been declining steadily. Over the last 15 years, the number of full time jobs for young people in the 15 to 19 age group has declined by nearly 100,000. At the same time, there has been an increase of about 250,000 in the number of youngsters in that group. The decline has been particularly severe for females with 24 per cent of their jobs disappearing as against 6 per cent for males. I, along with a lot of other people, have visited schools and spoken to students who say things like: 'I won't have any trouble getting a job, it's a matter of trying hard' and 'kids who don't get jobs and have gone on the dole are bludgers. I'm not going to be one of those. I'm going to be one who really goes out and finds a job.' One cannot help but be a little sad at seeing this tremendous optimism the kids have about to be crushed by the realities of the job market. </PARA>
<PARA> Not only has there been a decline in the number of jobs available to young people but also the nature of the jobs has changed. Between 1966 and 1980 the number of full time jobs for young males declined from 319,000 to 299,000 whereas part time jobs increased from 19,000 to 62,000. For girls, the number of full time jobs has declined from just under 300,000 to 228,000, and part time jobs have increased from 17,000 to about 83,000. Youth unemployment had existed for some time, but until the mid-1970s it had been offset by an increase in the number of students retained in schools. It was only after the mid-1970s, when the retention rates in schools began to level out, that the full impact of the loss of jobs became obvious. Despite the Government's claims about growth in employment, it remains a fact that unemployment among young people has grown. It now stands at about 15 per cent for males and about 19 per cent for females. Unemployment rates tend to decline with age. Of those who leave school at 15 years of age, 27 per cent are unemployed; at 17 years of age the rate is 18.9 per cent; and at 19 years of age the rate is 12 per cent. At 24 years of age the rate is 5 per cent. A person is very vulnerable if he leaves school at age 15 from year 9 or 10. His chances of being unemployed are more than one in four. They are even higher for a girl. </PARA>
<PARA> Technological change also seems to be increasing the disparity between the haves and the have-nots. The middle jobs are the ones which have been turned over to automation-word processors, for example. There has also been a decline in the number of people working as labourers. Unskilled and semi-skilled workers are the first to go when new technology is introduced. If this trend continues, the labour market will be increasingly biased against low achievers, particularly the young and the less highly motivated. There is no doubt that increasing technology will have an even greater impact in the next few years. Production levels can be increased without the need to increase employment levels. The Government has totally ignored this problem and urgent action is required. Under the Fraser Government's policies, the prospects are for increased youth unemployment, not decreased. The alternative is a coherent, workable youth policy. Even so, we will have difficulties which will require the community, employers, unions and government working together towards finding a solution. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to this year's Budget. The 1981 Howard Budget will do absolutely nothing to solve the nation's problems. It will only lower people's aspirations, cause greater unemployment and poverty in the community and create increasing industrial chaos. The gap between the rich and poor will become even greater. The ordinary people of this country are paying for the so-called resources boom through higher interest rates, higher income tax, increases in indirect taxes and increases in State charges brought about by the reduction in Federal grants to the States. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has deliberately increased interest rates to restrict the growth in money supply which was largely brought about by the massive inflow of speculative money from overseas. The tax increases are also part of this strategy and have created a $1,500m Budget surplus which could be used to provide jobs for the young and unskilled and reduce the burden of increasing mortgage repayments on Australian families. It is interesting to note that while personal income tax collections are expected to increase by 22 per cent in 1981-82, company tax collections will increase by only 10 per cent. These tax increases can only serve to depress an already faltering economy. Growth of gross non farm product fell from 6.1 per cent in the first half of 1980-81 to 1.6 per cent in the second half of the year. Unemployment between June and July 1981 increased by 25,000, while it decreased over the same period in 1980. Also, the number of people receiving unemployment benefits increased by 3,060 or one per cent between June 1980 and June 1981. This clearly indicates that unemployment is increasing once again. The trend has not been reversed as the Government would have us believe. </PARA>
<PARA> Increasing sales taxes in the current environment of rising interest rates and State charges will only reduce people's ability to spend and will cause even more hardship for pensioners. It will result in a massive slow down of industry causing unemployment to increase further in the next 12 months. The sales tax on building materials combined with interest rate increases will put home buying out of reach of thousands of Australians. It will severely hit the already depressed building industry in my home State and no doubt will also be felt in other parts of Australia. This Government is deliberately slowing down the economy to bring down inflation but it admits that the inflation rate will actually increase in the next 12 months. Clearly its policies are not working.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1980 Mr Fraser won government by promising tax cuts while running a fear campaign against Labor's alternative taxation policies. He has clearly broken that promise. This Government has alienated itself from the community and has totally neglected the needs of the average Australian. We as Australians should be looking to the future with pride and confidence. But under the current regime we are destined for increasing confrontation within the community, higher unemployment and a wider gap between the rich and poor. It is high time that the Fraser Government realised that this country's greatest resource is not its mineral wealth, but its people. </PARA>

I do not think the Honourable Clyde Cameron will find the Senate as lively as the House of Representatives was when he was in full spate there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will now turn to the subject of the Budget and in particular the aspect of interest rates. It is time we got away from some of the cant and hypocrisy talked about in relation to interest rates and got down to serious thought about the problem. It is a problem particularly for home owners with large mortgages and small equity. I will come back to that problem in a moment though it is worth pointing out right away that not everyone loses from high interest rates; lenders gain from high interest rates and many lenders are small people, much more so than many of the borrowers. A reduction in interest rates would result in a drop in the value of the insurance, superannuation and savings of many small people. </PARA>
<PARA> Without in any way trying to minimise the difficulties that high interest rates have created for many home buyers we must not pretend that there are no advantages on the other side to offset the difficulties and sometimes hardship being caused by high interest rates. Of course, it is not only housing that is affected by high interest rates. For instance high interest rates cause inventory run-down as businesses cut overdrafts by carrying less in the warehouse. This of course has a chain reaction throughout supplies and so on. Two things must be said, and said again and again, about interest rates. Firstly, interest rates are the price of money. Short term interest rates are governed by the ordinary laws of supply and demand; the commodity in this case being the available money. Secondly, interest rates cannot be separated from other parts of the economy. Interest rates are inextricably related, for instance, to money supply and to government Budget policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Why are interest rates so high? Can government action bring them down? If they cannot be brought down generally, can and should they be brought down selectively-on housing loans for instance? Let us look at each in turn. Why are interest rates so high? In many ways our present economic situation is the envy of many other countries. Real economic growth last year was 3 per cent. According to the Budget Papers growth is expected to be 3 1/2 per cent this year though the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development predicts a rate of 4 per cent as compared with one per cent for the OECD area as a whole. Real wages grew by 4 per cent last year though this is too high to be sustained. The strengthening in our economy is expected by the OECD to be broadly based but private investment spent on resource industries is regarded as a particular source of strength. This impressive growth comes at a time when most OECD countries are having no growth or even negative growth. Of course, out of growth comes more to share. </PARA>
<PARA> In the modern democracy it is very difficult to make a no growth economy work. This is the so-called zero sum society. In a zero sum society if we want to give more to a deserving group we have to take it away from another group which usually resists successfully. The result of the successful resistance is endemic inflation. The only way this Government, or any government, can achieve desirable social objectives is through sustained economic growth. This is being achieved by this Government. It would be destroyed by Australian Labor Party policies. The second favourable economic indicator is inflation. Last year inflation was 8.8 per cent, well below the OECD average and below the average rate for our trading partners. The third favourable economic indicator is unemployment which is coming down sharply. Employment has risen by 2.3 per cent in each of the last two years. Business confidence is up. We have enormous opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course there are problems. We must not let the so-called boom get out of control. Inflation is edging up. We must not try to distribute now the proceeds of investments which will not yield anything for 10 years or so. If we tried to do this wage demands could explode as they did during the Whitlam years. Of course, interest rates are much higher than we would like. In this Budget the Government has firmly faced these problems and used the budgetry weapons at its disposal to head off the dangers. The key weapon in controlling inflation is limiting the growth in the money supply. Of course, a Labor Party government would let the money supply blow out as it did in the Whitlam years when it hit an annual rate of increase of 27 per cent. This sort of thing might bring a temporary dip in interest rates but of course before long inflation would soar and interest rates would follow. This government, of course, is more responsible. </PARA>
<PARA> To head off the dangers of increased inflation and a wage explosion the Treasurer (Mr Howard) is aiming for an increase in the money supply of not more than 10 per cent to 11 per cent. Money supply growth is determined by the size of the domestic borrowing requirement of the central government, private sector foreign exchange transactions and a net increase in bank lending less net sales of government securities for the non-bank public. All these either are, or are potentially, under government or Reserve Bank control, though the relevant statistics and controls are perhaps somewhat slow acting. So much for the supply side of the supply-demand balance which determines short term interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> What about demand? The Government has taken two very significant actions to ease the demand for money. The Budget strategy is designed to dampen down just a little the so-called resource boom atmosphere in favour of more controlled, steady growth. Of course, this will ease the pressures on the money supply and interest rates. Even more importantly, we are moving to reduce government demands for money market funds. These demands include those of State and local governments, as well as our Commonwealth Government demand. In fact, last year their share of the public sector borrowing requirement was almost twice as large as ours. This year the Government has budgeted for a domestic surplus of $1,500m and has contained new loan programs to a level which is 4 per cent lower, in real terms, than that of last year. This will mean a sharp reduction in the public sector borrowing requirement and, again, will reduce pressure on interest rates. On the other hand, the Australian Labor Party, by its attempt to prevent the collecting of $500m in sales tax, would increase the public sector borrowing requirement and therefore increase interest rates. The crocodile tears that its supporters are shedding about interest rates are the purest hypocrisy. I suggest that it would be irresponsible, and probably impossible, for the Government to do more than it is doing in regard to interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA> A Labor Government in Britain tried to put a strait-jacket on interest rates by saying that they must not exceed a certain level, which, of course, was below the market rate. The obvious thing happened. Various substitutes for money arose outside the market and other liquid assets took the place of money. In fact, the British did not manage to reduce the effective interest rates for the benefit of those most in need, who had to use other sources of borrowing and finished up paying much higher interest rates than they would have paid if the Government had not interfered in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be obvious to everyone that a government cannot control both the money supply and interest rates. It can control one or the other but not both. This Government is committed to controlling the money supply as a vital weapon in the battle against inflation. Therefore, we cannot control interest rates generally, although we can help to keep them down by reducing the Government's demand on the money market. That we are doing. But, I repeat, Governments cannot control both the money supply and interest rates. They try to do so only at their peril and at great economic cost to the community. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4H4">Senator HAMER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, the suggestion was that they would be reduced, but as a reflection-not an action by the Government. If governments cannot control interest rates generally, what about doing it selectively? Can it be done? The answer is yes, but probably at great cost to everyone else and quite possibly to the harm of the people whom a government is intended to help. The trouble is that if you hold interest rates down artificially in particular areas, such as housing, people will put their money somewhere else. If banks and building societies cannot get the money in, they will not be able to lend to home buyers. Would-be borrowers will then have to go elsewhere for their money and will probably pay exorbitant interest rates in so doing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The problem was well summed up by Mr R. B. Cameron, Director of the Australian Bankers Association, when he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Savings bank deposits showed little growth, in real terms, during 1980-81. </PARA>
<PARA>He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Low deposit growth means a low level of lending for housing. Savings banks will be able to provide a strong flow of housing finance only if they are able to set rates of interest in line with those applying in the market-place. Savings banks still do not have sufficient competitive freedom. In fact, due to official controls, savings bank housing loan interest rates have risen over the past three years by much less than have other interest rates. </PARA>
<PARA>The problem has also been clearly recognised by the New South Wales Housing Minister, Mr Sheahan, who, when approving an interest rate rise on permanent building society home loans, quite rightly said that building society interest rates on housing loans had to go up, because, unless building societies were competitive and able to attract their share of investments, home loans would dry up. </PARA>
<PARA> We saw proof of this, both last year with savings banks and this year with building societies, when interest rates charged by these two institutions were too far below other rates. In the six months to June 1981, savings bank deposits, excluding interest, fell by $112m compared with an average increase of nearly $150m in the corresponding periods of the two preceding years. For building societies, the total sum deposited between December 1980 and June 1981 was $165m. This can be compared with a corresponding intake in the previous year of $855m-a drop from $855m in one year to $165m in the next. The drop in home loan approvals was even more dramatic. </PARA>
<PARA> A study done recently for the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System pointed out that trying to hold down interest rates on housing loans did not just fail to help low-income earners get housing loans. It also resulted in their being the very group which suffered financially. I do not want to underrate the burden of extra costs that high interest rates impose on home buyers. However, we should not completely lose perspective about the impact of these costs. A person on average weekly earnings who took out a mortgage of $30,000 three years ago at an interest rate of 10 per cent would have seen his mortgage payments rise by about $54 a month over the three-year period. However, his after-tax income would have risen over the same period by about $226 a month. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course not everyone can afford adequate accommodation unless assistance is provided by the Government. I make it clear that at the moment I am not talking about welfare housing for people who cannot otherwise afford housing. Some State housing Ministers are demanding several hundred million dollars more for welfare housing, apparently primarily in order to help the house building industry. Unfortunately, it is most unlikely that it would actually help them. The Government would have to raise the necessary funds on the money market and the competition would push up the interest rates for intending home buyers. The housing industry might well find that it had lost as much or more on the roundabouts as it had gained on the swings. In any case, welfare housing is a separate issue. I am talking of assistance to ease the financial strain on people who can afford, or nearly afford, to buy a house. What about direct assistance for them? Is it needed, and what sort of assistance would be effective?</PARA>
<PARA> During the last three years the number of houses completed has been rising steadily-117,000, 129,000 and 135,500 in successive years. It appears that this year the figure will drop to not more than 125,000. That is certainly well below the capacity of the industry, but is it below the needs of the community? The Housing Industry Indicative Planning Council calculates that we need at least 146,000 new houses a year. Its calculations are detailed and persuasive, though they rest on the critical assumption that the proportion of the community which owns a home should remain as it is. Most of us would agree with that assumption because of the great importance that is attached to home ownership as a crucial factor in our social structure. What, then, is the best way to give the housing industry the nudge that it needs to push its output of houses built and sold from 125,000 to 146,000 a year? We do not need massive support, of hundreds of millions of dollars, to do this. But, I do think some support is justified, although I do not want to sound like the United States senator who said: 'A billion here, and a billion there; why, it soon adds up to real money'. If we want to encourage the construction and sale of 20,000 more houses a year, the obvious group to be helped is first home buyers with modest family incomes. I see no need to help those who are 'trading up' to larger or more ostentatious houses. I think over the years people have developed rather grandiose ideas of what sort of houses they need and what is often being demanded may well be beyond the ability of the individual, or the community, to afford. The other thing we must do in any scheme to help home buyers is to avoid imposing any additional demand on the money market, because that would almost certainly be counter-productive. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the best solution is to take the $74m we now spend each year on the Homes Savings Grant Scheme and give it as an interest subsidy-by my calculations we could give up to 6 per cent-to first home buyers for the first two years or so of their loan. The subsidy would be subject to means testing of family incomes and apply only to the purchase of modest homes. The Homes Savings Grant Scheme does little to encourage house purchase. It comes along nine months too late, and tends to be used for furnishing rather than purchasing the house. </PARA>
<PARA> I think a case could be made for referring the problem to the Industries Assistance Commission. After all, we are looking for a scheme to help an industry-the housing industry-and the IAC is set up to advise the Government on just that subject. The aim should be a very modest one: How to help the housing industry increase its output by between 10 per cent and 15 per cent. But that is not what many people are proposing. What is suggested is that there should be massive direct assistance to housing borrowers. All sorts of questions have to be answered about this. Why housing, and not, say, cars or business inventories, for that matter? Bearing in mind that some people would be lenders as well as borrowers, surely to qualify for interest assistance account would have to be taken of their net borrowing-lending position. If we were to adopt the proposal that has been widely canvassed-making housing interest payments tax deductible-how would we cope with the criticism that this would be very regressive, of much more value to people with expensive homes and high incomes? Such a scheme was tried by the Whitlam Government and it failed hopelessly. For all these reasons I am not persuaded that any general subsidy on housing loans is justified. </PARA>
<PARA> But it must be admitted that although we are taking action by macroeconomic policy which will reduce interest rates, they may never come back to the levels of ten years or so ago, even if inflation is reduced to the level it was then. This is because, for many years, low real interest rates on home loans were made possible only by low real returns on savings. The growing competition for savings and the increasing financial sophistication of the community now make such a situation most unlikely to recur. Insurance offices cannot depend any longer on tax privileges to compensate them for near zero real interest rates on insurance savings. The funds have now become aggressively return-oriented. What is more, 10 years of inflation have taught savers to look to high interest rates to protect the real value of their savings. So quite apart from the temporary pressures imposed on interest rates by the present restrictive monetary policy, long run factors are operating to raise the real cost of borrowing for home purchase. It is only too easy to demand lower interest rates and be damned to the consequences. The consequences are clear enough. Taxation would have to be increased by about $600m a year to offset the shortfall caused by a tax concession for mortgage payments. The diversion of an increased proportion of the available funds to the housing sector would mean that all other borrowers-businesses, hire purchasers and so on-would have to pay higher interest rates than they otherwise would have to pay-the inescapable law of supply and demand at work. The real cost of capital therefore would rise and our economic growth rate would be lower-housing is not a profitable investment. The poor would be worse off; they never benefit from house ownership subsidies. The wealthy would benefit. I do not think these consequences are acceptable, and I believe that bowing to the lower interest rate campaign would do a great deal more harm than good. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the needs of housing are important, and the problems of some home buyers are very real. I have been trying to put them into perspective. The increased general affluence which will come from economic growth is the best way of keeping good housing within the reach of the widest sector of the community. The Government is working to achieve this growth, and a firm priority on fighting inflation is vital. Our policies will continue to be tailored to that fight. </PARA>

<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>This Bill will provide legislative authority for the entry into force of a comprehensive double taxation agreement with Denmark which was signed in Canberra on 1 April 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> The agreement deals with all substantial forms of income flowing between Australia and Denmark and is the second such arrangement that Australia has entered into with a Scandinavian country. </PARA>
<PARA> When it is assented to, this Bill will complete the processes needed for the agreement to be given the force of law in Australia. Denmark has already completed the processes necessary there. </PARA>
<PARA> Double taxation agreements have two principal functions-the elimination of international double taxation and the prevention of fiscal evasion. </PARA>
<PARA> The first of these involves the apportionment, by one means or another, of the relevant taxation revenue between the contracting countries. </PARA>
<PARA> There are various ways of doing this. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, some types of income are, by agreement, taxed only in the country of residence and others only in the country in which the income has its source. </PARA>
<PARA> The country of source may agree to limit its tax on some items of income and where, under an agreement, income may be taxed in the country of source and also in the country of residence of the recipient, the country of residence agrees to allow relief against its tax in recognition of the payment of tax to the country of source. </PARA>
<PARA> The agreement with Denmark accords in all essential respects with the position that Australian governments have taken over the years in relation to double taxation agreements. </PARA>
<PARA> It provides for the country of source to limit its tax on dividends, interest and royalties. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia and Denmark will each reduce the withholding tax on dividends flowing to the other country from 30 per cent to 15 per cent of the gross amount of the dividends. </PARA>
<PARA> The tax of the country of source on interest or royalties flowing to residents of the other country is to be limited to 10 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's rate of withholding tax on interest is 10 per cent and this will not be affected by the agreement. However, we do not have a withholding tax for royalties paid overseas. These are taxed on the ordinary assessment basis. The limit on the tax on royalties will, therefore, only affect Australian tax on royalties paid to Denmark where tax on the ordinary assessment basis on the profit element in the royalties is greater than 10 per cent of the gross royalties. </PARA>
<PARA> The tax limit applying to interest and royalties will not affect income of those kinds derived by residents of Australia from Denmark while, as is the case at present, Denmark does not impose a general tax on interest and royalties paid to non-residents. However, if Denmark should impose tax on such income in the future the limit will, of course, apply. </PARA>
<PARA> A significant effect of the agreement concerns Australian resident individual shareholders who are beneficially entitled to dividends from companies resident in Denmark. It is provided that these shareholders are to receive the benefit of a credit from the Danish Government equivalent to one to which individual Danish shareholders are entitled. </PARA>
<PARA> Within Denmark it is broadly the situation that part of the tax paid by a Danish company is treated as taxable income of a Danish shareholder who receives dividends from the company and a credit for this amount is then allowed against the tax that the shareholder is liable to pay. </PARA>
<PARA> In defined circumstances Australian individual shareholders in Danish companies will, under the agreement, be entitled to a similar credit. This will mean that an Australian shareholder entitled to the credit will receive a payment from the Danish Government. </PARA>
<PARA> For Australian tax purposes, the sum of the dividend and the credit will be treated as a dividend and credit will be allowed up to the amount of the Australian tax thereon for the 15 per cent Danish tax. </PARA>
<PARA> The agreement contains measures for the formal relief of double taxation of income that may be taxed in both countries. The country of residence of the taxpayer is obliged to provide the necessary relief. </PARA>
<PARA> So far as Australian residents in receipt of income from sources in Denmark are concerned, income in respect of which a limit is imposed by the agreement on Danish tax will be taxed here with credit being allowed for the Danish tax. However, dividends received from Denmark by Australian companies, which are effectively tax-free in Australia, will remain tax-free here.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The Government has decided to appoint a royal commission to inquire into the Australian meat industry. As the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) indicated in his statement yesterday, allegations of malpractice have been made into aspects of the meat industry and evidence of malpractice has been produced which give rise to serious concern on the part of the Australian industry and Australian consumers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Government is responsible for the maintenance of standards in the meat export industry, but the problems appear to go wider than this, and into areas of State administration. A Federal royal commission necessarily has powers limited to the area of Commonwealth responsibility-the export of meat. The Government therefore has invited all States to issue the royal commission with concurrent powers which would enable it to examine the meat industry in relation to human consumption and other uses domestically. The Victorian Government has already indicated its intention to take this action, so the royal commission will cover at least the handling of meat for domestic purposes in that State. His Honour, Mr Justice Albert Edward Woodward, O.B.E., will head the royal commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The royal commissioner will inquire into the following matters:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Whether administrative arrangements and procedures for the supervision of the handling of meat for export are adequate to ensure that all meat exported from Australia meets the requirements prescribed by law;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) whether malpractices are occurring, or have occurred, in the handling of meat for export or the exportation of meat;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) allegations made, whether in public or to a Minister, department or authority of the Commonwealth, of malpractices alleged to have occurred during the past 10 years, in the handling of meat for export or in the exportation of meat;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) whether such allegations were dealt with in a manner that was adequate and effective; and</PARA>
<PARA> (e) whether in response to such allegations, any illegality or corruption occurred. </PARA>
<PARA>The royal commissioner is directed to make such recommendations arising out of his inquiry as he thinks appropriate, including recommendations regarding the legislative or administrative changes, if any, that are necessary or desirable. He is authorised, at his discretion, to defer his inquiry into any matter that is the subject of a police investigation or of criminal proceedings in a court. Further, if the Governor-General so approves, he may conduct his inquiry in combination with any inquiry that he is authorised to make by any commission issued by a State or States. </PARA>
<PARA> The royal commission will report not later than 1 September 1982. The Government is fully seized with the urgency of this matter. However, it is also important that the inquiry be thorough and wide-ranging. The royal commission will be authorised to make interim reports as appropriate. The royal commission is separate from the management inquiry announced by the Minister for Primary Industry to review practices and procedures in the documentary and physical control of meat destined for export. Measures have already been taken to tighten control of procedures. The management review by independent consultants will check these procedures and report urgently whether anything further needs to be done in this field. The royal commission is not prevented from commenting also on any aspects of this area that seem to it to require remedy; but because a royal commission is necessarily a longer process, this intermediate step is being taken to verify the effectiveness of the control procedures now in place. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not need to emphasise to the Senate the urgency and importance of this matter, concerning as it does an industry vital to the prosperity of the country. It is the Government's wish that this inquiry satisfy the Australian public that all available measures are being taken to protect and preserve the Australian meat industry. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am indebted to the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) for pointing a finger at a national problem. The statement just brought down by the Minister in relation to the crisis, if I can so describe it, in the meat export industry is an important one. There are many qualifications which the Opposition has about the matter. I think it is our proper function-indeed, it is of some importance in the context of the future of this industry-to make those qualifications and criticisms quite clear. The beef industry is one of Australia's great national industries and has been for many years. Almost overnight it has lost the reputation which it has built up over many years-since the time of the first settlers in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The value of the beef industry as a whole to Australia last year was in the order of $1.2 billion. The industry is one of our great traditional export industries. It provides the livelihood directly of farmers and of workers in the transport industry, in meat processing, in retailing and in the shipping industry. It is also one of the classic examples of necessary co-operation between public and private enterprise and between government and private industry. Private enterprise is represented by the labours of farmers and public enterprise, one would hope, is represented by the diligence of public servants in supervising the meat trade to see that what is offered to consumers both in Australia and abroad is genuine. In a matter of days the reputation of this great industry has been shattered. </PARA>
<PARA> I again emphasise the importance of government responsibility in the regulation of private industries. Government responsibility extends to securing the reputation of a whole industry and to making sure that private entrepreneurs within that industry do not bring discredit upon their fellow producers and private entrepreneurs. It is an important question because so many times in this Parliament we debate absurd ideological assumptions based on government withdrawing from sections of private enterprise activity. It is argued that private enterprise activity by its own virtues will produce a desirable result for this country as a whole. This is a classic example of an industry in which government inadequacies in the last few years-I use the expression 'government' broadly-in providing regulation and supervision of the industry have resulted not in private industry improving the reputation of this country as a meat exporter but in exactly the opposite. </PARA>
<PARA> The effects of what has happened can be summed up by a few examples of financial loss which have personally been brought to my attention. For example, exporters holding chilled beef have incurred losses of up to $100 a head for certain types of beef, and those losses will have to be carried. There has been a rapid fall in the demand for manufactured beef. I was informed that in one provincial city in New South Wales a processor who normally produced 10 tonnes of processed meat a day has had his output reduced to 7 tonnes and it is still falling. He now has to look closely at retrenching staff. In Victoria alone, my State, some 2,000 meat workers will lose their jobs for periods of up to a month. I speak with some concern as a Victorian senator. I am sure other Victorian senators are concerned. Victoria is in the eye of the storm of economic disaster in this country because the Victorian meat industry is in a particularly prominent position in the crisis which affects this nation's reputation in export markets. </PARA>
<PARA> Overseas the implications of what has happened still have to be borne. Questions that arise include whether Australian beef in future will be singled out by importing countries for more vigorous supervision. That would mean added cost for our exporters and farmers. The questions that arise from a scandal of these proportions are innumerable. The paramount ones are: Has there been any cover-up? Has there been a cover-up of the involvement of Ministers or the inadequacies of Ministers in the administration of their portfolios? Has there been a cover-up of the activities or inactivities of public servants? We on the Opposition side say frankly that there is little that can be retrieved from this mess in a national sense at this stage. It is to be hoped that whatever can be retrieved will be retrieved by diligent and fast government action and also by the appointment of the royal commission. We believe that primary producers and others directly involved will demand forceful action and that the real culprits, those at the top, pay the price for this disaster which has befallen a great industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I make those comments at the beginning because they are relevant to the terms of reference of this inquiry which were announced in the statement read by Senator Chaney on behalf of the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon). It is important that the context of this inquiry be properly seen in the terms of the damage which has been done to a great industry, the damage which has been done to this country, and of the individual suffering which has been produced as a result of what has happened. The royal commission must offer a central solution to some of the problems that I have adverted to. Unfortunately, it will be a year before the royal commissioner produces his report. An extraordinary section of the Minister's statement occurs on page 3, where it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is fully seized with the urgency of this matter. However, it is also important that the inquiry be thorough and wide-ranging. </PARA>
<PARA>Of the two elements which are of crucial importance in this statement, the first is urgency-and the matter is urgent. It is urgent for cattle producers throughout Australia, it is urgent for the reputation of this country and it is urgent in respect of our national export earnings. But it is also important, as the statement says, that the inquiry be thorough and wide-ranging. It is not particularly urgent if it is not going to report until September 1982. More importantly, it will not be thorough and wide ranging under the terms of reference that are suggested in the Minister's statement. In the year until the royal commission is asked to report, the beef industry will unfairly face yet another 12 months of trauma. In the last decade the cattlemen of this country have seen their industry climb from the depths of despair to relative prosperity. Survival in the middle to late 1970s was a desperate thing for many cattlemen but, having pulled through that period, the worst recession in the industry's history, the beef producers of this nation are being betrayed now by those who seek, with all the rigour and energy at their disposal, to delay further this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> What has been presented to us in the context of the terms of reference suggested tonight is a half baked inquiry which will take a year. I refer briefly to the proposed terms of reference of the inquiry. The royal commissioner will be confined by these terms of reference to inquiring about the meat industry at the point of export. Anyone who knows anything about the meat industry in Australia will have known for a very long time that the problems occur through the vast chain of middlemen between the primary producer and the exporter. The problems are in that long chain of middlemen involved in the various processes, which might be described as almost broking processes, of the meat processing industry. On a proper construction of these terms of reference, the royal commissioner will not be able to inquire into those matters. He will be able to examine only at the point of export. The Government seeks to take comfort from that limited allegation by the reference to the constitutional power of the Commonwealth Government, by the suggestion that the Commonwealth effectively can inquire only under the export power at that time. I draw the attention of the Senate to the capacity which the Commonwealth Government has under the trade and commerce power and under the corporation's power to look at this industry at a much earlier stage. </PARA>
<PARA> The second thing I wish to say about the terms of reference is that the royal commissioner is limited to allegations which are made. For example, in paragraph (e) of the terms of reference the royal commissioner is invited to inquire into whether in response to such allegations any illegality or corruption occurred. I am sure Senator Chaney will agree with me when I say that that is an extraordinary sentence by any standard-'whether in response to such allegations, any illegality or corruption occurred'. Quite apart from the language of the proposal, the royal commissioner is required throughout these terms of reference to look at allegations which are made and then to respond to those allegations. Under these terms of reference he is not authorised to call for departmental files in order to engage in his own inquiries about the nature of the industry. He is required under every term of reference to look at allegations that have been made. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister says it is a misunderstanding. I am looking at the statement. There may be all sorts of interpretations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These terms of reference are structured very narrowly. We say that they would not produce satisfaction in the beef industry as a whole and that they are designed narrowly in order that the Government will get a narrow result after an examination which will take some 12 months. We regard the terms of reference as inadequate. We do not regard them as sufficient in terms of examining the industry as a whole. This is not just a crisis in relation to the export market. We argue that the possibility for examining the domestic market is excluded. The inquiry should be much more wide ranging than the terms of reference provide. One should be suspicious of terms of reference as narrow as these. Because of our concern about these matters and the concern of the industry as a whole that the inquiry be as wide ranging as possible I wish to move an amendment to the motion for the Senate to take note of the statement. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add, 'but the Senate is of the opinion that the terms of reference of the proposed Royal Commission should be amended to inquire into-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) whether legislative, administrative or other arrangements and procedures for the supervision and control of all relevant stages leading to the export of meat from Australia are adequate to ensure that all meat exported meets legal requirements and protects Australia's export markets;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) whether malpractices are occurring, or have occurred in the preparation, processing or handling of meat for export or the exportation of meat;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) whether investigations in relation to information which was available or could reasonably have been available in relation to malpractices which occurred or are occurring or which were alleged to have occurred have been diligently pursued;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) if the answer to (c) is no, the persons, including ministers, responsible for that lack of diligence;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) if there were such persons responsible for lack of diligence whether such lack of diligence constituted illegality, corruption or impropriety. </PARA>
<PARA>These wider terms of reference cover, beyond reasonable doubt, the sort of criticisms we have heard about the narrowness of the present terms of reference. In moving the amendment I briefly draw the attention of the Senate to the differences between the terms of reference proposed by the Government and the proposed amended terms of reference. If the Government intends the royal commission to inquire into all stages of the industry leading to the export of meat from Australia, there is no reason why it should not say so in the terms of reference. There is no reason at all why it should not query whether legislative, administrative and other arrangements and procedures in all of those stages are adequate, if that is what it wants the royal commission to do. If that is what the Government wants members of the public who will give evidence to the royal commission to say then it should say so. There is no reason why the royal commission should not examine whether malpractices are occurring or have occurred in the preparation, processing or handling of meat for export. If that is the Government's intention in appointing this royal commission, why should it not state in the terms of reference that that is its intention? There is no reason why the terms of reference should be confined to answering allegations only. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was saying that there is no reason why those words should not occur in the terms of reference if it is the intention of the Government to have those matters examined. There is no reason why the terms of reference should not examine whether allegations about malpractices or investigations into malpractices have been diligently pursued, particularly when we have the head of the Federal Police in Australia making quite clear publicly that in his view those matters have not been diligently pursued. Those terms of reference should be specifically included for that reason. There is no reason why there should not be a proper examination of responsibility in relation to the matters which have been suggested in the earlier terms of reference which are the subject of the amendment I have moved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition has moved those amended terms of reference simply to draw attention to the inadequacies of the Government's terms of reference. In a highly volatile situation in relation to a very important industry it is most important that the terms of reference be couched as widely as possible and be as explicit as possible in relation to the matters which are concerning people in the industry. In our view the Government's terms of reference fail in this regard. This is not an exercise which concerns just this Parliament, where we can place our own charitable interpretations on terms of reference. It is an exercise which concerns thousands of producers in Australia and a once great industry. For those reasons one cannot be too specific or too clear about terms of reference which ought to be provided and about the intentions of this Government, which has failed to date in its administration of this industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Belmont Private Hospital in Brisbane is wholly-owned by Hospital Corporation Australia Pty Ltd, which in turn is wholly-owned by Hospital Corporation of America.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) In accordance with section 33 of the Health Insurance Act a daily bed payment of $16.00 or $28 for surgical patients is payable for each day on which a bed is occupied by an eligible person. The $16 or $28 daily bed subsidy is deducted from the patient's account and is claimed by the proprietor.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Hospital Corporation Australia Pty Ltd acquired the hospital in 1978. Information concerning the purchase price was received by the Government in the context of a foreign investment proposal and is treated as confidential between the Government and the parties concerned. No Government subsidy was paid in respect of the purchase of this hospital.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) I am advised that ministers of religion visit the hospital and a consulting room is available for their use. On arrival, they are required to report to the sisters' station. Patients are advised by public address system that a particular minister of religion is present at the hospital and is available for consultation. If a Minister wishes to consult with a particular patient the agreement of the nursing staff must be obtained. Patients, however, are not precluded from approaching a Minister during a routine visit.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) From the information available it is not possible to accurately determine the average length of stay of patients accommodated in the hospital. However, at a review in September 1980 it was noted that approximately 40 per cent of the inpatients at that time had been in the hospital for 6 months or longer.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Hospital Corporation Australia Pty Ltd owns one other hospital in Queensland, details of which formed part of the answer to Senate Question No 2024 published in the Hansard of 4 March 1980.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator Peter Baume</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>(1)-(8) The decisions of the Review of Commonwealth Functions concerning contracting out work to the private sector do not affect the operations of two of the authorities under my control, namely the Health Insurance Commission and the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Commission. These are trading organisations whose management decisions must always be based on commercial considerations. In relation to the Department of Health and the Capital Territory Health Commission action is in hand to respond to these decisions.</PARA>
<PARA> One of the decisions from the Review was for the manufacturing portion of the Department of Health's National Acoustic Laboratories to be carried out by the private sector with Australian firms tendering for the manufacture and assembly of hearing aids. The necessary documents have been prepared and it is anticipated tenders will be invited in the press in August 1981. Until tenders have been received it will not be possible to make any cost comparisons.</PARA>
<PARA> In both the Department and the Capital Territory Health Commission ways and means of contracting out other work to the private sector are being examined. Areas under consideration include cleaning, repairs and maintenance, printing and computer software. Whether or not work is finally contracted out will depend on the extent and content of responses received to public tenders when they are called.</PARA>
<PARA> In the context of the Review of Commonwealth Functions concerning contracting out the following considerations were noted-</PARA>
<PARA> Contracting out could be considered where:</PARA>
<PARA> the private sector can provide the services more economically and/or conveniently;</PARA>
<PARA> services are already provided by the private sector and using Commonwealth resources to undertake them would be to compete with suppliers of those services;</PARA>
<PARA> performance of a new function or continuance of an old one would involve an unacceptable level of new capital investment or increased expenditure in salaries or services;</PARA>
<PARA> there is a need for expertise in a specialised technique or access to specialised equipment which it would be uneconomical for the Commonwealth to acquire particularly for one-off short-term requirements;</PARA>
<PARA> use of external services could be expected to bring an objective viewpoint with the prospect of a high level of acceptability of findings;</PARA>
<PARA> services might be more appropriately provided by State or local government under contract to the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA>These considerations will be borne in mind by the Department and the Capital Territory Health Commission when assessing whether to contract out particular tasks or functions. Naturally, when making such decisions potential savings will need to be offset against any additional or hidden costs. Constraints may also flow from the requirement to ensure engagements meet the principles for fair competition, ability to withstand public scrutiny, effective services and value for money.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Health has provided the following information:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government considers that preventive activities have an important role in a proper, balanced health system. Various programs are directed at encouraging people to adopt a healthier life style, including public education of the effects of smoking, alcohol and drugs.</PARA>
<PARA> It is significant that under the health insurance arrangements operative from 1 September 1981, Commonwealth medical benefits are payable to insured persons at the rate of 30 per cent of the Schedule fee for all services, unless otherwise excluded by the Health Insurance Act. This arrangement recognises the importance of primary medical care, in particular, as provided by general practitioners, both as to the ongoing companion function of health care advising and the early detection of possible serious conditions that might otherwise result in more costly curative care.</PARA>
<PARA> Health funds are required by legislation to pay basic medical fund benefits in the same circumstances that Commonwealth medical benefits are paid. Therefore, funds cover services provided by doctors regardless of whether such services are of a preventive or a curative nature.</PARA>
<PARA> At one stage some health funds had rules that excluded benefits for routine examinations in the absence of disease. The Government considered that such rules may deny benefits for a legitimate medical check-up and could be an inhibiting factor in the practice of preventive medicine. Therefore, such rules were disallowed.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Education has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question.</PARA>
<PARA> The per student figures quoted by the President of the South Australian Institute of Teachers refer only to the Commonwealth's direct contributions to government and non-government schools through the programs administered by the Commonwealth Schools Commission. It is quite misleading to focus solely on the Commonwealth's direct contributions without also taking account of its indirect contributions via the general purpose grants to State Governments. The States receive about half their total income from the Commonwealth and thus the Commonwealth indirectly contributes about half the expenditure by the States on government schools.</PARA>
<PARA> In determining the level of its direct spending on government and non-government schools, the Commonwealth takes account of the support being given to each sector by the States.</PARA>
<PARA> When the total expenditure by both Commonwealth and State Governments on schools is examined it shows that over twice the amount is being spent on average on each pupil in government schools as is being spent on each pupil in non-government schools: a difference of over $1,000 per pupil.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Schools Commission has reported that, on average, the great majority of non-government schools have resource levels some 30 per cent below those of government schools.</PARA>
<PARA> The underlying objective of Commonwealth programs for schools is to assist in establishing and maintaining high standards in all schools. The programs reflect no greater priority for one sector of schools than for another.</PARA>
