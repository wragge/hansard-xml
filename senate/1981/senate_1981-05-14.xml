<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My attention was drawn to the remarks made by Senator Mulvihill in this chamber on 29 April concerning a magistrate to whom Senator Mulvihill referred as Magistrate Nichols. I gather, that in fact, he was referring to Mr W. K. Nicholl, a magistrate in the Australian Capital Territory. There is a special magistrate by the name of Nichols; but the criticism, I gather, referred to Mr Nicholl, who is one of the stipendiary magistrates. Mr Nicholl is a highly respected and competent magistrate. I am not aware of any justification for Senator Mulvihill's allegations that Mr Nicholl is perverting the course of justice in relation to traffic offenders in the Australian Capital Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Mulvihill's criticism of Mr Nicholl has brought forth very prompt statements on behalf of both legal professional bodies in the Territory. A letter from the Australian Capital Territory Bar Association appeared in the Canberra Times on 6 May and a similar letter from the President of the Law Society of the Australian Capital Territory appeared in the same newspaper on 12 May. I draw the Senate's attention to the defence of Mr Nicholl made in both those letters. I have received a letter from the President of the Law Society in which he has assured me that Mr Nicholl has the confidence of the profession in regard to his personal integrity, honesty and competence.</PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to the case upon which the criticism was based. I only wish to add that the penalty that was imposed was in respect of only one of six charges that had been laid. Two other charges were dismissed on the evidence and no evidence was tendered on the three other charges. I have known Mr Nicholl and have heard of his capacity as a magistrate since I have been Attorney-General. I must say that what I know of him and his reputation gives me every confidence in his capacity as a magistrate.</PARA>

Did the error appear in a printed release tendered by the Minister at a Press conference on 2 February this year? Why did the Minister, or some other person, at the same Press conference also change the estimate of NEAC about the lead time for development of the Rundle project from 8 to 15 years to 8 to 10 years?

Whether it was published or not I do not know, but I will seek to get the letter and the facts as the Department explains them and as they have occurred. An attachment representing the accurate picture of the NEAC report was wrongly typed in an ordinary typing transformation. It was nothing more than that. I was not aware that that was so.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would be very happy to do so. The answer is that in the course of the Press conference we made it clear that the report was some five or six months old and that estimates that had been made subsequent to that time had suggested that there may have been an improvement in lead time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would need to look at the transcript of that conference, but the fundamental situation was that there was a difference of some significant number of months-four, five or six months-and that my advisers had upgraded their sense of lead times. It was not any attempt on my part to alter the NEAC report. How silly it would be to contemplate that a Minister would be publishing a report and at the same time purporting to alter that report. To say it is to demonstrate the nonsense of the question.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I understand that agreement has not been reached on the matter that has been raised by Senator Kilgariff. Negotiations are continuing between Australian and Indonesian officials aimed at reaching a comprehensive agreement on delimitation of those maritime areas between Australia and Indonesia not covered by the two seabed agreements concluded in 1971 and 1972.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A third round of talks between Australian and Indonesian officials was held in Canberra from 4 to 7 November last year. The two delegations continued their discussions on the various areas between the two countries where there are outstanding questions of delimitation of maritime boundaries, including the problem of overlapping fisheries jurisdiction. In particular, these two delegations undertook a further detailed examination of and exchange of views on specific proposals advanced by each side in respect of these areas. It was agreed that both sides would give further consideration to the proposals put forward by each side.</PARA>
<PARA> I am informed that the Australian delegation, which included representatives from the Northern Territory and Western Australia, has reported that the talks were useful in clarifying the proposals of both sides, and that a further round of talks will be held at a mutually convenient time in the future.</PARA>

What is clearly determined is that the fortnightly forms which are required to be lodged will be lodged directly with my Department and not with the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs. The extent to which there will be any additional function in my Department or to which the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs will be left with responsibility with respect to administration of the work test is still a matter for detailed decision, as I understand it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Education. I refer to the establishment of the Australian Children's Television Foundation. Does the Minister recall that in February this year the Australian Education Council supported the establishment of the Foundation and appointed a steering committee which included two State Ministers of Education to assist in this establishment? As the establishment of the Foundation followed closely on a recommendation in the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts on children's television and as the Foundation cannot proceed without Commonwealth support, can the Minister give me an indication of the progress of the Foundation? In view of widespread public support for the Foundation and because of the urgency relating to quality children's television, will the Government take early steps to give encouragement and support to the Foundation?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1959" SPEAKER="Carrick Sen The Hon J.L." NAMEID="2U4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As the honourable senator said, the Australian Education Council, at its meeting in February this year, resolved to support the establishment of the Australian Children's Television Foundation. I confirm that the Council has agreed to the setting up of a steering committee convened by the New South Wales Minister for Education and the Victorian Minister of the Arts with a view to creating the Foundation. The Commonwealth has a representative on the steering committee. All States, except Queensland, have nominated members. The form the Foundation might take and the extent of its responsibilities will depend on agreement between the Commonwealth and the States, but it could be expected that the objectives of the Foundation would be consistent with the need expressed by the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts for an independent authority which would stimulate the production of programs available for children.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Until the report of the steering committee is available, I am not able to comment further on the ways in which a contribution by the Commonwealth might be made. This will be a matter for consideration by the Government when firm proposals have been formulated for the consideration of Commonwealth and State Ministers. The view was expressed at the February meeting of the Council that no assumptions should be made concerning the Commonwealth's attitude to the appropriate level of funding for the Foundation and as to the Commonwealth's share of participation. I will keep the matter under consideration for Senator Davidson. I know of his interest and leadership in this matter and I know of the work of his Senate Committee.</PARA>

Is it a fact that the Government's decision to sell the Australian Wool Testing Authority has been overwhelmingly rejected by woolgrowers throughout Australia? Has the wool commodity group of the Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association now added its voice to this widespread rejection of the Government's proposal? What ideological reasons lie behind the Government's dismantling of this profitable public enterprise which has a world-wide reputation, as evidenced by the support accorded it at the recent annual meeting of the International Wool Textile Organisation in New Zealand?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen some response to the proposal to sell the Australian Wool Testing Authority. Some of that response has been in negative terms. I have not made any attempt to find out precisely what the total response has been and therefore I am not in a position to say to the honourable senator that I am aware of the Tasmanian response to which he referred, nor can I say whether the totality of response has been in the terms which he indicated. The honourable senator seeks some guidance as to the ideological reason for selling a profitable enterprise. I would have thought it was quite well known to all honourable senators opposite and certainly well known to the Australian people that this Government is one which believes in private and not public enterprise. We believe if a function can be performed by the private sector it should be performed by it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suppose one of the side benefits of the whole exercise has been to disclose the differences between the political parties which are available to the Australian people. While the Opposition is happy to go before the Australian people as a proponent of public enterprise, we are very happy to go before the Australian people as proponents of private enterprise. We make no apology for that. We believe it will be a very important contribution to good government in this country if government concentrates on what only government can do and leaves to private enterprise what private enterprise can do.</PARA>

In view of the fact that the razor gang has abolished the Commonwealth Council for Rural Research and Extension, a body established in 1978 and announced at the time with great flourish by the then Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Sinclair, I ask the Minister: Why did the present Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Nixon, who was a member of the razor gang, agree to the axing of this body which was carrying out very important work in the interests of Australia's primary producers?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will seek information from the Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Nixon, in relation to the final part of the honourable senator's question because I am not able to answer him with particularity. There is nothing surprising in Mr Nixon's role as a member of the so-called razor gang in recommending the abolition of that particular body. The decisions on the Review of Commonwealth Functions were decisions taken by the Government as a whole, decisions in which all of us participated and with which we are all in agreement. The fact is that we undertook the task of fining down the Government's consultative mechanisms. The same thing was done with respect to my own Department in a way which I am sure will enhance the consultative mechanisms which we have. Of course, all Cabinet Ministers, including the previous Minister for Social Security, participated in those decisions.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not certain that I have all the information requested by the honourable senator. I understand that the Loxton District Nursing Home is a 31-bed home approved under the Nursing Homes Assistance Act and that it has applied for an additional 12 beds and for approval to operate a day care centre. The current policy applied to approvals under deficit financing arrangements authorised by the Nursing Homes Assistance Act is that organisations which are subject to control or financial support from a State government should not be approved for deficit funding. I think this is the centre of the issue which comes up in relation to the Loxton District Nursing Home. Honourable senators will appreciate that this policy is necessary to ensure that the States do not use Commonwealth provisions for deficit financing under this Act as a means of transferring their traditional financial responsibilities, with the Commonwealth then meeting the total operating deficit. This policy can be relevant in the case of the boards of cost-shared recognised hospitals which also conduct nursing home operations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am informed by the Minister for Health that the application of this policy currently is under review in the context of the Government's revised health care financing arrangements. The honourable senator will appreciate that there is some cross-over between the areas. This review will necessarily involve consideration of the continued eligibility for deficit funding of organisations already approved. Consideration of the Commonwealth's legal position will be incorporated within the review. I can assure the honourable senator that the Commonwealth's review of this matter will take into account total application of the relevant policy. In this context the Loxton District Nursing Home is not an isolated case but one of a number of cases which will be encompassed in the review. As I said earlier, a general issue of principle is involved.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The ribaldry of members of the Australian Labor Party on this question indicates that they fail to realise the significance of the tin industry to Tasmania, particularly northern Tasmania, and the significance of it to Australia. It is true that there has been a recent fall in the price of tin. As I understand it, it is due largely to reduced demand resulting from lower levels of economic activity in industrialised countries and a running down of stocks by users because of the prevailing high interest rates. The ability of users to purchase tin surplus to United States strategic stockpile requirements is no doubt also a factor. The honourable senator will be aware that the effects of Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries oil prices over the past years have reduced very severely the ability of nations to trade other than by paying high prices for oil.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The price of tin seems likely to remain weak, in view of the lower demand and the ready availability of supplies in the absence of agreement by consumer countries in the International Tin Council to increase the price range which determines the operation of the tin buffer stock. That price range was last varied, I understand, in March last year. Australia and other producers argued strongly for an increase this year-I think about a month ago-in the April session of the International Tin Council. However, no increase could be obtained in the face of concerted opposition by consumer countries. A major effort is being made by producing countries to redress this situation at the next Council session in July. Because of the very particular significance of tin to Tasmania, I will bring the substance of the question to the attention of my colleague the Minister for Trade and Resources and ask him whether anything further can be done.</PARA>

It is of importance that we should maintain within the Australian community a continuing attitude of general opposition to measures which we believe will be damaging to that community. The fact is that there is a real and proper concern in the community about levels of employment. The fact is that levels of employment in this country have been increasing steadily. We have been disappointed with the failure of the unemployment rate to drop in the way that one might have expected, given those increases in employment levels. I would have hoped that all honourable senators would be delighted at the very real reduction in unemployment evident in the most recently released figures. I notice that there has been a remarkable shortage of comment on those figures from honourable senators opposite, and, of course, they have not chosen to provide an opportunity for Government senators to make many speeches on that subject.

When the strike began before Easter, approval was given for the carriage by international carriers of the following classes of persons: Compassionate cases, Federal parliamentarians and other VIPs and people booked with the two domestic operators for trips connecting to or from international services. Priority was given to Qantas carriage. When the domestics returned to operations on Easter Thursday, approval was given for the carriage of domestic passengers on international services to cope with the first legs of the Easter rush, again with priority for Qantas. Return carriage was by the domestics.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When the strike was resumed after Easter the same initial approval for compassionate cases, Federal parliamentarians, VIPs and others in the course of international journeys was again given. When it became clear that the strike was not going to be settled quickly, the Government decided on 24 April to allow Qantas to carry domestic passengers suffering hardship. This included passengers stranded away from home, particularly at a great distance, and others with compelling reasons to travel. On 27 April the Minister for Transport announced a request to all international operators to carry other domestic passengers. This action was taken only when the protracted nature of the strike became clear. It is unlikely that Qantas being given priority for the carriage of people in the course of international journeys in Australia would have led to Qantas gaining an advantage over other international carriers on international legs. The great bulk of these bookings would have been made prior to the strike with international operators of the passengers' choice.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry. I overlooked that part of the honourable senator's question. I would not agree that that is an accurate summary of the position. The fact is that when the indexation of pensions was introduced the basis of the indexation was that the May adjustment would be made in line with the rise in the CPI for the half year to the December quarter and the November adjustment would be made in line with the CPI increase for the half year to the April quarter. Although that means a delay, it, in fact, means that in a period of declining inflation the actual adjustments at any particular time are likely to be in excess of an adjustment in line with the increase in the nearest quarter. Of course, in a period of rising inflation the reverse would be true. It is a matter of which measure one chooses to take. Those choices have been made because there is some delay in receiving the figures and because there is a need to have some time for the processing of changes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To take a very simple example-I do this merely to illustrate the point I am making-if the inflation rate in, say, the September quarter were 4 per cent, in the December quarter, 3 per cent, and in the April quarter, 2 per cent, and if one made the adjustment in May on the basis of the most recent figures one would have an adjustment of 5 per cent; whereas if one made the adjustment on the basis of the December figures one would have an adjustment of 7 per cent. So whether there is a benefit or a detriment to pensioners in choosing the basis of adjustment really depends upon whether there is a rising or declining rate of inflation. Of course, under the present Government in the main there has been a declining rate of inflation, for which we are duly thankful, our policies having worked to an extent towards that objective. Therefore, there has not been a detriment to pensioners in the system that has been brought in.</PARA>

If so, has the Government considered taking steps to ensure that pensioners living overseas are not maintained on benefits after their eligibility has expired due to improved health?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is true that in general there is portability of pensions and benefits in this country. That applies to invalid pensions, as to other pensions. That means that a person qualifying for the pension in Australia is free to leave, to live elsewhere and to continue to receive the pension. At times this can mean that he or she is receiving a lesser entitlement because, with respect to fringe benefits, for example, it is unlikely that any benefit will apply. So there may, in fact, be a smaller financial obligation upon the Commonwealth Government in that situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable senator in her question raised the difficulty of ensuring that the conditions for eligibility continue to be met. That, of course, is a matter that does have to be addressed. In fact, the eligibility conditions continue to be the same. Various steps are taken to check eligibility, as steps are taken in Australia. I cannot give the honourable senator the full detail in response to the question, but I can assure her that steps are taken to ensure that persons resident overseas do continue to have eligibility. I would not say, however, that we have a perfect system by any means.</PARA>
<PARA> We have before us the prospect of discusssions with various countries about reciprocal social service agreements. There has been a number of discussions to date and there will be further discussions in the future. I think an important element in those discussions will be the need to gain the co-operation of other countries in the maintenance of pensions payable to Australian pensioners overseas. This is an area where I would expect to see useful developments over the coming years. I cannot pretend that we could fix up overnight all of the problems there might be.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Social Security will recall that when the family allowance scheme was introduced by the Government in 1976 the Government described it as the greatest thing since lace-up boots, or words to that effect. Is the Minister aware that because of the ravages of inflation the value of the family allowance for a mother of four children has deteriorated by $657.60 per annum and that, by comparison with the old child endowment and tax rebate scheme, which was discredited and described by the Government and all concerned as being totally inadequate, under the current scheme a person with four children is now $352 per annum worse off? If the Minister is not aware of those particular facts, why is he not aware of them? If he is aware of them, why has the Government not done something about it?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course I am aware of the broad facts stated by the honourable senator and of the introduction of the family allowance in 1976, a change which certainly was regarded by the Government and spoken of by the Government as a major social reform. I would certainly so describe it myself. Before the major change that was effected in 1976-a change that I am sure Senator Harradine approved of-a substantial number of Australian families who did not benefit from tax deductions because they had very low incomes or no taxable income were left out of a substantial element of the assistance available to families to that time. They did receive the very low child endowment payment, but because they did not have a taxable income they did not receive the benefit of the tax deduction. One of the major effects of the 1976 change was to bring 300,000 low income families into the system in a full way, and that benefited some 800,000 Australian children in Australia's neediest families. So, the major element of that reform is the qualification that I would put on the sort of statistics that the honourable senator referred to in his question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is certainly true that because the family allowance has not been adjusted since 1976 there has been a decline in the real value of that allowance over that period. That is quite clear. I would, of course, not be arguing with that proposition contained in the honourable senator's question. As to those families who are at the poorest end of the spectrum in Australia, I think the generalisations made by the honourable senator in his question would not be true. It is true that even those poor families have suffered a loss in value. It would not be true, I think, that the level of assistance to them is less than it was prior to the introduction of this reform, when they were omitted from a large proportion of the help that was generally available to families.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government agrees that the position of families in Australia does need attention. Reference to that will be found in the Speech of the Governor-General when he opened this Parliament. I have indicated that the Government has under consideration the best means to extend assistance to families. A wide range of options is available to us, and those matters are under consideration. All honourable senators would be aware that I am not in a position to predict what might be in the Budget later this year. The Government has clearly indicated a commitment to families, and that commitment is one that we have under close examination at the moment.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment. It arises from a statement reported to have been made by Dr Robert Endean, of the Queensland University, that the taking of predator fish by spear fishermen has left 500 kilometres of the Great Barrier Reef open to attack by the crown of thorns starfish. Has government research thrown any light on the cause and effect of crown of thorns infestations, and in particular whether the starfish continues to pose a serious threat to the reef? What restrictions are placed on fishing and other human activities by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act to protect the reef from damage by the crown of thorns starfish?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen the statement reported to have been made by Dr Endean. The honourable senator will be aware that the Queensland Fisheries Service and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority undertook surveys of the crown of thorns infestation last year on reefs between Innisfail and Cooktown. Research to date has found no one cause, such as spear fishing, to which crown of thorns infestations can be attributed. Rather it is a multitude of causes that is more likely to be involved. Further investigations being developed by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority include a detailed historical study of previous crown of thorns populations and their relationships, if any, to human use of the reef. I think that is the key element.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Authority is concerned about the recent apparent increase in crown of thorns starfish populations. But it must be added that, despite years of considerable research, there is still no hard evidence to support the suggestion that large crown of thorns populations are the consequence of human activity on or near the Great Barrier Reef. The Authority will continue to monitor the crown of thorns situation and to support appropriate research programs into the key question of causes and possible controls. In view of experience with the starfish since 1960, we do not expect quick answers.</PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that the object of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act is to make provision for and in relation to the establishment, control, care and development of a marine park in the Great Barrier Reef region. Zoning plans for sections of the marine park established under the Act may make provision for the regulation of activities, including fishing of course, in those areas.</PARA>

<PARA>In so doing I draw to the attention of the Senate that this is another demonstration of those characteristics of indolence and insincerity which have become so much a part of the way of life of this Government. The average time for the non-appearance of a response to these reports, if one does one's arithmetic quickly, is 17 months. In respect of the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts on broadcasting, the time involved is nine months. In respect of the Joint Select Committee on the Family Law Act, the delay is nine months. The delay in the Government's response to a series of reports from the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations has been 14 months, 19 months, 27 months, 18 months, 15 months and 12 months respectively. The delay we have experienced in getting a Government response on the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence-the response still has not turned up-is 18 months. The delay on a response to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources is eight months. The delay on a response to the Joint Committee of Publications is 20 months.

The response to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment has been outstanding for 23 months. </PARA>
<PARA> On my calculations the average delay is over 17 months. I do not think we ought ever to forget the undertaking on the part of the Executive in this respect. I remind you, Mr President, and your colleagues of what was said on 26 May 1978 by Senator Withers, the then Leader of the Government in the Senate, expressly on behalf of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) who made a similar statement in the other House. This is what was said:</PARA>
<PARA> Henceforth, within six months of the tabling of a committee report, the responsible Minister will make a statement in the Parliament outlining the action the Government proposes to take in relation to the report. If the six month period expires during a parliamentary recess, the ministerial statement will be made at the earliest opportunity in the next parliamentary sittings. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The paper entitled 'Science and Technology Statement 1980-81' purports to be a statement on the Commonwealth Government sector in science and technology. It is a very comprehensive statement insofar as it embraces a number of departments and government activities. The statement is accompanied by two Press releases from the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Thomson) to which I will refer shortly. The Minister quite rightly reminded us that the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development pointed out that in future science and technology policy must be taken together with economic and social policy. That is a statement with which the Opposition profoundly agrees. What one must question in the light of a statement like this is whether the Fraser Government is in fact taking science and technology policy together with economic and social policy. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Opposition's view there is a major deficiency in tying industry policy to science policy. The Opposition agrees very much with the view that there is insufficient private industry research in Australia. All the figures point to that conclusion. That was pointed out by the OECD in its 1975 report, some six years ago, on Australian science and technology and it was also pointed out by Project Score. The OECD, in its 1976 survey, which I think is the latest comparative survey available, showed that the percentage of gross expenditure on research and development performed by business enterprise was, for example, in Australia, 41 per cent; France, 59 per cent; Germany, 64 per cent; the Netherlands, 58 per cent; Norway, 59 per cent and Sweden, 67 per cent. Expenditure in all those countries was substantially ahead of Australia. I refer to three other countries by way of example. Gross expenditure in Portugal was 27 per cent; New Zealand, 24 per cent; and Canada, 36 per cent. If one looks at those figures one notes that the countries with advanced sophisticated industries, including small countries like Holland, Switzerland, Sweden, Norway and so on, far exceeded Australia in the volume of private or non-government research and development in industry. It is only over industrially under developed countries like Portugal, New Zealand and Canada that Australia has a better performance, comparatively speaking, in the level of research and development done in private industry. </PARA>

I think the problem is that for cultural, political and standard of life reasons Canada and Australia tend to see themselves as developed countries, but I argue that in terms of a number of economic matters they are underdeveloped countries and the figures of expenditure on research and development are an indicator of that underdevelopment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The lesson I point to from these comparative figures is that there is a need for a proper industry policy in Australia as a prerequisite to business spending on research and development. There is also a need for a proper policy on technology transfer, a matter to which I have referred recently on a number of occasions in this House and particularly with reference to countries like Korea and Norway which have, compared with Australia, sophisticated policies of technology transfer. I argue-I hope in not too partisan a way-that the present Government has not a proper industry policy despite the recommendations of the report of the Jackson Committee to Advise on Policies for Manufacturing Industry, the report of the Crawford Study Group on Structural Adjustment and all the various other reports which have been commissioned by the Government and from which little results have flowed. One notes that according to the report of the Cabinet Review of Commonwealth Functions, the so-called razor gang, the Government is probably cutting out the industry committees with which it should be developing policies for industry, policies which would at least indirectly lead to greater capacity and interest in research and development in private industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister's Press statement which has been issued with the science and technology statement calls for Australian private industry to more than double its spending on research and development in this decade. I am reminded-if I may venture a classical allusion in the presence of Senator Puplick-of a claim by Glendower to Hotspur in Henry IV. He claimed that he could summon spirits from the vasty deep. Hotspur replied: 'Yes, of course, but will they come?' The Minister for Science and Technology is in much the same category in exhorting private industry to spend more on research and development. He is just leaving it at that. It is not sufficient merely to do so. That is a piece of empty rhetoric. One has to examine industry policies to see whence the encouragement for greater research and development by industry can come. </PARA>
<PARA> One's attitude to research and development in private industry should in my view be very much dictated by our attitudes to such factors as the resources boom. Industry policy in relation to the resources boom involves, in the view of the Opposition, the necessity to put some of the revenue gained from such a boom back into new industry in the manufacturing sector which will create permanent jobs and a permanent wealth generating capacity for this country. That in turn will depend on the level of research and development in which private industry is prepared to engage. The argument about research and development in the private sector is an argument about opportunities which we would argue exist. We say that the present Government is neglecting those opportunities by ignoring the education base for research and development. Australia has a contracting rather than an expanding education base in terms of research. That is a bad thing for the long term future of this country. The actions which have been taken recently, to which I have referred, again indicate a short-sighted approach to the issues of research and development spending in private industry, and particularly technology transfer. </PARA>
<PARA> It is that second matter of technology transfer to which I shall now refer briefly. I argue that there is a very real need for Australia to examine, for example, some of its patent laws and its trade practices legislation in relation to this matter. We can look advisedly to the experiences, as I have said before, of countries such as Norway and Korea in terms of their policies on technology transfer, both of which involve a slightly stronger stance by government insofar as the terms under which multinational or foreign capital is brought into those countries. Multinational capital is attracted to Korea, but on certain conditions. The conditions are that the results of basic research are made available to the Koreans who specialise in the area of applied research. In Norway the stricture has been that foreign capital in the oil industry is very welcome provided that Norway provides the technology and the infrastructure. The result of that will be the development of a net export industry in some 12 years time, when Norway will be able to export oil industry technology, at great benefit to Norwegian companies and to the Norwegian economy. Australia does not take that stance with the importation of foreign capital. No conditions are applied in those terms. We have a very subservient derivative economy in terms of our examination of the conditions under which foreign capital can come to this country. We make very few requirements. That may be good in the short term but it is not good for the long term future of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> In dealing with the question of technology transfer I again make the point that it is significant that Canada and New Zealand are below us in the level of private research and development because they share the same problems. They have a very high proportion of overseas ownership of their industries. They are great raw material suppliers-or have been-and they are great agricultural commodity suppliers. But they share exactly the same problems in their manufacturing industries. Their industries are dominated by multinational or foreign capital. In that context very little research is done in Canada by private industry. Industry there says: 'Why do we need to do this? We can borrow it from overseas'. That is a nice short term solution-a soft option-but it is not a long term answer to a country's economic and developmental problems. Canada, New Zealand and Australia fall into the category of underdeveloped countries in that they lack the capacity to do their own thing in technology transfer and research and development. That is because of the subservience to foreign capital on much the same basis as I argued before. The real challenge is not to export business; it is to create policies which change us from the Canadian, New Zealand and Australian situation to one which is more comparative with the relatively highly successful economies of countries such as Norway, Sweden, Holland and Switzerland. It is not sufficient to give lip service to that. It is desirable that policies be developed. </PARA>
<PARA> We argue that in respect of these issues the Government is pulling in a variety of directions. There is no coherent leadership or policy in relation to these issues. In 1976, for example, the Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, launched the Department of Productivity. He lauded the creation of the Department as something which would do great things for Australian industry and development. In fact, in answer to a question in the House he made the comment that it was a department which would be concerned with long term problems, not short term solutions. 'These problems will not go away', he said. I could not agree more. However, the Department of Productivity and its functions went away in 1980; it was abolished. Its remaining functions virtually went away at the behest of the razor gang. </PARA>
<PARA> However, as the Prime Minister rightly pointed out, the problems will not go away. It is a short-sighted, silly, short term and expedient solution to cut back on programs as the razor gang has done, for example, in relation to industrial management, productivity promotion and so on. I refer the Senate to page 33 of the razor gang's report, at which the Government's decisions on science and technology are set out. Far from displaying a serious and long term concern such as the Prime Minister did in 1976 about policies in this area, the razor gang's report provides a classic example of short term decision making. Moreover, in the first draft of the report, as it was released to members of the Parliament, a passage on that page was blacked out. It was reported that the razor gang had intended to cut a particular function, by way of government decision, but the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Thomson) threatened to kick up a tremendous fuss if pilot programs for innovation in industry were deleted. Thus, that proposal was blacked out of the report. </PARA>
<PARA> That is an example of decision making of a most bizarre kind. It is like bringing out a newspaper such as the News of the World to report the latest murder-although in this case it was not the normal kind of razor gang. To make such a decision about an important matter and have it changed at the last minute demonstates the degree of thought and consideration given by this Government to matters of long term policy. It is an example of the sort of policy making on the run that we do not want if these issues are to be addressed seriously in Australia. They may not seem terribly important at the moment but they are vitally important to generations of young children, to those as yet unborn, and to the lifestyle that they will have in Australia in years to come. </PARA>
<PARA> After 5 1/2 years of deliberation and numerous reports by the Australian Science and Technology Council and other scientific bodies, the Government is still making eleventh-hour decisions about science and technology in Australia. We are not in a position to make and afford eleventh-hour decisions. Press statements such as that of the Minister for Science and Technology in support of this science and technology statement are merely superficial and do not address the real problem. In 1976 it was arguable that, at least philosophically, this Government was on the right track in relation to science and technology policy-even if only on the basis of its recognition, in the words of the Prime Minister, of the fact that these were long term issues involving the future of Australia. As we have said on numerous occasions the razor gang has provided a classic example of the taking of short-sighted, short term initiatives, of decisions made on the run and changed even in the printing process. That is not the way to attain good government in this country, government which will benefit future generations and Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA> We again sound these warnings. No doubt they will fall on deaf ears but at least in years to come we can have the satisfaction of reading Hansard and of thinking that we were probably right. Accordingly, I commend the reading of this report on science and technology to the Senate and hope that more serious account will be taken of some of the issues raised in it than has so far been apparent on the part of the Government. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish briefly to refer to an answer that was given to a question today concerning the starfish problem of the Great Barrier Reef. As Senator Button has said, much of what is uttered in this place falls on deaf ears. I recall debates taking place in the Senate on the control of the starfish problem of the Great Barrier Reef and requests being made of the Government to display more interest in it and to accord it a higher priority. Although I have not read the Marine Sciences and Technologies Research Grants Scheme report, I take it that the amount of money available for research has been increased. The answer that Senator Baume gave this morning, after all these years, showed no understanding of the problem. If, after that passage of time, we have not appreciated the desperate situation faced by the reef it is a very sad state of affairs indeed. I have moved that the Senate take note of the paper so that it will be placed on the Notice Paper. We can then debate whether the amounts made available for research into this problem of the Great Barrier Reef are suitable. I know that Senator Bonner would be interested in such a debate, as should all Australians and particularly Queenslanders. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The paper makes a correction to the annual report of the Australian Heritage Commission for 1979-80. I do not want to place this matter on the Notice Paper. However, the paper states:</PARA>
<PARA> The statement on page 2 left-hand column ''During the year the Government determined a ten year moratorium on oil drilling . . .''. should be replaced with:</PARA>
<PARA> 'During the year the Minister for Science and the Environment the Hon. David Thomson, M.C., M.P., reaffirmed the Government's commitment to protection of the Great Barrier Reef from damage caused by human activity. He referred to the Prime Minister's statement of June 1979 when Mr Fraser announced that there should be no further exploration for petroleum in the Great Barrier Reef Region and that there should be no renewal of pertroleum exploration permits in the Region until the results of both short and longer term research were known. In the same month the Prime Minister and Premier of Queensland confirmed that it was the policy of their respective Governments to prohibit any drilling on the Reef, or any drilling or mining which could damage the Reef.'</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very important statement. The statement should have been included in the report, as the correction states. We are almost at the end of another financial year, with another report almost due, and the Senate is advised of a correction-and it is a substantial correction. I would like some explanation from the Commission as to why it took so long to bring this important correction before the Senate. For a correction to reach us almost at the end of May in the year following the annual report seems to indicate that something is wrong with the administration and organisation of the Australian Heritage Commission. I hope that criticism is taken note of. It is a criticism which is not alone in the Senate with regard to the lateness of reports. But this is astounding. I cannot understand why we should suddenly have a piece of paper notifying a very important correction 11 months after the event. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the replacement of the Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission by a Commonwealth Legal Aid Council. For convenience I shall refer to these bodies as 'the Commission' and 'the Council', respectively. The Bill gives effect to a decision of the Government which was announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) following the recent Review of Commonwealth Functions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission was established in 1978 pursuant to the Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission Act 1977. It does not itself provide legal aid but has a range of functions related to the scheme for legal aid to be provided by State and Territory commissions. The Commission's functions, which are set out in detail in section 6 of the Act, provide overall for the Commission to have an advisory, co-ordinating and monitoring role. In particular, the Commission has the functions of keeping the need for legal assistance in Australia under review, of making recommendations to the Attorney-General and to the State and Territory Commissions, of collecting and publishing statistics, of undertaking research and of furnishing an annual report for tabling in Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Act provides for the Commission to consist of a part time chairman, a full time deputy chairman and six part time members. Two of those members are to be nominated by the Attorney-General and two by the Attorneys-General of the States which have established commissions providing legal assistance in respect of Commonwealth matters. One member is to be nominated by the Law Council of Australia and one by the Australian Council of Social Service. The Commission has the assistance of a separate staff, which is under the control of the full time Deputy Chairman. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the Commission's many functions are, of course, of greater significance than others. The Commission itself has recognised this. It has also recognised that its resources are not unlimited. It accordingly resolved last year to adopt an order of priority for its various functions and to confine its activities normally to the functions of greater significance. Briefly stated those functions are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Collation and analysis of statistics;</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Liaison with professional bodies and with national community interest groups;</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Examination of the basis of Commonwealth Government financial support for legal aid;</PARA>
<PARA> 4. Research relating to the need for legal assistance, the functioning and effectiveness of other schemes and new methods of financing and providing legal assistance;</PARA>
<PARA> 5. Convening meetings with representatives of State and Territory Commissions;</PARA>
<PARA> 6. Maintenance of a library and clearing-house of legal aid materials and publication from time to time of a newsletter; and</PARA>
<PARA> 7. Matters specifically requested by the Attorney-General. </PARA>
<PARA>In introducing the present Bill I want to stress, as I did in answer to a question asked by Senator Evans without notice on 26 March 1981, that there is no intention on the part of the Government to reduce its commitments to the level of legal aid or the commitments it has made in agreements with the States to maintain the level of activity of legal aid. I want to emphasise that it has always been the policy of the Government that no person should be denied legal aid because of lack of means. This is a continuing aim of the Government and is evident from annual appropriations for legal aid, which, excluding Aboriginal legal aid, have increased from $19.6m at the time the first State legal aid commission commenced operations in Western Australia in April 1978 to $26.9m in the current financial year-an overall increase of some 37 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government does not question the desirability of an independent Commonwealth body with functions broadly similar to those to which the Commission itself has resolved to give priority. The Government is concerned, however, that the structure and working arrangements of that body should be dictated by efficiency and economy. In the light of experience since the establishment of the Commission the Government has concluded that there is room for improvement in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two main and related causes of concern with the present arrangements. One is that the functions of the Commission overlap those of my Department, with consequential duplication of effort in some matters and uncertainty as to responsibility in other matters. The uncertainty also presents difficulties for the State commissions. Those problems are accentuated by the other cause of concern, which is the separate staffs of the Commission and my Department. The existence of two separate staffs dealing with the same or closely related matters makes for unnecessary bureaucracy and is uneconomic and inefficient. In saying this, I am not, of course, reflecting on the capacity or dedication of individual officers. My concern is exclusively with the system in which those officers have to operate. </PARA>
<PARA> With these considerations in mind the Government has concluded that the Commonwealth's legal aid body, while retaining its independence, should have a closer working relationship with the Attorney-General and his Department. To avoid the problem of overlapping functions I have mentioned it is proposed that the body should confine itself to advice and matters incidental thereto, leaving the Department to attend to matters of an executive nature. It is also proposed that staffing assistance for the body should be provided by the Department instead of by a separate staff. In recognition of these changes, which are expected to result in significant cost savings, it is proposed that the new body be named the Commonwealth Legal Aid Council. In respects other than those I have mentioned the Council will be very similar to the existing Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> The membership of the Council will be the same except that:</PARA>
<PARA> There will be no full time Deputy Chairman; members at present appointed on nomination (including two nominated by participating States) will be appointed instead after the Attorney-General has consulted with the bodies which at present do the nominating. Experience has shown that the present provisions are unduly restrictive and inflexible; and</PARA>
<PARA> Appointments will be by the Attorney-General instead of by the Governor-General. </PARA>
<PARA>The functions of the Council will be broadly those which the Commission is now performing. Some functions will be exercisable on the Council's own initiative but these can be supplemented by ad hoc requests by the Attorney-General. The functions are expressed in broad terms in proposed section 5 of the Bill. In the course of performing those functions the Council will, of course, undertake research, assisted as appropriate by officers of my Department or consultants. </PARA>
<PARA> Functions to which the Commission has given priority are those of maintaining a library and providing a clearing-house of legal aid materials. It gathers those materials and circulates them to legal aid agencies and interest groups. These are very useful functions and they will be continued by my Department consulting as appropriate with the Council. The collection and analysis of statistics will be similarly continued by my Department. The Council itself will be required to provide an annual report for the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Council will not have the functions of making recommendations to State commissions. While the Commission has had the power to make such recommendations, it has seldom exercised it in practice. Where it is appropriate for matters to be raised with State governments or commissions, it is better that they be raised by the Attorney-General or by his Department. The functions the Commission has under the Commonwealth-State agreements will be taken over by my Department. In particular, the programs and estimates of expenditure of State commissions will be submitted to my Department, which in any event, must be closely involved in all budgetary matters. The States with which the Commonwealth has entered into such agreements-Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia-have agreed to these changes. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned earlier, the Council will not have a staff of its own but will be serviced by staff of my Department. To meet the increased workload that will be imposed on my Department, some of the present staff of the Commission will be absorbed into the Department. The placement of other staff will be considered after consultation with the Public Service Board and staff associations. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to place on record my appreciation of the work of the foundation Chairman of the Commission, Sir John Nimmo, the present Chairman of the Commission, Mr Justice Else-Mitchell, the past and present members of the Commission and the staff of the Commission for their loyalty and dedication and for the work they have done since the Commission commenced operations. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

It may be argued that what is listed on the business sheet now is a substitute for General Business. A whole series of first readings of Bills is listed. Those debates cannot refer to any item on the Notice Paper. If the debate refers to an item which is firmly entrenched in the Notice Paper a point of order could be raised. Even though there is a flexibility for honourable senators to debate a variety of matters the opportunity for General Business has been again taken away. I was going to say that it has been abandoned. I still make the point that it ought not to be taken away so early in the piece.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I again lodge my strong objection to the taking away of senators' rights by Government Business taking precedence of General Business. My colleague Senator Cavanagh would have done the same as I am doing now if he had not been called out of the chamber on urgent business. Over the many years Senator Cavanagh has been a senator, he has always protested against the Government's taking away the rights of senators, particularly back bench senators, to indulge in debate on Thursday evenings under General Business, whether it be a debate on reports on which a motion that the Senate take note of the paper has been moved and the debate adjourned to a later day or on matters of importance to senators of which they have given notice. Senator Cavanagh is back in the chamber now. I am very pleased to welcome him back. He can speak for himself. His meeting must be over.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Looking at the Notice Paper and the items listed under notices of motion, I see that I have no fewer than eight notices of motion which I wanted to see come forward for debate because they are very important matters to my State of South Australia. Most of them deal with unfulfilled promises made by the South Australian Liberal Premier. I think they need to be aired in this place. Whilst most people say that this is a States House, I dispute that. It does not operate along those lines. While it is said by Government members that it is a States House, I intend to make use of it and air State problems in this place. I want to raise those matters which I consider are very vital to the economy of the State. They ought to be aired in this Federal Parliament. Because of the decision of the Government to take away General Business tonight no opportunity will be available to have these matters aired until we come back in the Budget session. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chipp and Senator Mason, I think last Thursday when we debated the same motion that Government Business take precedence of General Business, gave warning to the Government that it will not be able to get away with this sort of thing as soon as we come back for the Budget session because the numbers will be on this side of the chamber if the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats combine to uphold the rights of members. So the Government should have taken warning from what Senator Chipp said. I hope that he sticks to the statement he made. Without delaying the Senate unduly I say again that I want to place on record my strongest protest at the actions of the Government so early in the piece. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to refer to just one other matter which was referred to by Senator Evans; that is, the non-appearance on the business sheet today of the Freedom of Information Bill. Senator Evans might be of the view that the Bill is not listed because some of the debates have been dragged out. I would not agree with him if that is his thought. My view is that the Government does not want this Bill to come on for debate. I read in the Press today that this matter was raised in Cabinet yesterday and the decision was that the Freedom of Information Bill was to be brought on for debate. Apparently, like other things which appear on the Notice Paper, it has disappeared from the business sheet. </PARA>
<PARA> We have only to look at yesterday's to see what was put in front of us. We were to debate the motions for the first readings of the Pig Slaughter Levy Amendment Bill, the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill and Appropriation Bill (No. 3). Let us look at today's Notice Paper. It is just like playing draughts. The people in the office of the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Carrick) must be having some great fun with the way they are moving about the Bills listed on the Notice Paper. Today Appropriation Bill (No. 3), which yesterday was the third of the Bills listed for debate on the motion for the first reading, is listed first under Orders of the Day. The Excise Tariff Amendment Bill is now listed after Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and takes precedence over the Pig Slaughter Levy Amendment Bill. With the way that the order of Bills on the Notice Paper has been altered in this place even during a day, I am beginning to wonder whether we will get on to debating the Bills in the order in which they appear now. The Pig Slaughter Levy Amendment Bill easily might still be put back and be debated before the other two Bills. I again lodge my strongest protest at the action of the Government in taking away the rights of back bench senators. </PARA>

I have fought on this matter for 16 years-three years of my 19 years were exempted because the situation did not apply-on every occasion it has happened. It is the routine of the Government. I feel so strongly about this matter, knowing that I could never succeed while I remained in this place, that I am retiring this year to let Janine Haines from South Australia take a place here. During the short session she was a senator she voted against the taking away of General Business. I made that sacrifice for the purpose of justice in this matter.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Cavanagh has stated very frankly that he has fought and protested against Government Business taking precedence of General Business on Thursday night for only 16 of the 19 years that he has been in the Senate. Of course, during the three years when his party was in government he would have had the attitude held by all governments that I have heard of and had experience with. At this stage of a session governments seek to intrude on time otherwise granted to private members by giving precedence to Government Business. It seems that, no matter how much we try, it is a feature of any parliament under any government that there is a bank-up of government legislation at the end of a session. The fact is that a great deal of time has been granted to private members' business throughout this session and, indeed, other sessions. It is wrong to think of private members' business being confined to Thursday evenings. Private members are able to bring forward matters of public importance or urgency motions on numerous occasions. They frequently make use of the opportunities provided by the adjournment debate. Under our system they are provided with very many opportunities and they quite rightly make full use of them. We are talking about an exceptional and a very short lived restriction of one of those rights.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I have said, this situation has occurred traditionally. It has been only a very minor intrusion on those rights. I think the fact that Senator Cavanagh, with all his eloquence and determination, has not been able to rectify this situation over the 16 years that he has been trying to do so indicates that there is a fairly widespread recognition that the Government is putting forward a reasonable proposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me comment on Senator Evans's question. I think Senator McLaren is also interested in this matter. The fact that the Freedom of Information Bill has not been placed on the order of business sheet today is not a ground for coming to any of the conclusions that Senator Evans has postulated. During this week we have not made the progress with legislation that it appeared likely we would make. Yesterday we did not complete the program for the day. The appropriation Bills are becoming more urgent at this time of the year and, in any event, such Bills must be given absolutely top priority by the Government in any session of Parliament. Perhaps when I was speaking earlier about the rights of private senators, I should have mentioned that a large number of senators are taking advantage of their rights to speak in first reading debates. The Government does not seek to curtail that right, but a number of senators still wish to speak on the first reading of Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and on the first reading of another money Bill. In order to get those Bills through the Senate today it seemed necessary to give them first priority. We estimate that they will fill the day's program. As I have said, consideration of another Bill was not completed yesterday. We could have placed the Freedom of Information Bill on the program for consideration after the Bills to which I have referred had been disposed of, but it seemed to be an unrealistic exercise. People may have prepared unnecessarily for a debate which was very unlikely to be brought on. That is the only reason for the Freedom of Information Bill not being placed on the order of business sheet. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another factor, although it is not conclusive. The Government has not yet completed its consideration of the very large number of proposed amendments to the Freedom of Information Bill that have been tabled. Certainly, if we had time today we could have proceeded with the Committee debate ahead of that final consideration. A number of amendments could be dealt with promptly. However, I am sure that the Government will complete its consideration of the amendments before we meet again in 10 days time. We have in mind that in the first week after Parliament resumes we may be able to get a reasonably lengthy run at the Bill. If we have some hours of Committee debate-I do not know whether we will be able to complete the debate in that time-we ought to have some indication of how long it will take to deal with the remainder of the Bill. I hope that we will be able to break the back of the questions to be considered in the series of proposed amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> The position is quite clear. There has been much unnecessary speculation about it. Senator Evans has raised it again today. I do not criticise him. He is properly entitled to ask what is going on in relation to the Bill. I hope that I have been able to make it clear that the Government hopes to provide time for the Senate to debate the Bill. It appears from the way in which the legislative program is shaping that we will have time to do so in the first week after the break. Of course, it all depends on how much time senators wish to devote to other pieces of legislation. The Government has great faith in private enterprise and market forces. If large numbers of senators wish to speak on other pieces of legislation, I am afraid that the Government cannot do anything about it. We must bow to the numbers and deal firstly with the matters to which the majority of senators give priority. </PARA>

<PARA> The statement and speeches read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>I will be introducing today various Bills pursuant to the Commonwealth's obligations under the co-operative companies and securities scheme. Before I discuss the individual Bills, I would like to outline, for the benefit of honourable senators, the administrative and legislative context in which the Bills will operate. </PARA>
<PARA>Formal Agreement on Companies and Securities</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The formal agreement executed by the Commonwealth and all the States on 22 December 1978 provides the framework for a co-operative Commonwealth-State scheme for a uniform system of law and administration regulating companies and the securities industry. The scheme covers the relevant law operating in the six States and the Australian Capital Territory. There is also provision for the scheme to be extended to the Northern Territory and to the external territories of the Commonwealth. Background material on the formal agreement and on the four basic elements of the co-operative scheme is set out in paragraphs 7 to 36 of the explanatory memorandum on the Companies Bill which has been circulated to honourable senators. The basic aim of the scheme is to ensure that wherever possible, any person or company should be able to deal on all general companies and securities matters as if that person or company were only subject to one system of law and administration throughout Australia. The co-operative scheme thus provides a framework for uniform general laws on companies and securities matters that will apply throughout Australia. It was, however, never intended to fetter the sovereign right of any parliament to pass particular laws which are not inconsistent with the general legislation agreed to under the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>Keeping Company Law Uniform</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>There have been far too few examples of uniform laws being achieved across State boundaries in Australia. Company law, of course, is one area in which a measure of uniformity was achieved in the 1960s but did not continue. Under the co-operative scheme, we have a mechanism for continuing uniformity. An inevitable consequence is that the Commonwealth Minister has only 1 vote in 7 in determining the content of the legislation which is introduced into the Commonwealth Parliament, as all such legislation must be approved by the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities. Indeed, after the initial legislation has been enacted it is conceivable that the Commonwealth Minister would be required to introduce legislation of which he did not approve. Amending legislation requires the approval of only a simple majority of members of the Council. However, it is apparent from the spirit of co-operation and give-and-take which has emerged already in the Council's deliberations that any future legislation will also be the product of consensus. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not surprising that a scheme of this magnitude has taken some years to get off the ground. By the time the companies code is in operation, it is expected that the Parliaments of Australia will have enacted more than 50 Bills. But it is only after the initial legislation has been enacted that the real fruits of these labours will become apparent. There will no longer be any need for action by State parliaments to keep the scheme uniform as amendments passed by this Parliament will flow automatically into the laws of the States. Even when the Ministerial Council decides that the amendments should operate slightly differently from one State to another so as to pick up some local evidentiary differences-for example, this can be achieved by translator amendments-regulations will be made in one State varying the Commonwealth amendments in their operation as laws of that State. </PARA>
<PARA> Uniform legislation is, of course, only half the package. Uniform administration of those laws by the National Companies and Securities Commission acting through the various Corporate Affairs Offices is the feature which will set the scheme apart from existing practices. Legislation setting up the National Commission was passed in 1979 and the members appointed early last year. </PARA>
<PARA>The Substantive Codes</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>In addition to the legislation establishing the National Companies and Securities Commission and supporting its operation in jurisdictions other than the Australian Capital Territory, the substantive legislation for the scheme at this stage will be contained in four codes:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) a share acquisition code which will regulate the acquisition of company shares;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) a securities industry code which will regulate the securities industry;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) a companies code which will cover the remaining areas dealt with in the current companies and marketable securities legislation; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) an interpretation code which deals with the interpretation of the Commonwealth legislation under this scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>Public Consultation</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The formal agreement foreshadowed a major exercise in legislative uniformity and law reform where this was necessary. In embarking on this exercise, this Government and the other governments which are parties to the formal agreement have sought to ensure that there is at all times adequate opportunity for the proposed legislation to be considered by interested persons. Comments were sought and received on the proposed acquisition of shares, securities industry and companies codes. The Companies Bill which I am introducing today is an amended version of the Bill which was introduced to the House on 27 August last year by the then Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, the Hon. R. V. Garland, M.P. Notwithstanding a period of public exposure of an earlier draft prior to that introduction, additional comments were sought on the Bill as introduced into the House. In addition to the process of public consultation, committees of interested Government and Opposition members and senators have continued to receive regular briefings on the scheme. </PARA>
<PARA>Progress in Implementation of the Co-operative Scheme</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>A point has now been reached where substantial progress has been made towards bringing into operation the co-operative companies and securities scheme. The original Commonwealth Acts relating to the share acquisition code, the securities industry code and the interpretation code have already passed through this Parliament and received royal assent. Our aim is to bring these codes into operation in the Australian Capital Territory and the six States on 1 July 1981 and we are hopeful that the companies code will be operative from 1 January 1982. I would now like to discuss very briefly the first of the Bills that I am presenting today, the Companies Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>Companies Bill 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>An outline of the principal features of the companies code and, in particular, the main changes it makes to existing companies legislation, is set out at paragraphs 37 to 43 of the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, the most important feature of this Companies Bill and of the previous exposure drafts which differentiates them from the existing law is the 'one place of registration' concept. These modifications to the existing law are required to ensure that an Australian company incorporated in a jurisdiction covered by the co-operative scheme can lodge all its documents with the local corporate affairs office in its jurisdiction of incorporation without the need to lodge documents anywhere else. Similarly, overseas corporations will have to register in only one of the jurisdictions covered by the co-operative scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australia-wide nature of the scheme has also been reflected in several major parts of the Bill. For example, in the areas of special investigations, schemes of arrangement and liquidations, the provisions of the existing law have been recast to overcome jurisdictional difficulties which have been faced in the past. The national emphasis of the co-operative scheme is also reflected in the clauses providing for a national system of registration for auditors, liquidators and official liquidators. The capacity of companies to change their headquarters has also been improved with the provisions relating to transfer of incorporation. There are also a number of other improvements to the existing law which have been made independently of the need to provide for an Australia-wide system of company law. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some areas of the Bill such as the division concerned with registration of charges which reflect both categories of change: provision is now made for charges over company property wherever situated to be registered in only one participating State or Territory. At the same time, however, the consequences of registration or failure to register will be fundamentally different from the existing law-in brief it reflects a change from a partial invalidity system to a priority system as recommended in the seventh interim report of the Eggleston committee. Further changes have been made in the current Bill from the exposure drafts which involve some departures from the Eggleston committee recommendations in the light of public comments. To identify quickly the other changes from the last draft of the Bill I would direct honourable senators' attention to Appendix D of the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. There is also a comparison, in Appendix C, of the provisions in the April 1980 and August 1980 exposure drafts. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be apparent from an examination of the Bill and a comparison of Appendices C and D that the changes made in the current Bill generally represent fine tuning changes rather than ambitious law reform exercises. Whilst everyone agrees in the main that there are areas of company law in need of fundamental reform, it is not so simple to achieve general agreement in the community on any particular measure of reform. Accordingly, in order to get the scheme into operation without any further delay, the changes in the current Bill, though many, are not radical. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of the areas where there have been further refinement of provisions in the exposure drafts include divisions relating to the powers of inspection of the National Commission, ratification of contracts made before formation of companies, companies financing dealings in their own shares, the duties and liabilities of directors, disciplinary proceedings against auditors and liquidators, and substantial shareholdings. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps I should also mention some things which are not in the Companies Bill but which nevertheless are of considerable practical importance. The first is that the Companies Bill does not contain provisions corresponding to the Ninth Schedule to the Companies Acts and Ordinances in force in the various States and Territories. The Ninth Schedule deals with the content of accounts and group accounts to be lodged by companies. That does not mean that company directors will be able to determine for themselves what matters to include in their accounts. It simply means that with a view to having flexible accounting provisions which have some chance of remaining relevant to the purposes for which they are designed, the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities has decided that these provisions should take the form of regulations. The aim is, of course, to enable these provisions to be amended more readily than would be the case with such provisions contained in the principal legislation. Lest this decision should give rise to any apprehension as to the ultimate content of those regulations, I hasten to add that the proposed regulations will not involve significant departures from the existing Ninth Schedule. The regulations will contain the provisions as exposed for public comment, amended in a few relatively minor ways in the light of public submissions. These proposed changes are set out in paragraph 1,300 of the explanatory memorandum to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two additional matters which are not covered by this Bill but which may yet be the subject of an amending Bill when the Ministerial Council decides upon the extent to which certain disclosure principles should operate. The first is the disclosure of the operations of trading trusts. Honourable senators will recall that provisions concerning disclosure by companies operating business through trusts formed part of the first exposure draft of the Companies Bill. When introducing the August Bill into the House last year the then Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, the Honourable R. V. Garland, M.P., indicated that those provisions had been removed but that Ministers would be giving further consideration to the inclusion of more appropriate provisions at a later stage. The examination of this matter is still proceeding, and in the interim, the Companies Bill does not contain special provisions relating to the operation of trading trusts. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter highlighted last August as requiring further work was that concerning the extent to which overseas incorporated companies should disclose information as to their Australian operations. Again, this is a matter which will require further work to be done before the Ministerial Council is in a position to consider amendments to the legislation. It may well be that draft accounting requirements relating to such disclosure would need to be submitted for public comment before being submitted to the Parliament. Accordingly, legislative amendments on this subject may be some time away yet. Whilst drawing attention to the possibility of additional accounting requirements, I would like to mention one matter of particular concern to the accounting profession, namely the permitted size of accounting partnerships. Ministers drew particular attention to this matter when seeking public comments on exposure drafts of the Companies Bill. The Ministerial Council will be making a decision on this matter in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA> I should mention that some amendments to this Bill are likely to be introduced during the second half of this year. This Bill is being introduced at this stage, however, to enable the six State parliaments to pass legislation in the second half of this year adopting the Companies Bill. This should then enable the entire scheme to be in operation by 1 January 1982. Experience with the other codes has demonstrated that the need for some modifications to the principal legislation will become apparent only when the State adopting legislation and the Commonwealth regulations are being settled.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I commend the Companies Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>Companies (Fees) Bill 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The Companies (Fees) Bill is related to the Companies Bill in that it deals with the fees payable under the Companies Bill. The actual amounts of those fees will be set out in regulations to be made under the Fees Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Details of the Bill are set out in the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated for the benefit of honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill has been approved by the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities for introduction into the Commonwealth Parliament. Mr President, I commend the Companies (Fees) Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>Companies (Transitional Provisions) Bill 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The object of the Companies (Transitional Provisions) Bill is to enact, for the Australian Capital Territory, the transitional provisions that are necessary for the introduction of the new companies code. This Bill will come into operation on the same day as the commencement of the Companies Bill itself. The States will not be having separate Companies (Transitional Provisions) Bills. Each State will, however, include in its Companies (Application of Laws) Bill appropriate transitional provisions which will be modelled on those contained in the Bill that I am now introducing, with such modifications as are necessary to take into account the particular circumstances of that State. As with the Companies (Transitional Provisions) Bill itself, the transitional provisions in the various State (Application of Laws) Bills will require the unanimous approval of the Ministerial Council. Mr President, I commend the Companies (Transitional Provisions) Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>Companies (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The Companies (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill contains miscellaneous amendments to certain Commonwealth Acts consequent upon the repeal of the Australian Capital Territory Companies Ordinance 1962 and the enactment of the Companies Bill 1981. The Bill does not affect the States as it relates only to Commonwealth Acts. Each State will however need to pass similar legislation in relation to any State Acts that contain references to the existing State Companies Acts. </PARA>
<PARA> Details of the Bill are contained in an explanatory memorandum that has been circulated for the benefit of honourabe senators. Because this Bill and the Crown Debts (Priority) Bill do not form part of the co-operative scheme legislation they therefore do not require the approval of the Ministerial Council. The Miscellaneous Amendment Bills passed by each State will again not be part of the scheme legislation. There will also be a separate Companies (Miscellaneous Amendments) Ordinance containing consequential amendments to Australian Capital Territory Ordinances. Mr President, I commend the Companies (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>Crown Debts (Priority) Bill 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The Crown Debts (Priority) Bill reflects the Commonwealth Government's view that the Crown in right of the Commonwealth should be placed in the same position in an insolvency situation in relation to ordinary debts as any other creditor. This decision was announced to the House by the then Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, Mr Fife, on 13 September 1979 following a report that Senator Missen tabled in this chamber as Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. The report concerned the right of the Crown to be repaid debts owing to it in priority to other creditors in matters of bankruptcy, corporate liquidations or other cases of impecunious persons or corporations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Committee in its report recommended the complete abrogation of all Crown priorities in insolvency administration. The Government examined the report and was in agreement with the main thrust of the Committee's argument. The Government supports uniformity of insolvency administration which was of particular concern to the Senate Committee. It also acknowledged the desirability of placing the Crown on an even footing with the private sector so far as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, the then Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs announced that the Government had decided to abolish all remaining Crown priorities in the Commonwealth sphere except in relation to tax instalment deductions and withholding tax on dividends and interest remitted overseas and to seek the abolition of all remaining Crown priorities in the State sphere. Special considerations apply in relation to these two categories of taxation debts and separate them from other Crown debts. Other changes have already been made to bankruptcy and taxation legislation in pursuance of the Government's decision.</PARA>
<PARA> The Crown Debts (Priority) Bill will abrogate the prerogative priority of the Crown in right of the Commonwealth and will ensure that, in the case of the insolvency of a corporate or unincorporate body, the Commonwealth is under an obligation to repay preferential payments in circumstances where other creditors would be obliged to do so and that it is bound by any compromise or arrangement entered into by such a body. Details of the Crown Debts (Priority) Bill are contained in the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated for the benefit of honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA> The Crown Debts (Priority) Bill is not part of the co-operative scheme since it only affects the Crown in right of the Commonwealth. The Bill I am here introducing accordingly did not need the approval of the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities. Nevertheless, as the drafting of the terms of the Bill is interrelated with that of the Companies Bill it has been decided that both Bills should come into operation on the same day. Mr President, I commend the Crown Debts (Priority) Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>Companies (Acquisition of Shares) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The Companies (Acquisition of Shares) Amendment Bill (No. 2) will amend the Companies (Acquisition of Shares) Act 1980 consequent on the provisions that are set out in the Companies Bill 1981 and will also amend the substantive provisions of the share acquisition code. Details of the amendments are set out in the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated. </PARA>
<PARA> Provisions in the Bill consequential on the Companies Bill will come into operation when the Companies Bill commences and the other provisions will come into operation when proclaimed. This Bill has been approved by the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities for introduction into the Commonwealth Parliament. I commend the Companies (Acquisition of Shares) Amendment Bill (No. 2) to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>Companies (Acquisition of Shares-Fees) Amendment Bill 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The Companies (Acquisition of Shares-Fees) Amendment Bill makes a minor amendment to the Companies (Acquisition of Shares-Fees) Act 1981. This amendment will bring these provisions into line with equivalent provisions in the Companies (Fees) Bill 1981. Details of the Companies (Acquisition of Shares-Fees) Amendment Bill 1981 appear in the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated. The Bill has been approved by the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities for introduction into the Commonwealth Parliament. I commend the Companies (Acquisition of Shares-Fees) Amendment Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>Securities Industry Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The Securities Industry Amendment Bill (No. 2) has two separate functions. Part II of the Bill makes certain amendments of a technical nature to the substantive provisions of the Securities Industry Act. Part III of the Bill amends the Securities Industry Act 1980 to take account of certain provisions in the Companies Bill 1981. Details of the amendments are set out in the explanatory memorandum which has been circulated for the benefit of honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA> Provisions in the Bill consequential on the Companies Bill will come into operation when the Companies Bill commences and the other provisions will come into operation when proclaimed. The Securities Industry Amendment Bill (No. 2) has been approved by the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities for introduction into the Commonwealth Parliament. I commend the Securities Industry Amendment Bill (No. 2) to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>Securities Industry (Fees) Amendment Bill 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The Securities Industry (Fees) Amendment Bill 1981 makes a minor amendment to the Securities Industry fees Act 1980.

To get my speech into its proper context, I will have to go over some of the remarks that I made at that time. On that occasion I said that I had hoped that the matter that I wanted to raise would be raised during the Joint Sitting, because that was the most appropriate time to do so. Unfortunately it was not raised at that stage. As I said, I missed the opportunity to raise the matter myself, but I think it is only right and proper that the attitude of the present Government when it was in opposition to Senate representation of the Territories be put into the record. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter to which I want to refer is the legislation which had been before the Senate on three occasions previously, while the Whitlam Government was in office. Its purpose was to allow the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory to have Senate representation. This afternoon I confine my remarks to Senate representation for the Australian Capital Territory. I said last Tuesday that I found it very interesting, when we were sitting in this chamber on 5 May, to hear the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) nominate Mrs Reid to be the replacement senator for the Australian Capital Territory. It was particularly interesting to hear the remarks of the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Carrick, when he seconded the nomination. I refreshed my memory of what Senator Carrick said during the debate on the legislation when it was before this House on three different occasions and also when it was before the Joint Sitting in the other place. I do not think he spoke on the latter occasion. In seconding the nomination of Mrs Reid, Senator Carrick said:</PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that she will be a considerable acquisition to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>I am not going to dispute that statement. The remarks that he made which were of great interest to me were these:</PARA>
<PARA>She conforms to the requirements of the Electoral Act and other legislation. I am happy to commend Mrs Reid to the Joint Sitting. </PARA>
<PARA>What we have to remember is that if it had not been for the Joint Sitting which was forced upon the Whitlam Government in 1974 and which was held in the other place across King's Hall, the Joint Sitting of 5 May would not have taken place because there would have been no legislation in this Commonwealth to allow either the Northern Territory or the Australian Capital Territory to have representatives in the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, this legislation came before this chamber on three occasions, and on each such occasion members of the then Opposition, who now form the Government, had the numbers and voted against it. After the double dissolution in 1974 but before the Joint Sitting was held, the Liberal Party challenged the legislation in the High Court of Australia, but that challenge was defeated. Again, after the Joint Sitting it took another challenge to the High Court and again the legislation which was passed by the Joint Sitting was deemed to be valid. We can see that those people who are now in government-I will list them for inclusion in Hansard at the end of my speech-fought tooth and nail to prevent people such as Senator Kilgariff, Senator Robertson and Senator Ryan and now Senator Reid taking their places in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate (Representation of Territories) Bill first came into this place on 31 May 1973. On the same day the second reading speech was delivered. On 7 June 1973, Senator Jessop led in the debate for the then Opposition. As I said, when I was speaking on this matter last Tuesday I expressed regret that I had to speak about Senator Jessop in his absence. Unfortunately, I have to do the same thing today, because I understand that Senator Jessop has another commitment interstate. But that will not prevent me from reading into the record the remarks of Senator Jessop who was the lead speaker for the then Opposition. Some of his remarks may make Senator Kilgariff blush. In particular, some of Senator Carrick's remarks may make him blush and wonder about the person who now leads him. I had to wait a week to speak on this matter. Now, a further two days have gone by. Senator Jessop, in his opening remarks on this Bill, said:</PARA>
<PARA> We believe that this proposal-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, to legislate to give Senate representation to both Territories-</PARA>
<PARA>is contrary to the spirit of the Constitution by which the sovereign States agreed to the establishment of the Federal Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on further to say on that day:</PARA>
<PARA> We believe that if this Bill were approved, this principle would be destroyed by giving the balance of power to Territorial representatives and the Senate would no longer be a true States House. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask Senator Kilgariff, who is in the chamber now, to ponder those remarks because they are very pertinent. It would appear that we have done away with the Constitution because we have people like Senator Kilgariff sitting in this place. That debate took place on 7 June. Later on, at the end of his speech, he said:</PARA>
<PARA> We cannot support the measure. </PARA>
<PARA>On 14 November 1973 when the matter again came into the House, Senator Jessop, again the lead speaker for the then Opposition, said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has not changed its attitude in relation to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>He was speaking of the Senate (Representation of Territories) Bill. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> We do not lend our support to the proposition before the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on further to say:</PARA>
<PARA> We maintain that the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory have adequate representation. </PARA>
<PARA>Those were the remarks of the then lead speaker for the Opposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Jessop said that he believed, and his party believed, that both the Territories had adequate representation in the Parliament. At the conclusion of his speech on 14 November 1973, Senator Jessop said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Therefore, the Opposition rejects both of these Bills. </PARA>
<PARA>On 17 July 1974, in speaking to the legislation when it was again introduced into this Parliament, Senator Jessop in the course of the second reading debate said:</PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, as a responsible member of the Senate, I believe that anything which will endanger this chamber in which we sit constitutionally and anything which will weaken the influence of the States-this place is a States House-ought to be rejected by any responsible member of this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the proposition was rejected by those who sat behind him. He further said:</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators opposite refer to the need for Senate representation of the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>Then he referred to what Senator Gietzelt had said. He had said in a previous speech that he maintained that the Territories were adequately represented. I interjected, as I usually do when I do not agree with what the honourable senator is saying. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Senator McLaren always rises to the bait, and I am very glad of that fact. In South Australia State Australian Labor Party members have not been able to put the views expressed by their electors because they have been bound by Caucus decisions. That is not so with respect to our Party. </PARA>
<PARA>I quoted from Mr Burr's speech when I was speaking on the amendment to the Address-in-Reply. We find that in fact the people who now sit opposite are also bound by Caucus decisions. But they are not as honest as we are. When we go to the people at election time we do not make any secret of the fact that we abide by a majority decision of our party. We do not hoodwink people into believing that we can act as free agents once we are elected. That is what the Liberals do repeatedly. Anyone who reads Mr Burr's speech will see what free agents Government members are. Mr Burr stated the penalties imposed upon members of the Liberal Party in particular if they do not toe the line. The penalties are all stated in Hansard. We saw some evidence of the penalties when we read the report in today's Press about what took place yesterday at the party meeting. Even the Premier of Queensland was huffing and puffing about what he would do. The Premiers are now licking the boots of the Prime Minister, running around like little lap dogs and doing as he says. So much for the free agency of honourable senators opposite! Senator Jessop went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> We reject this Bill purely and simply because it would weaken this place as a States House. It seems quite incredible to me that the Government should put these proposals without consulting the States. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Jessop then repeated that he believed that the Territories were adequately represented. Further he said:</PARA>
<PARA> I just cannot see that there is any argument at all to be put forward to change my mind about this measure. I think that the Labor Party can be likened unto white ants, because with this Bill they seem to be nibbling away at the very core of the Constitution that set up the Senate as a States House. I think it is valid to raise constitutional matters in this debate. </PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Even a person such as myself without any great legal knowledge can see immediately that this measure could be challenged by the States if it was ever enacted. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course this measure was challenged by the Liberal Party of Australia in the High Court and was proved to be valid. Some of his other comments are very interesting, similar comments were made by other members of the coalition. I will refer to them later. Senator Jessop said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is quite fair to suggest that the people of Norfolk Island, Christmas Island and other territories could be justified in asking for Senate representation and I would be very surprised if it did not happen. </PARA>
<PARA>It has not happened as yet. These are the spurious arguments that were put forward by members of the then Opposition who now sit in government in trying to prevent residents and electors in the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory from having representation in this Senate. People should be very concerned about that matter and not be hoodwinked by the platitudes mouthed in Parliament last Tuesday week by the Prime Minister and supported by Senator Carrick. In the Joint Sitting on 6 August when introducing the Senate (Representation of Territories) Act Senator Murphy said:</PARA>
<PARA> These Bills, like the other 4 Bills under consideration in this first Joint Sitting, have been before each House of the Parliament on 3 previous occasions. </PARA>
<PARA>That is why they were brought forward at the Joint Sitting. He further stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The effect of these proposals will be to give representation in the Senate to 140,000 voters in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA>He also said:</PARA>
<PARA> When the Parliament reassembled a month ago these Bills, along with the other 4 Bills, came before each of the Houses for a third time. The result was the same. The Opposition parties continued to deny representation in the Senate to the people of the 2 Territories. The deadlock persisted. The Governor-General . . . convened this Joint Sitting of the members of the Senate and of the House of Representatives on Tuesday last week. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course he spoke on 6 August. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> A further attempt was made in the past few days in the High Court of Australia to prevent the enactment of this Bill, along with the other 5 Bills, into law. That attempt to stop the proceedings that are taking place here in Parliament today, I am pleased to report, has failed. After all these frustrations we now have come together to deliberate upon the Senate (Representation of Territories) Bill and the Representation Bill and to enact them as laws of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what we did. Of course we know, as I said earlier, that after that Joint Sitting the decision taken by those duly elected representatives was again challenged in the High Court. I will quote briefly a remark made by the late Senator Greenwood, who vigorously opposed this legislation. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> We ought to recognise that the Labor Party is a party which, since it has been in government, has exercised a power of patronage and corruption which is unequalled anywhere in Australia's history--</PARA>
<PARA>If Senator Greenwood were here now I do not think he would utter those words because they would be fired right back in his face. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As my colleague has said, there is no doubt about that. When one looks at the record one sees some very interesting remarks. Also on the 6 August in the Joint Sitting Mr Sinclair added to the words used by Senator Jessop in trying to hoodwink the people and to fool them about the real reason we introduced this legislation. Mr Sinclair said that people from the Australian Antarctic Territory, Christmas Island, Cocos (Keeling) Islands, the Coral Sea islands, Heard Island, Macdonald Island, the New Guinea Trust Territory-which, of course, has its own charter now-Norfolk Island, Ashmore and Cartier Islands-would seek representation here. That is the sort of smokescreen that Government senators and their representatives put forward to try to fool the people into believing that we were doing something corrupt and were not being genuine in our endeavours. I think that they stand condemned for that. Mr Sinclair further said in the same speech:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This measure is one of a series of measures. It is interesting to note that of the 6 measures that we are considering at this Joint Sitting, three in fact relate to representation either by distorting electorates in order to determine the number of members in the House of Representatives or by distorting the numbers in the Senate in order to ensure the probability of a Labor majority in that chamber. This legislation is completely repugnant to honourable senators and members on this side of the chamber on the same basis as it was on each of the 3 successive occasions when it came before both Houses of this Parliament. It is for that reason that I intend again to vote against it. I believe that it does not enhance the opportunities for democratic government in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>Again I ask Senator Kilgariff: What does he think about those remarks which were made by a very senior member of the party of which he was once a member? He was a member of that party when he was elected to this chamber. He resigned for reasons best known to himself to join the Liberal Party. I have quoted the remarks made by senior members of the now Government. All of their remarks denigrated the Australian Labor Party and sought to deprive the people of the Territories of representation in this chamber. As I have said, last Tuesday week it was interesting to listen to the remarks of the Prime Minister, supported by Senator Carrick. It will be very enlightening for honourable senators opposite, who may not have been here or read what was said, to hear his remarks. The honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), who is very much in the news these days, at the Joint Sitting asked:</PARA>
<PARA> What is the Government doing about the people of the Territories-</PARA>
<PARA>He also referred to Cocos (Keeling) Islands, Christmas Island, Norfolk Island, Ashmore and Cartier Islands and the Coral Sea islands. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> There is one man on a meteorological station on one island. Is the Government going to send him here to look after himself as the Senate representative?</PARA>
<PARA>That is the sort of stupid argument put forward by senior party members to try to prevent the people of the Territories from having a voice in this chamber. Even Mr Killen said:</PARA>
<PARA> I would not expect honourable gentlemen and ladies opposite to be thrilled by that observation--</PARA>
<PARA>He was talking about all the Bills before the House-</PARA>
<PARA> But the simple truth is that to add 4 new senators to the Australian Parliament at this time would hardly convey the impression that the Government had a glorious sense of redemption, had a high sense of purpose. Those who come later will say of this decision that it represented a monumental piece of folly. </PARA>
<PARA>Have we ever heard Senator Kilgariff, the late Senator Knight or the now Senator Reid repeating those words? I repeat them: 'Those who come later will say of this decision that it represented a monumental piece of folly.' If those people agreed with what Mr Killen said-he is still a senior Minister in the Government-they would resign immediately from this Parliament. They would be genuine and resign and say that they agreed with what the members of their party said about their being in this place. But, of course, they will not resign; not on your life! Mr Killen, when talking about the Bill, said:</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill, or rather the effect of it, will not be to give people representation in this Parliament. The Bill represents the most significant assault ever on the Australian Constitution. If this Bill is carried, becomes an Act and remains a valid Act of Parliament, it will be the most significant de facto alteration ever made to the Australian Constitution.</PARA>
<PARA>Those are words of a senior member of the now Government which were uttered to try to hoodwink the people into believing that the Labor Government, under Mr Whitlam and particularly under the Minister responsible for this legislation, Mr Daly, was doing something dishonest. The members of the present Government even mentioned that in their speeches. </PARA>

<PARA></PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4L7">Senator McLAREN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to the suspension of the sitting I was relating to the Senate my concern at the attitude of the present Government when it was in opposition to having in this chamber representatives from the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. I was quoting from some of the statements made by various senior members of the then Opposition and now very senior members of the Government. I want to quote from the remarks made by Mr Hunt, now the Minister for Transport and a very senior man in the Country Party. Whilst the Country Party from the outset opposed legislation providing for Territory representation I must give Senator Kilgariff some credit because when he was giving evidence before the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Northern Territory, of which I was a member, in its inquiry into constitutional reform for the Northern Territory he personally thought that the Territory ought to be represented in this chamber. His party did not agree with him. When it came to a vote, as the record shows, Country Party members always voted against the legislation, except at the Joint Sitting when Mr Calder who was then the House of Representatives member for the seat of the Northern Territory, was forced by some of the statements that he had made on previous occasions to cross the floor and vote with the Government on the day. I quote from page 69 of the Joint Sitting Hansard. On 6 August 1974 Mr Hunt said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us be frank. This Bill is brought into this Joint Sitting in the hope that when it is carried it will provide the Labor Government with a majority in the Senate thus enabling it to achieve its philosophical and policy objectives. It is purely a political stunt that could well slow down the constitutional advancement of both the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate that it was a Labor government that gave the Northern Territory a fully elected House of Assembly, something that the Territory was not given under the party Mr Hunt represented and still does. He went on:</PARA>
<PARA> Other speakers have pointed out that it makes a complete mockery of the Senate as a States House and there are all sorts of doubts as to its constitutional validity. No doubt these will be tested in the High Court at the appropriate time. </PARA>
<PARA>I referred to that before the suspension of the sitting. When it was tested twice in the High Court the Liberal Party, supported by its ally the Country Party, was soundly defeated. Mr Hunt went on:</PARA>
<PARA> Let me conclude by saying that I am diametrically opposed to this Bill for the reason that it destroys the concept of the Senate being a States House. As the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Killen) said it shatters the constitutional framework of this country. It deals it a mortal blow . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Those are very interesting words when we remember the words uttered by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and by Senator Carrick in this place only a little more than a week ago. Let me go further-this is the most interesting comment, to my mind and to the mind of many of my party colleagues-and quote from what Senator Carrick said at the Joint Sitting on 6 August on the same Bill. At page 81 of the Joint Sitting Hansard Senator Carrick said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . these 2 measures now before us, the Senate (Representation of Territories) Bill and the Representation Bill, are the most important in their future potential to alter the whole framework of this Parliament, of this parliamentary system and, therefore, of the structure of decision making in this country. But they are memorable for something more than that. They are memorable because the Government has produced a hybrid mule of very strange proportions. </PARA>
<PARA>I refer back to his remarks of Tuesday week when he was talking about Mrs Reid, as she then was. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> She conforms to the requirements of the Electoral Act and other legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Carrick had probably forgotten the words he used when he said that what the Labor Party was doing was producing a hybrid mule of very strange proportions. Yet he was very happy to welcome Mrs Reid, who is now present to this chamber. I say to Senator Reid that she ought to read some of the remarks that were made by Senator Carrick and take them up with him to see what he thought about people who might want to represent the Territories. At the Joint Sitting of 6 August 1974 in the same debate Mr Street, now the Minister for Foreign Affairs, said:</PARA>
<PARA> This legislation demonstrates the essential hypocrisy of the Labor Government. </PARA>
<PARA>We were called hypocrites because we introduced legislation which provided that the Territories should have Senate representation. So we were accused of being hypocrites. That is not the only time we were accused of being hypocrites. I now say to those people who sit on the Government side as representatives of the Territories that they ought to have another think and change their minds as to whether we were hyocrites because we in the Labor Party were the ones who gave them the opportunity to take their place in this chamber. Mr Street went on:</PARA>
<PARA> No less an authority than my friend and colleague, the honourable member for Moreton,--</PARA>
<PARA>Of course most of the people on the other side are always happy to quote from speeches of the honourable member for Moreton because he butters up his speeches with a lot of rhetoric, but when one takes away all the rhetoric one finds very little in them. They still lean on the honourable member for Moreton, Mr Killen, for a quote. Mr Street said:</PARA>
<PARA> No less an authority than my friend and colleague, the honourable member for Moreton, with his usual felicitous turn of phrase, in most moderate and temperate terms described this legislation as an assault on the Australian Constitution and our federal system. It would not just provide territorial representation in the Senate, as envisaged by section 122 of the Constitution; it would also provide territorial senators who would have full voting powers in the Senate. It would substantially affect that part of the Constitution referring to the establishment and working of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore this legislation is nothing short of an attempt to subvert the Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA>I put it to honourable senators opposite, including the two Government senators who represent the Territories that when the next vote is taken in this chamber they ought to take cognisance of what Mr Killen said and refrain from voting. If honourable senators opposite are going to be consistent and fully support Mr Killen, in all fairness they ought to refrain from voting. However, I know they will not do that because they are now members of this place despite what their party said before about what a terrible thing we in the Labor Party were inflicting upon the Australian people and how we were subverting the Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note from the division on that legislation on 6 August 1974 at the Joint Sitting to see the people who voted against Senate representation for the Territories. The people I am going to refer to are those very same people who took their place in this chamber on Tuesday of last week and supported the nomination of Mrs Reid. I have no objection at all to Senator Reid's being a senator because I am a member of the party which every time legislation came before the Senate on Senate representation put up a strong argument on why the Territories should be represented. So I am not objecting to Senator Reid's being a senator, but it is very interesting to see the names of the people who voted against people like Senator Reid sitting in this place. These people are still members of the Parliament and they were in this chamber last Tuesday week. They include Mr Anthony; Senator Baume, who is now sitting opposite; Senator Bonner who is present; Mr Bourchier; Mr Bungey; Mr Cadman; Senator Carrick; Senator Chaney. Even Don Chipp, who was a member of the other place at the time and who is now a senator, voted against that legislation. The list of names continues: Mr Connolly, who is still a member of the House of Representatives; Senator Davidson; Mr Drummond; Senator Durack; Dr Edwards; Mr Fisher; Malcolm Fraser; Geoff Giles; Senator Guilfoyle; Mr Hodges; Mr Howard; Mr Hunt; Mr Hyde; Senator Jessop; Mr Katter; Mr Killen; Senator Laucke; Mr Lloyd; Mr Lusher; Mr Lynch; Mr MacKellar; Mr McMahon; Mr McVeigh; Mr Macphee; Senator Martin; Senator Maunsell; Mr Millar; Senator Missen; Mr Nixon; Mr O'Keefe; Mr Peacock; Senator Rae; Mr Ian Robinson; Mr Ruddock; Senator Scott; Senator Sim; Mr Sinclair; Mr Snedden; Mr Street; Senator Townley; Mr Viner; Mr Wilson and Senator Withers. Three people were paired and can be taken as having supported that opposition to Senate representation. The tellers were Mr Donald Cameron, the present member for Fadden, and Senator Young. Fifty-four people in all. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Reid must feel very awkward sitting here today knowing that all those people on three occasions and at the Joint Sitting objected to her being here as a Territory representative. Perhaps when matters are being discussed in the party room Senator Reid ought to ask those people why they objected to people like her being in this chamber and representing the Australian Capital Territory. Their attitude is an indication of what they think of the people in the Australian Capital Territory. That is why the Labor Party now holds three of the four seats in the Australian Capital Territory. Incidentally, three of those seats are held by women. One woman, of course, is on the Government side.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the Labor Party ever got the numbers in this place-it probably will after the next election-and if it introduced legislation to repeal the present legislation for representation for the Australian Capital Territory I wonder what would be the attitude of Senator Kilgariff and Senator Reid. It would be very interesting to find out what attitudes they would adopt then. Neither of them were in this place, of course, when the deliberations were taking place on the legislation that gave Senate representation to the Territories, so they cannot be accused of voting against it but Senator Baume can be accused of voting against it because on every occasion--</PARA>

If Senator Baume is prepared to look at the debate in the Hansard record he will find that Mr Calder asked Mr Speaker whether he would be allowed to sit in the corridor rather than vote against the legislation or vote for it. Of course, because of the interjections from the supporters of the then Government-the Whitlam Government-he was forced to honour some of the promises he had made in the Northern Territory. He is the only member of the National Country Party on record as having voted for the legislation. I have no doubt that had Senator Kilgariff been in this place at that time he would have supported it also because the Hansard record of the hearings of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Northern Territory shows that he said on quite a few occasions that he supported Senate representation for the Northern Territroy. Of course, his party did not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I put these facts on the record to point up the double standards of the people who now sit in government. The attitude they took when in Opposition is completely different from the attitude they take now. I am sure it would be very interesting to go through the Hansard records and then in this place refer to all the contradictory comments that honourable senators opposite have made since this Government came to office. Perhaps when I have a little spare time I might do that and so embarrass again the people who sit opposite. This is one event which-I said this when I rose to speak last Tuesday-should have been mentioned at the Joint Sitting which was held on Tuesday, 5 May. Of course, under the Rules for Conduct of Business each speaker was given only five minutes. One could not put all these points in five minutes. It has taken me about 35 minutes to put all these facts together. </PARA>
<PARA> The attitude of this Government to Senate representation for both Territories is on the record for people to read. Senator Reid and Senator Kilgariff sit in this place and vote on legislation which they support in the main knowing that their presence here was opposed at every opportunity by the party they represent. I think the Labor Party can be proud of the fact that when in government it introduced legislation for the Territories to be represented in the Senate. The Labor Party should be given due credit for that. It gave Senator Reid and Senator Kilgariff the opportunity to sit in this place. It believes in electoral democracy in this country. It is due to the action of the Labor Party that both Senator Kilgariff and Senator Reid have the privilege of sitting in the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Today we are debating the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1980-81. This first reading debate gives honourable senators the opportunity to speak about matters other than those contained within the Bill. Today I want to talk about a tour that I went on recently into South East Asia. I was accompanied by my wife and by a very prominent official of the World Vision organisation. We left Australia on 14 April and went first to Thailand, where we spent some time. In a sense, my tour was a fact finding mission. As I have done in the past, I wanted to go into countries where the World Vision organisation, with which I am very much involved, is working on a number of projects. I thought it was appropriate that I take my wife to look at these projects because I had seen them before. We went to Thailand, the Philippines, Singapore and finally into Kampuchea and Phnom Penh.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We arrived in Bangkok on 14 April and decided to visit some of the refugee camps. Much has been written and said about refugees from both Cambodia, which is now called Kampuchea, and Vietnam. Australia has had a lot of experience with people who have come from these two countries. Some are called 'boat people'. As an Aborigine I find that rather ironic because from what I can gather from history most of the ancestors of the people who are in Australia today were boat people who came with Governor Phillip almost 200 years ago, and landed at Botany Bay. My fellow Aborigines and I find it rather ironic when we hear some of the criticisms about the so-called boat people coming to Australia, because the ancestors of many of the people who are in Australia today were in fact boat people. </PARA>
<PARA> We visited a refugee camp called Sakeo II, which is some 70 kilometres from the Thailand-Kampuchea border. In that refugee camp there are about 36,000 people-men, women and children. It appeared to me, my wife and to Roger Walker from World Vision that there were children everywhere. Whilst they appeared to be healthy and happy, one of the strange things we noticed was that there were no toys. There was nothing for the children to play with. There were people everywhere-children, men and women-living in the refugee camp. </PARA>
<PARA> I should now like to pay tribute to the people of Thailand for at least extending a refuge to people who have fled from countries such as Cambodia, which is now called Kampuchea, and Vietnam. At least they have been given refuge for a time. I suppose there are people who criticise the conditions under which these people live but at least Thailand is one country in South East Asia which has allowed the refugees from these countries at least to have refuge for a time. We spent almost a day at Sakeo II. The people at that refugee camp are from Kampuchea and are known as Khmers. To distinguish between Khmers and the Khmer Rouge, I should like to point out that the Khmers are people from Kampuchea who have found it necessary to flee from that country because of the things that were happening. The people at that refugee camp were living in houses that were built on stilts and had galvanised iron roofs. They were single army barrack-type dwellings. </PARA>
<PARA> One needs to travel to those places to realise the situation and to understand the conditions under which people live in those refugee camps. The heat is something that we as Australians-unless we live in places such as Darwin-cannot understand. The heat which they have to put up with in those camps is terrific. One of the strange things we saw which gave us great heart was that around each of the primitive dwellings the refugees were trying to grow all sorts of vegetation. It is a credit to World Vision because World Vision provided either the small plants or the seeds so that the people could grow the plants around their homes. Generally, water was caught off the galvanised iron roofs by receptacles that people had made themselves out of concrete. Water reticulation in the camp was non-existent. Yet the people were able to keep themselves clean. Their clothing was clean. Whilst they lived under exceptional conditions they were certainly trying to do the best they could. </PARA>
<PARA> In this camp there was a hospital which was funded and, to some extent, run by people-nurses, sisters and doctors-who are involved with World Vision. When we visited that camp we met a young lady who is a fully qualified nurse and who had spent time in many parts of the world where there were problems. She had come to serve the people in this refugee camp, Sakeo II. We looked at what the people were trying to do for themselves. I think that what they were doing is a very great credit to these gentle and wise people who have no desire to lose their culture. They had a little workshop in which they made a number of things. For example, they made soap. It might be difficult for people in Australia to understand how valuable a little piece of soap can be-a piece of soap to wash one's face, one's clothing and that type of thing. These people were so ingenious that they were able to manufacture soap out of coconut oil because they were concerned for their people and they wanted to be able to take care of themselves. In this little workshop where they made different things in an effort to preserve their culture, they even made instruments. I was presented at that camp with a type of violin which was one of the things they were making to help preserve their culture. They also made different types of tools of trade under almost primitive conditions. For example, they made tomahawks out of pieces of steel. To heat the steel to the right temperature they devised a type of blower which would keep the heat going to get the right temperature. </PARA>
<PARA> The aid agencies which are working there as well as World Vision are working under almost primitive conditions, conditions which they would not experience in their own country. I do not think that we can give enough credit to this type of people who are dedicated to giving this kind of service to people less fortunate than themselves. As I said, a number of aid agencies were working in that camp and I cannot speak highly enough of them for the type of work they were doing. When I think of it, I cannot help but marvel at the dedication which these people gave to God and to man. They are basically Christian people who are giving their Christian love and dedication to a people who are, unfortunately, less fortunate than themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> From that camp we went to visit a refugee camp called Khao-I-Deng which is only seven kilometres from the border between Kampuchea and Thailand. We were told there that at one stage the camp had housed 120,000 people. I wonder whether honourable senators can visualise what it means for 120,000 to be cramped into an area of, say, from this building to the lake and back-about 150 acres of land. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, the total population of Hobart. These 120,000 people were cramped into this area. This brings me to another very serious thing that is happening in these refugee camps. What happens in these refugee camps-and Australia is as guilty of this as any other country-is that we tend to go into them with so-called compassion but what we are actually doing is carrying out a kind of brain drain. We are taking out of those camps people who should be going back into Kampuchea to rebuild Kampuchea, or Cambodia as it was called. Instead, what we are doing is draining off all the people who have the expertise, the knowledge and the understanding because they are acceptable to our country, because they can fit into our country; they can fit into the environment and the conditions in which we live in our country. But what we are actually doing inadvertently-or advertently-is creating a kind of brain drain from the refugee camps of the people who should be helped to go back into their own country to rebuild it. In the Khao-I-Deng refugee camp there were 120,000 people; there are now 49,000 people. So we can see what has happened in that camp alone. There has been a brain drain from that camp into countries such as the United States of America, Great Britain, Canada, France and Australia and other countries. We have drained the brainy people from those camps so the loss will be not to the camps but to Kampuchea as a whole. The houses in this camp were built out of bamboo and rattan and were thatched and on high stilts. Unfortunately, just before we arrived an accident occurred and a whole hospital was destroyed by fire. Sixty per cent of these Khmer are peasants or agriculturalists who have fled from Kampuchea for reasons that I will speak about later. Fortunately, or unfortunately-whichever way one likes to put it-these people have no understanding of politics. They are just simple, ordinary people who want to get back to their farms and to their rice paddies to work them and to be able to make a contribution to their own country. But because of what has happened under the Pol Pot regime-and I will be speaking about that later-they have had to flee their country. I suppose one could say that perhaps they were more fortunate than many other people in that area. But here they are seven kilometres from the border of their own country. Can anyone envisage a Queenslander, a New South Welshman, a Victorian or a South Australian having to flee from his own State and live only seven kilometres from the border of that State? What a traumatic experience it must be to be able to almost look over to one's own country with a desire to go back there but not to be able to get there because of all the kinds of things that prevent one from doing just that. The situation at the moment is that Pol Pot and his butchers-and I will talk about them later-are still at the border between Kampuchea and Thailand trying to prevent people from going back to rebuild their own country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> After visiting Thailand and looking at those two refugee camps, my wife and I and Roger Walker went back to Singapore. We then travelled from Singapore into Kampuchea by the airline run by Krissair which was first established by the World Vision organisation. We travelled on the Argosy, a fairly old aircraft but still very serviceable. Whilst we were made very comfortable, it was not like getting on a DC9 and flying from Canberra to Sydney. At least it was comfortable enough. We spent 5 1/2 hours on that aircraft. We travelled from Singapore to Ho Chi Minh City where we stopped for a couple of hours so that the aircraft could be refuelled and we could walk around and stretch our legs. From there we went to Phnom Penh. </PARA>
<PARA> I make these remarks because there are people who will say: 'Neville Bonner could have been snowed by the Heng Samrin Government and the Vietnamese'. But when we arrived at the airport we were met by a person from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We took our suitcases and everything else to the hotel. We had a very short briefing and the person from the Ministry said: 'Senator, I am here representing the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. I have been told to ask you what you want to see'. Naturally enough, I had been briefed by my colleague from World Vision, Roger Walker, as to the types of things we should look at. The things we wanted to look at were orphanages 1, 2 and 3, the paediatric hospital which is funded and run by World Vision, the pig farming which had been re-established by World Vision, the poultry industry which was starting again and which was funded by World vision, the condensed milk factory and the textile factory. One of the two most important things I wanted to look at was the school which the Pol Pot regime turned into a prison and a torture chamber. I have some photographs of different things which I will exhibit as I continue my speech. We also wanted to look at some of the mass graves. </PARA>
<PARA> The experience we had in Phnom Penh was one of the most horrific experiences which my wife and I have ever had. Phnom Penh is a very sad city indeed where there are approximately 250,000 to 500,000 people. But prior to Pol Pot taking over on 17 April four years ago there were approximately 2.5 million people in Phnom Penh. Phnom Penh is a city almost as big as my city of Ipswich. It has beautiful buildings, shops and all the things which one normally would want to see in a city. Pol Pot absolutely and totally ravaged the city. He did so in such a way that it is almost impossible for anyone in this country or in any free country really to understand and visualise what happened. People were driven out of their homes on to the roads and sent out into the country. It almost defies anyone really to express exactly what happened. </PARA>
<PARA> I have some photographs of what happened when Pol Pot took over the city of Phnom Penh and the whole of Kampuchea. One photograph shows how 2.5 million people were driven out of Phnom Penh with nothing at all. They were not allowed to take a solitary thing out of their homes. If they happened to take things out of their homes they were shot and killed because they were regarded as people who supported the capitalist regime or were regarded as educated people. I have with me a photograph which I would be quite happy to show any honourable senator after I have finished speaking. But people-men, women and children-were driven out of the city of Phnom Penh by this terrible regime of Pol Pot. When we toured the city of Phnom Penh, as I said, we looked at the orphanages. I have some photographs which I will be quite happy to show to any member of the Senate when I have finished speaking. The things which children in these orphanages and schools remembered of the Pol Pot regime were depicted in their paintings on the walls. This photograph is of a soldier--</PARA>

<PARA> I have taken a photograph of a painting drawn by young children on the wall of one of these orphanages to show what they remembered of what happened under Pol Pot. I am quite happy to show these to anyone who may be interested, not for political purposes but for humanitarian purposes. They show how the Pol Pot regime used children to drag ploughs which normally were dragged by oxen. They forced children to drag ploughs in the rice paddies. Children were forced to take the place of oxen to drag the carts taking material from one point to another. Again, I can show these photographs to people if they are interested enough to look at them. These are photographs which I took of what happened just outside this school which was used as a prison and as a torture chamber. Here is a photograph showing how supporters of the Pol Pot regime hung people by their feet, pulled them up by a block and tackle and then dropped them head first into a container of water, half drowned them and then pulled them out. They were then asked to make confessions, and when they did not they were dropped back into the container and were pulled out again. This was continued until they were exhausted. Finally, their heads were held in the water until they drowned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, the worst regime in history. But what has the free world done about it? This is the question I ask today. The photographs that I have before me show children in some of these camps and a child in the paediatric hospital run by World Vision in Phnom Penh. I invite honourable senators from both sides of the chamber to examine these photographs. One is of a child who is actually seven months old. These children need great help from the peoples of the free world, the peoples of the West. I will have more to say about that later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Still further photographs depict other aspects of the Pol Pot regime in Kampuchea. Prior to Pol Pot's takeover of Kampuchea there were 60,000 Catholics in Phnom Penh. Today zero Catholics are to be found there. That means that 60,000 Catholic Kampucheans were tortured and murdered by the Pol Pot regime. Another photograph is of a photograph on the wall of a torture chamber. Shown are children as young as six and a seven years as well as students who, when Pol Pot finally won what was called 'The War', came home and were murdered, tortured and butchered by Pol Pot. </PARA>
<PARA> Other photographs show mass graves. I am happpy to make them available to any honourable senator who is concerned enough to look at them. My wife and I and Roger Walker visited one of the many mass graves around Phnom Penh. Some 14 graves were opened up and the skulls and bones placed on top of the mounds. However, I would say that in that area three times as many mass graves were not opened up-so in all some 20,000 people were involved. Another photograph shows a young girl student who was tortured and murdered by Pol Pot supporters. Other photographs show the kind of thing that was perpetrated by the supporters of the regime. When they arrested someone they took a photograph of him. After they tortured him they took another photograph. After he was murdered they took a third photograph. I have before me a series of photographs of young men who were academics and were murdered by Pol Pot after they had suffered the tortures of hell. One can see that from the photographs of the bodies their throats were slit to ensure that they were dead. I have many such photographs for honourable senators to view. </PARA>
<PARA> I propose now to read an example of the rules of this bestial, torturous, murderous regime. Let us remember that this fiend, Pol Pot, is still alive and kicking in a part of Kampuchea; that he is supported totally by Red China and is provided with the arms, ammunition, clothing, food and other facilities that that country can furnish. We know where he is getting that support from but unfortunately, because of world politics, people are not prepared to say. The following are some of the rules laid down for inmates of this torture prison:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. You must answer accordingly to my questions. Don't turn them away. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. Don't try to hide the facts by making pretexts this and that. Your are strictly prohibited to contest me. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. Don't be a fool for you are a chap who dare to thwart the revolution. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. You must immediately answer my questions without wasting time to reflect. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. Don't tell me either about your immoralities or the essense of the revolution. </PARA>
<PARA> 6. While getting lashes or electricfication you must not cry at all. </PARA>
<PARA>While one is being lashed by electric wires, set on a handle, or receiving electric shocks, one must not cry out at all. These are laws that were laid down by the Pol Pot regime-</PARA>
<PARA> 7. Do nothing, sit still and wait for my orders. If there is no order, keep quiet. When I ask you to do something, you must do it right away without protesting. </PARA>
<PARA> 8. Don't make pretexts about Kampuchea . . . in order to hide your jaw of traitor. </PARA>
<PARA> 9. If you don't follow all the above rules, you will get many many lashes of electric wire. </PARA>
<PARA> 10. If you disobey any point of my regulations you will get either 10 lashes or five shocks of electric discharge. </PARA>
<PARA>But one must not cry out when all of these things are done; one must just bear it and not say anything at all. I suppose that what I am really all about is the fact that Australia as a country is not prepared to do what it should be doing to aid Kampuchea-again because of politics, a subject which I do not wish to discuss in this connection. What I am all about is humanitarianism. People in Australia and in many countries of the Association of South East Asian Nations say: 'We cannot recognise the Heng Samrin Government because it has been propped up by the Vietnamese, who invaded Kampuchea'. But why did the Vietnamese invade Kampuchea? That is the most important question for us to answer. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0V4">Senator BONNER</NAME></TALKER>

The fact is that they did invade, and drove out the bestial Pol Pot regime, which was responsible, on a very conservative estimate, for the torture and death of some 3 1/2 million people. The Vietnamese drove out this beastly man and his followers. Let me compare that situation to what happened in Uganda. Honourable senators will recall that some time ago I made a speech about what Idi Amin was doing in Uganda, about his being responsible for the death of Bishop Luwum and about his many other crimes. The countries of the world were aghast at what Idi Amin was doing. Julius Nyerere of Tanzania sent in his troops. They did exactly what the Vietnamese did in Kampuchea. They got rid of Idi Amin and his forces. I suppose that in the same sense they re-established Obote as the head of the Government of Uganda. That was rightly applauded by Australia and the world. Julius Nyerere got rid of Idi Amin and his vicious, horrible troops, that did such dreadful things to the people of Uganda. The Vietnamese did very much the same sort of thing in Kampuchea. We say we cannot abide that kind of thing because it was an invasion of Kampuchea.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not want to get into that area. All I am saying is that here we have a country whose people are in need of help to rebuild their country, to enable them to get back on their feet and to run their own country. From my experience of talking to people at all levels in Kampuchea, not only people in the aid agencies but also the ordinary people in the city of Phnom Penh, I would say that the Kampuchean people regard the Vietnamese people, rightly or wrongly, as their saviours. Despite the Pol Pot regime, all the things I have spoken about, the photographs I have shown and the bestial treatment that they received, they regard the Vietnamese people as their saviours. I say very sincerely that if the Vietnamese people were to move out of Kampuchea tomorrow, there is no doubt whatsoever that Pol Pot and his supporters would be back in control of Kampuchea. There is not the slightest doubt in my mind, in the minds of the people in Phnom Penh, in the minds of the people of Kampuchea or in the minds of the aid agency people that that is what would happen. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very grateful indeed for what our Government has done in providing immediate relief for Kampuchea. We have done remarkably well in a sense because we have given immediate aid. The blockage is because we will not do anything towards the rehabilitation of the country because to do that, we say, would be to recognise the Heng Samrin Government which is supposedly a puppet government of Vietnam. Be that as it may, as far as I am concerned there is a need in Kampuchea for aid that we are capable of giving. I do not give a continental damn how we give that aid-whether we give it by recognising Heng Samrin or through the voluntary aid agencies which are more than capable of giving aid to that country. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me talk about some of the things that I saw in that country. I looked at the milk factory which at present is providing about 200,000 cans of condensed milk for the people of Kampuchea. Unfortunately the factory has only sufficient raw material-powdered milk, glucose and things like that-to keep it going until the end of this year. It has only sufficient sugar to sweeten the milk to keep it going until September. Where in the name of Hades will the factory get the materials to keep it going? It cannot. There is no light at the end of the tunnel. </PARA>
<PARA> I looked at the textile factory. I do not know how many honourable senators here today have any understanding of how textile factories work. There are a couple of textile factories in my home city, so I have a little working knowledge of what textile factories are all about. The textile factory is divided into approximately three sections. One section is where the yarn comes in and is made into cotton; the next one is where the cotton is turned into material; and the next section is where the printing and everything else is done. Because the factory does not have sufficient power only one-third of the factory can work at any one time. That textile factory employs about 800 people-500 men and 300 women. Only one-third of it is able to work at any one time. What does a textile factory mean to people? It means the difference between having clothing and not having clothing. </PARA>
<PARA> What really shocked my wife is that she learnt from conversation with a number of womenfolk in the city of Phnom Penh that there is nowhere in that city at the moment where a lady can buy the necessary cosmetics and the ordinary things that women need and use. They cannot be procured because they are not being produced. Yet we sit here in our ivory towers and say: 'Oh no, we cannot help them to get these industries going again because that is rehabilitation and we cannot have rehabilitation as that means recognising the Heng Samrin Government and the Vietnamese people'. I believe we can do those things. We can and must try in some way to open up a dialogue with the Vietnamese people and with the Heng Samrin Government so that something can be done in that area of the world which is so sorely in need of help. I believe we can do it. </PARA>
<PARA> One really serious matter is that no government in the free Western world has ever done anything about taking these people to the International Court of Justice, as we did with the nazis in Germany and other war criminals. I find it difficult to describe Pol Pot and Ieng Sary and the people involved in what happened in Kampuchea. I find it difficult even to talk of them without having an emotional feeling about the whole thing. What really shook me was that while we were in Singapore on my way home from this visit my wife and I learnt from two reputable Australian journalists that Ieng Sary was shopping in Singapore. He was walking down the street a free man. After all the atrocities that he perpetrated against the Kampuchean people he was walking down the streets of Singapore buying things in shops. Pol Pot is still alive. No one is prepared to take either of those people or their regime to the International Court of Justice as we did in the case of the nazis in Germany after the last war. I hope and pray with everything I have that some country-I hope it will be my country and my Government-will have the intestinal fortitude and the courage to initiate that kind of thing. </PARA>

<PARA> Finally, I shall read an extract on what happened in Kampuchea. At least the people of Kampuchea and the Heng Samrin Government have taken Pol Pot and his cohorts to task. They took Pol Pot to the courts in Kampuchea and Pol Pot was found guilty of a number of charges. The extract from the article reads:</PARA>
<PARA> At the sitting of August 15, 1979, the Tribunal heard the Act of Accusation of Genocide committed by Pol Pot and Ieng Sary read by the Prosecutor at the People's Revolutionary Tribunal. According to this act, Pol Pot, Ieng Sary and their gang have been accused of the following crimes:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Systematically carrying out a plan of increasingly ferocious massacre against all strata of the population. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. Forcible and immediate evacuation of the urban population, and systematic displacement of the rural population, causing the death of a large number of people. </PARA>
<PARA>We understand the number of dead is now something like 3 1/2 million people-</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Organisation of a regime of repression and coercion in the people's communes where the population was forced to toil until exhaustion, was reduce to slavery and living conditions conducive to physical and moral destruction. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. Destruction of all human ties, repression of thinking, negation of the human being who was reduced to a solitary slave whose sole tie is subordination to Angkar. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. Liquidation of Buddhist bonzes, religious, believers. Systematic liquidation of intellectuals, destruction of religion and national culture. </PARA>
<PARA> 6. Massacre of children, persecution and corruption of adolescents with a view to turning them into torturers devoid of all human feelings. </PARA>
<PARA> 7. Thorough destruction of the national economy, bringing the population to starvation. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the accusation the Heng Samrin Government made in trying to bring these people to justice. They have not been brought to justice, unfortunately, because the peoples of the West, including Australia, have not had the intestinal fortitude or courage to do what this group of people have been able to do. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope and pray that somehow, somewhere and in some way we can see our way clear at least to open dialogue with the people of Kampuchea through their Government at the moment. I hope, and have proposed this to the Australian Government, that a delegation of Australian parlia- mentarians-I do not care from which side of the chamber they come-visits Kampuchea and not only goes into Phnom Penh, as I was able to do, but also looks at a broader area of Kampuchea and report to the Australian Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I was told by the Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs in Phnom Penh that any time I and my wife would be most welcome in Phnom Penh. He said that we would be welcome to look at Kampuchea. I hope that perhaps in some way and somehow we can organise a delegation of parliamentarians from this Parliament to visit that country, look at it, talk to the people, come back to Australia and make a report to the Australian Parliament. Perhaps then our Government will be able to do something for a beautiful and lovely people who are certainly more than worthy of help from the free world. The Western World should give them some help so that they can retain what they want most-to be recognised as people and to do the things they want to do and not what someone else wants to impose on them. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the report. </PARA>
<PARA>I have the honour to present to the Senate the report of the Standing Committee on Social Welfare entitled 'Another Side to the Drug Debate- a medicated society?'. This report follows on from an earlier report of the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare. That report exposed for the first time a number of drug-related problems, particularly in relation to alcohol and tobacco. The report that is presented today deals with another aspect of the drug debate, namely, the use of prescription and over the counter medication. In many respects this is the first comprehensive report done in Australia on this particular aspect of drug use. None of us would like to be accused of contributing in some form or manner to the drug problem, but as a consequence of almost total community support for medication, we have all at some stage contributed to it. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me say at the very outset that the Committee does not condemn the use of medication in our society. On the contrary, the Committee has been quick to highlight and comment on the beneficial effects of the use of medication in our society. What the Committee is deeply concerned about is the way in which we have come to rely on, and use drugs. In particular, medication in the wrong hands or inappropriately used can have devastating results from the point of view of both the individual and the community at large. The dividing line between the legitimate use of drugs for either medical or social purposes and inappropriate use is indistinct. For example, some people are able to use analgesics or psychotropic drugs without harm but many others become dependent on them both emotionally and physically. Because of the dramatic advances made in medical treatment, particularly over the last 50 years, both the medical profession and community have placed great expectations on the use of medication. </PARA>
<PARA> The dramatic advances in medical science and technology have enabled us to understand many of the so-called modern disease processes more fully and this has helped facilitate the development of preventive and curative treatments. The Committee supports these advances but it believes that if the pathways controlling mood come to be fully understood and drugs which alter mood are developed, we should not accept as a norm a society in which widespread drug taking is used to treat the outcomes of social distress. The Committee believes that we have to ask ourselves whether this is the sort of society we want and, indeed, whether the need for widespread drug taking reflects serious problems in our society. </PARA>
<PARA> In our society the giving of medication is a symbol of caring. The symbolic gesture is an important aspect of the use of medication, quite apart from any specific pharmacological effect that it may have. The desire to give a person something to make him better is strong and in many cases, although the medicinal benefit is probably minimal, the psychological benefit may be considerable. This is not to say that drug treatment is not an important part of the total health care in our modern community. Rather, the Committee believes that the expectations of drug therapy are becoming too great and that perhaps society is becoming too dependent on drug treatment as a cure for social as opposed to medical problems. What is equally worrying is that the medical profession has been forced to involve itself not only in the treatment of disease but also in trying to cope with all sorts of social and community problems which society regards as an illness but which the profession has not been trained to deal with. </PARA>
<PARA> It is against this background that the Committee has written this report in the hope that the Senate, the Government and the people will gain a greater awareness of the proper use of medication in our society. I now wish to elaborate briefly on a number of major findings arising out of this report. </PARA>
<PARA>Development of a Data Base for Planning and Explaining Public Policies</PARA>
<PARA> The first obstacle the Committee came up against in trying to understand and appreciate fully the use of medication in our society was the lack of adequate data from which to draw meaningful conclusions. To date, most people have relied on Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme figures to indicate levels and trends in consumption. Far too much reliance has been placed on PBS data for policy and research purposes. In total, PBS and Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme figures represent only 74 per cent of all ethical drugs bought from pharmacies and only 47 per cent of all drugs used. In certain therapeutic classes the level of total consumption which is accounted for by PBS figures is as low as 30 per cent. The Committee, through its research, has provided what it believes for the first time in Australia a comprehensive set of figures on levels and trends of total drug consumption. In addition, the Committee has compiled figures on a selected range of drugs, in particular psychotropic drugs, which it believes give a more realistic and meaningful insight into our drug-taking patterns and habits. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee believes strongly that the Commonwealth requires a more comprehensive data base and in particular one that will enable comparisons to be made from one region to another or from one community group to another. If drug taking is only masking more serious problems in our society it is essential that policy makers have at their disposal adequate comparative data to identify specific problems faced by particular groups or regions in our society. With this in mind the Committee has recommended that the Commonwealth Department of Health develop a data base which is able to give an adequate assessment of the consumption of therapeutic drugs. This could in part be achieved by purchasing data from commercial sources such as Intercontinental Medical Statistics (Australasia) Pty Ltd but the Department would still need to negotiate with manufacturers and distributors to gain more comprehensive data on hospital consumption and the sale of proprietary drugs to non-pharmacy outlets. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to go into detail at this stage about the various levels and trends of consumption of particular drugs in the Australian community. However, the Committee was able to determine from its research that over the period 1975 to 1979 the consumption of proprietary drugs from pharmacies rose slightly, the increase in consumption of ethical drugs from pharmacies was moderate and the increase in drug consumption generally in hospitals was significant. Overall, the Committee reported that total drug consumption between the period 1975 and 1979 increased moderately. </PARA>
<PARA> In brief, the Committee's research into the community's drug taking habits and patterns revealed the following: Approximately $55 per head is spent on drugs per annum; psychotropic drug intake is presently averaging out at around 29 daily dosages per head of population per annum; there are 4.36 prescriptions per head dispensed under the PBS per annum; there are 22.22 prescriptions per head dispensed under the Pensioner PBS per annum; there are 18.55 prescriptions per head dispensed under the Repatriation PBS per annum; hospital drug consumption has risen substantially in recent years; surveys have revealed that between 47 to 60 per cent of the population are regular users of medication; more women than men take drugs; both the very young and elderly are major consumers of medication; and an alarming number of patients do not take their medication as directed. </PARA>
<PARA>Drug Evaluation and Control</PARA>
<PARA> In an attempt to try to examine the evaluation, distribution and control procedures in Australia, the Committee continually came up against problems of non-uniformity of legislation between the Commonwealth and States, overlap of responsibility between the Commonwealth and States and the existence of a maze of committees, boards, councils and other groups that had been set up to carry out a particular function in the drug area. In addition, in the area of evaluation, distribution and control, the Committee could not accept the numerous explanations given by the Commonwealth Department of Health that it had been unable to fulfil a number of its functions adequately due to lack of resources. The Committee believes that these functions are important and have been introduced to ensure the proper regulation and control of all facets of drug manufacture and distribution. Therefore, the Committee does not accept as satisfactory the explanation of financial and manpower shortages. We believe strongly that rules and regulations are of minimal value unless there are adequate resources to ensure that they are complied with at all times. In this respect, the Committee has made a number of recommendations aimed at ensuring that all these functions can be carried out efficiently and effectively. </PARA>
<PARA> The responsibility for evaluation, quality and control of therapeutic substances is shared by both the Commonwealth and States. The Committee recognises that there will always be inherent problems with respect to any shared functions but the Committee believes that with careful planning and co-operation between the Commonwealth and States many of these problems can be minimised. One of the major findings of the Committee in this respect concerns the establishment of a national registration scheme incorporating a national products register. At the present time there is no comprehensive listing of all therapeutic substances produced and marketed in Australia, let alone a comprehensive evaluation of all therapeutic substances on the Australian market. It is the Committee's belief that the safety of the community is of utmost importance where pharmacological substances are involved. The inadequacy of the current system threatens that safety. The Committee further believes that a national products register without the backing of a national registration scheme will be of no assistance in the area of control. Therefore, the Committee has recommended that the national registration scheme as already outlined by the Commonwealth Department of Health be instituted as soon as practicable along with the proposed national products register. </PARA>
<PARA>Drug Manufacture and Distribution</PARA>
<PARA> The only point I wish to raise today regarding firms and people involved in manufacture and distribution of drugs concerns the way in which their long term viability is determined or influenced by government policy. The Committee has made it quite clear in the report that any policies aimed at the restructure, rationalisation or income maintenance should be devised in such a way that the demand for therapeutic substances is not increased; that is, if there is an over-supply of manufacturing capacity, pharmacies and doctors, the Committee would be strongly opposed to any policy that tried to increase the demand to match that supply. It would rather see policies aimed at coming to terms with the inherent problems associated within the supply side. </PARA>
<PARA>Drug Promotion</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee in the report has highlighted a number of problems associated with the promotion of drugs in Australia. The Committee found that advertising does tend to stereotype people and this had the potential to create a situation where drug taking becomes the norm for that particular situation. The Committee also found that there was a great deal of variability in the control over advertising in the print and electronic media. In particular, the Committee found many shortcomings over controls in the print media and as a result has made several recommendations which it believes will remedy that situation. Finally, the Committee found that advertising does play an important role in informing and educating doctors and in this regard the Committee believes that the educational content of advertising needs to be improved. The Committee has made recommendations to that effect. </PARA>
<PARA>Adverse Drug Reactions</PARA>
<PARA> No drug is free of the possibility of adverse reactions due to individual sensitivities or allergies though in many cases these may be very small. The doctor must make the appropriate risk-benefit decision when prescribing any course of medication. Because the clinical trial and evaluation prior to marketing are limited, it is necessary to adopt procedures which will enable adequate post-market surveillance and help in the early detection of any unknown adverse drug reactions. No matter how thorough the research and evaluation is prior to the release of a drug there is always a likelihood that unexpected adverse reactions may appear after many years of carefully supervised medical use. In the event that such a situation arises, the medical profession needs to be able to follow up immediately all patients who have used that drug. The Committee found that the present post-market drug surveillance and the detection of adverse drug reactions is ad hoc, is subject mainly to voluntary reporting and is limited to only a very few drugs. We are all only too aware of the thalidomide tragedy and we would not like to see similar events occurring in the future. However, under the present system of surveillance, the Committee cannot rule out that such an event will occur again. It is in this regard that the Committee has recommended the establishment of adequate and effective schemes designed to monitor and detect the occurrence of adverse drug reactions and in particular it has recommended that hospitals should be required, as part of their accreditation system, to establish adequate facilities for monitoring and reporting adverse drug reactions. The public has a right to expect that all drugs on the market are safe and effective in their specific use and that adequate checks and safeguards are still applied in the post-marketing phase. </PARA>
<PARA>Medication, the Solution to Society's Ills</PARA>
<PARA> I wish to draw to the attention of honourable senators the major findings and purpose of the report. In this report the Committee has looked at many aspects of drug use in our society. It has examined the conceptual and philosophical framework behind society's almost unquestioned faith in medication and has discussed the evaluation, production and distribution systems. The Committee has concluded that the medical use of drugs in our society has played an important role in the past and will continue to play a significant role in the future. This is not to deny that there are a number of problems with respect to the use of medication. In this report the Committee has drawn attention to a number of areas of concern and has made recommendations which would significantly improve the handling and use of drugs in the community. However, the Committee believes that the present and future use of drugs should be assessed against the broader aspects of health and not simply in the context of curative and palliative medicine. The ultimate objective of medical care of which drugs are an integral part is the attainment of a better level of community health and well-being. Even when drug treatment is effective, there is still a need to satisfy ourselves that its use is the most appropriate course of action. </PARA>
<PARA> It is with these matters in mind that the Committee believes that there is a need for the Australian community to declare for itself a long term strategy which takes better account of all aspects of health, both curative and preventive, and which ensures that each determinant of health is given appropriate weighting and support. Possibly one of the major contemporary misunderstandings concerns the belief that more medical care which includes not only drugs, but doctors, hospitals, health centres, et cetera, leads to better or improved health. The Committee believes that most Western nations have poured vast amounts of money, manpower and time into the medical system, not for the benefits which it confers but in the belief that such emphasis can lead to a healthier, happier and more productive society. While this belief may be undisputed from the individual's point of view, it is not at all clear from a societal point of view that this ever-increasing health care expenditure has achieved the desired result. </PARA>
<PARA> The report has also drawn attention to the fact that the concentration on medical care in the health area is symptomatic of society's tendency to medicalise-to coin a phrase-as many problems as possible. This approach has led society to spend more and more money on medical care. It has reinforced society's belief that individuals cannot adequately look after themselves without the assistance of the medical profession. This has placed more and more pressure and responsibility on the doctor and has made him a scapegoat when he fails to achieve the impossible. To try to measure up to patient expectation the doctor has relied very heavily on the availability of a great battery of drugs. The Committee acknowledges that this is a very complex problem and that there would be difficulties and resistance to any attempt to de-medicalise or reclassify particular illnesses or dysfunctions. Nonetheless, the Committee believes that many problems have been wrongly or simplistically diagnosed as medical matters when in actual fact such problems would be best dealt with in a broader, societal and community context. In fact, the Committee believes that for some problems it is only a societal approach which can hope to be effective in the long term. To an extent certain disorders have already become locked into the medical system and it would be difficult in the short term to try to change the way in which we treat some problems. Once again, it is in this regard that the Committee believes that the declaration and implementation of a long term strategy which will place less reliance on medication, valuable as medication is, and give greater attention and value to other determinants of health, will be the most sensible and feasible course of action. </PARA>
<PARA> The report has commented on the suggestion that our modern diseases have arisen primarily as a result of society's departure from the conditions of life under which man has evolved. If this is so, one could reasonably ask whether it would be feasible to return to such conditions of life in order to eradicate or modify the diseases that are presently afflicting mankind. It would appear that if we are to make progress in the improvement of society's health and well-being, not only will we have to place relatively less reliance on medicine, including drugs, but we will also have to be prepared to modify our lifestyles. In terms of modern day values, the achievement of good health is not without its costs and sacrifices. Principally, these require the denial of present pleasure for future benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee does see a dilemma in pursuing a course to bring about improved health within the community. Society has known for quite some time that health and quality of life are improved by taking exercise, avoiding tobacco, alcohol and other drugs, and limiting the consumption of food. The dilemma is that to promote health activities which will encourage better health is also to put at risk the long term viability of many industries and thereafter employment opportunities within our community. That is, we have come to depend very heavily on a tobacco industry, a drug industry, an alcohol industry and a refined food industry as well as many other activities which act either directly or indirectly in some degree against the attainment of good health. </PARA>
<PARA>What Can Be Done?</PARA>
<PARA> Health is about many things. Medication has played its part well and will continue to play a significant role in the maintenance of health. However, medication alone cannot promote or guarantee a health society. All aspects of health must be equally cherished and desired. Beneficial effects of medication will not be enhanced if society continues to rely heavily on the availability of pills and cures to put them back on the road to good health. Medication cannot do what indivudals are unwilling to do. What must be made clear is that the report is not advocating alternatives to drugs but rather the need to place less reliance on drugs. While the Committee sees the maintenance of health as being very much the responsibility of the individual, it recognises that governments can provide the necessary framework or incentives to enable individuals to make health promotion decisions based on relevant and meaningful information. That is, governments must ensure that individuals have access to the best information possible to improve the decision-making processes regarding health matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee, in the report, has made a number of recommendations which it believes will lead to a healthier and less drug-dependent society. As a first step, the Committee has recommended that all governments in Australia reaffirm their support both to the concept and implementation of the declared strategy outlined in our previous report, 'Drug Problems in Australia-an intoxicated society?'. This reaffirmation should also take into account the reappraisal of that declared strategy as outlined in this report. Such a commitment in the Committee's view will help establish the necessary framework from which all aspects of the drug problem can be considered and feasible policy options developed. I am pleased to see that the Commonwealth Minister for Health has announced the establishment of a national body to draw up and implement a uniform drug strategy. This Committee will follow carefully the progress of this Commonwealth-State ministerial committee on drug strategy. </PARA>
<PARA> To date, the emphasis has been on the treatment of disease, not on the promotion of health. In particular, what is needed is a better balance to be struck between the amount spent on medical care and the amount spent on all other factors which have some relationship to health. The Committee has recommended that the Commonwealth Department of Heath undertake a study to obtain more information about the relative importance of all determinants of health. An evaluation study of this nature would provide a valuable insight into the relative merits of medical care, including the use of drugs, compared with all other determinants of health. This study could then be used to reassess the allocation of public funding in the area of health. The Director-General of Health, in his 1979-80 report, devoted his opening remarks to the issues and philosophy of health promotion. This Committee will also watch with interest further developments taken by the Commonwealth Department of Health in the area of health promotion. </PARA>
<PARA> The mass media has been used by virtually every sector of the community to promote their activities or to further the use of their products. In the same way the Government should make effective use of the mass media to get across positive messages on health to the general public. Health needs to be promoted along similar lines to all other products in the community. Therefore, the Committee has recommended in this report that the Commonwealth Department of Health undertake a pilot study to examine the feasibility of using the mass media to get across to the public effective messages concerning determinants of health other than drugs. These messages could cover such things as diet, exercise, road safety, relaxation and hygiene. In the Committee's earlier report we recommended that the Government take the initiative to discourage activities which are deemed harmful to the individual's health. In particular it recommended the banning of advertising of such products as alcohol and tobacco. The Committee once again urges the Commonwealth and State governments to act upon the recommendations made in this earlier report regarding promotion, advertising and sponsorship by alcohol and tobacco companies. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, may I say that the Committee recognises only too well that there are many problems associated with governments actively supporting and promoting a better state of health and well-being within Australia. It also recognises that such changes cannot be expected to come about overnight. This is where the Committee believes that the Government should make a long-term declaration regarding the desirable state of health and well-being within the community. Such a declaration would provide a positive impetus to those activities which promote health and at the same time would give adequate warning about other activities which are detrimental to health. If we do not make a move in this direction, our health-or to be more specific, our ill-health-will come to depend more and more on members of the medical profession and the vast battery of drugs that they have at their disposal. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I wish to express my personal appreciation to my fellow Committee members for their contributions during the inquiry and during the deliberations which followed. I should also like to record the Committee's gratitude to the former Chairman, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Peter Baume. Because of his elevation to the ministry he was unable to proceed with the drafting of the report, but his ideas and influence did have great bearing on the Committee's deliberations. In addition, I should like to record the Committee's gratitude for the co-operation and assistance received throughout the inquiry from State governments and many departments, organisations and individuals. Our thanks go also to our Committee staff. The technical nature of the report has meant that additional demands were made on the secretarial staff. They were required to familiarise themselves with the correct use of innumerable medical terms, and the committee is deeply appreciative of their dedication to the task. The Committee thanks the previous secretaries and particularly the present secretary, Peter Kiel, who joined the Committee only half way through the preparation of the report. I would also like to thank Pat Mowbray, Pam Gulloni and Elanore Gilmore for their support. Thanks also go to our personal staffs and to the various specialist staffs of the Parliament for their ready response to our many and varied needs during the inquiry. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, as a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare and as a concerned person I should like to endorse the comments made by Senator Walters on the presentation of this report, titled 'Another Side to the Drug Debate-a medicated society?'. As the title of this report suggests, the Committee has posed the question of whether we have indeed become a medicated society. My colleague on the other side of the chamber has already briefly outlined the major findings of the Committee's research into the community's drug taking habits and patterns. I would like to elaborate on some of those findings because I believe that the data that this Committee has compiled shows quite clearly that we have become a medicated society.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The 1977-78 Australian health survey revealed a number of what I believe are alarming facts. The survey showed that approximately one-half of the population was taking medication in the two days before the survey was undertaken. That medication was taken either on a doctor's advice or was self-prescribed. The breakdown of the figures on the population reveals that around 48 per cent of children under age five; 31 1/2 per cent of the community in the age group five to 14 years; 43.6 per cent in the age group 15 to 24 years; nearly 50 per cent in the age group 25 to 44; and over 61 per cent in the age group 45 to 64, were taking medication. Perhaps what is most alarming, nearly 75 per cent of those in the age group 65 and over were taking medication in the two days before the survey was undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA> The results of that survey have been known for quite some time. Unfortunately, there has been very little official comment to date on the implications and the ramifications of this apparently widespread drug-taking phenomenon. The Australian health survey, as well as other data collected by the Committee, revealed quite conclusively that more women than men take medication. In particular, nearly twice as many women as men take medication prescribed or suggested by a doctor. I am quite sure that my colleagues on the Committee would support me when I say that medication has been used to mask many problems faced by women in our community. It is a poor reflection on our society if we have to tell many women that the problem will not go away but that we can give them something to make them feel good or help them cope with their problem. </PARA>
<PARA> I found from the evidence that too many doctors put women into convenient boxes. They saw them as poor, distressed women trying to cope with the problem of being a mother and a wife without looking at the underlying problems that caused their distress. We find these days that many women in the bigger cities of Australia are trying to cope with too much. They are trying to cope with being mothers and with being the wage earner, the provider in the home-or at least a part provider in the home. I found that many women had the sort of day that would distress a labourer on the wharf, a man with better physical attributes to help him cope with the problems. </PARA>
<PARA> Many women these days have the sort of day in which they get up at six o'clock in the morning to put on the washing, get the kids up, get them bathed and ready for school, give them their breakfast, cut their lunches, get them off to school, go to work, work all day, shop on their way home in the evening, prepare the dinner, put the children to bed, do the housework, do the ironing, do the mending and all the other household tasks, then fall into bed at midnight. They then have to get up at six o'clock the next morning to repeat it all over again. That is not a life for a draught-horse, let alone a human being!</PARA>
<PARA> Other women in our society today are isolated at home. Because we have such poor public transport systems, because the price of fuel is so great, they have no means of getting out of their houses. They are isolated from mothers, grandmothers, aunts, or the world that they grew up in. Their only companions are small children. Small children are lovely people, but the conversation of a five-year-old, a four-year-old or a three-year-old, all day every day can be very distressing. Many of these women find themselves distressed and looking for help. There are women in our communities today who have never learned English. They grew up in another part of the world. Their mother tongue is not English. Perhaps they were not particularly adept at using or writing in their own language. They have never learned to use or write in our language and they find themselves isolated. Too many of those women finish up on the other side of the doctor's desk asking for help, and too many doctors find that the only help that they can give them is to prescribe a pill. They tell them: 'Go home. Take a pill. Become a cabbage. Forget that there are other things in the world to worry about or that you are a human being'. </PARA>
<PARA> Our report also discussed at some length the incidence of drug taking among children-in particular, as I pointed out, children under the age of five. It is distressing that the only way that society can deal with problems that manifest in small children is to give them drugs. It is distressing that so many children under the age of five have problems. At the moment, when children become ill, we take them along to the doctors and the doctors inevitably prescribe some medicine for them. Whilst I have some reservations about doctors' ability these days properly to diagnose and prescribe medication-because of the training they get-I, along with my colleagues, found it most disturbing to find that nearly 30 per cent of children under the age of five are given medication which could be self-prescribed; that is, that the parents or friends of the child have taken it upon themselves to decide what is appropriate and most beneficial for the youngster. We have doctors who, without a great deal of training in the pharmaceutical area-in some cases we were told in evidence they had no training in the pharmaceutical area-prescribe medication for children. We found in the world of the professionals that in some instances doctors had no training in the pharmaceutical area and yet they were the only people who could prescribe drugs. They did not understand what the reaction of a drug might be or the reaction of one drug on another. I find that situation alarming and appalling. I hope that those people who are in a position to look at the training of doctors in the future will look very closely at that area. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area about which we heard evidence was self-prescription. People had got into the habit of taking a pill. Doctors told us that it was the patients' fault and they demanded a pill. On the other hand, we heard evidence which showed that people had got into the habit of believing a pill would solve all their problems. We also found that the older a person got the more likely he or she was to have a number of prescriptions and to have a cabinet filled with bottles and boxes of potions and pills. If a daughter turned up with a child who had some ailment then it was likely, we found, that grandpa or grandma would go to the cupboard and find something that might do the child some good. We were appalled that that action goes on. We were also appalled to find that repatriation pensioners and age pensioners with ailments repeatedly went to doctors to get a prescription. They had their prescription filled, and then they put the bottles and boxes away. We found to our horror that many people felt that unless they had an ailment their pension would be taken away from them; so the whole cycle was prolonged. People who did not need medication were prescribed medication because they fronted up to a doctor to show that they were worthy of a pension. The off-shoot was that in many instances they used that material to prescribe for their entire families. </PARA>
<PARA> It is sad that during the International Year of the Child considerable attention was paid to the physical, emotional and sexual abuse of children, but unfortunately very little attention was paid to the chemical abuse or assault on children. From a drug manufacturer's point of view, what could be better than establishing drug-taking habits at a very early age? Once the pattern has been established it is not surprising that by adulthood the population has almost an unquestioned faith in the power and benefits of medication. I saw no evidence to show that the medical profession was taking much of a stand against that situation. In the area of drug-taking patterns and habits, it is alarming to hear statements to the effect that 45 per cent of psychoactive drugs go to elderly people, who constitute less than 10 per cent of the population. Probably only 20 per cent of drugs taken by the elderly are necessary. Forty-eight per cent of patients in a Sydney nursing home took psychoactive drugs before admission to the home, but after admission the figure rose to 92.3 per cent. A significant number of elderly people are in institutions because of drugs prescribed by doctors who failed to appreciate that the elderly have a reduced tolerance of many agents. In many cases the drug dose to elderly people should be halved. Therefore both ends of the population spectrum come in for a great deal of chemical abuse simply because other people, including doctors, have taken it upon themselves to give or prescribe medication because they believe it will be good for them. They see it as the only answer to a problem that they are not prepared to face. I agree with Senator Walters. I believe governments have a duty in this area if they believe the good of the country depends on the good health of the country. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to my original point, and that is: What does this drug-taking phenomenon reveal about our society? The report that has been tabled certainly does not say that all drugs are bad. On the contrary, it has gone to great lengths to highlight and emphasise the beneficial effects of medication. On the other hand, the Committee was unable to give total and unquestioned support for all forms and use of medication-that is, we are not saying that all drugs are bad, but at the same time we are not saying that all drugs are good. What we have said in this report is that drugs or medication should not be seen as the main determinant of health. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walters has already highlighted the major thrust of this report. I endorse this major thrust and believe very strongly we must, as a society, promote all positive aspects of health. We must develop preventive strategies and we must be prepared seriously to tackle those problems in society which most of our drug taking has continued to mask. Whilst health is ultimately very much the responsibility of the individual, there is still a great need for government participation in the health area to ensure that individuals have the right sort of information on which to make proper health care decisions. If we simply leave it to the private sector, every member of the community will be bombarded continually with various vested interest groups to take a pill for every ill. I take a strong view, as I have said, on the question of doctors' education. I believe they rely far too heavily on the material that is made available by the pharmaceutical companies and yet they are the only people who are allowed to prescribe drugs. They have the least education in the area and yet are the only people with the ability to prescribe. I believe this report has put medication into its proper perspective in the health care arena and if, as a community, we put medication into that perspective we will become a far healthier and happier society. I commend the report to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am pleased that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) is in charge of the chamber because my contribution to the discussion on Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1980-81 is dedicated to three aspects of his portfolio-namely, the effects of agent orange on the community in general and on veterans in particular; the problems now being encountered at two levels in relation to repatriation pensions; and the incident that took place in this city on Anzac Day. Firstly, I refer to the problems associated with agent orange and the manner in which many veterans have been affected because of their exposure to it. I take the Minister to task for his remarks passed earlier this year. He said that much of this was in the imagination or words to that effect and if it was not caused by the psychological aspects of war--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister is reported in the Press as having said that. He said the other problem was caused by sexually transmitted diseases. We realise that STD-caused problems are fairly widespread in Asian areas, but I think it is unfair to make that blanket charge so far as ex-servicemen are concerned. A veteran has given me permission to state his case publicly in an attempt to obtain justice in medical treatment and thus cure his problems caused from exposure to agent orange. The gentleman concerned, Graham Kenneth Scarce, lives in my city of Townsville. As the Minister for Veterans' Affairs is taking notes I quote the file, which is No. MSS2348. This man is married. He served in South Vietnam at Nui Dat between 1970 and 1971. He was a plant operator. The young men there were told at the time that while helicopters were operating and other methods of spraying were being used in the area it was quite safe and there was nothing to worry about. In the humid Asian atmosphere most of these men wore long slacks, gaiters, boots and hat but they seldom wore shirts. Obviously, a large part of their skin was exposed to the spray. The rash on the young man I mentioned is brought about by the chemical used at that time. It disappears under some medication but reappears. On the last occasion the rash reappeared his local doctor gave him needles to stop the itching from the waistline to the hair line. He has had the rash on previous occasions but not the needles to tone down the itching.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In his present employment he wears light overalls. His employer is quite happy about this. Although uniforms are usually supplied for the type of work that he does with one of the major airlines, unfortunately he has to buy his own lightweight overalls. He was asked by the local doctor to be tested for agent orange exposure while he was in the Greenslopes Repatriation Hospital in Brisbane recently. He was also advised by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs that there is no record of his application to have his problem accepted as a war-caused disability. Nothing happened to his claim so he put in a second claim but he was told it got lost. That is the sort of thing that is happening in some sections of the Department of Veterans' Affairs today. </PARA>
<PARA> At the end of my contribution to this debate I want to make a short statement because I think Senator Bonner may have misunderstood an interjection I made, but I will not include the explanation in my speech. </PARA>
<PARA> I have photographs of this rash. The Minister may examine them if he wishes. The rash last appeared on 17 January 1981 and gradually spread. The man was given injections to stop the itch. There are colour photographs of the body from near the groin to the left side of the body trunk and photographs of the stomach and the chest. They were taken at various stages following the onset of the rash. So there is photographic proof of how the rash spreads in periodic outbreaks. There are photographs of the rash on the lower back and the buttocks. The photographs were taken over a period of several days by the man's wife. There are photographs of the rash on the back, the stomach and under the right arm. Each one shows a very angry rash quite clearly and it can be identified without the aid of any sort of apparatus. I hope that this case will be considered. </PARA>
<PARA> Many other people have reported to my office in Townsville that they all have a similar complaint. They are supposed to lodge their details but nothing is ever done about them. I understand that the Minister was to go to America but we have seen no report of any findings that he made as a result of his examination of American veterans. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the trip was called off and the Minister is not going until June I hope he will bear some of these things in mind when he goes. Many ex-service organisations are extremely worried, as are the veterans themselves, about the long range effects, particularly on the children of the veterans who are involved. Graham Scarce has two young children, both of whom suffer from some reasonably serious disability. What I am saying applies to others. I quote from a recent article in the Telegraph about Barry Kelly and his wife Sue. Barry is also a Vietnam veteran. I will not incorporate the whole of the article but I want to read three or four paragraphs. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of his jobs in the mid-sixties was to spray the jungle around the camp with a backpack filled with chemicals. </PARA>
<PARA> 'We were told it was to kill mosquitoes and the undergrowth to give us a clear field of fire', he said. </PARA>
<PARA> 'The choppers had 44-gallon drums inside them. A big spraying arm came out and they sprayed all over the jungle and the camp site.'</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Kelly said the spray left a white sticky substance on the jungle foliage. </PARA>
<PARA> He said Australian soldiers sprayed with back-packs wearing only shorts, socks and boots and a hat. </PARA>
<PARA>That is similar to the experience of Graham Scarce. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> 'It was some sort of insecticide in unmarked drums,' he said. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Kelly is now convinced the herbicide used was Agent Orange. </PARA>
<PARA> Agent Orange a cocktail of the herbicides 2,4-D and 2,4,5-T, was widely used in the Vietnam war to deprive the Viet Cong of cover and food. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Kelly also suffers from aggression, anxiety, severe headaches and a blistery skin rash. </PARA>
<PARA> He is not the only member of the family affected-the children, Jodie, 12, Jarren, 10, Sharyn, 9, and Daniel, 4 all suffered birth defects. </PARA>
<PARA>That is another case which has been publicised. Ex-service organisations generally, probably excluding the Returned Services League of Australia, which did not take much notice of this from the start-I will have more to say about that later-are concerned. The Legion of Ex-Service Men and Women at a national conference carried a number of complementary resolutions. The Legion's journal states:</PARA>
<PARA> Vietnam Veterans and other ex-service personnel should be interested to learn that the Australian Legion is trying to assist with your claims on the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> We are in no position to judge who is right and who is wrong but will continue to urge the Government to carry out immediate and urgent enquiries into the effects of chemicals and radiation. </PARA>
<PARA> The following motions were forwarded to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, from the Legion National Council, in November 1980. Acknowledgement was received in December but to date-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, two or three weeks ago--</PARA>
<PARA>no official reply has been received. </PARA>
<PARA>I was present at that conference. The resolutions were carried unanimously. They read:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. 'That while accepting the long-term usefulness of the epidemiological enquiry into the effects of Agent Orange and other chemicals, Congress urges the Federal Government to initiate an immedate public enquiry into the effects of the Agent Orange programme and other chemicals; that such enquiry have wide ranging terms of reference. </PARA>
<PARA> Congress, therefore, urges the Government to establish a Judicial Enquiry, a Royal Commission or a Senate Select Committee. Those concerned can then publicly place their submissions before such an Enquiry and from this should flow acceptable guidelines for the processing of Agent Orange and other chemical warfare disability claims.'</PARA>
<PARA> 2. 'That until such time as the Government commences and completes its enquiry into the effects of Agent Orange and other chemicals, or Radiation, on veterans, where a medical practitioner considers they are affected by chemicals or radiation they be granted exgratia payments equal to Repatriation benefits.'</PARA>
<PARA> 3. 'That until the investigations into the chemicals 245T and 24D are completed the import and manufacture of these chemicals be totally suspended.'</PARA>
<PARA> 4. 'This Congress requests the Government to establish an immediate survey into the effects on veterans of radiation, irrespective of locality in which veterans served.'</PARA>
<PARA>That was a series of complementary resolutions. As no reply had been received the resolutions were adopted at the congress of the same organisation in Melbourne a couple of weeks ago. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately when the effects of agent orange became apparent a considerable time ago the predecessor of the present Minister for Veterans' Affairs decided to set up a committee of inquiry-a committee without teeth, incidentally -but it took many months for it to be established. So for all practical purposes the Department is totally ignoring the effects of agent orange on veterans. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs is retiring from the chamber. Obviously he does not intend to listen to the rest of my story about the problems in his Department. This is not uncommon in the Department, many areas of which are in a state of disarray. I am not blaming the employees of the Department. The problems are caused by Government policies and by the inability of the current Minister to grapple with a very difficult portfolio in a difficult situation. I remind him that on 9 April 1981 I put question No. 648 on the Notice Paper. It remains unanswered. I now wish to refer to those parts of the Repatriation Act which cause veterans a great deal of distress and which neither the Minister nor the senior officials of the Department of Veterans' Affairs seem to be able to cope with. In question on notice No. 648, I asked:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Is any action proposed to amend s. 107VL of the Repatriation Act. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) Does the annual report of the Repatriation Review Tribunal (1979-80) state that the Tribunal conducted 5,165 hearings and completed 3,775 applications during the year 1979-80. </PARA>
<PARA>That information was included in the report. I asked further:</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Were 972 applications (630 entitlements and 342 assessments) referred back to the Commission under section 107VL (2) of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> (4) Do delays of up to 12 months occur with many of the referrals; if so, what action is it proposed to take to rectify this state of affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>A rumour is now current in government circles that an amendment which is long overdue will be made to the Repatriation Act. The transfer of Repatriation Review Tribunal cases back to the Repatriation Commission constitutes a very big blockage in the pipeline in getting cases treated. It ought not to have--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Messner" NAMEID="9I4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SG7">Senator KEEFFE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will re-examine it. I will accept the Minister's challenge. Many hundreds of cases which have experienced inordinate delays are still in the pipeline. The situation is even worse because for some reason or other Service pensions have become extremely difficult to come by because of delays. Delays of anything up to three or four months can occur before some cases are handled by the Department. I should like to give an example of an ex-serviceman who wants to retire at age 60 or an ex-servicewoman who wants to retire at age 55. They usually want to program their lives so that by the time they leave their regular employment their application for the Service pension has already been made and they are in a position to receive the Service pension immediately. The situation is even worse of course, if the case involves a burnt-out digger who has qualified for pension through illness or other war-caused disabilities at an earlier age, particularly if that person still has dependent children going to school.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the Department of Veterans' Affairs has a serious staff ceiling problem similar to that experienced by the Department of Social Security then something should be done. Those two Departments ought not to be forced to make their clients suffer because of their inability to obtain sufficient staff. A lot of criticism was made of Mr Lanigan when he was the head of the Department of Social Security. In spite of the problems the Opposition had with him as the permanent head of the Department of Social Security-he was very close to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and was able to keep the then Minister for Social Security under his thumb-since he has left the Department the situation has deteriorated. Now that the new permanent head has taken over the Department of Social Security I hope that sufficient staff will be provided for the various regional offices as well as the State offices and that we will overcome the problems experienced in the Department of Social Security. Perhaps Mr Lanigan was thinking of that the other day when he landed at Coolangatta airport in a Canberra Aero Club plane, and ran into two other aeroplanes. </PARA>
<PARA> The other rumour circulating in the Department, of course, is that Sir Richard Kingsland who has always been approachable-I have found him quite approachable when I have been dealing with difficult cases-will retire possibly in September or October this year. The rumour is that his place will be taken by Sir William Keys, the National President of the Returned Services League of Australia. If an appointment to this position is to be made from outside the Public Service I do no think it will be welcomed by many of the returned Services people, particularly those who are disabled. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) who is in charge of business in the Senate at the moment can laugh his head off but that rumour is current not only in the Department of Veterans' Affairs but also in a number of other departments. This probably accounts for some of the very pro-establishment statements that Sir William Keys has been making over the last few weeks. It certainly clears the decks. I hope that such an appointment has only been thought about and that nothing will be done about it. The only way to clear the air, of course, is for the Goverment to make a full statement on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The other problem on which I want to touch briefly is concerned with radiation. All government departments have backed away from trying to find any proof of or any cure for radiation-caused illnesses. In a recent newspaper story Mr Pat Creevey who represents the Australian Nuclear Veterans Association-he is an authority on the subject-was reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> New information shows cancer deaths in 1975 among veterans of British nuclear bomb tests in Australia during the 1950s and early 1960s, were apparently more than four times higher than in the overall population. </PARA>
<PARA>From evidence that is given to the Labor Party from time to time I believe that is probably a very conservative increase because some figures indicate that it is even higher than that. I have asked questions of the former Minister for Social Security as the Minister representing the Minister for Health. I have been told that no surveys have been carried out, that the Government in fact knows nothing about it, that it does not intend to do anything about it, that it proposes to let the status quo remain. As a result of the incidents that took place in this city on Anzac Day I received a telegram in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA> Why can RSL hierarchy get traffic law changed for Anzac Day when they cannot get the present regime to honour existing laws on veterans. </PARA>
<PARA>That was signed by Graham Bell, Queensland President of the Vietnam Veterans' Association. That sums up the situation. I am still waiting for the Minister for Veterans' Affairs to defend his Labor parliamentary colleague in another place, Mr Ken Fry. If one looks at the Parliamentary Handbook of the Commonwealth of Australia one can examine the record of the Minister and that of the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Fry). Perhaps the Minister is unable to handle his portfolio because he did not join the boy scouts. I cannot see from his record that he joined the boy scouts at any stage. He was old enough to have gone to Vietnam but, judging by the executive positions he has has held in the Liberal Party, he apparently belonged to the cheer squad-cheer them as they leave and hope they do not come back; or cheer them when they come back, if they come back at all. He did have something to do in his private life because he was the Secretary of the South Australian Road Transport Association (South East Division), Inaugural Secretary of the South Australian Bulk Fertilisers Spreaders' Association, and the South East Log Hauliers' Association. I suppose that helps him to know something about the transport incidents in which some of the people in Vietnam were injured. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, we find that Ken Fry served with the Australian Imperial Force from 1939 to 1945 and served overseas in New Guinea, Borneo and South East Asia as a member of an infantry batallion. Obviously when Mr Fry speaks he does so from a background of wide experience. I was very disappointed at the letter I received from Sir William Keys addressed to me and dated 1 May 1981. I should like to refer to some of the passages which are quite insulting. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> You will be aware of problems that have developed over Anzac Day arising out of the efforts of a group of women calling themselves 'Wimmin Against Rape'. This group both last year and this year have attempted to participate in the Anzac Day march and wreath laying ceremony. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know that there is anything strange about that because I have seen members of bowling clubs, golf clubs, boy scout associations, girl guides and schools all tag onto Anzac Day march. Some of them, of course, have never seen a shot fired in anger. Certainly the little ones have never seen a shot fired in anger and I hope that they never will. They have been encouraged to participate in these sorts of demonstrations by senior officials of the RSL. I do not condemn the RSL as an organisation; I condemn some of the people who have achieved top ranking status in the RSL and who are very much the hawkish type, who are part of the establishment and who are anti-working class. They use this status, usually at the State level, to obtain a knighthood. One seldom sees them obtaining any Australian order-even an Australian knighthood, for those who still believe in knighthoods. The letter goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> You are also aware that the Minister for the Capital Territory, Mr Michael Hodgman, has caused the Traffic Ordinance to be amended to provide for it to be an offence for a person to disturb or disrupt the Anzac Day Parade or the ceremony conducted at the Australian War Memorial. In addition, the amending Ordinance now provides for it to be an offence for persons to act in a manner likely to disturb or disrupt such parade or ceremony or engage in conduct offensive or insulting or likely to give offence or cause insult to such persons taking part in such a parade or ceremony. </PARA>
<PARA>I think the organisation known as Wimmin Against Rape is quite a legitimate organisation. It is entitled to demonstrate peacefully. I understand that that was all its members wanted to do. Had they been allowed to do that, the chances are there would have been no problems at all at the Anzac Day ceremony. A well-known Anglican churchman in this city has suggested that there should be a way around the problem and that there ought to be representations by any democratic organisation entitled to participate in this sort of ceremony. In a further paragraph Sir William states:</PARA>
<PARA> It is an occasion on which the Nation remembers those who have died in war and pays an appropriate tribute. That tribute itself in the march, the service, and the laying of wreaths is the clearest expression of the cost and the ugliness of war. In this way, the Anzac ceremonies are a most moving and effective appeal for peace. </PARA>
<PARA>By not allowing constituent bodies or bodies that have a right to show publicly their dislike of war and of the things that happen in war the RSL, which controls Anzac ceremonies in some areas of the country-not in many areas-allows the hawks associated with the hierarchy to display a total ignorance of democracy. In fact it even tried to suppress democracy in this city by getting the Minister-the Minister is very much to blame too-quietly to put in an ordinance providing this sort of effect on the local scene. On the next page Sir William stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The group of women to which I have referred were this year organised by the 'Canberra Anzac Day March Collective' and the League believes that they have certain political objectives. </PARA>
<PARA>How would anybody know whether they have certain political objectives? I suppose the League would say it is non-political. The great majority of sub-branches are non-political. People from all walks of life and from all political parties who have the qualifications join the RSL. But there are some areas-Canberra is apparently one-where democracy does not apply inside the RSL. Sir William Keys, by writing this type of letter and by publicly doing similar things, obviously indicates that he is one of the establishment people. He further states:</PARA>
<PARA> Prior to Anzac Day this year, this group had organised workshops on April 3,5,12, 18-20 inclusive, and on the 22. </PARA>
<PARA>How would Sir William Keys know this was done unless he had inside knowledge-probably from members of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation or one of the other security intelligence organisations-about where they met and what they did? It would appear that he had a plant somewhere in the organisation who was able to assist either him or the police. The latter part of the letter-it is fairly lengthy-states:</PARA>
<PARA> There has been a great deal of publicity in all forms of the media that the amending Ordinance has infringed the rights of individuals. </PARA>
<PARA>I understand that this ordinance will be talked about in this place at another time. I do not want to go into all the details and start putting up an argument, but I stress that this ordinance was brought in in circumstances which are less than satisfactory. It gave Sir William Keys the opportunity to come out with a very tough letter such as that, which I think is less than democratic. It is an insult to people who belong to the Returned Services League. Mr Fry took up the cudgels on behalf of the women involved. In one of his Press statements he said that he was quite ashamed about what happened at the local level. At that time he felt ashamed to be a member of the RSL. Then the RSL got highly excited and took out resolutions suggesting that Ken Fry ought to be expelled from the RSL. That is another negation of democracy and of the so-called objectives of the Returned Services League. </PARA>
<PARA> I also took out membership in the RSL. The last time I saw anything like this happen was in the 1940s when a McCarthy-like witch hunt went on inside the RSL, allegedly to make communists leave the organisation. There were, of course, in World War II communists who were killed in action. Two of them were members of my battalion. Both did not come back; they were killed in action. Apparently, it is all right to be a member of the Australian Services, to belong to a political organisation which most of us do not support and to be killed in action. But some people would not do anything for such people if they returned, whether or not they were maimed, nor would they let them join an ex-services club to help their own comrades. At that time I was a delegate to the south-eastern district of the Returned Services League, or the Returned Soldiers', Sailors' and Airmen's Imperial League of Australia, as it was in those days. My credentials were questioned because I was a militant unionist and a member of the Labor Party. A Macarthy-like smear campaign went on inside the RSL at that time. If Sir William Keys had been around no doubt he would have been one of the commanders of that smear force. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He was in charge at the time. He was one of the hawks. In fact it was only advancing age which caused him finally to be defeated. I was defended at the south-eastern district meeting by a member of the Liberal Party who gave an assurance to the assemblage that I certainly was not a member of the Communist Party and had never been a member. I was a member of my own political party which was opposed to his, he respected me for it and we had a good personal friendship. It was only because of his intervention that I was not expelled from the RSL at that time. Because it was an embarrassment to some of my more conservative friends who belonged to the Country Party, I think it was called then, and the Liberal Party-in the early days of the Liberal Party-I decided to resign from the RSL. I remained outside it for about three years until the McCarthyists had run out of hot air. Then I rejoined and had continuous membership from 1946 to 1949. I have had continuous membership from 1951 to 1981, this year. I am a financial member of two sub-branches. I am a member of the incapacitated sub-branch. One needs to be more than 50 per cent incapacitated to become eligible for membership of that branch. I am also a financial member of my local sub-branch. I have a good relationship with everybody in the two sub-branches, regardless of our political outlooks on anything. It angers me that this sort of thing should happen in the bush capital. The problem that Ken Fry encountered was taken up very well by a local resident who wrote to Sir William Keys defending Ken Fry. He stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My father, now 89, believed that he fought in World War I for democracy. The inscription on one of his medals suggests that the ''Great War'' was for maintaining and defending civilization. </PARA>
<PARA> I was in the US Army from 1949 to 1952, during the Korean war. I also believed that we were in that war to condemn totalitarianism and to defend democracy. </PARA>
<PARA> I am now an Australian citizen. I believe that civil rights of citizens are of paramount importance in our democracy. I am not on the ''left''. I handed out 'how-to-vote' cards on behalf of the Liberal party at the last election. </PARA>
<PARA>There is a man, a local resident, who belongs to a conservative organisation who also is highly disturbed at what he saw. He went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> But I am very upset at the actions of the RSL in trying to reserve for itself the right to make a public witness on Anzac Day. That is a day for all of us to give our testimony to the horrors of war, as we remember the dead. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend to you the editorial in the Canberra Times on Saturday last. </PARA>
<PARA>That was a very good editorial which I do not propose to incorporate in Hansard. I suppose everyone has read it. He went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> I am particularly distressed that the RSL should see fit to criticize Mr Ken Fry the Member for Fraser, in whose electorate I happen to be, for his honest, sincere and democratic statements. I do not support his party, but I respect him as a man and as a citizen. He does well by the members of his electorate. He is right to support the freedom of our fellow-citizens, including women, to participate in Anzac Day activities, in ways they find appropriate. Your organisation owes him, and the members of his electorate, an unreserved apology. He continues to fight for our freedom of speech, of public assembly, of dissent from majority opinions. </PARA>
<PARA>Is not that what democracy is supposed to be all about? Are not we supposed to demonstrate, to participate and to indicate how we feel about things, even though we may be in the minority? The writer adds:</PARA>
<PARA> Because of my job in education, I am well aware of the feelings aroused amongs most young people (and they are very fine young people) as a result of RSL actions vis-a-vis the Anzac Day march. At the conclusion of a Sunday service on 26 April our young people expressed their shock to think that police had arrested many women for following their consciences. Those arrested included a few students, and at least one member of the religious denomination to which I belong, the Society of Friends. They are not 'militant lesbian Marxists' . . . </PARA>
<PARA> That label was put on them by a Federal politician who is a member of the Liberal Party. He ought to be ashamed of the expression that he used. The writer continues:</PARA>
<PARA> I can assure you that any attempt to victimise these freedom-seeking and freedom-loving citizens will be counter-productive to your organisation, which is, surely, in need of good not adverse opinion in the community at large. </PARA>
<PARA>The writer concludes:</PARA>
<PARA> Might I urge the RSL to recognise that civilians also suffer and die in wars.</PARA>
<PARA>The writer has signed his name to it and has told Mr Fry that it can be used publicly. The letter is there for anyone who wants to read it. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, there are a number of things that this Government has failed to do and continues to fail to do. It looks as if the future will be equally bleak. Agent orange victims are not being properly dealt with. The onus must fall on the shoulders of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) who, apart from saying that it is an STD problem, or a psychological problem, will not do the right thing by them. He has dismissed their complaints publicly in that way. It was a scandalous and disgraceful statement to make in fobbing off the matter. No attempt has been made by the Government-again it comes back to the responsibility of the Minister-to see that a proper survey is carried out to ascertain how many people in the community are suffering from radiation as the result of the explosion of bombs which took place under the protection of previous Liberal Party governments. </PARA>
<PARA> The pension situation is also bad. There are inordinate delays in the payment of service pensions. I accept the Minister's assurance that recent amendments will remove the problem. I am not sure that they will, but I hope that they do. On the other side of the coin, I am not suggesting that anybody should resign from the RSL. I would like to see everybody join it and take control away from the hawks, who have turned into a vehicle for political propaganda in several areas, though not largely at the sub-branch level. I would hope that as a result of open discussion such as this improvements and corrections will be made. I am reminded of what was said by the Premier who was present in Parliament House last night. He came to take home the bank but went home with the petty cash. When Indonesia invaded East Timor he sent a telegram of congratulations to Indonesia. That is the sort of hawk in the community that every one of us must fight. I am sure that the small 'l' liberals on the other side of the chamber would agree with those sentiments. I hope that the points which I have raised will be taken seriously by the Minister and that he will not continue to treat the effects of agent orange as a joke, as he did earlier this year. </PARA>

He sought to make the point that I had claimed that some of the problems suffered by Vietnam veterans were attributable to causes other than agent orange. I am not saying that at all. My various public statements on the matter have always been based on the fact that there are many reasons why people may have problems as a result of the Vietnam war and that they need not be due exclusively to exposure to a herbicide.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the last week or so Federal-State relations seem to have been in fashion. Now that we have finished hearing the synthetic indignation of the Opposition it would be a good idea if we got down to real problems. There are not many political federations in the modern world-probably not more than a dozen, however loosely one might define them. Although federations have unique advantages-any other solution for Australia is inconceivable at this time and for the foreseeable future-they also have enormous difficulties. That is why, of course, not many nations have dared to try federation as a political solution. These difficulties are well known. They may be summed up as disputes over the division of powers and disputes over the division of tax revenue. We are about to become involved again in this dispute over the division of tax revenue because of the imminent renegotiation of the income tax-sharing formula. We may or may not have finished deciding the total amount to be distributed to the States. What we certainly have not yet decided is the actual relative distribution between the States. It is for this reason that I bring the matter to the attention of the Senate and because, as I shall show, my own State of Victoria is badly disadvantaged by the present formula.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I do that we should count our blessings as well as our problems. Compared with most other federations, we have a very homogeneous population-compared to India with its religious divisions, to Canada with its Quebec problem or to the United States with its negro minority-compared with those countries we are extraordinarily lucky. Our second great advantage is that we have no badly depressed States or regions. Looked at in terms of income per capita, Victoria is the richest State. If we give Victoria's per capita income a base figure of 100, then that of New South Wales is almost identical on 99.8, followed by South Australia on 97.5, Queensland on 93.6, Western Australia on 91.9 and Tasmania on 90. </PARA>
<PARA> It is perhaps worth noting that the spread between the richest and the poorest States has reduced sharply in the last 20 years although the order of States in regard to per capita income has changed little. Twenty years ago Western Australia was at the bottom of the table and Tasmania was next. Now those States have changed places. Although the order of States has changed little, the important thing is that the range between the richest and the poorest has dropped from 16 per cent in the late 1950s to 10 per cent now. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table showing these facts. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must emphasise that by world standards the 10 per cent range between the richest and the poorest states is very low. In Canada, for instance, the range is 40 per cent between the richest and the poorest states and in the United States it is 50 per cent. Although the average per capita income is remarkably consistent throughout the Australian Federation, there are sharp differences between the dominant types of economic activity in the various States. New South Wales and Victoria are important manufacturing as well as primary producing States. Western Australia has the highest value of production per capita of cereal grains, wool, sheep and fishing. Queensland records the highest production per capita of food, beverages and tobacco. South Australia and Victoria lead in per capita production of motor cars. Tasmania leads in paper and paper products. All States, including the Northern Territory, have very large mineral and energy resources. Victoria, South Australia and Western Australia have petroleum or natural gas. New South Wales, Queensland and Victoria have coal. Tasmania has hydro-electric power. Queensland and the Northern Territory have uranium. New South Wales and Queensland have lead, zinc and copper. South Australia and Western Australia have iron ore. Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory have bauxite. All States have some other minerals as well. It also needs to be recognised that the mineral and energy resources of Queensland and Western Australia are very large by world standards and that the present rate of economic and population growth in those two States is higher than those of the other four States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Although the differences in per capita incomes between the States are at present relatively small, there are significant differences in the capacities of the various States to provide comparable government services without imposing unreasonable taxes or burdens on their citizens. The factors which contribute to those differences between the States are numerous. There is a difference in the capacity to raise taxation. There is a difference in natural resource revenues. There is a considerable disparity in population in each State. There are differences in the age structure of the population of each State. There are differences in the dispersion or density of population. There is disparity in the physical size of each State. There are differences in the physical and economic environments. It follows that if the capacity of State governments to provide services and the tax burdens imposed on State residents are to be roughly equal, some differential payment must be made to State governments by the Federal Government. The concept of differential payments is not in dispute-certainly not in Victoria. It is the amount of the difference that is the issue. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Constitution made provision for three kinds of fiscal transfers from the Commonwealth Government to the States. First, there was a tax sharing arrangement whereby the Federal Government transferred to each State at least three-quarters of the net customs and excise revenues derived from consumption in that State for a minimum period of 10 years after Federation. That has now lapsed. Secondly, after a transition period the Commonwealth Government was required to transfer all its so-called surplus revenue to the States on such terms and conditions as this Parliament thought fair. The Commonwealth very understandably has never had any surplus revenue, so that has effectively lapsed too. Thirdly-this is the key provision-by section 96 of the Constitution the Commonwealth Government can grant financial assistance to any State on such terms and conditions as this Parliament thinks fit. That power has been widely used far beyond anything dreamed of by the authors of the Constitution. It has enabled the Commonwealth to interfere in many matters-for example, education-which by the Constitution are exclusively a State preserve.</PARA>
<PARA> In the early years of Federation equalisation grants were made to the various State governments under section 96, but those were so blatantly pork-barrelling exercises and the whole procedure was so unscientific that in 1933 the Commonwealth Grants Commission, as it is now called, was instituted as a semi-judicial body, independent of Parliament and political influence, to consider applications from the States for grants of financial assistance under section 96. Initially the task of the Grants Commission was to consider claims from South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania for special grants and to formulate criteria for the assessment of the amounts. On such criteria the Grants Commission in 1936 said that special grants should be determined by the amount of help found necessary to make it possible for a State, by reasonable efforts, to function at a standard not appreciably below that of other States. Very little has changed to alter that attitude over the years. Section 5 of the Grants Commission Act 1973 defines a grant of special assistance to the States in almost identical words. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the task of the Grants Commission was soon complicated by a radical change in the taxing power of the States. At the time of Federation income tax was a preserve of the States. The Federal Government levied no income tax. In fact the first Federal Budget for a full year was for $21m, of which just under 80 per cent came from customs revenue. The pressures of World War I forced the Commonwealth Government into the income tax field as a temporary war time measure but, like nearly all temporary measures, it became permanent and until 1942 Australians paid two income taxes, one State and one Federal, with separate tax forms and collection systems. That became unworkable during World War II, when some people would have been paying more than 20 shillings in the pound. So in 1942 the Curtin Labor Government imposed uniform income tax. It was in fact a rather neat manoeuvre for a Labor Government. First, it declared that all Federal income tax had to be paid by an individual before any State income tax was paid. Then under war powers it requisitioned the State income tax offices and records and called up their officials. Then it imposed a very high rate of income tax which left no room for a State income tax. Finally, it offered the States reimbursement, as a section 96 grant, of the amounts they had been collecting previously, provided they stayed out of the income tax field. The States did not like it, but with no tax records or staff they had little choice but to accept. </PARA>
<PARA> That is substantially the situation today, although the amount of tax reimbursements has varied and a 1957 High Court decision held that the States could levy income tax if they wanted to. Perhaps they could-but how? To set up a separate tax collection system would be political suicide. Even when the present Government, under its new federalism policy, offered to collect State income taxes for the States, there was still a catch-22. If a State allowed an income tax rebate to its residents so that they paid less tax and the State received less revenue, obviously that State's entitlement under the tax reimbursement formula would be looked at very critically by the Grants Commission, since it would obviously be too well off vis-a-vis the other States. If a State were brave enough to put a surcharge on its citizens, although that would be a strong argument for an increase in its tax reimbursement share, it is most unlikely that the government concerned would be around to receive it. For those reasons the power of the State governments to legislate for tax rebates or surcharges has never been used, nor is it ever likely to be used. </PARA>
<PARA> The key to all this is the tax reimbursement formula. Initially, of course, it just gave the States back what they had been collecting themselves. In 1946 a new formula was introduced which increased tax reimbursements to the States each year on the basis of current population and average wages. Then over the decade to 1958 the criterion was gradually modified to a so-called 'adjusted population' basis which took account of population density and the number of school age children. This was a reasonably fair system-at least in the circumstances of the time-but over the following years it became seriously distorted by events such as the incorporation in the formula of special grants given to South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania; special grants to Queensland; and the effects of the takeover of the South Australian and Tasmanian railways and of the transfers of payroll tax and tertiary education. All those events resulted in the relativities between States being seriously distorted by the mid-1970s. </PARA>
<PARA> The present situation is recorded in a series of 'Points of Understanding' adopted by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the State Premiers in June 1976. These points set out the basic elements of the personal income tax sharing scheme when it commenced operation at the beginning of the 1976-77 financial year. The scheme was to be related to personal income tax and not to company tax or any withholding taxes on interests and dividends. The States were to be given a guaranteed percentage of personal income tax. This figure was to be made certain by being incorporated in a Commonwealth Act. The percentage figure was initially 33.6 per cent of the estimated income tax of the current financial year, but by a 1978 amendment of the States (Personal Income Tax Sharing) Act it became 39.87 per cent of the preceding year's income tax take. </PARA>
<PARA> As announced last Monday week, this year it is proposed to reduce the figure to 38.32 per cent of last year's income tax take, but this will require an amendment of the Act. Of course, it is up to the Parliament to decide whether it passes the amendment. It has been suggested-this too will require an amendment of the Act-that it should in future be about 20 per cent of the total Federal revenue rather than about 40 per cent of income tax revenue. This will probably be to the disadvantage of the States for, with the dropping of automatic indexation, income tax collection is likely to rise faster than the rest of Federal revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> Be that as it may, the total tax reimbursement entitlement for all States under this system is first determined, as was done last Monday week, and then comes the division between the States, as will be done later this year. The breakdown of the amounts between States, which appeared in last week's newspapers, is all speculation based on the existing formula. I do not think the States which get the most controversially good deal at the moment-Queensland and Western Australia-should spend their money yet. Victoria and New South Wales should not give up hope. </PARA>
<PARA> In the scheme adopted in 1976 the initial per capita relativities between the States were to be the same as those in the preceding year. Subject to certain conditions and to any absorption of specific purpose payments, these relativities were to be carried forward into subsequent years so as to maintain the proportionate relationships between the per capita entitlements of the States. The four less populous States were to continue to be entitled to apply to the Commonwealth Grants Commission for additional grants. Most important of all, there was to be a periodic review of the relativities between States. Advice for this review was to be sought from an independent body and the first review was to be made by 30 June this year. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1977 it was agreed that the review should be undertaken by a special division of the Commonwealth Grants Commission consisting of six members. One of those was appointed on the joint nomination of Victoria and New South Wales. Two others were nominated by the remaining four States. Of course, three were nominated by the Commonwealth. The principle to be followed was that the payments to the States should enable each State to provide, without imposing taxes and charges at levels significantly different from the levels of the taxes and charges imposed by other States, government services at standards not appreciably different from the standards of the government services provided by the other States. </PARA>
<PARA> In the course of the review the special division was charged to take account of the different capacities of the States to raise revenue; the differences in the amounts required to be expended by the States in providing comparable government services; and to examine the matters that influence the determination of State factors and any event that has occurred since those State factors were determined that, in the opinion of the special division, affect the appropriateness of the continued application of those factors. The terms of these guidelines are of crucial importance, as are also the matters upon which the guidelines are silent. There was no mention, for instance, of the different budgetary practices and accounting procedures between the States. There was no direct reference to the difference from State to State in capital and recurrent expenditures. There was no mention of the role of loan finance in provision of government services by each State. There was no definition of the range of government services that were to be reviewed. A question that comes to mind on this last point is: Will the review be limited only to services which are financed from the State Budget. It is important to realise that this will be the first time that the relativities between States in tax reimbursements will have been looked at comprehensively. </PARA>
<PARA> If the special division of the Grants Commission does its job thoroughly-I am sure it will-there will, of course, no longer be a need for any of the States to apply to the Grants Commission for additional money because the relative disadvantages will have been eliminated by variations in the rate of per capita tax reimbursements. In a little more than a month we will know the answers to all our queries as to how the Grants Commission deals with this most complex problem. Nothing we say in this chamber will, I am sure, alter the conclusions of the Grants Commission. I am equally sure that these conclusions will go at least some way to rectifying the financial injustice suffered by Victoria in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> Because some honourable senators do not seem to comprehend the nature and extent of these injustices and because some have brought in totally irrelevant issues, such as protection, I think it is necessary to explain the problem in some detail. I will explain in some detail in a few minutes the reason protection is totally irrelevant to this issue. </PARA>

About 40 per cent of the total personal income tax collected by the Commonwealth Government has been returned to the States.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the 10-year period to 1957-58 the tax reimbursement share for each State was increasingly determined on an adjusted population basis so that in 1958-59 Victoria was receiving almost its population's share of the total grant; that is, 26.63 per cent of the total grant for a population that was 27.83 per cent of the Australian total. This slight drop below the population share arose because the adjusted population formula made special allowance for the number of school children in the population and for the area of the State.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, as I said, it was certainly relatively fair in the circumstance at the time. But since that period, Victoria's position has deteriorated progressively for three reasons. First, there was the incorporation of claimancy grants to Western Australia, South Australia and Tasmania in the tax reimbursement formula. Victoria's share fell dramatically in 1959-60 because that was the first year in which the special grants paid to those States in the previous year were included in the base for the purpose of calculating the distribution of funds. In later years, each of these States was 'bought out' of claimancy; and this involved a permanent addition of claimancy grants to tax reimbursement grants with a net result to Victoria's disadvantage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, there were special additions to other States' grants. South Australia and Tasmania had their railway systems taken over by the Commonwealth with little offsetting adjustment of tax reimbursement grants. In this way, South Australia gained $25m and Tasmania gained $3.3m relative to other States. During the period 1965-75, Queensland had its grants unilaterally increased by $2m a year giving a total permanent addition relative to other States of $20m. New South Wales and Victoria did receive special additions for a limited period but these have now lapsed. Thirdly, there were the effects of the transfers of payroll tax and tertiary education. Victoria has a relatively more highly developed tertiary education system and a relatively greater taxable capacity for payroll tax than most other States. When transfers of responsibilities were made in both those areas, the method of calculation of the accompanying offsets disadvantaged Victoria and New South Wales in relation to the smaller States. </PARA>
<PARA> The consequence of these three factors has been that Victoria now receives a significantly lower share of the financial assistance. It has 27.27 per cent of the population-almost identical to what it was in 1958-but receives only 22.65 per cent of the financial assistance grants. This is a drop of almost 4 percentage points since 1958, and that represents a lot of money-about $200m a year. The arguments for Victoria receiving such a low proportion of income tax funds can only be that Victoria has a significantly higher State taxing capacity than other States or that the cost of providing equivalent services is significantly less in Victoria than in other States, or both. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the potential revenue side first. The significant tax sources likely to vary much per capita from State to State are payroll tax and revenue from mining. Payroll tax is levied by all States at 5 per cent. The revenue ranges from New South Wales with the highest in 1979-80 at $121 per capita to Queensland with the lowest at $83 per capita. Victoria is second higest at $112 and Western Australia is third at $103. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table setting out the payroll tax receipt figures for 1979-80. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators will observe that Victoria and Western Australia are not very different in payroll tax revenue per capita, and that Victoria's margin over Queensland-$27 per capita-is, as I shall show in a moment, substantially less than the extra rail levy the Queensland Government extracts from the mining industry. Incidentally, payroll tax is the only significant area where protection affects State government revenue. The value to the Victorian Government of the payroll tax on industries which would not exist-anyway not in their present form-without protection is roughly $12 per capita per year. I repeat: It is $12 per capita per year, when Victoria receives $70 per capita less than the national average in income tax reimbursement. Of course, all other State governments themselves get some payroll tax revenue from protected industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I hope this puts in perspective some of the nonsense that has been talked about protection in this chamber. Protection is decided on a national basis in the interests of the national economy. None of it goes directly to State governments. I have mentioned the only significant benefit that comes indirectly to State government revenue. I happen to think on economic grounds that tariffs are far too high and that Victorians, far from being advantaged by tariffs, are seriously harmed by them. For tariffs keep key resources in capital and skilled labour locked up in inefficient industries, whereas if tariffs were reduced and the resources released, the magnificent infrastructure of Victoria-a central position, cheap power, good roads, rail and sea communications, a skilled labour force and a sophisticated financial structure-would result in Victoria being much wealthier. If the dead hand of excessive tariffs imposed by the Federal Government in what is thought to be the national interest could be removed, Victoria would benefit enormously. But that is a different issue. What we are talking about is the revenue of the State governments and payroll tax is the only significant way in which protected industries help State government revenue. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4H4">Senator HAMER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, indirectly to other States. Of course, there are other ways of raising taxation from miners. The Queensland Government has an ingenious method. Rail freight charges for mining projects in Queensland are not set according to a fixed scale but are negotiated separately for each project. The rate consists of three components-capital costs, operating costs and the profit to the State. The rail infrastructure for each project is in effect paid for by the mining company and given to the State Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> How does the system work? Under a system developed by the Queensland Treasury in the late 1960s called the 'security deposit' system, the mining company lends the Government the money required to build the rail facilities. The loan is later repaid at the same time and at the same rate as the company pays the Government an additional capital component in the freight rate. The net effect is that the company pays for the construction of the Government's railway. The operating cost component is calculated by the Railways Department in Queensland on a rate per tonne per kilometre. The profit to the State, which is known in the industry as the 'excess rail freight', is calculated by the Queensland Treasury as a flat rate per tonne but in the individual freight rate negotiations the capital component is determined by the infrastructure requirements of the project concerned. Negotiations focus on the operating cost-profit figure but the Queensland Treasury keeps the operating cost, and hence its profit, a closely guarded secret. </PARA>
<PARA> Although the exact profit from the freight charged on any project is not known, even by the owner of the project, the 1980 Queensland Budget Papers show that overall rail freights are more profitable to the State Government than mineral royalties. In 1979-80 the Queensland Government raked in $78m in royalties and $108m in excess rail freights from the mining industry. These figures, I am glad to say, are the subject of constant scrutiny by the Commonwealth Grants Commission which has in recent years added a high percentage-80 per cent in 1978-79-of the excess rail freight revenue to the mineral royalty figures for Queensland to make that figure fair in the comparative overall State table. In looking at these two items-payroll tax and mining royalties-and recognising that the other potential areas of State revenue do not vary significantly from State to State, one can see that Victoria is not particularly well off in its revenue raising capacity and is certainly not as well off as Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> If Victoria is to receive a lower per capita reimbursement of income tax revenue, the only justification must be that it is cheaper to provide services in Victoria than it is to provide equivalent services in other States. But is this true? In 1979-80 Victoria spent 33 per cent of its Budget on education, 12 per cent on hospitals and health, 11 per cent on railways, 9 per cent on debt charges, 5 per cent on police and 3 per cent on welfare. Roads funding, incidentally, is outside all State Budgets. It is provided for in part by Commonwealth grants for roads, which are heavily biased in favour of the less populous States. In addition to the Commonwealth grant, Victoria in 1979-80 spent a further $118m on roads, outside the Budget, from the proceeds of motor taxes and petrol licence fees. All States make similar road provisions outside their Budgets. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at each of the other principal Budget items to see which are more expensive in larger, more dispersed States compared with a smaller State such as Victoria with a very large urban population. I shall deal with education first. That takes nearly one-third of the Victorian Budget. According to the Schools Commission there is no significant difference between the costs of educating a child in the city and in the country. There are offsetting factors both ways and the end result is very much a line ball in each State. Three quite different factors influence the level of State government expenditure per capita on education. First, there is the ratio of school age population to the total population. Then there is the proportion of the school age population actually attending school. Finally, there is the ratio of enrolments in government schools to total school enrolments.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4H4">Senator HAMER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is not quite true, as the honourable senator will see if he examines the table later. I think the significant figure is the ratio of school age population to total population. Western Australia, after Tasmania, has the second highest ratio. How do the other States compare in these categories? New South Wales and Victoria have the lowest ratios of school age population to total population, but New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania have the highest proportions of their school age populations actually attending school. New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland have the highest proportions of school students in non-government schools and South Australia and Tasmania have the highest proportion of school students in government schools. Incidentally, the total number of school age children is decreasing in all States except New South Wales and Western Australia, where there has been a very small increase. I do not think any significant weighting of per capita tax reimbursements is warranted on the grounds of the costs of education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn to hospitals. On a comparative basis Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania have an above average number of public hospitals and government nursing home beds per thousand of population. New South Wales has about the average number but Victoria and South Australia have considerably less than the average. New South Wales and Western Australia have well above the average numbers of private hospital and nursing home beds for every thousand of population and Victoria is approximately 30 per cent below the average. </PARA>
<PARA> All these figures do not help us much. They show what the various States have, not what they need. There is no real evidence that hospital running costs are higher in the country than in the city or that particular States are healthier than others. The only obvious differential factor is the number of old people. Old people are the greatest consumers of health care resources and States with greater numbers of old people will inevitably be committed to greater health expenditure. Queensland has the highest number of old people in proportion to total population. It is followed by New South Wales, South Australia, Victoria, Tasmania, and Western Australia, which has the least number of old people in proportion to population. However, the range between the top and the bottom is only 1.61 percentage points, which would not justify a substantial discrimination between States and the order would most certainly not justify discrimination against Victoria and New South Wales in favour of Western Australia and Queensland. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it is not on the way they feel. Some honourable senators might be in that category but I do not think we should bias redistribution grants in favour of senators. We might do it for State Premiers. Until the recent decision on the Jamison report, Commonwealth contributions to hospitals-about half their running costs-were made as specific purpose grants. The trouble was that States with the most expensive and inefficient hospital systems-Victoria, according to the Jamison report, has a relatively efficient one-at the commencement of the cost sharing arrangement continued to receive proportionately more funds than States which had attempted to move with the times, to remove wasteful and inefficient services and facilities and to concentrate on providing appropriate services to the community they served. The Jamison commission report stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The cost sharing arrangements have rewarded the expensive and punished the efficient and have perpetuated rather than solved some of the main problems in Australia's health system. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth's contribution will in the future be added to general revenue grants to the States and the relativities will be determined by the Grants Commission. This decision is to be warmly welcomed for I am sure that the Commission will evolve a formula based on population, with perhaps some slight weighting for the proportion of old people. This will be fairer to all concerned, and will give a much better deal to Victoria than it gets at present, although for this year it will be operating under the old formula which seriously disadvantages both Queensland and Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> What, then, about railways, whose losses absorb 11 per cent of the Victorian State Budget? Broadly speaking, freight services can sometimes run at a profit; passenger services always run at a thumping loss. Because of the size of Melbourne and Sydney, Victoria and New South Wales are committed to running extensive suburban passenger services and have vast losses as an unavoidable consequence. With regard to freight, Queensland and Western Australia have the highest ratio of route kilometres to population. During the 1970s all States, except Queensland, experienced a decline in the density of goods and livestock traffic as measured by tonnes carried per route kilometre, and density is the key to rail freight profitability. Putting the two together, the problems of lengthy low-density freight routes and loss-making suburban rail networks, it is hard to see why one should subsidise the other. </PARA>
<PARA> Then there are police forces-in Victoria, for example, the police force takes 5 per cent of the State Budget. There is strong evidence that there is greater need for police in relation to population in urban centres than there is in the country. In Victoria it is assessed that in cities of 20,000 or larger there is a need for one policeman for every 350 people; in towns of between 6,000 and 20,000 the ratio is one to 530; and in communities of less than 6,000 it is one to 1,000. Although the cost of maintaining a policeman in a rural area is somewhat higher than it is in a capital city, the main cost of law enforcement is salaries. There is no possible reason why Victoria and New South Wales, with their enormous urban populations, should be disadvantaged in police finance in relation to States with dispersed populations. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government bears the main responsibility for welfare. The States have a supporting role. In Victoria 3 per cent of the Budget goes on welfare. In this welfare field, the main needs are the great urban areas, far more than in the rural areas. In the welfare field there should, if anything, be a bias in funding towards Victoria and New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> I have now been through all the major components of the State Budget. It is obvious that on the cost of providing equivalent services there is absolutely no justification for the heavy bias against Victoria in the income tax reimbursement scheme. There is one further issue with which I must deal. It has been claimed that, although Victoria fares badly on the tax reimbursement formula, it is adequately compensated by above average specific purpose grants and works and borrowing programs entitlements. These claims are false. Let us look at each of them in turn. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table showing the States' specific purpose payments and works and borrowing programs. </PARA>

It receives 25 per cent of the specific purpose payments and 27.3 per cent-that is, its exact population proportion-for works and borrowing programs. So Victoria just holds its own on works and borrowings, and drops even further behind with its specific purpose payments. So much for those two red herrings. Incidentally, in relation to the works and borrowings program, the only area where Victoria has its fair share, the States have full responsibility for meeting the interest and redemption costs on borrowed funds. Hence the 9 per cent of the State Budget which goes in debt charges.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I apologise to the Senate for the many financial details I have felt it necessary to use to support my argument. State relativities are a most complex subject and are, as was recognised nearly 50 years ago, quite inappropriate for the Parliament to determine. Nevertheless, it is important that the Senate, which was designed as a States' House, should understand the issues involved. Victoria is not asking for a special deal. It is asking only for justice. I have confidence that the Grants Commission will come up with a fair solution. It is up to us to see that its recommendations are speedily implemented. In the 48 years that the Grants Commission has been in existence, its recommendations have always been accepted and implemented by the Federal Government. So it must be with these recommendations, whether or not they go as far as Victorians would like. Of course we must recognise that if some States get a larger share, others will get a smaller one. With the levelling of per capita incomes and the greatly increased wealth of Queensland and Western Australia, it is inevitable that the loading of income tax reimbursements in their favour will be reduced. For a long time now the main financial burden has been borne by Victoria and New South Wales. In our changing economic environment, the relative status of South Australia and Tasmania has remained roughly unchanged. Queensland and Western Australia will have to shoulder a greater share of the burden. I hope that they will accept their new, more responsible status, with dignity and pride. </PARA>

The present Export Expansion Grants Scheme arose from a 1977 election promise. It was enacted in 1978 and proclaimed in November of that year. Meat was included as an eligible product for the financial years 1977-78 and 1978-79. It then became and remains ineligible. Grants are determined by increases in the value, not the volume, of eligible products in a grant your vis-a-vis the base period, which is the average value of exports-the base period being a term used in the Act for the financial years 1974-75 to 1976-77.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The original Act excluded from consideration meat exported to Canada and the United States under quotas granted by the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation-the AMLC. The AMLC replaced the Australian Meat Board on 1 December 1977. That fact is highly significant. Quotas granted by the Australian Meat Board were not excluded from consideration when assessing export expansion. All meat, including Australian Meat Board quota meat exported in the base period, and to some extent in the qualifying period, was counted. Comparable exports under quotas granted by the AMLC were not. Thus the base period was inflated relative to the qualifying period, and the assessed export growth in that period reduced accordingly. That was the law until Statutory Rule No. 127 was gazetted on 30 May last year, almost a year, I stress, after meat ceased to be an eligible product. </PARA>
<PARA> Statutory Rule 127 removed quotas to the United States and Canada granted by the Australian Meat Board from consideration in assessing export growth and grant entitlement. That rule deflated base period exports and to a much lesser extent the qualifying period in 1977-78 only, and increased the Commonwealth's liability to pay grants because it deflated the base period and therefore inflated the degree of export growth. Those facts, incidentally, can be verified in the report of Estimates Committee H which was tabled in the Senate on 12 May, page 009. I seek leave to incorporate that page in Hansard. </PARA>

In some cases they may; in this case they cannot because the rules were changed 11 months after the product in question ceased to be eligible. An export expansion grant for a product such as meat is paid to the owner of the product, who is not necessarily the processor, at the point of export. I understand that the Mitsui company, for example, exports meat; it does not process it. The grant is paid to the owner of the product at the time of export. It is arguable whether that export grant completely filters back to the livestock producers who determine the level of production and indirectly the volume of exports. In this case there is no room for argument. Benefits cannot filter retrospectively for livestock sold two and three years before the new rule established an increased grant entitlement. I repeat that Statutory Rule 127 provides a gratuitous, retrospective handout which will cost approximately $20m. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot believe that even this Government is sufficiently negligent with taxpayers' money, even when one considers some of the things that it did last April and before the last election, to throw $20m away in this fashion. This begs the question: Is there an ulterior motive? The fact that no official announcement or explanation of the implications of Statutory Rule 127 has been given suggests that there is. So does the turgid language in which SR127 is written. It was designed to be incomprehensible in the hope that its effects would not be detected. Did the Government succumb to pressure from the potential beneficiaries of the change? It is worth noting that the Export Development Grants Board annual report for 1979-80 lists the following organisations amongst those for whom grants have been paid to that time: Tancred Bros Pty Ltd-a director of which organisation occupies a Liberal Party seat in the House of Representatives-which received $1.72m for the financial year 1977-78; Elders Overseas Trading (Aust) Pty Ltd, which received $1.697m for 1977-78 and 1978-79; and the Anglis group, which received $2.750m for 1978-79. At this stage I do not know whether any of those grants were affected by Statutory Rule 127 since it was gazetted only one month before the closing date for that report. I do know that the export entitlement of those who had previously received grants will be increased because of Statutory Rule 127. In some cases those people who were not previously eligible for grants will become eligible because of Statutory Rule 127. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Presumably, among others, Tancred Brothers will get the money, if it has not already received it. I repeat that a director of that company occupies a Liberal Party seat in the House of Representatives. His file in John Fairfax and Sons Ltd is marked 'never to be re-employed'. The reason that it is marked that way is that he was running his own shares when he wrote a financial column. He is a director of one of the firms which will certainly benefit from the change. I am not in a position to say whether that is the reason for the change. Alternatively, was this gratuitous, retrospective handout of $20m to exporters, a pay-off for collaborating in past chicanery organised by the National Country Party and the Department of Trade and Resources, officers of which Department recently, at the direction of their political masters, made secret oral threats of bureaucratic harassment to firms which have been tardy to comply with secret directives to buy commodities which they do not want? To a significant degree we have two tiers of government in Australia. One is public and applies the rule of law and the other rules by secret, arbitrary, ministerial directive transmitted through corrupt National Country Party controlled departments, in particular the Department of Trade and Resources.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1980-81 I raise some questions pertaining to South Australia. One relates to the difficulties that miners are having in Coober Pedy because of the very high price that they have to pay for diesel fuel. As a result of this Coober Pedy, which today has a population of some 5,000 people, may virtually have to close down or go out of existence. Because of the high price of fuel and the high cost of transportation into that area some 1,500 people have left Coober Pedy. Some two years ago the price of low grade opal was $60 to $80 per oz; now it brings only $10 per oz. Because of these factors it is very difficult for miners to exist in that town. Low grade opal is what miners call their bread and butter opal. As a result of prices as low as $10 per oz it is impossible to mine profitably. I believe that Chinese buyers have formed a syndicate to keep the price of opal very low. High grade opal still brings a very good price of $500 to $1,500 per oz. But high grade opal is very difficult to find. Sometimes it takes many years for miners to find a parcel of good quality opal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Coober Pedy is situated on the Stuart Highway between Port Augusta and Alice Springs. It is 935 kilometres by road from Adelaide. The highway is largely unsealed. As many people know, conditions in Coober Pedy are very harsh. In summer the temperature reaches well over 40 degrees celsius. Most of the people have to live underground because of the extreme heat. Even water for household purposes that on average costs a householder in any of the capital cities $250 a year costs about $1,500 a year in Coober Pedy. The people in the area are unable to have gardens or any of the luxuries that go with an ample water supply in the city areas. Coober Pedy is the largest producer in the world of opal found in the one centre. South Australia produces 80 per cent of the world's opal and Australia produces 95 per cent of the world's opal. </PARA>
<PARA> Opal is a precious stone. It is much sought after in many countries. In the past opal has been a valuable income earner for Australia. In 1979, $32.67m worth of opal was produced at Coober Pedy. The capital investment per miner in the area is about $18,000 and total investment for mining equipment amounts to $18.46m. Annual operating costs run at about $3.65m. The operating costs for a miner work out at about $800 a week. The difficulty is that the high cost of fuel has increased transport costs. As I said, a miner's operating costs are about $800 a week. All their equipment runs on diesel. It is becoming impossible for Coober Pedy to exist. In 1974 the price of diesel was $11 for a 44-gallon drum, which is about 200 litres. In 1978 the price was $29.50 a barrel. In 1980 the price rose to $60 a barrel. The price of diesel is still increasing. As I said, because of the high cost of fuel Coober Pedy will go out of existence unless some help is given by the Commonwealth Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Coober Pedy is not recognised as a town. It is run by a progress association. The association has done a great job. It takes the place of a normal town council. In the early days the association was responsible for the building of the airfield and most of the roads. It was even responsible for the desalination of the town's water. It is a co-operative affair designed to keep prices down. As I said, water costs a householder in Coober Pedy about $1,500 a year. All the water, which is brackish and is pumped from bores near Coober Pedy, has to be desalinated. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past Coober Pedy has been a valuable place. It has played a part in the tourist industry. I believe if help could be given either by the State or Federal governments to overcome the difficulties that the people in this area are experiencing they will be able to survive. The real trouble is that the people of Coober Pedy do not have the finance to enable them to search for new fields. The old fields are not producing as much opal as they used to produce. The people of Coober Pedy cannot search for new fields because of the high cost of fuel. The Federal Government could provide some help through the Bureau of Mineral Resources. The South Australian Department of Mines should be out in the field to help the people of Coober Pedy overcome their problems. The people in the area did have talks with the Minister for National Development and Energy, Senator Carrick, some weeks ago but so far there has been no result. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been in contact with the people in the area. I have been to Coober Pedy to see how badly off or how well off they are and to ascertain whether their claims are outrageous. I am convinced that they have a genuine claim and that they are in desperate trouble. Arrangements have been made to seal the runways at Coober Pedy. The construction of a new hospital for the town is about to be commenced. It is vital to South Australia to have a sizeable town in this area. A lot of mineral development is going on in the area. Coober Pedy will certainly go out of existence unless the opal miners stay there. The people are facing many difficulties but they can overcome them if they are given help. They do not want the unemployment benefit. They are not the sort of people who want to go on to the unemployment benefit. They are not trained in any other field of work. If they are forced out of the area all they will be able to do is to go back to Adelaide and apply for the unemployment benefit, which will be of no benefit to anyone. I believe if they were given assistance at this time they certainly would be able to overcome their problems. It is a government responsibility. I think this Government should seriously look at the situation in Coober Pedy. </PARA>
<PARA> The miners in the Coober Pedy area use nitrosyl as an explosive which virtually is a nitrogenous fertiliser. Primary producers get a subsidy for using nitrogenous fertilisers but the miners at Coober Pedy do not get any subsidy whatsoever. The explosives are very expensive. In 1974 nitrosyl cost $8.40 for a 40 kilogram bag. In March 1981 it cost $25 a bag. Primary producers do not have to pay anywhere near that price. In 1974 the miners of Coober Pedy were paying $3.90 for a box of 100 detonator caps. Today they are paying $12.95 a box. In 1974 the miners were paying $36.60 for a roll of cordex, the detonating cord. Today they are paying $105 a roll. In 1974 the miners were paying $14.50 for a roll of fuses. Today they are paying $35.60 a roll; and so it goes on. The cost of living in this area is extremely high. Some of the people who have gone on to the unemployment benefit have been mistreated. A year ago a person who held a miners licence could not go on to the unemployment benefit. That situation has now been overcome, but if a person holds a mining lease he cannot go on to the unemployment benefit even if he is not producing one cent of opal from that lease. Some people have gone on unemployment benefit but because of computer processes which show that they are still holding a mining lease they have been taken off unemployment benefit and have had to wait six to eight weeks before receiving it again. The miners, in general, do not want to be unemployed; they do not want the unemployment benefit. They want some practical help from the Government. I believe that the Federal Government and the State Government should liaise so that some sensible solutions can be worked out. The miners do not want a subsidy for ever and a day. They want to be viable, and that is understandable. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other problems. Some miners may work for 10 to 12 years before finding a worthwhile parcel of opal. It is true, as I said, that they can go out and get their bread and butter opals and keep themselves viable. This enables them to buy fuel and food and send their children to school and everything else. It virtually does not pay to recover a low grade opal. It is nothing for a sizable parcel of opal to be worth $100,000. There is a discrepancy under the present taxation laws of this country. As I have said, some miners have lived on virtually nothing for 10 years. I know of one miner-he was very honest-who disclosed that he had found a $100,000 opal. He had to pay some $70,000 in provisional tax. He owed several people something like $15,000 and was left with about $15,000. That shows the ridiculous situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Primary producers can have their taxation varied over a number of years. I believe the taxation rights of miners should be looked at. I think representatives of government agencies should go to the area and make an honest report. The honourable member for Grey, Mr Wallis, has been up there many times, as have I. I have found the people to be genuine. They are hard working. They have produced many millions of dollars for the economy of this country. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> I present Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1980-81 which, together with Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1980-81 which I shall introduce shortly, comprises the Additional Estimates for 1980-81. In these Bills, Parliament is asked to appropriate moneys to meet essential and unavoidable expenditures additional to the appropriations made under Appropriation Acts (Nos 1 and 2) 1980-81. The additional appropriations total $520.9m: Of this, $432.6m is sought in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) and $88.3m in Appropriation Bill (No. 4). </PARA>
<PARA> The additional appropriations sought in the Bills are offset to some extent by savings in appropriations made by Appropriation Acts (Nos 1 and 2), resulting partly from the Government's determined efforts to achieve savings in expenditure wherever possible. These savings, amounting to $147.6m, are detailed under the relevant appropriation headings in the document 'Statement of Savings Expected in Annual Appropriations', which has been distributed to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding the additional appropriations now sought, current expectations are that total outlays in 1980-81, including those financed from special appropriations, will be within one per cent of the Budget estimates. This reflects the Government's continued adherence to its policy of maintaining maximum expenditure restraint. </PARA>
<PARA> I now outline some of the main areas where the Government has found it necessary to seek additional appropriations in Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1980-81. Included in the amount Parliament is now being asked to appropriate is $191.1m to meet increases in award rates and other wage and salary costs since the Budget, consisting of $100.7m civil, and $90.4m defence. Although the overall Budget figuring contained an allowance of $235m for prospective wage and salary rate increases in the Public Service, including defence, that amount was not then appropriated. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the 'Administrative expenses' vote, an amount of $3.6m is included for the Attorney-General's Department for payments to private legal practitioners by the Australian Legal Aid Office. This is partly offset by a reduction in the counterpart payments through State legal aid commissions due to delays in the establishment of the Victorian commission. The amount also provides for an overall escalation in payments to private legal practitioners. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the Department of Defence an amount of $7.4m is sought to cover the increased cost of fares and vehicle hire, together with a general increase in program activities above that provided for in the Budget. An additional amount of $4.5m included for the Department of Housing and Construction results from a higher than anticipated rate of expenditure on the engagement of private architects, engineers and consultants. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the 'Other services' heading, $5.8m is proposed for the Department of Communications mainly for locally produced television programs, originally expected to be covered by revenues from advertising through the multicultural television channels. An amount of $26.2m is required under the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs for employment retraining and assistance. The increased provision comprises $17.7m for new initiatives and increased activity under the National Employment and Training System and $8.5m under the scheme to encourage full time training of apprentices. </PARA>
<PARA> A sum of $9m is required under the Department of Industry and Commerce to meet increased costs of maintaining reserve capacity in government factories. </PARA>
<PARA> Additional significant 'Other services' provisions include: $16.5m for the Department of Defence to cover increased cost of stores and greater requirements than expected as a result of increased activities; $10.5m for the Department of Defence to meet increased cost of repair and overhaul of aircraft, ships and other equipment; $5.4m for the Department of Education mainly to cover unavoidable increases in running costs for the Australian Capital Territory Schools Authority; $8.3m for the Department of Foreign Affairs, principally to cover the increased cost of wheat relating to Australia's commitment under the Food Aid Convention; and $5m under the Department of Science and Technology mainly to meet increased running costs of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first reading of any money Bill, of course, provides honourable senators with the opportunity to discuss a number of matters of public interest. Some matters I wish to discuss tonight are causing a great deal of concern in our community. I refer firstly to the removal of medical benefit payments for supposedly cosmetic surgery. This has caused a lot of confusion not only in the community but also amongst medical practitioners. Let me say immediately that the term 'cosmetic' is something of a misnomer. The word 'cosmetic' in the first place is an emotive one and the implication is that this type of surgery is done only to satisfy the patients' vanity and is therefore totally unnecessary. That is not true. I will admit that some cosmetic or plastic surgery procedures are unnecessary but most procedures are very necessary for the emotional or physical well-being of people involved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Perhaps the biggest problem with the recent decision of the Government to remove a number of items from the medical benefits rebate schedule is that no one knew what was allowable and what was not allowable. We had a situation, as mentioned by Senator Chipp in a question I think on the day that the revised schedule came into effect, in which people were actually in hospital after having arranged to have a particular operation on a particular day but they did not know whether they were covered sufficiently to get the medical rebate. I believe that a number of operations were cancelled virtually at the last minute because people were just not sure whether they were covered. I have to admit that when I make that statement I am going strictly on what other people have told me. I have no evidence of the fact that it did happen but it is quite possible that it did. </PARA>
<PARA> The second problem in relation to the rash manner in which the Government introduced this particular measure is that no period of grace was allowed. The decision was announced on 30 March and it came into effect the following day, 1 April. There are still a number of grey areas. I raised a number of these matters at an Estimates committee hearing. I have since received a copy of the Press release of the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) which really has not clarified the situation for me to any great extent. It now appears that the matter is in the hands of the Department of Health in the various States which may have occasion to refer a specific matter to the Minister for clarification. Unfortunately, during the Estimates committee's investigations I referred to the National Health and Medical Research Council when, in fact, of course I meant the committee which reviews the medical benefits schedule. Be that as it may, I still believe that there are too many grey areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I raised at the Estimates committee hearing the case of a woman who is 40 years of age and who was severely burnt down one side of her body as a small babe. She has a tremendous amount of scar tissue and she has had no breast development at all on one side. She has already had two breast augmentation operations, the first of which was not at all successful and the second of which was successful only to a certain extent. She was informed within three months of that second operation that she would need another operation. She had planned on having that operation at about this time. But when she contacted her medical practitioner she was advised that she would not be eligible to claim a medical rebate because the operation would now qualify as breast augmentation. When I raised this matter at the Estimates committee I was informed that this particular operation would not be considered in that light and would in actual fact be covered. As her doctor has already tried to clarify the situation with the Department of Health in Western Australia-it informed her that she is not eligible-we will now have to raise the matter directly with the Minister. Perhaps it is fortunate that she is an acquaintance of mine and, therefore, has access to a member of parliament. There are many people in the community who do not have that access and who do not know where to go when these grey areas need to be cleared up. Obviously in this situation her doctor is not aware that she could be covered for rebate and he is apprehensive about performing the operation because it would commit her to tremendous expense in the event that a medical rebate does not apply. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly I should like to refer to the case of a young constituent of mine, a girl of some 17 years of age who, because of a disease she contracted or for some other reason of which I am not aware, suffered a tremendous weight loss. As a result of that immediate and drastic weight loss she has heavy jowls. What she needs is a face lift. According to the Minister's schedule it is classified as cosmetic surgery and cannot be covered. The young girl's mother informed me that the girl is introspective and she will not go out in the daytime. In fact, it is a difficult proposition even to get her out of the house at night. She hides in her room when visitors call and the only place that she seems to visit is the doctor's. She wraps her neck up with a scarf and is extremely embarrassed by her condition. Her doctor has already advised her that she will require at least one facelift. Possibly because of the condition of her jowls she will need two operations. </PARA>
<PARA> She will not be covered under this new schedule for either operation unless her doctor decrees that they are medically necessary. Now we have to find a doctor who will in actual fact state that this is so. What this situation will produce in the community is an awareness by some sections that if they have the means to have these operations done-whether or not they may be considered medically necessary-they will be able to have them done. If they are on low incomes and, therefore, do not have the means or the access to information, they are most unlikely to have the operations done. More problems will be created in the community. I need to be able to advise this girl whether she is entitled to a medical benefit rebate. I have endeavoured to clarify the situation with her physician. Her physician tells me that he has contacted the Department of Health in his State and has been advised that this is plain and simple cosmetic surgery. Under the Minister's decree I would assess that this is so. It has to be considered cosmetic surgery but, as the same time, there is a discretion involving the words 'unless it is medically necessary'. The situation will develop in our community that a large number of people will have to seek psychiatric advice-this already occurs in the case of a woman who needs to have an abortion-so that they can have these very necessary operations. This girl's family is on a particularly low income. It is certainly not in a position to pay hundreds of dollars if this is not an allowable deduction. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said earlier, there are too many grey areas. The move by the Minister appears to be discriminatory. I hope that it is not, but it appears to be that way. I am moved to ask, for instance, whether any women were on the review committee. Were there any plastic surgeons on the review committee? Was the Australian Society of Plastic Surgeons consulted prior to the removal of those benefits? If it was consulted what were its recommendations? Were those recommendations taken into account? I can only presume, because of my contact with a number of plastic surgeons, they were not consulted. If their Association were consulted, its recommendations were not taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA> I have copies of letters from women which were written to plastic surgeons expressing gratitude for cosmetic surgery performed for breast reduction, for instance. That may on the surface appear to be purely cosmetic. I have already given one instance where it is not cosmetic. It was because of psychological disadvantages that this was necessary. Let me assure male senators that women could find over-large breasts a distinct disadvantage which would cause stress, both emotional and physical, and they do suffer physical disabilities directly attributable to being, as one woman put it, top heavy. In fact because it is such an important matter I want to read out both of those letters to honourable senators. I am quite happy to have them in Hansard, but I want honourable senators to recognise that I have removed the names and addresses of the women to preserve their anonymity. In the second instance I also have removed the name of an education centre at which one of these women is having lessons, so that there is no danger of identification or of her privacy being invaded. The name of the plastic surgeon, I believe, is not important because I am sure there would be similar letters on the files of most of the plastic surgeons who work with women throughout the country. The first letter states:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Mr . . . It is almost two years since you performed breast reduction surgery for me and my gratitude continues. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason for this note is to say that I am now able to achieve something I was too embarrassed to attempt previously-I am learning to swim at adult classes conducted by the . . . Education Centre and am making good progress. </PARA>
<PARA> Thank you for having made this possible. </PARA>
<PARA>The second letter, which is rather lengthy but which requires to be read out, states:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Mr . . . </PARA>
<PARA> As a result of your understanding and skill I am, for the first time in many years, learning the meaning of living and 'ordinary' everyday life without feeling the sensitivity and sometimes real humiliation suffered so many times during those years. I do not believe that anyone, excepting, of course, a compassionate Plastic Surgeon or another woman (and there are very many of them) could possibly realise to what extent an overlarge bosom can affect the afflicted person psychologically. </PARA>
<PARA> At the age of 61 years, I did not arrive lightly at the decision to have the breast reduction operation and vanity certainly did not enter into my thoughts. As you will recall, I left the decision entirely up to you regarding the size, shape et cetera. I had no preconceived ideas of the result: My one hope and desire was for the chance to become a normal looking woman like a lot of other people instead of feeling somewhat of a misfit. I had not been swimming for many years and I did not accept many invitations for dancing-although I was a good swimmer in my earlier years and a pretty fair dancer. </PARA>
<PARA> Prior to the operation I often suffered from severe backache and pain over the shoulder and neck region which I understand now was caused through the straps of my bra pulling up the weight. I still bear deep indentations in my shoulders from bra straps and I rather imagine these will be a lasting reminder of my earlier problem. Now I have no backache and no shoulder pains. I walk more confidently and feel I am not so accident prone as I was when I was so top heavy. I had quite a few accidents-I just seemed to fall over if I tripped a little. Once I fractured my kneecap and the surgeon then remarked that I might have been able to save myself if I had been a little less top heavy. I wish other women with my former problem could obtain the relief I have done and I would be only too happy to personally speak with anyone who needed reassurance as to the result of such an operation. </PARA>
<PARA> I have an additional problem which, perhaps, some others may not have as I have been a chronic asthmatic for many years and prior to the operation I was on cortisone tablets and an electric machine-in addition to the usual Ventolin and Becotide. I could not walk far without the aid of an inhaler and the strain of breathing was very much aggravated by the weight I had to lift with each breath. Since the breast reduction I am managing to get by with the aid of only the Ventolin and Becotide. I still get asthma but do not get so distressed: After all, I have a few kilos less to hamper me. </PARA>
<PARA> I regret that this letter is a lengthy one but I feel so appreciative for your help and your understanding of my feelings, I wanted to convey my gratitude to you. Compassion is what is so badly needed by women in my former predicament and that is what I feel you gave. Please accept the sincere thanks of . . . Yours truly</PARA>
<PARA>As I said, those letters express the gratitude of people who see the operation not as cosmetic surgery but as a necessary operation to enable them to live, as one woman expressed it, a normal life and to become a normal human being. </PARA>
<PARA> I said earlier that the decision of the Minister appears to be discriminatory. I outline my thoughts on that just a little further. I do not do so intentionally to disturb any members of the Senate, but I tell the Senate that I will speak about some very personal areas of both the female and the male anatomy. It appears that for a women to have breast augmentation and attract the rebate it could be performed only after mastectomy or if there were no breast development at all. Those two areas would be considered medical rather than cosmetic. I have already outlined one instance in which it is not possible because breast augmentation has already been done. </PARA>
<PARA> Breast development in males is not normal so I have to ask: Is the rebate applicable to males who are female impersonators or trans-sexuals? I see nothing at all in the Minister's statement to show that that is not so, but if it is, why is it that a man can have a breast augmentation operation and can collect the full medical rebate but a woman can have the operation and not be able to collect any rebate? If a young girl is conscious that her breasts have not developed to the same extent as those of her peers and as a result is too embarrassed to go swimming or to play sport, she has to put up with that disability unless she can pay a fair amount of money. I believe it is approximately $700 or $800. If a male feels inferior because of the lack of normal development of his testicles or if his testicles atrophy because of a disease or injury, he is able to have a prosthetic replacement and his medical benefits rebate is not affected. The two matters are identical. Surely if one is to be considered cosmetic the other also has to be considered cosmetic. </PARA>
<PARA> I am given to understand, as a matter of interest, that no more than 100 of those operations are performed in any one year, but surely numbers are not being taken into account. Surely what we are looking at, at the moment anyway, in the Minister's statement is a further disadvantaging of disadvantaged people in the community. There does not appear to me to be any provision for exceptional conditions, although I was assured at the Estimates committee hearing that there is a discretion if an operation is considered medically necessary. We have to ask who makes this determination of whether it is medically necessary. Is it the Department of Health in each State? If so, is it reliant on the determination of one person in that Department whether a matter is medically necessary? Obviously, the departmental advice to remove certain items from the Schedule was given to the Minister as a certain way to save a relatively small amount of money. I think it is approximately $3.4m. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know how one measures money against personal distress, emotional distress or physical distress, but the manner in which these items were to be removed was administratively easy to carry out and to police. That may be so, but are we talking about the policing of regulations or are we talking about human misery and human suffering? From my contact with the Department, as I have already stated, the position appears to be a little confusing. I have some information that leads me to believe patients and doctors who contact the various departmental officers about particular deserving situations have been advised-only over the telephone, of course-that the operations for such deserving cases should be itemised under other, inappropriate item numbers. In other words, it is being suggested to them that the item could be quoted as something other than it is so that the medical benefit can be retained by the patient. That virtually encourages doctors to commit fraud. An ironing out process will have to be conducted in the Health Departments of the States if that is happening. I have no reason to believe that it is not. I have already given an instance in which I was given information that was the complete opposite of what was given to a medical practitioner. Both inquiries were made of the same department, in the same State. </PARA>
<PARA> Plastic surgeons have always agreed that a number of operations are most commonly patient-initiated and undertaken mainly for aesthetic reasons, but not all such procedures are in that category. I apologise to anyone with a medical background who may be offended at the way in which I use or pronounce these terms but there is, for instance, bilateral melanoplasty, bilateral blepharoplasty, and bilateral augmentation mammoplasty, to which I have already referred. For those who are not already aware of the fact, that is breast augmentation. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that any health scheme which is based on insurance should allow patients rebates for all recognised surgical procedures which are medically necessary. What one needs to know is who determines what is medically necessary. If a doctor determines that it is necessary for a woman to have breast augmentation and goes ahead with the operation, the woman could then be committed to pay a very large sum of money because the department will not allow a medical rebate for the operation. Face lifts perhaps fall into a slightly different category because a number of men and women in the community have become accustomed to their friends and relatives having face lifts-mostly, I would say, for purely cosmetic purposes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As long as the honourable senator is against the medical rebates proposals that have been put before the Senate he does not need a face lift. However, there are situations in which people have been left with scarring of the facial tissues because of the prolonged presence of acne, which can become unsightly. Others have come to Australia from countries in which smallpox has been prevalent. Sometimes they suffer from a great degree of facial scarring. For them the only solution is to have a face lift. Paralysis of the muscles of expression can occur on one side of the face, particularly after a stroke. In those cases a partial face lift is necessary to restore those muscles to a seemingly normal position so that the symmetry of the face is closer to normal. Lifting muscles may also assist speaking and chewing. The determination of the Minister seems to be that such an operation would constitute a face lift. We return to the question of who is to determine whether it is medically necessary.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Particular mention is made of the reduction of eyelids. I suggest that in a number of situations such an operation would be medically necessary, but how does one determine if this is so? Are we to have doctors take before and after photographs to prove that a medical rebate is justified? I suggest that very few honourable senators have not seen, particularly in older people, marked sagging of the skin around the eyelids. I have seen cases in which the vision has been completely obscured because of excess skin on the upper lid. If an operation were medically necessary surely a medical rebate should be given. The Minister's statement is so narrow in effect that one would not know that whether it would be. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister referred particularly to cases of hair transplants. I suggest that a few honourable senators might be drastically in need of that operation. I would not suggest that Senator O'Byrne would be drastically in need of it. He might be regarded as being mildly in need of it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;His forehead is growing, his hair is not receding. The Minister in charge of the House, the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney), is not quite at that stage either, but I imagine that it will not be long before he is. Under normal circumstances, it is an operation that is carried out on men. Are we simply to say: 'If you need a hair transplant you will have to establish that it is medically necessary'? I suggest that in a number of cases it would be. People who have been burnt around the head may carry excessive scar tissue. Others may have taken drugs under prescription and not been able to tolerate them, with the result that baldness has occurred. Are we to say to these people: 'You are not entitled to a rebate'? That is what the Minister has said.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suggest that the Minister's decision would also disadvantage pensioner patients especially. It may save the taxpayers' money but one questions whether a small saving is necessary or beneficial when compared with the amount of well-being that would be felt by the community if this were not such a grey area. I continue to use that term because I do not understand who is to determine what is medically necessary. Obviously, the doctor will not. I have already given instances in which doctors have contacted the Health Department in a number of States and have been given information different from the information I was given. I was told that it was quite acceptable for a woman to have breast augmentation because of the presence of excessive scar tissue following burning. Her surgeon was told that since it was breast augmentation it was not a medically rebatable item. This is an extremely grey area. No one seems to know, least of all, I suggest, the plastic surgeons. They do not know whether they can say: 'Go ahead and have this operation; it is medically rebatable'. They just do not know, as we do not know. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that it would have been possible to make such a determination if people were not prevented from insuring themselves for that type of surgery. Information before me indicates that the Australian Society of Plastics Surgeons agrees that patients could be expected to pay more for certain operations which may be patient-initiated even though they be medically necessary, but it does not accept that insurance should not be available. At the moment insurance is not available for this type of operation because it is considered not medically necessary. I understand that the Society suggested to the Government that cosmetic surgery be included in the top bracket of medical insurance only and that contributions be made for at least two years before claims were paid. That recommendations of the Australian Society of Plastic Surgeons was not taken up by the Minister's review committee. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the Society's major worries must be the effect on standards of patient care, because it is certain that doctors will continue to perform aesthetic surgery. The economics of such operations will be such that those performing them could be forced to work in much poorer facilities. We could have a situation in which certain operations would be done under local anaesthesia virtually in doctors' surgeries, when they should be done in properly medically equipped hospitals or clinics. Such surgery is subject to the usual complications of haemorrhage and infection. We may even see the development of lay clinics in which this type of surgery will be done by people who are not equipped to perform it. We will perhaps find underqualified medical people undertaking a great deal of work which should be performed by qualified medical practitioners. I think we can look forward to the development of beauty clinics where people can have a face lift if they are prepared to accept that the person who will do the operation is not necessarily medically qualified. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to raise also in this first reading debate the problem that I see developing with regard to women's refuges. It was not my intention to speak only on matters related to women, but these are two areas about which I feel most strongly. The situation with regard to women's refuges in Western Australia is at the moment at crisis point. Honourable senators might remember that I raised the issue of women's refuges on 29 May 1979 as a matter of urgency. At that time I moved that the following was a matter of urgency:</PARA>
<PARA> The need for guaranteed, continued and adequate Federal Government funding for women's refuges throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>It is interesting to note that the Government did not oppose that matter of urgency. It expressed agreement with the views I put forward. I raise the matter now because I am concerned that the crisis in Western Australia is being heightened by State Government policy. I begin by reminding honourable senators that the first women's refuges in Australia were established by women's groups in response to the desperate need they saw in the community for women and their children to have a haven at times of emotional stress and at times when it was perhaps necessary for them to escape a situation made unbearable by physical abuse, by drunkenness, by financial oppression or even by mental oppression in their domestic situations. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think it necessary for me to spend a great deal of time in this place convincing honourable senators of the genuine need that Australia's 97 women's refuges fulfil at this moment. But clearly there is a great deal of catching up to do. That is reflected by the increasing number of refuges that have been set up by the number of women and children who avail themselves of the service of those refuges. There is no question that there is a need. More than 1,460 women and 2,116 children were accommodated in women's refuges through Western Australia in 1980. Yet those figures belie the fact that many homeless women and their children are turned away not just every week but, in some instances, every night because of lack of accommodation at refuges. I can tell honourable senators, as an instance, that in March of this year 21 families were turned away in one month from the Warrawee refuge in Western Australia. Those 21 families included 50 children. Ave Maria House, which is run by the Daughters of Charity, turned away 288 women and 386 children in the period from 1 December 1979 to 30 November 1980. Because priority is given to women with small children, it is usually single and middle aged women who are turned away. I will return in a moment to look at that group. </PARA>
<PARA> I recognise that the Federal Government tends to acknowledge the plight of women and their children who are forced to leave their homes. It is unfortunate, I suppose, that many of those decisions to leave occur in the dead of night when the women are least able to turn to friends, family or relatives who may be able to help them. But it is not a need that the State Government of Western Australia apparently recognises. Honourable senators will be aware that the Western Australian Government and the Queensland Government are the only two State governments which do not totally fund women's refuges with the assistance of the 75 per cent paid by the Federal Government. In New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Tasmania and, I believe, even in the Northern Territory, where Federal Government funding is 75 per cent, the 25 per cent is funded by State government grants. This is not the case in Queensland. In fact we have seen in this very chamber a situation, after Queensland only two years ago was given a sum of money to fund two women's refuges, in which it was necessary for deliberations to be made by the Government to give a direct grant because the Government of Queensland had refused to hand over money which was earmarked for that specific purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> In Western Australia the situation is that the State Government makes up only 12.5 per cent and it is up to the refuges to make up the other 12.5 per cent. Most of them-there are a couple of exceptions-make up that 12.5 per cent by the back paying of wages paid to their staff. The two exceptions are two refuges which the local councils aid by donating the actual 12.5 per cent. I would not like to think that the Federal Government was suggesting that it would be necessary for refuges to resort to lamington drives, cake stalls and that kind of thing to find the additional amounts of money. When we stop to think of the way in which women's refuges go about their affairs, the need that they fulfil in society and the amount of time spent by the women who run the refuges, we can understand that there is not a great deal of time left for fund raising. In fact they have to go begging to get the amount that is necessary for them to continue. As I said, in Western Australia the State Government makes up the 12.5 per cent, but it is still up to the refuges to make up the other 12.5 per cent. I wonder what the attitude of the Western Australian Government will be now that the Federal Government has handed to the States responsibility for funding women's refuges. On Tuesday of this week Senator Ryan directed a question to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) who represents the Minister for Health in this chamber. She asked:</PARA>
<PARA> I understand that as a result of the recently announced changes to the health care system the funding for women's refuges will be transferred to the States. Will this funding be in the form of an earmarked component of general revenue grants to the States? If not, how does the Government intend to ensure that women's refuges, especially in such States as Queensland and Western Australia, continue to receive an adequate level of funding or, indeed, any funding at all?</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister replied:</PARA>
<PARA> It is my understanding that the funds to be set aside for the purposes set out in the new health arrangements will be identified initially as being that block of funds which will cover health, the Community Health Program and the School Dental Scheme. They will eventually be absorbed into general revenue grants. I understand that it will then be for each State to examine its own priorities in relation to the particular program which interests the honourable senator. I suggest that, as a senator from New South Wales, I will be as concerned to see the response from the Government of New South Wales as Senator Ryan is concerned to see the response of any other State government. I think it will be for each State government to examine its priorities. I just observe that some years ago I assisted in setting up one of the women's refuges. I, as much as any other senator, would not like to see the program founder. It will become a matter for the States to decide in the light of their own programs and priorities. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Ryan asked a supplementary question in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA> Am I to understand the Minister to have stated that there will be no earmarking or any other specific indication that any part of the health grant will be for women's refuges?</PARA>
<PARA>The Minister, Senator Peter Baume, then said:</PARA>
<PARA> I have already said that there will be earmarking of the total amount of money, at least initially. There will be no specific component for women's refuges within that total earmarked amount. Anyone examining what the States are doing will know the global amount of money with which they are working and their capacity to allow for women's refuges within that amount of money if they so wish. </PARA>
<PARA>It is those last four words that concern me because it could well be-I think in Western Australia we will so find-that it does not suit the wishes of the State Government to fund women's refuges. As I have already made quite clear by the figures I have provided to the Senate, the refuges are often full. In fact, they are overflowing. I have visited refuges when they have had mattresses in the passageways. They have had bodies-that is live bodies-lying on mattresses virtually in the kitchen of a house because there is nowhere else for them to go and they do not want to turn another family away, particularly in the middle of the night, so they make whatever arrangements are necessary. I presume one has to accept that a blind eye is turned to that situation by the various health inspectors from the departments. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, we see the refuges providing a tremendous amount of the emotional support needed when a family breaks up. We have seen the tremendous support of the people who work in these refuges. If there are any members in this chamber who have not visited a women's refuge I assure them that that is one thing they should do on a fairly regular basis. They should see the amount of support and encouragement that is given to women and children who arrive at refuges. </PARA>

I suggest that as I have been refused permision to visit a men's hostel we might find ourselves in the same boat. I am sure I was refused permission purely on the grounds of my sex. I find that a little disturbing too. I am sure that there would be a number of refuges in Victoria which would welcome Senator Chipp going to them to see the situation that exists there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will just illustrate the situation that pertains in Western Australia by referring to the Lucy Saw Centre. This refuge, in its 1980-81 Budget allocation, received $30,000 from the Federal Government; that is, 75 per cent of its total funding. It received $5,000 from the State Government-its 12 1/2 per cent. Therefore, the refuge is bound to finding a further $5,000. There is no way that it can avoid having to find that $5,000 because its entire budget has been based on what the Federal Government is prepared to give it. The refuge, like all refuges, receives its funding in arrears. Therefore it has to make its own 12 1/2 per cent contribution available before both the Federal and State government funding is available; it has to find money before it can get any money at all. It has to find 12 1/2 per cent of the total amount of funding it is going to get so that it can finance its operations until it gets its initial funding and so that it can attend to the needs of people. The Lucy Saw refuge predicts that for the 1981-82 Budget period it will need to find around $7,000. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already told honourable senators how the refuges find that 12 1/2 per cent. They back donate the pay of the staff who service the needs of the people who use the refuges. We are in a real catch-22 situation. The fact that the refuge now has to find an extra $2,000 more than last year will put an even greater strain on the refuge. It is putting an even greater strain on the people who see the need for the refuge. They have only so many hours in a day in which they can service the needs of the community in that situation. They have only so many days in a week and so many weeks in a year in which they can be prepared to work for less remuneration than they are entitled to so that they can finance the operations they are running on behalf of people. </PARA>
<PARA> The Lucy Saw Centre is in a depressed, low income, high unemployment area in Kwinana. The Minister at the table who is from Western Australia will be aware of just what I mean when I say 'in a depressed, low income, high unemployment area'. Fund raising is extremely difficult. Refuge workers and volunteers spend all day at stalls plus the time and money needed to make cakes and other items to be sold. On some occasions they raise a mere $140 or $150. It takes an awful lot of lamington drives, cake stalls and pot plant sales to make enough lots of $140 or $150 to get $7,000 for the funding of a refuge. Honourable senators can imagine how many raffles would be needed for them to make $1,000 profit. </PARA>
<PARA> The Nardine women's refuge-I have raised the subject of Nardine in this place on a number of occasions-participates in an annual street appeal with other agencies and it raises approximately $800. That does not even cover one month's operating costs; that is, Nardine's 12 1/2 per cent share of the operating costs. Local organisations cannot provide help indefinitely and, understandably, organisations such as Rotary and Apex feel that they should not have to be called on year after year to support the refuges financially. I am not saying-I want to make it quite clear-that Rotary, Apex, Lions or any of those other community service organisations do not like to be called on for funds on an annual basis. But they have an awful lot of work to do in our community, and they do it very well. I can recognise the difficulty they would have in having a constant appeal for assistance from the same organisation, albeit that the organisation is in their area and is a very worthy cause. I can still recognise the dilemma they are placed in if they have a constant begging for funds from one organisation when there are so many they have to service. </PARA>
<PARA> Workers at Nardine have explained to me that most organisations and individuals that make donations do so in the form of a specific item or a service. For instance, if a service organisation is prepared to donate toys for the entertainment of children, if it is prepared to donate the time for a clean-up of the yard or if it is prepared to donate the time and the equipment needed to paint the refuge, that is fine. But they do not necessarily have the funds to contribute and it is money that is vitally necessary in the running of the refuges. The money just cannot be raised because the burden on the people's time, as I have already said, is so great. The staff have already committed themselves to the work that they are doing in the community. They are committing themselves even further by back-paying their income. They pay in that way just to keep the refuge solvent. It does not necessarily mean that they have everything in the refuge that they need. They still rely on charitable organisations to provide them with the necessary equipment such as beds, linen, mattresses, brooms, brushes, cleaning equipment and everything else. </PARA>
<PARA> The low wages paid to the refuge staff are limited according to what the members of the committee at each of the refuges consider they are capable of raising as their 12 1/2 per cent. That suggests an even more callous attitude of the State Government in Western Australia. It is clearly in the interest of the State Government to keep funding at 12 1/2 per cent because its contribution to the running costs and wages paid at refuges is then minimised. Clearly a refuge could not afford to pay award rates to its workers. Yet, people in any industry would be horrified if they were asked to accept less than award rates or award conditions. Yet here we have a situation in which refuges cannot afford to pay award rates. </PARA>
<PARA> I have spoken to refuge workers and co-ordinators and it has been made clear to me that wages-that is, fair and decent wages-are not the overriding consideration; it is the amount of time involved and the need to supply a service to the people who they are there to service. To a large extent the refuges rely on voluntary assistance. When one talks to the organisers and the administrators of the refuges it is interesting to find just how many people who have used the service of a refuge come back to assist in the running of the refuge at a later time because they recognise the need and the limitations. They all come back in an unpaid, voluntary capacity. As I have said, I am most concerned that the Federal Government has abrogated its responsibility by handing over the responsibility for the funding of refuges to State governments. I am even more disturbed at the Minister's response to Senator Ryan's question. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Anyone examining what the States are doing will know the global amount of money with which they are working and their capacity to allow--</PARA>
<PARA>The operative word is 'allow'-</PARA>
<PARA>for women's refuges within that amount of money if they so wish. </PARA>
<PARA>They were the Minister's words. I repeat:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . their capacity to allow for women's refuges within that amount of money if they so wish. </PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that there is a great deal of concern in Western Australia, particularly among the workers in the refuges, who are worried that the Western Australian Government may not so wish. It may not have this matter on the top of its priority list where it should be. The Government may not even see it as a need. A situation is developing in Western Australia which disturbs me greatly. I refer to the attitude of the Court Government to the needs of people in the community. I beg the Minister's pardon. Did I miss an interjection?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just a silent prayer. I have another eight minutes in which to speak. I might be able to see out that period. I hope no one is in a hurry. I believe what I am speaking about is of great concern. We had a situation in which all members of this chamber, and possibly members in the other place, received letters from the women's refuge co-operative in Victoria. The refuges were concerned that their addresses had to be disclosed to Federal Government departments and if it were not they would be in danger of losing their funding. I question what will happen to that exercise. The Victorian State Government was quite happy for the address to remain undisclosed. I believe the system which works in Victoria should be working in all States. It is interesting that there have been relatively fewer violent incidents in Victoria compared with those in other States. There have certainly been such incidents in Western Australia. I refer to the degree of violence that is exhibited at women's refuges, perhaps by an irate husband whose wife has had to leave home, possibly because of his violence or alcoholism or her financial deprivation. She has left and taken the children with her and he has suspected that she has gone to a women's refuge. I do not think there is one refuge in Western Australia that has not been attacked at some time. We have had situations in which men have fired rifles in the street, possibly not with the intention of injuring anybody, but certainly expressing a warning. We have had rocks thrown through refuge windows. We have had a number of doors broken down and fences broken.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not think I know of any one case in Victoria in which this has happened. Such incidents do not occur there because the addresses of refuges are not disclosed. If a woman needs to go to a refuge she telephones the one central number. If she does not have transport she can be collected and taken to a refuge. If she lives in the western suburbs the possibility is that she will be sent to a refuge in the northern, eastern or southern suburbs. She will not necessarily be sent to a refuge in her own area. I think that is a good thing. If all States worked on that basis I would be much happier and I am sure that the refuges would be also. We had a situation in which the Federal Government had determined that the addresses of refuges had to be known or funding would be discontinued. The Minister claimed that this action was necessary. I heard a senator say at an Estimates committee hearing last week that in her opinion it was necessary for these places-these were her words, not mine-to be available for inspection by the various authorities. One questions why that is so. </PARA>

Senator Walters said that she felt that it was necessary for these refuges to come under some degree of inspection; to justify their existence virtually, and that otherwise they should not receive any funding. I suggest that this is not the situation that we are talking about. We are talking about protecting the anonymity of people who are in desperate need when they leave home. In most instances they do not want their family to know where they are. They certainly do not want a violent husband to know where they and their children are. I wonder what the Victorian Government's attitude will be now. The Federal Government has said: 'Here is the money. If you so wish you can fund the refuges'. The Victorian Government has already indicated that it does not want to know the addresses of these refuges because it believes they are under enough inspection as it is. One presumes health inspectors go out occasionally to exercise their right to examine the premises.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What will happen in Western Australia? I have expressed my concern. I am sure that the Minister recognises that I have real reason to be concerned. Funding of women's refuges has never been high on the priority list of the Western Australian Government. Let me assure the Senate that irrespective of what that Government has told the women's refuges in Western Australia, if there were an expression of concern the refuges would not have the problem that they have at the moment in obtaining emergency or relief housing-half-way housing-for women whose need for the refuge is perhaps over but who are not yet in a position to return to the full community. They need a half-way house. If this matter were high on the list of the Western Australian Government's priorities a recommendation would be made at State government level that emergency housing be made available through the State Housing Commission. This has not been done in Western Australia. The Federal Minister for Housing and Construction, Tom McVeigh, has told us that if this matter has a high enough priority such housing would be provided. It is obvious that in Western Australia it does not have a high enough priority. </PARA>
<PARA> Under normal circumstances a member of parliament has to make representation to the State Housing Commission to obtain even emergency housing for a constituent. I am speaking of such an emergency in which a woman with three, or perhaps four children, has absolutely nowhere to go. The refuge can no longer keep her because she has been there for the maximum length of time and it needs the space that she and her children are occupying for other needy families. Such women cannot get emergency housing because emergency housing is not available. It is not available because it is not at the top, or even half way up, the priority list, of the Western Australian Government. There is a real and pressing need in Western Australia for continued funding of women's refuges. I do not believe we will get it now that the Federal Government has abrogated its responsibility in the area of health care of women. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not detain the Senate for long. I am not overexcited by the swelling numbers of senators on the benches in this place at the moment, but I will take the opportunity of putting on the record something which I hope some students, some people who are interested in social reform, will read and debate. I wish very briefly to discuss the question of alcohol and its relationship with the road toll and the kind of insanity with which we persist in this country. I begin by saying that expenditure on health now constitutes 8 per cent of national income and of that amount about 60 per cent is spent on hospitals and other health care institutions. That assumes in terms of dollars that 8 per cent of gross domestic product is $9,105.4m. Sixty per cent of that amount would be about $5,400m, that is, $5.4 billion. We are talking about a lot of money out of the taxpayers' pockets being spent on hospitals. Hospital authorities reveal that approximately 14 per cent of patients entering mental health institutions are admitted with a diagnosis of alcoholism or alcoholic psychosis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The matter I want to concentrate on mostly this evening is the funding of the National Health and Medical Research Council that 'not less than 10 per cent of admissions to public hospitals are substantially due to alcohol'. Taking 10 per cent of $5,400m, that would mean that at the very minimum alcohol related admissions to hospital are costing the community $540m. This figure seems to have a familiar ring. That is about the amount of money that the razor gang has just allegedly saved the taxpayers. All I am talking about is the admissions to public hospitals that the National Health and Medical Research Council attributes directly to alcohol. That does not include the hundreds and thousands of other costs to national health that alcohol produces. </PARA>
<PARA> I wonder why we persist with the insanity of allowing this drug, alcohol, to be advertised. It passes my comprehension, when we have evidence that, in terms of hospitals alone, it is costing $540m a year. That is without taking account of the associated agony, suffering and heartbreak. I am informed that alcohol is now the third largest killer of the human race, and yet we still allow it to be advertised. Before I pose as a hypocrite, although in recent times I have become a reformed character in terms of drug intake-I have given up smoking, I have given up coffee, I have given up sugar and I have essentially give up drinking except for--</PARA>

I am not a teetotaller and I do not speak from the moral point of view on this question of abuse of alcohol. But we in this Federal Parliament still allow the incredibly wealthy producers and marketers of alcohol to inculcate into our young people, into our car drivers, the theory that there is no way that they can have a good time at the party they are going to unless they have some bubbly or some social lubricant which will get them going. Millions of dollars are spent to advertise in glorious living technicolour in our lounge rooms that alcohol is a necessary ingredient to have a good time when young people go out. If we continue to permit such advertising, let every honourable senator have it on his or her conscience. But with one stroke of the legislative pen we in the National Parliament could exercise the necessary control over advertising in the electronic media. I would suggest that if a private members Bill were to be introduced into this place seeking to place a ban on the advertising of alcohol in the media a majority of senators would not support it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The majority would not have the courage. I will have the luxury of testing the Senate on that after 30 June. Let us have a look at the figures for the road toll. In 1979, 3,508 people were killed on Australian roads. In 1980, 3,278 people were killed on Australian roads. People suffering injuries requiring surgical or medical treatment numbered 92,000 in 1979. If we heard of some sort of Subiaco Ripper going around killing people and he had killed 50 people in a year, that would be page one national headlines perpetually. And yet in 1979 we allowed 3,278 Australians to be killed on our roads, and 90,000-odd to be maimed.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3V4">Senator CHIPP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Coleman for her assistance. That happened largely as a result of alcohol. It has been estimated that 50 per cent of those deaths are due to some extent to alcohol. State governments have introduced a number of measures designed to counter the alcohol-induced component of the road toll. These include the breathalyser, the random breath tests, and interestingly enough, the State which appears to have had the most success is the strictest State-that is, Victoria, my own State. I simply offer that as a statistical fact.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Why I say it is an insanity to continue to allow the advertising of alcohol is that the insanity was brought home to me recently. I was with my wife at a function of medical superintendents of hospitals at the Alfred Hospital in Melbourne. There were about 150 medical superintendents and their wives in attendance. I had finished my speech and I had to leave for another engagement. It was a Friday evening and the resident medical superintendent said: 'Senator, I will show you the quick way out to your car', and he took me through the casualty ward. This was about 9.45 on a Friday night. He said: 'See, it is almost empty'. And it was. There was some fellow there with a little cut on his hand. The medical superintendent said: 'One hour from now you will not be able to move in this place. There will be broken bones, deaths, and blood everywhere. Every single one who comes in here after 11 o'clock tonight will be the victim of alcohol induced fights or stabbings at so-called parties, or road accidents or whatever'. </PARA>
<PARA> Yet we allow this to go on. We know that strictures help in this regard. Victoria has had success in reducing the road toll, particularly alcohol related or alcohol induced accidents, by the strictness of its rules and laws regarding alcohol. They are not pleasant. A great number of people would like to have four or five beers with the boys before they go home but do not because if they are caught with a blood alcohol level over 0.05 it is a serious offence. But is that sacrifice not worthwhile to save people from getting killed or maimed? Victoria's road toll peaked in 1970 at 1061. With the assistance of compulsory seat belt laws introduced in 1971, breathalysers introduced in 1971 and random breath testing introduced in 1976, the 1980 figure has been reduced from 1,061 to 663. I commend the Victorian Government for its courage in introducing those reforms. </PARA>
<PARA> Might I attack those airy-fairy people who are so-called non-compulsionists and say: 'I will not agree to breathalysers or random breath tests, because I am against compulsion'. I find those people very tiresome, because they have agreed and conformed to all forms of compulsion, to traffic lights, to inspection of food and whatever; but when any new initiative is taken in relation to the road toll, they seem to resist it. I would not find compulsion in this area incompatible with my beliefs as a liberal-and I mean a true liberal of the philosophy of John Stuart Mill. I would easily agree philosophically that the Government has a right to interfere in the private affairs of human beings if that interference can save people from doing harm to a society. My apologies go to Mill for paraphrasing what he said. I repeat that it is clear insanity to allow drunken drivers to continue wreaking havoc on our roads. </PARA>
<PARA> Now I would like to be controversial. This is not Australian Democrats policy. This is an injection into the record of the Senate which I hope may be taken up and debated in thinking places around the community. I express a personal view. I believe that we should look at the Swedish example, which has proved extraordinarily effective. To begin with, no Swede may be awarded a driving licence unless he has a reputation for having temperate habits. So no person with a reputation for drunkenness or other intemperate behaviour has a chance of getting a licence in the first place. When someone applies for a licence the local police automatically check their records and those of the local social welfare authority before proceeding to the actual driving test. Honourable senators might say that that is added bureaucracy, added opportunities for graft and corruption. They are the thoughts which flash to one's mind. I am prepared to accept those sorts of invasions on my privacy if the results of the Swedish strictures that I will cite in a moment save lives and save people getting maimed. </PARA>
<PARA> In Sweden, having gained a licence, a person may then lose it without having committed any traffic offence if the authorities discover he is leading an insober way of life or if he is found drunk in public. Driving with a blood alcohol content of more than 0.15-can I get some assistance; I think that would be about 12 beers--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Grimes" NAMEID="9V4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9V4">Senator Grimes</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is more than that. You wouldn't be making this speech with such clarity.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3V4">Senator CHIPP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Grimes for his assistance. Driving with a blood alcohol content of more than 0.15, or after consuming 15 beers, will always result in a one or two month prison sentence; the maximum is one year. There is no option when a person is found to be in charge of a vehicle with a blood alcohol content of more than 0.15-he goes to gaol for up to a year, regardless of the offender's standing in society. It does not matter what standing in society a person has, the penalty for such an offence is up to a year's gaol. This is termed first degree drunken driving and can also earn a licence disqualification of about two years. A blood alcohol content of between 0.05 and 0.15 will normally be punished by a heavy fine of up to $14,000. This maximum penalty has been applied in many cases. Licence disqualification of about 1 1/2 years is constant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But the Swedes go even further. They place the responsibility on the supplier of alcohol, namely, the hotelier, the restauranteur and even the private host. Honourable senators who have been a guest in the home of a Swede will know that the host asks: Did you come here by taxi or did you bring your own vehicle? If a person arrived in his or her own vehicle there is no way that a responsible Swedish host will serve even a sherry or a glass of wine because of the strictness with which this law is enforced in Sweden. These measures are widely accepted by the Swedish population and there is a general disinclination to drink heavily at parties and in hotels. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the results? Road fatalities in Sweden in 1979 at 783 were nearly 100 fewer than the number in the preceding year and represent the lowest death toll on Swedish roads since 1956, in spite of a trebling of the number of cars to some 2 million over the intervening 24 years. So in 24 years the number of cars has trebled but there has been a diminution of the order I have described in the number of road deaths. In 1980, 712 persons were killed in traffic accidents in Sweden. That was 71 fatalities less than in 1979 and the lowest figure on record since 1952. My source is the Swedish International Press Bureau. So with a population of about 9 million people Sweden has a road toll of 712, while with a population of about 14 million people Australia has a road toll of 3,300. Australia has 4 1/2 times the number of road deaths that Sweden has, yet Sweden has a population of less than nine million people. We should be fair dinkum about people dying, killing and maiming each other on Australian roads. The tragedy is, as with any other social problem, that scarcely an honourable senator-I am not being critical of other honourable senators or members of parliament-becomes interested to this degree until the problem has struck home to him or her, with a loved one or a family friend suffering a road fatality. </PARA>

<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Excise Tariff Act 1921 to enact the excise tariff alternations made by Excise Tariff Proposals No. 3 (1980) and Nos. 1 and 2 (1981). Excise Tariff Proposals No. 3 (1980) were validated by the Excise Tariff Validation Act 1980. They altered the excise duty on stabilised crude petroleum oil from $140.11 to $157.21 per kilolitre and on naturally occurring liquefied petroleum gas from $41.65 to $43.48 per kilolitre. The alterations operated from 1 July 1980. Excise Tariff Proposals No. 1 (1981) were moved in the House on 3 March 1981. They further altered the excise duty on stabilised crude petroleum oil from $157.21 to $174.08 a kilolitre and on naturally occurring LPG from $43.48 to $36.67 per kilolitre. These alterations operated from 1 January 1981. The alterations followed determinations of new import parity prices for crude oil and the setting of new wholesale prices for naturally occurring LPG by me. </PARA>
<PARA> Government policy in relation to crude oil is that all Australian produced crude is sold to refineries at import parity prices. These are based on the official price of Saudi Arabian light market crude. This policy is designed to maintain an adequate supply of liquid fuels over the longer term by encouraging conservation. At the same time it is intended to provide an incentive for exploration and development of Australian energy resources. </PARA>
<PARA> Government policy on naturally occurring LPG is to link the wholesale price of this gas to the price of Australian crude oil. The wholesale price of this gas increases by the same percentage as any increase in the price of that crude oil. However, there is one overriding qualification. If world price trends result in the export value of LPG becoming lower than the domestic price then a price based on the export value will become the basic price for domestic purposes. This policy is designed to encourage use of LPG as an alternative fuel, thus reducing Australia's dependence on imported crude oil. The rate of excise duty on naturally occurring LPG is set at 60 per cent of the average wholesale price for both domestic and export markets in excess of $147 per tonne. Because of a decrease in export values over the six-month period ending on 30 November 1980 the rate of excise duty was reduced by $6.81 a kilolitre from 1 January 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> Excise Tariff Proposals No. 2 (1981) were also moved in the other place on 3 March 1981. They created a new excise tariff item for mixtures of fuel ethanol and petrol. This new item provides the administrative basis for the excise treatment of ethanol-petrol mixtures as a transport fuel in its own right. Previously, the components of such mixtures had to be separately entered for excise tariff purposes. It is Government policy that the ethanol component of such mixtures be duty free. This has the objective of also encouraging the production and use of this product as an alternative fuel. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak briefly in support of the Pig Slaughter Levy Amendment Bill 1981. The situation in relation to pig meat is that production exceeds consumption and there appears to be a degree of build-up in stocks. I am also concerned about the plight of the smaller pig producer in Australia who is faced with increasing pressure on account of increases in the price of wheat and diminishing returns for his product. Certainly people who have spent high capital sums on piggeries are facing a major problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other major problem that they are facing is that on the mainland we have seen the establishment of very large piggeries which are financed largely by transnational companies. Many of our local producers are concerned that these transnational companies can deliberately keep prices down for a sufficient period to force many of those small producers out of business with a consequent loss of livelihood. So the small pig producers are faced with the high cost of wheat; and in Tasmania they have difficulties because of a need to rely on limited shipping from the mainland. This adds substantially to their problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The handling of wheat in Tasmania also causes difficulty as the Australian Wheat Board hands over a degree of responsibility to the Tasmanian Grain Elevators Board. Many of the producers in the northern part of the State are required to provide security if they want supplies quickly. The normal procedure is that they send their cheque to Hobart and an order is sent out; one copy goes to the Grain Elevators Board and another to the producer. It is only on the production of that document from Hobart that producers can pick up wheat. This means producers have to have substantial storage of wheat supplies which adds considerably to their costs of stockholding and therefore their investment in stock is considerably higher than it should be. </PARA>
<PARA> Another problem that producers face is the fact that the price of the meatmeal does tend to vary quite considerably. It is very difficult for producers to chart movements in the price of meatmeal. The producers feel that to some extent the problem has been exacerbated by the demand situation in Japan which is difficult to predict. Japan's entry into the market appears to follow a pattern. If Japan is short of fish protein from Peru the Japanese will suddenly come into the Australian market to seek supplies. This is a further difficulty that the producers are faced with at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA> The producers also feel that in relation to the need to promote their products further they are in a catch-22 situation. The authorities say 'you must advertise to sell your product' but if we look at the statistics we find that basically consumption of pig meat a head has varied somewhat over the years. For example, in 1974-75 the apparent consumption of pig meat a head was 5.1 kilograms. In 1979-80 it was 4.9 kilograms, which admittedly was a substantial rise on the consumption figure for 1978-79. The same sorts of advisers go around to the poultry producers and say: 'To sell your product you must produce more poultry'. Who really is benefiting? Many of the smaller producers believe it is merely the advertising people who are the main recipients in this sort of situation. The producers believe that they are in a catch-22 situation because they cannot afford not to advertise and to take the risk. Some of them believe they have to go along with the advice they receive. There is another problem facing the producers in that if they promote their product there is the problem of not being able to supply the quantity promoted. </PARA>
<PARA> I leave it at that to indicate the problems facing the small producers, particularly in a small State such as Tasmania, at the present time. These problems include the low prices they are getting for their product, the high costs of production and the entry of transnationals with vast piggeries on the mainland where they can sell large quantities to supermarkets and probably are able to buy at a better price. I would like to take this opportunity of thanking Senator Chipp who spoke on the previous Bill-</PARA>

<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Pig Slaughter Levy Act 1971 to raise the maximum permissible rate of levy for promotion purposes from 20c to $1 per pig. The amendment relates only to the maximum rate of levy, not to the operative rate of levy paid by producers which is set by regulation. A levy has been paid by pig producers since 1975 to provide funds for the promotion of pig meat. Promotion is funded entirely by the industry, and expenditure has been increasing because of expanding activities at wholesale, retail and consumer levels and because of rising media costs. The request for an increase in the maximum rate of levy has been made by the national body of the pig industry, the Australian Commercial Pig Producers Federation. The Federation has sought the amendment as increases in the operative rate have taken the levy to 20c, which is the maximum currently permitted under the Act. Without this amendment there is no scope to raise the levy further and expand promotion expenditure in the future. Any subsequent increase to the operative rate requires a recommendation from the Pig Meat Promotion Committee to the Minister. The Committee consults with the industry before making its recommendation to the Minister for Primary Industry. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations has been conducting an inquiry into matters related to the Australian Dairy Corporation and Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd. This inquiry is in pursuance of the Committee's reference from the Senate:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The continuing oversight of the financial and administrative affairs or undertakings of Commonwealth statutory authorities, and other bodies which the Commonwealth owns or controls wholly or substantially, and of the appropriateness and significance of their practice in accounting to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>In the course of the inquiry evidence was given, on oath, relating to certain trading arrangements in large quantities of skim milk powder and suggesting that these arrangements were in breach of Australia's obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Relevant to this were questions relating to the knowledge and actions of the Government at various stages of these arrangements. Evidence was given, on oath, as to the meetings between the then chairman of the Australian Dairy Corporation and the then Minister for Primary Industry, the Right Honourable Ian Sinclair. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee decided to write to the former Minister, now the Minister for Communications, inviting him to put in writing his recollection of the relevant events. The Minister's reply was, in certain important respects, in direct conflict with that of the former chairman. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also decided to ask the responsible officer of the Department of Primary Industry questions in relation to this matter. The evidence, given on oath, was somewhat equivocal. The Committee found itself confronted with a dilemma in relation to this evidence-part of which was on oath and a part of which was not. It was decided that in fairness we would write to the Minister inviting him to provide his evidence in the form of a statutory declaration. Had this course been followed it would have meant that all the evidence then had the same basic evidentiary value. </PARA>
<PARA> At no stage did the Committee seek to have the Minister appear before the Committee, although we would have been happy to arrange this had the Minister sought the opportunity to make a direct denial on oath. Our letter to the Minister stated that we were inviting him to place his evidence in the form of a statutory declaration 'in the interests of justice'. The Minister declined to accept the invitation but rather chose to take the alternative course of making, by way of personal explanation, a formal statement to the House of Representatives. This statement said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Sydney Morning Herald of 4 May made the following comment:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Ian Sinclair is refusing to put on oath his denial that he knew Australia continued to breach an international trade agreement by selling cheap milk powder. </PARA>
<PARA> On 27 February 1981 I received a letter from Senator Peter Rae, Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations, in which he set down particulars of some evidence received by that Committee and asked for my comments on it. I responded to that letter on 16 March and then on 22 April 1981. I further responded in the following way:</PARA>
<PARA> Dear Senator Rae,</PARA>
<PARA> The letter under your hand as Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations dated 25 March 1981, has been received. </PARA>
<PARA> My response to your earlier correspondence of 16 March 1981, was written as a Minister in accordance with the several Oaths taken relating to that office. </PARA>
<PARA> My comments were based on my own recollection and supported by Departmental records and my Ministerial diaries. </PARA>
<PARA> In my letter of 16 March 1981 I set down in considerable detail my response to Senator Rae's letter which was dated 27 February 1981. As my letter stated, the detail was in accordance with my own recollection and was written as a Minister of the Crown. I have now received a further letter from Senator Rae dated 6 May 1981 in which he comments, inter alia:</PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, we are left with the dilemma that sworn evidence was given to the Committee which is contradicted only by an unsworn letter from you. </PARA>
<PARA> In your letter dated 22 April 1981 you stated the written evidence you gave to the Committee by letter dated 16 March 1981 was given as a 'Minister in accordance with the several Oaths taken relating to that office'. </PARA>
<PARA> From our examination of the oaths taken by Ministers we are unable to see any declaration that would place written evidence given by a Minister on the same basis as sworn evidence. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not believe it appropriate that a Member of this House should appear and give sworn evidence before a committee of the other House. Therefore, I make this statement with respect to the evidence that I have tendered to that Committee in the Parliament and, of course, in accordance with my responsibilities to this Parliament. I believe that is the correct and proper form by which I can respond to the honourable senator. I assert to that honourable gentleman and to the members of the Senate Committee that I believe the evidence given to them is totally correct and has the substance of my being a Minister and giving it in this place. I do not believe there is any reason for a statutory declaration to be given to confirm formal correspondence entered into by me as a Minister in this place. </PARA>
<PARA>That statement, though not on oath, was made by a Minister to his House of Parliament. However, the statement was not in relation to his present ministerial responsibility for which he is accountable to the Parliament. Reference was made by the Minister to his oaths as a Minister and member of the Executive Council. Examination of those oaths shows that they do not bear in any way on the matter of the obligation to make truthful statements; nor do they provide any sanction for breach. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Committee recognises that there is a long-standing convention relating to ministerial responsibility to the Parliament. The Minister made a clear and unequivocal statement to the House of Representatives confirming his belief in the statements made in his letter. There is no doubt that the House of Representatives can treat as a contempt a false statement made to it by a Minister in relation to his area of ministerial responsibility. The extent to which the convention extends beyond that is unclear to us. The Committee is now in the position where it must deliberate on what conclusions it draws in its report on the matters in dispute. It is up to the Committee to compare the evidentiary value of the conflicting points and to make findings accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned earlier the uncertain position in regard to the responsibility of a Minister to the Parliament. So far as the Committee is able to ascertain, there is no clear definition of what this responsibility entails and of what the precise relationship is between the Parliament, a parliamentary committee and the Executive. The Committee does not intend to pursue this matter in the context of its inquiry into the Australian Dairy Corporation on which I have made this statement today. However, the Committee considers the problem so important to the whole role of the Parliament, the Executive and the committee system, including joint and statutory committees, that we should draw this to the attention of the Senate. We have also decided to commission a legal opinion on the matter from a suitable senior counsel and will report separately to the Senate at a later stage. I thank the Senate for the opportunity to make this statement on behalf of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Senator Rae has covered the relevant points fairly comprehensively. Although I am not a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations, I was present at most of the Committee's public hearings. I must endorse the general comments that Senator Rae made about the one retired officer and the one serving officer of the Department of Primary Industry who appeared before the Committee. I think it would be fair to say that Mr O'Bryan's evidence was extremely vague and that the second officer prevaricated in replying to a number of direct questions. This, of course, left the Committee with the problem that Senator Rae has outlined, namely, that evidence had been given on oath by the former Chairman of the Australian Dairy Corporation and the Minister reponsible at the time had declined an invitation to give evidence of equal status, claiming, in the first instance, that his oath of ministerial and Executive Council office pre-empted the need for any other oaths, which, as Senator Rae has said and as the Committee concluded, is not correct in that the Executive Council and ministerial oath of Office refers to diligence and secrecy only. There is no mention of guarantees to tell the truth; nor, of course, is there any penal sanction for failure to do so, as there is with a statutory declaration or with evidence given on oath. In the second instance, the Minister responsible at the time claimed that it was not appropriate for a Minister to appear before a Senate committee in this way. This leads me, Mr President, to the point to which I wish to draw your attention in particular, and that is the question which I asked yesterday and in which I essentially asked three things. I asked whether you agreed with the statement in the fifth edition of the Odgers's Australian Senate Practice which says that the Executive Government enjoys no privilege which puts it above Parliament. I then referred you to Standing Order 360 of the House of Representatives. Finally, I asked:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Do you agree that a Minister should or can refuse to appear? If so, on what grounds?</PARA>
<PARA>With respect, Mr President, your reply dealt with only the first two of those questions. You said that you did agree with Odgers but that you did not believe it was appropriate for you to interpret the Standing Orders of the House of Representatives. Your reply did not touch upon the final question which I asked yesterday, which was:</PARA>
<PARA> Do you agree that a Minister should or can refuse to appear?</PARA>
<PARA>That is, before a Senate committee-</PARA>
<PARA> If so, on what grounds?</PARA>
<PARA>I certainly would appreciate it, Mr President, if you could see fit at some time in the future to put on the record your response to those questions. I note Senator Rae's comment that the Committee has sought a legal opinion on the problem raised by Mr Sinclair's refusal to appear before the Senate Committee and I agree with the Committee's action in so doing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Senator Rae's statement on this matter was a carefully worded one and I simply indicate that it does represent the views of all members of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations. The position reached by the Committee was essentially a bipartisan one reached on the basis of discussion and consensus. There is no question of any difference of opinion between members of the Committee as to the proper course now to be followed. I should like to summarise briefly where we are at as a result of the Committee's deliberations and Senator Rae's statement tonight. The position is simply this: The statement of the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) to the House of Representatives is regarded by Committee members as a serious one insofar as it represents an explicit commitment by the Minister to the truth of the proposition he was asserting in the letter given previously to the Committee. It is regarded as so serious indeed, as Senator Rae has indicated, that it would in fact be a contempt of the House were that to amount to a deliberate misleading of the House-indeed, contrary to what my colleague Senator Walsh has said, a contempt punishable by a term of imprisonment by direction of the House should the House be so minded to apply it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Walsh" NAMEID="TJ4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I referred to the oath of office.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed, I understand the difference Senator Walsh is making, to the extent that it is a question of the oath of office bearing upon it. That does not bear upon it. To the extent that it is a solemn and deliberate statement being made to the House, for that statement to be an untruth would amount to a contempt punishable as a matter of parliamentary common law by a term of imprisonment, among other things, at the pleasure of the House. That is the first point I wish to make. The Committee regarded the undertaking or the statement made by the Minister as a very serious one and, as such, having considerable evidentiary weight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second point made by the Committee, and I think by Senator Rae in his comments tonight, was that it now remains for the Committee's deliberation and determination as to what respective weight is now to be given, on the one hand, to Mr Webster's statement on oath and, on the other hand, to Mr Sinclair's statement made in a solemn and deliberative fashion to the House of Representatives. It is simply not possible nor would it be in any way proper to speculate as to the outcome of the Committee's deliberations on this matter and as to whether there will be an outcome. I simply make the point, in confirmation of what Senator Rae has said, that this is a matter which the Committee will now have to consider further. </PARA>
<PARA> The third point that was made by Senator Rae-I think it bears repetition, to make it absolutely clear that this position was reached on a bipartisan basis by the Committee as a whole-was that the Committee does not propose to pursue the question of Mr Sinclair's giving evidence to the Committee through the possible existing forms and procedures in legal avenues open to it in respect of this matter. However, the Committee does take the view that the issues raised by this matter are so serious, concerning as they do the whole question of the relationship between the two Houses and in particular the relationship between the Executive arm of government and ourselves as legislators, that they do bear very close and careful consideration. It is in that context that the Committee does propose to seek a formal legal opinion as to the strictly legal matters involved in this kind of case-not this case but this kind of case-in order to consider further whether there might be some clarification for the future when questions like this arise. I simply repeat that the Committee's response on this matter-it is a very difficult and sensitive matter-is one that has been the product of unanimous agreement within the Committee and not in any way the product of partisan actions from either side.</PARA>

<PARA> Honourable senators may recall that, on Thursday, 30 April 1981, I made a statement to the Senate in which I indicated that the Committee would be asking the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) to respond urgently to certain matters to be put to him. Under its principle (D), the Committee also sought the views of the ACT House of Assembly and the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory, in accordance with the Committee's intention expressed in its sixty-fourth report. I would like to thank the Minister, the Joint Committee and the House of Assembly, for responding so promptly. I mention here that both the Joint Committee and the House of Assembly in their responses opined that ordinances of this nature should be considered by the Assembly before they are made. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also sought advice on the consequences for accused persons of the disallowance of an ordinance in force at the time prosecutions are launched. The advice is that disallowance would not, in law, have the effect of halting such prosecutions. The Committee considered substantial private representations and material relating to the introduction of a code covering the law relating to parades, processions and assemblies generally, in the Australian Capital Territory. Following discussions which I had with the Minister for the Capital Territory, the Committee considered at this morning's meeting a letter from the Minister giving certain assurances in relation to the Ordinance. I seek leave to have the Minister's letter incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Senator Lewis,</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to my letter to you dated 6 May 1981, your response dated 11 May 1981 and our subsequent discussion with reference to the Traffic (Amendment) Ordinance 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> I confirm my opinion that it is desirable that there should be a Code covering the law relating to parades, processions and assemblies, generally, in the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> In support, attention is drawn to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ratified by Australia on 13 August 1980, Article 21 of which expressly refers to the recognition of the right of peaceful assembly. </PARA>
<PARA> You will appreciate that due to the extreme urgency of the situation, the Traffic (Amendment) Ordinance 1981, which your Committee has under consideration, relates specifically to Anzac Day only. </PARA>
<PARA> I am more than happy to give your Committee an undertaking that it is my intention to give instructions for the preparation of a general Ordinance, in effect setting out a Code covering the law relating to parades, processions and assemblies, generally, in the Australian Capital Territory. This will be done as expeditiously as possible, and I further indicate that it is my intention to refer the proposed Ordinance to the House of Assembly and also to your Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I have carefully noted suggestions as to possible amendments of the form of words used in the Traffic (Amendment) Ordinance 1981. For my own part I would have no objection whatsoever to these suggestions receiving every consideration by the Parliamentary draftsman. In this regard, of course, you will appreciate that the ultimate responsibility for drafting the proposed Ordinance rests, not with my Department, but with the Attorney-General's Department. </PARA>
<PARA> For my own part, as I mentioned to you, I can see no objection, in the general Ordinance, to a substitution of the words 'causes a disturbance at' for the word 'disturbs' which presently appears in Section 23A (3) (a) and (b) in the Traffic (Amendment) Ordinance 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed general Ordinance would, upon coming into effect, replace the specific Ordinance which relates solely to Anzac Day. </PARA>
<PARA> As to any other suggested amendments, and the specific wording of Section 23A (3) (c), as I told you, I unequivocally reserve my position. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I confirm that pending the making of the proposed general Ordinance, by His Excellency the Governor-General, the Traffic (Amendment) Ordinance 1981 will continue to operate with full force and effect. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to place on record my appreciation of the spirit of co-operation which has prevailed during your deliberations and our discussions on this important matter. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>In speaking to this motion I make it very clear to Senator Chipp that in fact Senator Lewis expressed to the chamber the view of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. It is based on a very clear undertaking by the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) that the Anzac Day ordinance, if I may refer to it by that short title, will not be operative on Anzac Day 1982. The reason is that the Traffic (Amendment) Ordinance, amongst all other laws dealing with the right of assembly in the Australian Capital Territory, will be reviewed and recast in the production of a new general ordinance dealing with the rights of assembly in the Austraian Capital Territory. In a second letter which was received from the Minister at 11 a.m. today he has given an undertaking that that new general ordinance will be in place by Anzac Day 1982. Therefore, this very specific ordinance will be withdrawn, swallowed up and cast aside in the production of a new general ordinance. So we are proceeding on the very clear undertaking by the Minister that the specific ordinance, the subject to the Committee's consideration, will not be operative on Anzac Day 1982. Of course, it cannot be operative at any time before that because it is specifically related to Anzac Days. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Even if the Senate were to disallow the Ordinance tonight, the prosecutions could continue. There is no legal impediment to the continuation of those prosecutions even if the Senate disallows the Ordinance. I will put a further argument very briefly in a moment that whilst there is no legal impediment to the continuance of those prosecutions, given the circumstances of the settlement which was reached, there is a political impediment which should be acknowledged by the Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A further consideration was the fact that the recasting will be taken under the guiding criteria of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. That is something which at least will give us some touchstone in the consideration of this matter. The consideration of the matter will occur in an unprecedented way. The Minister has undertaken that the consideration of his draft general ordinance will be put not only to the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly for its advice but also to the Regulations and Ordinances Committee in an unprecedented way to enable it to have some say in the creation of the new ordinance. But, of course, that examination of the ordinance will in no way impair the integrity of the Committee or the Senate in reviewing the ordinance as finally passed into law before Anzac Day 1982. Then we will be able once again to disallow any provision within it which is obnoxious to the civil liberties of people within the Australian Capital Territory. It is simply on that basis that the Committee found the settlement acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the point raised by Senator Chipp, namely, that there is no legal impediment to the prosecutions going ahead, whether or not the Senate should disallow the ordinance. I believe that nevertheless there is a very real political impediment to the prosecutions going ahead in light of the Minister's expressed desire that the totality of laws relating to peaceful assembly in the Australian Capital Territory, including of course the very ordinance which has been the subject of our concern and the initiating force in the recasting of all these laws, should be recast. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I make a plea for an acknowledgment that the people concerned in the proceedings may become subject to conviction on the basis of a law which will be swallowed up by the creation of a general ordinance based more clearly on internationally recognised principles and principles which are seen by the Regulations and Ordinances Committee to be apt. On that basis, having explained the course of deliberations within the Committee, I leave the matter but make a plea that, since the law is to be recast, discretion be exercised so that the prosecutions do not proceed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the motion to take note of the paper I generally would agree with what has been said both by the Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, Senator Lewis, and by Senator Tate. I believe that what is proposed by the determinations of the Committee and of the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) is on the whole a sound way of resolving this matter. There has been a fair amount of public controversy about an Australian Capital Territory ordinance which came into effect very shortly before Anzac Day. There has been a considerable amount of dispute as to what were the facts and what was the situation that occurred in Canberra on that day. I certainly do not intend to advance into that area because those are matters which presently are before courts and are not matters which I think we should analyse. I do not think I am in a position to know the precise facts concerning what took place on that day. That is probably not the area with which we are concerned at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is a pity that we have tackled only a very small part of that. The evidence and the advice which the Committee has received is to the effect that even in the event of disallowance of the ordinance prosecution of an offence committed on Anzac Day can proceed.

In other words, there should be a law which relates generally to assemblies. I remind members of the Senate that we recently agreed to ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. That came into force, so far as we are concerned, on 13 November 1980, having been ratified on 13 August 1980. Article 21 of that Covenant provides:</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YL7">Senator MISSEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He has made a law in regard to peaceful assembly in a specific instance. It is a law and ordinance which relates to Anzac Day only. I believe it is highly undesirable to make laws with respect to a particular occasion. We should have a law which covers most cases of assembly. There is really no right of public assembly in the Australian Capital Territory. In the very area in which we have control we have not an appropriate law with regard to assembly. In some States, for instance the State of South Australia, we have a much better law because it provides for notification of the desire to have an assembly. Then, if the police object, one can have a court hearing before the event as to whether it is proper in the circumstances that the assembly take place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In New South Wales there is a civil law which has many desirable features. I hope that the code which the Minister brings down will be one which will provide quite reasonably that the parties' interests shall be determined beforehand. If there is to be an assembly or if they want to join an assembly, and there is objection, they can go before a court and argue whether it is reasonable. Then we will not have a situation in which people will do something which will interrupt an assembly and in which everything is done by stealth. In fact, the matter will be determined beforehand. </PARA>
<PARA> Under Article 40 of the Covenant that we have now ratified, we have an obligation within one year to report on the steps that we have taken to carry out the terms of the Covenant in Australia. It will be very useful if we can show that in the Australian Capital Territory, where we have control, we have set an example in regard to rights of assembly whereby those terms are properly carried out. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer honourable senators to an article written by Robin Handley in the latest issue of the Legal Service Bulletin entitled 'Assembly Laws and the Civil Rights Covenant'. The burden of that whole article, which was written before this matter arose in the Australian Capital Territory, was that we ought to be undertaking an assembly law which would be generally applicable to all cases of assembly in the Territory. Therefore, I see this whole incident as providing an opportunity to improve the state of law and to set out a code for the Australian Capital Territory which I hope would be usefully followed in a number of States of the Commonwealth-I believe I need not name them-in compliance with the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, I believe the Minister has acted wisely in regard to the proposals that he has made to the Committee. He has given an undertaking that before next Anzac Day we will have subsumed that particular law and will have a code in respect of assembly and procession in this Territory. I believe the indications that have been given in the Minister's decision are wise and that we should support them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a few remarks on the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances which was brought down tonight by its Chairman, Senator Lewis. I must say at the outset that I acknowledge the care and attention that the Committee has given to the examination of the Traffic (Amendment) Ordinance introduced by the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) with regard to the Anzac Day ceremony, but I must say also that I am in no way satisfied by the conclusions that the Committee has reached. I will not traverse the ground that I traversed when I raised my objections to the Ordinance in this place on a previous occasion. I will simply confine my remarks to the report of the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> From that report I infer certain things: Firstly, the Ordinance did offend the Committee, in that it did trespass unduly on personal liberties and civil rights. Secondly, the Minister was at fault in failing to consult the House of Assembly, and that that failure to consult was directly contrary to the intention expressed by the Regulations and Ordinances Committee in its sixty-fourth report. I point out to Senator Missen that I infer that, by the undertaking the Minister has now made to enter upon consultation exercises in preparing the ordinance which he has foreshadowed, he has implied that that is what he ought to have done in the first place with the Ordinance before us. So in that respect also the Ordinance is unsatisfactory. There was no consultation with the locally elected body and it is the view of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee that there ought to be such consultation. Thirdly, the Regulations and Ordinances Committee concludes that the prosecutions will continue, despite the fact that they have been made under an ordinance which, firstly, fails properly to protect civil liberties and, secondly, was made without consultation with the local assembly. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say at this stage, speaking now as a senator for the Australian Capital Territory, that I find it entirely unsatisfactory that a large number, some 57 or so, of my constituents, are currently charged with a criminal offence under an ordinance which the Senate Regulations and Ordinances Committee itself admits was unsatisfactory on two cardinal points. Therefore, it is my view that the Ordinance should not be endorsed. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us examine the deal that the Minister has offered the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. I have examined the correspondence between the Minister and the Committee. The Minister has stated that he will bring in a new ordinance which will deal with the entire matter of assemblies and demonstrations and the public's right to enjoy peaceful assembly in accordance with an international convention which has been described in some detail this evening by Senator Missen. That is all very well. I await the introduction of that ordinance with interest. I am gratified to note that the Minister has given the following undertakings in respect of that ordinance: That he will consult the locally elected body, the House of Assembly; that he will in fact seek the views of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee; that he will go through proper consultative procedures when he brings in the ordinance; and that he will have regard to an international convention. </PARA>
<PARA> That is all very satisfactory as far as it goes, but it is for the future. It is an undertaking that the Minister has given with regard to bringing down an ordinance in the future. What he says with regard to the present Ordinance which, on the admission of the Committee is so unsatisfactory, is that that Ordinance must stay in effect until the new ordinance is ready. The Committee states that that will be before next Anzac Day so it is acceptable, but I do not see how the Minister can actually guarantee that the ordinance will be--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GD5">Senator RYAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;By interjection, Senator Primmer has raised one problem with that undertaking-that the Minister may not be the responsible Minister on Anzac Day next year-but there are other reservations that one could raise. By committing himself to allowing the proposed new ordinance to go through consultation procedures, he is committing himself to a course in relation to which he cannot make guarantees. The ordinance that he drafts may be unacceptable to the House of Assembly or to the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. What will he do in that case? Will he insist on the ordinance despite its being unsuitable and, therefore, contradict his newly-acquired sense of consultation and propriety, or will he maintain that consultation until a satisfactory ordinance is brought down well beyond the date of the next Anzac Day procession? It is just not satisfactory to say: 'We will keep this acknowledged bad ordinance on the books until we have the new ordinance'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seems to me that if the ordinance is unsatisfactory, as it clearly is, there is no case for its being endorsed by the Senate. I do not believe there is a case for an ordinance which is unsatisfactory in the ways I have enumerated, and which the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances has admitted is unsatisfactory, being allowed to go unchallenged by the Senate. I remind honourable senators that we have a very special responsibility with regard to the Australian Capital Territory. In the Australian Capital Territory there is no legally elected body with the power to make laws. Therefore, laws are made by way of delegated legislation, the power being delegated by this Parliament. Senator Cavanagh, who is something of an expert on these matters, explained to us on a previous occasion the complexities and difficulties that arise with regard to delegated legislation. When it comes to laws which create criminal offences under which my constituents can be charged, fined and gaoled, the Senate has the final say. Therefore, when we have such an unsatisfactory ordinance I think it is quite inappropriate that it should go unchallenged by the Senate even if the Regulations and Ordinances Committee has reached agreement with the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly a compromise has been reached between the Regulations and Ordinances Committee and the Minister, but I am not at all satisfied with that. It seems to me that the Minister, Mr Hodgman, is now trying to have it both ways. He introduced an ordinance which offended many people for many reasons in order to please a certain sector of the community. If we allow this matter to end here tonight without further action, we will be able to go to the people who were agitating for the ordinance, the Returned Services League, and say: 'The ordinance will stay on the books. There was nothing wrong with it. It was perfectly all right and there will be another one to take its place'. Then he can go to the people who are concerned about civil liberty issues and who do not believe 60 of my constituents ought to be charged with offences created by an ordinance of this kind and say: 'I have taken note of all your civil liberties arguments and I am going to do something about it'. The Minister is trying to have it both ways and I do not think that is proper or just. I do not think the Senate should acquiesce in this. </PARA>
<PARA> At this stage I would like to register my acknowledgment of the work that has been done by the Committee but my dissatisfaction with its final conclusion. I foreshadow my wish to take further action in respect of this ordinance, but I wish to take that further action after consulting with other honourable senators in this plce, with my colleagues, with the Australian Democrats and with Liberal and National Country Party senators who may feel, as I do, that the situation has not been satisfactorily resolved. Of course, I want to consult also the people who are affected by all this-my constituents. I am dissatisfied with the conclusions of the Committee and, after consultation, I will seek to take further action in respect of this unsatisfactory ordinance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Deputy Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances I want to say a few words about this matter as there is some doubt as to whether my attitude on one question seems to be the reverse of my attitude on this question. The first thing to remember on this question is that it is the right of any honourable senator to move to disallow a regulation. That is not the prerogative of the Committee alone. I think this regulation offends against the civil rights of the individual. I think any law which attracts breaches by a large number of normally law-abiding citizens is not a good law. I think a law which creates such large scale breaches is so important that it should be an Act of parliament rather than a regulation. But this question does not concern the Regulations and Ordinance Committee deciding anything. What Senator Ryan said is correct-the Parliament gives a Minister the power to make a valid law.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When the report from the Commonwealth Conference of Delegated Legislation Committees was brought down here I mentioned that and mentioned looking at approval of regulations and not at their disallowance. The system I mentioned would make any regulation ineffective until such time as the Parliament had had an opportunity to look at it. As I said when discussing this matter on the night on which that report was brought down, the difficulty with that is that an urgent regulation could not be brought into operation when the Parliament was in recess. During the whole time that I have been a member of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee the Committee, whenever possible, has sought to obtain remedial action in respect of an offensive regulation, rather than to move for disallowance. On numerous occasions motions for disallowance before the Parliament have been withdrawn on a Minister's assurance that he would alter the regulation. On this occasion we are faced with a regulation which was apparently properly made and enforced because of our neglect in the past to make it impossible to enforce such a regulation until the Parliament had perused it by giving power to a Minister to make a law. </PARA>
<PARA> Because the members of the Committee are not inhuman and are concerned that when someone offends against such a law a penalty should be imposed, we considered the effect that disallowance would have on future prosecutions. There was some disagreement. The Committee sought advice from its own legal counsel. As a result of that advice the Committee formed the opinion that whether or not the Senate moves for disallowance would have no effect on the court's decision. The regulation was law when the offences occurred, even if we subsequently moved to disallow it. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Evans's concern is that the regulation should be withdrawn. I agree with that. The regulation is wrong. The Committee is of the opinion that there should not be a special law for Anzac Day if there is not one for, say, a Labor Day procession. Why should there be particular laws for particular occasions? If there is a need for such a law, consideration should be given to placing a special provision in the law. What the Minister wrote to the Committee was written at the suggestion of the Committee. It was not the Minister's formula. The Committee asked how we could get over this problem. The Committee suggested that there should be one law covering all demonstrations and he said: 'What if this one exists until the next one comes in? It will be 12 months before the regulation would have another application'. The Committee's attitude was that the Minister would bring in another regulation before next Anzac Day and that those who have been prosecuted under this regulation, if the prosecutions continue, will have to submit to trial. </PARA>
<PARA> Many legal questions can be argued. We can consider whether the law was properly enforceable at the time and whether there was actually any breach of law. But that is a question for the courts. We know that no one else can be affected until such time as a new ordinance is brought in. We have looked at the Ordinance to see whether it complies with our regulations. The question has arisen as to whether the Ordinance is in breach of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. I consider that it is. It is our responsibility to point that out, and we are doing so. The Parliament has to have the power to do so. If we are firmly of the belief that the law is in contravention of an international obligation and if the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) has discovered that that is so or agrees with what I have said, he surely cannot proceed with the prosecutions when the occasion arises. I hope that he will not do so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a former member of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances I do not, for a moment, underestimate the difficulty or sensitivity of the task confronting that Committee in dealing with matters of this kind and in particular a matter such as this which is capable of arousing great passions in different sections of the community. At the same time, it was with profound regret that I heard the Committee's apparently unanimous report in this chamber tonight. Let me explain why. Everyone seems to agree that the Traffic (Amendment) Ordinance 1981 is objectionable, that it unduly trespasses on the rights and liberties of the subject and that, as it presently stands, it offends even the most literal and wide reaching reading of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. That seems unquestionably to be the view of the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman), at least to the extent to which he has responded to the representations, of the Committee. It is undoubtedly the view of the Committee itself. It seems to be the view of Senator Lewis and other members of the Committee who have spoken tonight. Certainly it is the view of myself and others on this side of the chamber who have spoken. Nobody has come out of the woodwork to defend this Ordinance, for the reason that it is indefensible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Why is the Ordinance indefensible? Let us remind ourselves of some of its terms. Of course, it might be ligitimate to have something on the books prohibiting disruption, physical disturbance, violence and offensive demonstrations on an occasion as solemn and dignified as Anzac Day. Almost a dozen provisions are on the statute books already to deal with that kind of conduct. What the 60 women nearly overwhelmingly were charged with was not an offence against that sort of provision in the Ordinance. They were not charged with disruptive behaviour, violent behaviour or anything that could be described as offensive behaviour according to the normally understood standards and conventions that apply in the common law and the statute law. They were charged with offending against the provisions of the Ordinance. </PARA>
<PARA> Let the Committee members-Senator Missen, Senator Lewis and others who have spoken-be reminded of the terms of this Ordinance. A person can be convicted under this Ordinance for refusing to obey the direction of a police officer which is based on the belief of that police officer as to the likelihood of the person committing the following offence, namely, engaging in conduct which is likely to cause offence or insult to persons taking part in such a parade or ceremony. How many instances removed from objective reality is that? How many subjective opinions are compounded one upon the other? We are talking about the likelihood of the possibility of a person engaging in a form of conduct which is, not likely to physically disrupt the demonstration, but likely to give offence or insult to someone participating in the parade. I find this contemptible. The provision is far reaching, over-broad and impossibly vague. It goes beyond anything that exists in the law, and these women have been charged under that provision. Overwhelmingly, they were peaceably wanting to participate in the Anzac Day ceremonies to make a dignified point about women being raped in war. They wanted to do so in a way which, however inoffensive physically it may have been, was bound to offend the insensitivities of some shellback conservatives who took a different view about what Anzac Day was about. That is the kind of offence we are talking about. That is what is offensive about this Ordinance. Let us remember that in everything we say. It appears that the Minister has accepted this fact. The Committee and everyone else seem to accept that the law is over-broad, vague and offensive in this way. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the matter with the proposal that has been put forward by the Committee? Probably, nothing is the matter with it if we look at it on the face of the law. An undertaking has been given to get rid of these offensive provisions and to look at the whole context of the street offence law by the time of the next Anzac Day. So far, so good. If nobody had been prosecuted under the existing law I, for one, would say: 'Well and good; that is a reasonable compromise'. The reality is that 64 people are presently awaiting prosecution under the operation of this law. What has been brought forward by the Committee may be a satisfactory solution for everyone else, but it is not a satisfactory solution for any of the people who are awaiting prosecution and are overwhelmingly likely to be convicted on the literal text of the law as it stands at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hodgman has tonight put on record his reaction to Senator Tate's suggestion, made earlier in the debate, that maybe the Executive should have a second look at these prosecutions, that maybe the Executive should withdraw them in the interests of fairness and justice all round. Do honourable senators know Mr Hodgman's reaction that he put on record tonight? I was informed a few minutes ago that Mr Hodgman has gone on record as saying that Senator Tate and anyone else who suggests that the prosecutions ought to be withdrawn by the Executive because of the offensiveness of this legislation are kidding themselves. Mr Hodgman says that he will never interfere with the due process of the law. Mr Hodgman has put on record also tonight, I understand, his view on the legitimacy of the law as it stands. Whatever he might have sought to convey to the Committee in the language of his letter, he apparently has also gone on record tonight-I was informed of this a few minutes ago-as saying the following: 'I could not tolerate a situation where incompatible groups would use Anzac Day to push their own particular point of view. Nothing has changed'. That is the attitude of this Minister to this legislation. It shows that he will say one thing to the Committee to buy a particular package which gets him off the hook and to remove embarrassment from himself and then smugly turn around after the event and say the contrary. This indicates, specifically, that he is not prepared to exercise the kind of Executive discretion unequivocally open to him at the moment to arrange for the prosecutions to be withdrawn. </PARA>
<PARA> Where do we go from here? Some people will say, in response to this sort of situation, that maybe it is no business of the Parliament to comment, that maybe it is no business of the Senate as a whole or any individual senator to express an opinion that maybe in all the circumstances, given the manifest offensiveness of this law, the prosecutions ought to be withdrawn so that we can go back to day one. Maybe someone will say that it is not appropriate for a legislative chamber to do that because the matter is sub judice. Let it be understood that that is nonsense. As the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) will be well aware, prosecution is a matter for the Executive. Prosecutions are laid by the Executive branch of government. Prosecutions can be withdrawn by the Executive branch of government. That is what we are talking about tonight. We are not talking about what the court should or should not do. We are talking about what the Executive should do in relation to the prosecutions. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt in my mind that, given the manifest offensiveness of this law and the manifest injustice of women being prosecuted under the terms of this law, the prosecutions ought to be withdrawn. If they are not withdrawn the Senate should proceed to consider very seriously the question of the disallowance of this Ordinance. I am well aware that technically the disallowance of this Ordinance will not affect the viability of the prosecutions currently pending against these women. Of course that is true as a technical matter of law; but it is equally true, as a matter of real world reality, that if the Ordinance is disallowed by this Parliament before the prosecutions come to fruition those prosecutions will not be proceeded with and no court will feel realistically able to deal with them for this reason. How could a prosecution or any court in the land worth its salt confront the business of convicting and fining someone for an offence against an ordinance which has been determined by this Parliament to be offensive to civil liberties and, as such, demanding to be disallowed? Because of this there is an overwhelming reason in logic or at least in practice for the Ordinance to be disallowed even if the offences technically are not struck off by virtue of that happening. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) No register of restrictive trade practices and agreements was maintained by the Commissioner of Trade Practices. The Commissioner did maintain, however, a register of trade agreements. The register of trade agreements and the records of the Commissioner of Trade Practices concerning complaints and investigations on examinable practices were maintained from 1965 until 1974 and have never been published.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) and (3) Neither.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Both. The information contained in the register of trade agreements and the Commissioner of Trade Practices' complaints and investigations on examinable practices was obtained on a confidential basis from industry. A guarantee that this information would be kept confidential was specifically provided for in the Restrictive Trade Practices Act 1971 and its predecessors.</PARA>
<PARA> Sections 148 and 149 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 also continues the confidentiality for documents acquired under the previous legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> As the information contained within the register of trade agreements, and the information in the Commissioner of Trade Practices records of complaints and investigations on examinable practices, was obtained under a specific legal provision that the information would remain confidential, it would not be appropriate for the Government to now make that information public.</PARA>

<PARA> (2) Are the Committee's claims correct that this system, known as Over Horizon Radar, is generating interference in the HF spectrum and could endanger human life should the interference block out a Mayday call; and if so have approaches been made to the Soviet Union through diplomatic or other channels to relieve this situation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) My Department is aware of the radio interference caused by OHR systems. Fortunately, the interference is much less harmful in Australia than it is in other parts of the world. In fact, very little specific information is available that the transmissions are causing harmful interference to operating radio services in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> The responsible authorities for safety communication in Australia have not observed any circumstances of significant interference on any of the internationally recognised radio distress channels. On the other hand, there has been some observation recently of OHR signals occurring on the Australian safety frequency 27.880 MHz, though the extent has not been serious. However, on the basis of these observations, my Department has initiated communication with the USSR seeking their co-operation in avoiding interference to the 27.880 MHz safety channel.</PARA>
