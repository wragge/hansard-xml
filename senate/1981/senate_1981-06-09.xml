<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the following petition from 1,693 citizens of Australia:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>The Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. That we wish to express our strongest opposition to any deregulation of trading hours in the Australian Capital Territory.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. That if trading hours are deregulated in the Australian Capital Territory, the present restrictions on trading hours in other parts of Australia may be lifted.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Past performances have proven that longer trading hours do not lead to increased sales. However, they do increase costs, because shops have to be staffed for longer periods. To cover these increased costs, retailers are forced to increase prices and reduce staff levels. This means that longer trading hours increase both prices and unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. There is no real consumer demand for longer trading hours in the Australian Capital Territory.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. The deregulation of trading hours would force small retail companies out of business.</PARA>
<PARA> 6. Extended trading hours would gravely disrupt weekend recreation and family life of shop assistants.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, should:</PARA>
<PARA> Stop the deregulation of retail trading hours in the Australian Capital Territory, by disallowing the Ordinance which amends the Trading Hours Ordinance, 1962.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not able to say that any country in the Middle East, including Iraq, has the capacity to build nuclear weapons, but I will follow that up and see whether there is any further information. The Government has been informed that on 7 June Israeli aircraft attacked the Iraqi nuclear research facility close to Baghdad. The Government, of course, can in no way condone the Israeli attack, which is a grave and serious development and which can only exacerbate tensions in a region where tensions are already critically high. The Government regrets military action of this kind, particularly at a time when every effort needs to be made to encourage actions which are designed to reduce tensions in the region. As to the substance of Senator Button's question concerning the capacity of the Iraqis to produce highly enriched uranium as a first step or to develop actual weapons or weapon systems, I have no specific information. I will seek information and let the honourable senator have what comes to hand.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4H4">Senator HAMER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. Is the report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission on the formula for the distribution among the States of tax reimbursement funds expected this week? In view of the obvious fact that if some States are to receive relatively more per capita others will have to receive less, is it realistic to believe that there is any possibility of the Premiers agreeing among themselves on the distribution formula? If agreement among the Premiers is not possible, will the Federal Government accept and implement the recommendations of the Commonwealth Grants Commission as it has invariably done in the 48-year history of the Commission?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My understanding is that the report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission on a review of relativities is to be forwarded to the Commonwealth and State governments in the early future. I believe it will be done this week. It is true, as Senator Hamer indicates, that any review of relativities is likely to create situations in which some States will have recommendations for gains and other States will have recommendations for losses, and that inevitably therefore only those States which have recommendations for gains will be in favour of the report. It is equally true that in the years since 1934, when the Commonwealth Grants Commission was established by a Liberal government of the day, the reports of the Commission have been received and adopted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a very important report. The Premiers and the Commonwealth will put it under study and this will take some little time. I do not imagine that the report will receive other than preliminary discussion at the Premiers Conference which is scheduled for the immediate days ahead. I am unable to predict the outcome of such discussions, but it is true that when one looks to relativities it is inevitable that there will be pluses and minuses. The States themselves should accept that fact. The aim is to provide services in the various States throughout Australia of an average quality of those appertaining in Victoria and New South Wales. This has been the consideration in the past. I think the discussions will take place in the near future between the Commonwealth and the States. It will probably take a considerable time to digest the report itself.</PARA>

Is this the first time ever that the ABC Senior Officers Association, which represents the management of the ABC, has joined the other ABC unions in protest against cuts in government funding of the Commission?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I begin my answer by asserting that neither the independence nor the viability of the ABC is at risk in any way. That is a very important point to make. Neither the independence nor the viability of the ABC is under threat in any way. What we are hearing-I am not saying that it is improper-is special interest pleading and the application of a little pressure. I do not know whether the facts as set out by Senator Chipp are correct-whether people have banded together and whether the newspaper reports are correct. I certainly do not know what the Budget situation of the ABC will be. As I have said on several occasions, that matter is still under negotiation and we do not intend to foreshadow any part of the Federal Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>

Are these two fall-back positions, firstly, that the Government is prepared to leave undisturbed the present discretionary power of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal with respect to public interest but to insert a clause saying that holding two metropolitan licences is not in itself against the public interest; and, secondly, that the Bill could provide for prior approval for all changes of share ownership in licensee companies?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was attracted immediately by Senator Georges's interjection. I observe to the Senate that, once Senator Cavanagh retires, the Senate can no longer be treated to the sight of Senators Cavanagh and Georges fighting round 11 of the turtle farm battle with which Applied Ecology Pty Ltd was concerned some years ago. It is a fact that one of the decisions in the Review of Commonwealth Functions was that Applied Ecology would no longer be funded, and it is intended that that funding should cease. There will be some minor provision for winding down operations, and Applied Ecology has at present been put on a winding down basis or a care and maintenance basis while the winding down takes place. No other Commonwealth or State department of which I am aware will be picking up the funding for Applied Ecology. I am not sure what final decisions eventually will be taken in relation to the two major projects-that is, the emu project at Wiluna and the crocodile project on Cape York, I think, on the Edward River. As I said, I am not quite sure what final decision will be taken, but we are at present investigating what is the appropriate course of action for these projects. I think the short answer to the honourable senator's question is that there will be no alternative source of government funding for Applied Ecology.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Education announced, I think on 4 June, that the Commonwealth wishes to accelerate the development of transition courses in secondary schools and colleges of technical and further education relevant particularly to the needs of low-achieving students. In October 1979, the Commonwealth and the States agreed that concerted action should be taken. The Commonwealth undertook to provide a total of $150m-a very large sum-over five years from 1980 for the transition program and asked the States to match this expenditure from 1982 onwards. Because the States have not been prepared to match the Commonwealth expenditure, the Commonwealth has felt compelled to earmark up to $27m within Commonwealth general recurrent grants to the States for government schools in 1982. If the States increase their expenditure, this will be offset against the amount to be earmarked. There should be no need to increase any form of school fees for this reason, any more than for recent increases in teachers' salaries. The costs to the States of their contribution in 1982 in any event will represent something less than 2 per cent of total expenditure in government secondary schools. The program is a very important one and the results being achieved are very heartening.</PARA></TALK.START>

I ask: What is the situation with a single person, in which case the unemployment benefit is not indexed and goes up only intermittently at the whim of the Government and, on past records, may go for two years or more without being increased?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I ask: In view of the increasingly disastrous effects on the Tasmanian economy of each of the current rounds of maritime union strikes and the enormous damage being done to Tasmanian development and potential generally as a result, can he advise honourable senators whether the Prime Minister has received any request for action, suggestions or expressions of concern about the matter from the Tasmanian Premier or his Minister for Industrial Relations? If so, what suggestions were made or assistance requested? If not, what action does this Government propose taking to overcome the impossible, unacceptable and untenable situation which puts Tasmania at the mercy of those overpaid and underworked maritime unions?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is extremely concerned about the effects of industrial disputes on the Tasmanian economy which is particularly vulnerable to air and sea transport disputes. The recent campaign of rolling strikes by maritime unions is especially harmful, coming so soon after a series of airline strikes, so Tasmania has had a very rough time. As I understand it, the maritime dispute is now back before the Commission. Recent disputes have arisen from the failure of the unions involved to avail themselves of arbitral mechanisms and one can only hope that the due processes will now result in a speedy resolution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I understand it, the Prime Minister has not received a letter from Mr Lowe on the subject of disputes in the maritime industry. It is up to the Tasmanian Government to approach the Australian Council of Trade Unions to seek for the State exemption from industrial action. It is a great hardship upon the Tasmanian people to be subjected to such hostage actions, wherein a handful of people hold a majority of people hostage in order to exact tribute.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would answer the last part of the honourable senator's question by saying that I would have thought that events in the various branches of the Labor Party in New South Wales had been exposing faceless men in very large numbers. As to the first part of his question-although I do not attempt to hit it to leg on this ground, it does not concern my ministerial responsibility-I am not aware of any statement or threat being made by the President of the Liberal Party in Queensland. However, I must say that no one could deliver any such threat because the preselection methods of the Liberal Party throughout Australia are in the hands of committees which vote by secret ballot and it is entirely up to responsible and mature people to vote in that ballot according to their conscience. As Senator John Martyr indicates, he is living proof of that. I am asked by Senator McAuliffe how I reconcile this with my comment that Liberal Party members in this and the other chamber are free agents and act according to conscience. I have noted the phenomenon that the Labor Party urges others to act according to conscience but itself acts according to its Caucus.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for National Development and Energy.

Is it a fact that the Commission will have the power only to make recommendations on this important question and that such proposals will be subject to veto by any one of the parties to the agreement? As the matter of water quantity and quality management transcends State borders and must be regarded as a subject of national consequence and as the establishment of a national water authority to deal with this meets with the tripartisan agreement of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment, can the Minister say whether there are any means, other than by referendum, whereby the management of this vital resource can be placed with the national government?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The whole question of the quantity and quality of water in the River Murray has, as indicated by the number of questions asked in the Senate, been of major importance and will continue to be so. The proposed new River Murray Waters Agreement will enable the River Murray Commission to take account of water quality in its operations and studies. These apply only to the main stem of the river, the tributaries above Albury and the Darling River below the Menindee Lakes. They do not apply to other tributaries. However, it will also be empowered to make representations to the States on all matters which affect the quality of water under its control or supervision subject to unanimous decisions within the River Murray Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact of the matter is that those from the various States and indeed the Commonwealth who have studied this new Agreement believe that it will be a considerable advance in the management of this great resource. Control of the River Murray system could, of course, be placed with the national government if the States were to cede to it the necessary powers. That, in itself, is unlikely. I believe that with good will and co-operation under a federal system we can achieve suitable control.</PARA>
<PARA> I am reminded that the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources in its 1978 report on the role of the Commonwealth in water matters decided against a central fresh water research institute because of the wide range of tasks of development, the diverse range of water and related problems-climate and topography-and the great distances involved. It doubted that a central water research authority could meet the specific needs of a particular region or State. On that basis, it is generally believed that with good will and co-operation the results can be achieved best, as indeed they have, within the federalist system. They could of course have been achieved and written under a former Labor government but this was not done.</PARA>

Is this due to a deliberate lack of dissemination of information about social service benefits on the part of the Government? Instead of spending large sums in advertising its opposition to the 35-hour working week campaign, would the Government not serve the people better by placing advertisements with regard to available pension, unemployment and sickness benefits? Will the Minister seriously consider publishing such information in all the daily newspapers in Australia, preferably in several languages?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Department of Social Security does have an information program which includes some limited advertising in the media. That program is aimed at ensuring that members of the public are aware of their entitlements. I think all honourable senators receive copies of the pamphlets which are issued and regularly updated by the Department. Indeed, we have made some effort to ensure that those updated pamphlets are available at the time changes are made to benefits so that people are fully aware of their entitlements. The Government does take seriously its obligation to ensure that people are aware of their entitlements with regard to benefits. I think most honourable senators are aware that there has been an extensive decentralisation of the Department under this Government. Scattered around Australia there are now more than 160 offices which are readily accessible to most pensioners and beneficiaries. I think most honourable senators are aware that the Department employs social workers who have the important role of ensuring that people who have difficulty in coming to grips with the social security system receive assistance. I will examine the matter that the honourable senator raised. If particular examples of non-availability of information are drawn to my attention, we will do our best to cover them. I would welcome hearing from Mr Hamilton on the particular case so that I can examine what further measures might be necessary.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the proposal to hold a convention in Bourke on 8 July. Indeed, I was privileged to have discussions some weeks ago in this building with delegates who are planning that convention. I am aware that one of their aims is to propose that there should be an in-depth study which would aim basically to turn the Clarence water system back inland. Both Mr Anthony and I discussed two main matters with the delegation: Firstly, the very great importance of getting the River Murray Waters Agreement into position as quickly as possible; and, secondly, the fact that the New South Wales Government has undertaken, in association with the Federal Government, a study of the northern rivers of New South Wales. The Federal Government has been urging the expedition of the study. We have pointed out to these delegates that, before any kind of study can be made in further depth, it is necessary to find the material that will come forward from the New South Wales Government. We are looking forward to that. I point out without attempting in any way to deprecate the situation-and Senator Douglas McClelland will understand it-that not only would the deviation of the Clarence River through the mountain range be extremely costly, being measured in some billions of dollars, but also is the likelihood of that water managing to go the 2,500 mile journey very remote because of evaporation and also because, no doubt, of riparian rights along the river. So there is an enormous amount to be done in this regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am aware of Mr Jacobi's proposed private member's Bill in another place with regard to the aim of a central fresh water institute. I repeat part of an answer that I gave a moment ago, that is, that the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources in its 1978 report on the role of the Commonwealth in water matters decided against a central fresh water research institute because of the wide range of tasks of development, the diverse range of water and related problems-climate and topography-and the great distances involved. It doubted that a central water research authority could meet the specific needs of a particular region or State. It is open to question, therefore, whether the institute proposed by Mr Jacobi would add in any way to the basis for solutions to the River Murray problems.</PARA>

I am not sure that I would be able to give an accurate figure with respect to the amounts which are paid in this country. I will make inquiries and find out. As to whether people who are receiving pensions from the Commonwealth Government are better off in or out of Australia, there are some areas in which a pensioner going overseas is worse off because he or she loses certain entitlements which he or she would receive here-fringe benefits and so on-and which are regarded by pensioners as being of considerable value.

In view of the increasing necessity for shippers of goods to use air transport, because of maritime strikes, when orders have to be filled to keep faith with customers and to replenish supplies of essential stores and materials, will the Minister give consideration to allowing equivalent equalisation payments under circumstances when ships on which equalisation payments would have been available cannot be used?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport has provided me with some information for Senator Archer in regard to the freight equalisation scheme and its workings. I note that the Tasmanian freight equalisation scheme was introduced to overcome the transport cost disability suffered by Tasmanians when shipping cargoes interstate by sea because of the lack of access to road and rail transport. The scheme has not been developed to place Tasmanians at an advantage over their mainland counterparts; rather, it has been developed only to remove a disability. When the scheme was established in 1976 consideration was given to the inclusion of air cargo at that time. However, it was found that Tasmania's interstate air freight rates were no higher than comparable air freight rates on the mainland. Accordingly, the Government did not introduce assistance on air freight as no disability existed. It may well be that that situation has changed and, if that is implied in Senator Archer's question, I will undertake to refer that matter to the Minister and to obtain a reply for him.</PARA></TALK.START>

In particular, would not great savings be made by banning such trips as the one made by the Prime Minister to Armidale for the purpose of visiting relatives and to buy a bull for his property at Nareen, this visit being reported in the Tamworth Northern Daily Leader on Friday, 22 May 1981 and on the Australian Broadcasting Commission program PM on 21 May 1981? What was the cost to the Australian taxpayer of that particular trip? If the Minister does not have the cost of that trip at her fingertips, will she undertake to make it available to the Senate before the Commonwealth Functions (Statutes Review) Bill 1981 is debated later this week?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It does not surprise me that Senator Walsh is out of step with everybody, including his own party. The fact is that the world price has fallen, probably by roughly $A20 a tonne. That is being determined at this moment. The aim of the Government when it fixed the price, particularly when it fixed the price of LPG in relation to automotive use and when it fixed the price with regard to the $80 a tonne subsidy, was to ensure that if the world price fell below a particular level in relation to oil the consumers would get the benefit of it. This has happened within recent days, not in recent weeks or months. The matter is immediately under the consideration of the Government. It may not be possible-indeed, it cannot be possible-to bring in legislation to have effect this side of the end of June, but it will be a priority measure in the August session. Indeed, the aim will be to ensure that equity is done to the Australian people in terms of this matter. I would hope that as more supplies of LPG become available, particularly from the departure from flaring in the Middle East and the stripping of the gas, the price may continue to fall.</PARA></TALK.START>

I will not know what benefit, if any, accrues to producers or distributors until, firstly, the Government is able to make calculations as to the prices and, secondly, the Government is able to bring in legislation and, of course, proclaim that legislation.

<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The frequent calls for a national approach to solve the problems of the River Murray and the steadfast refusal of the national Government to become involved in interstate arguments about the river's management exemplify the fact that water resources management in Australia to achieve national objectives at the highest and broadest levels is virtually non-existent. This is undeniable and has been noted by every commentator on water resources management in Australia. It is not surprising that such deficiencies should exist when the Australian Constitution omits water management as a specific responsibility of the national Government. But national governments have almost invariably attempted to adopt the narrowest interpretation of their residual responsibilities and powers with respect to water management. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill I am moving today provides for the establishment of an Australian Institute of Freshwater Studies to upgrade and extend the research and planning of freshwater resources; in short, to provide the framework for better management of the most basic of resources in a dry continent-water. The establishment of such a national institute would not, of itself, solve the problems of the River Murray or similar national problems. It would, however, greatly assist by providing impartial information whereby the claims and requirements of the various managing State authorities could be investigated and evaluated, whereby the problems could be better defined and whereby optimal solutions would be most likely to be derived in the national interest. The manner in which the Institute could play its envisaged role can be assessed from the wording of the Bill itself. It should be noted, however, that the charter of the Institute itself would not be settled until an interim council had been established by the Government to examine the situation more closely. </PARA>
<PARA>Overseas Experience</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The establishment of an Institute of Freshwater Studies is by no means unique. Similar institutes exist in many developed countries, including, for example, Canada, the United Kingdom, South Africa, New Zealand and Israel. Indeed, it is quite anomalous that the driest continent, Australia, presently lacks such an institute. The charters of these overseas institutes indicate the importance placed in water research by the countries in which they are located. The high priority given such institutes by Israel and South Africa, where, like Australia, water is a basic resource in short supply, is, of course, no coincidence. </PARA>
<PARA> These countries have recognised the vital role of water research, investigation and management to their national well-being. These countries have recognised that the problems of water management are inextricably tied to the nature and complexity of their localised geography; that is, their soils, topography, industries, agriculture and water demands. These countries have clearly seen that the problems of one country are inevitably individual to that country and cannot necessarily be solved by taking results from elsewhere. That feature, above all, applies in Australia. For example, the irrigation problems along the River Murray, which has mainly sodium salinity, require a quite different solution to those of irrigation areas of the United States of America or Israel where salinity is mainly of the calcium type. We require a solution which can be found only in Australia using our own brains and resources. </PARA>
<PARA>The Situation in Australia</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> In comparison with other countries we can ask what organisations and level of effort Australia applies to the solution of her problems. First, the level of funding of freshwater research in Australia is totally inadequate. The allocation to the Australian Water Resources Council for research purposes in the last Budget was a mere $450,000. Compare this figure with that received by just one freshwater research laboratory in the United Kingdom in 1980, $2,500,000! With this limited level of funding for AWRC, even the best organisation in the world would be hard pressed to make any impression on the growing water problems of this vast and largely arid nation. But worse than that, the organisations we do have are woefully fragmented or inappropriate to the tasks. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, the Department of National Development and Energy of which the Australian Water Resources Council is part, is only involved in administrative and policy areas. Neither organisation directly undertakes investigation or research, although they do have some limited control or influence on these activities by their funding powers. Nor do they make decisions or recommendations on specific or contentious management issues. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, there are the bureaucratic State water authorities which are the main centres of water management responsibility in Australia. These bodies attempt to allocate fairly the waters within their areas of responsibility and to keep them free from pollution. But their areas of responsibility, especially State boundaries, do not coincide with catchment boundaries, and squabbles inevitably arise over interstate rivers. In general, senior officers in water authorities are competent and dedicated engineers, but the problems of water management are becoming increasingly associated with chemistry and biology. It is not surprising then that such officers are finding it ever harder to keep abreast of the nature of the problems, let alone the solutions. The water authorities do not generally undertake fundamental research; that is, work of a basic type and of national application. Whilst they do carry out many investigations, these invariably only cover areas within their State boundaries and therefore cannot address the allocation or pollution of waters of interstate rivers. </PARA>
<PARA> The third organisation is the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation which undertakes some water research, but it is scattered, among 14 different sections of the organisation. The Senate Standing Committee on National Resources recommended in 1978 that there be a separate water resources division within CSIRO, and I concede that this could be an alternative to an independent institute. However CSIRO has generally not taken up research or investigations where social, legal or cultural values have to be evaluated. But these questions are of vital concern to water management, as also is the development of new technologies from previous research. Unless CSIRO were to be significantly changed, given enlarged responsibilities and a greatly enlarged budget, the responsibility and activities of the proposed Institute could not be incorporated. </PARA>
<PARA> Fourthly, the universities perform considerable and valuable research and several have ongoing interests in water subjects. However, none are adequately funded or manned to carry out the level and type of research and investigation envisaged. The last of the water organisations are the commissions specifically set up to manage interstate rivers. The best known of these is the River Murray Commission and its deficiencies are numerous. Its powers relate only to the quantity of water in the main stream of the River Murray, plus certain off-river storages. Consequently, it has no control over the quality of water in the river, nor over adjacent land practices, nor over activities on the tributaries of the Murray which might lead to a deterioration in quality. </PARA>
<PARA> The commission has a staff of only 10 to manage thousands of miles of river, and, like the State water authorities that it serves, has little real expertise in the biological questions which are increasingly important in determining water quality. Consequently, engineering works along the Murray have often been constructed by, and on behalf of the Commission, without proper study of their impacts on the river ecology. The Commission does not undertake research, and it does not include Queensland under whose jurisdiction much of the headwaters of the Darling lie. Like all federalist co-operative bodies, the Commission produces lowest common denominator decisions and takes an enormous amount of time to reach them. There is much labouring to bring forth a gnat. In relation to the River Murray Commission, Professor Sandford Clark, a recognised expert on international water legislation and rivers, pointed out that: 'A commission must have considerable independence and autonomy if it is to be effective' and that 'there is an inconsistency in creating an organisation and then denying it the powers to undertake its tasks'. </PARA>
<PARA> My criticisms of the River Murray Commission should not be taken in any way as a reflection on its staff nor do they suggest that there is no need for such a body. The point is that the River Murray Commission and similar commissions are not institutionally structured to effectively solve many of the pressing problems of interstate rivers let alone other problems of a national nature in water resource management. Whilst changes have been proposed to widen the scope of the Commission's operation, there are fundamental limitations which these changes will not overcome. The expanded River Murray Commission is to have responsibility for mainstream water quality but at the best, will only be able to make recommendations with respect to water quality in tributary streams. It is not possible to control river pollution without control over what enters the river. It is nonsense to think othewise. In any case, the Commission has effectively had the power, if it can be called that, over water quality under an informal agreement made by the States and the Commonwealth five years ago. As one government expert who is reported in a recent article in the Australian summed up the real barrier to resolve the mounting issues facing this river system in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA> If we can get rid of the need for unanimity we would have travelled a long way to solving the problems. The ability to make majority decisions will give the Commission real power to censure not just to recommend, any government which bucked a three-to-one vote against it would have to stand up and be counted. </PARA>
<PARA> However only SA is prepared to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>Further, most legal experts agree that it will be impossible to convince, or even force, New South Wales and Victoria to surrender their rights over the Murray, its tributaries and the lands adjoining them, which would be necessary if the Commission was given the power envisaged by South Australia, and other organisations such as the River Murray League. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, if the river's problems are to be solved, it will be necessary to conduct research and adopt a new approach towards them. Biologists and other scientists need to be considerably more involved in management of the river. </PARA>
<PARA>Problems of the Murray</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Much has been said about salinity, silting, pollution and other river problems, but it is quite extraordinary and scandalous that so little research into the cause, nature and effects of these problems is undertaken. After 100 years of thoughtless exploitation, the viability of the River Murray system as a resource is in jeopardy. Members will recall that recently it even ceased flowing to the sea. If present trends continue, it is only a matter of years-or less if there is prolonged drought-before this river and its tributaries, which supply most of South Australia and many thousands of people in NSW and Victoria with domestic water, become not merely unpleasant, but quite undrinkable, and practically useless for irrigation. Without the expenditure of enormous sums of money on moves to rectify past and present poor practice the river is now at crisis point. Six features of this unique system have lead to this crisis. They are:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The aridity of the region;</PARA>
<PARA> 2. The enormous extent to which existing water resources are exploited;</PARA>
<PARA> 3. The frightening rate of salinity increase from source to sea, greatly exacerbated by irrigation and clearing;</PARA>
<PARA> 4. The pathetic infighting between States bordering the resource, all behind the smoke screen of 'sovereign rights';</PARA>
<PARA> 5. The almost total lack of knowledge of the way the system functions ecologically; and</PARA>
<PARA> 6. The lack of effective management based on sound knowledge. </PARA>
<PARA>The Institute to be established by this Bill can overcome the problem of lack of knowledge, can investigate different and improved management options and can provide impartial arbitration between States. It is the only reasonable hope we have for better management of the river system. By investigation of options before, rather than after a decision is taken, much of the cause for conflict will be reduced. By adopting a national viewpoint in its investigations, the mutual concern and possible distrust between the upstream and downstream interests can be largely dispelled at the early stages. The Institute would look at the river system from a much broader perspective than can be achieved by the separate state bureaucracies responsible for management of the river. As consumers of water, we ask our river to dilute and carry away our sewage, cool and supply our industries, remove our industrial effluents-heavy metals, chemicals, oils and so on-act as a means of transport and recreation, irrigate our crops, water our stock, carry away fertilisers and pesticides, cook our foods, clean us and provide drinking water. Yet, we know next to nothing of the way in which rivers operate to carry out this multiplicity of functions, particularly those involving waste material processing. </PARA>
<PARA> At present there is no current, co-ordinated research on river systems as a whole. There is only one river laboratory in the entire River Murray basin, a small one associated with the development of Albury-Wodonga. Salinity is increasing at an alarming rate in many river systems throughout Australia. Numerous examples of rivers which have become unusable can be cited in western and south eastern Australia due to unthinking land use practices. We do not know how long it will be before citrus and viticulture fails along the Murray but we can be sure that it will happen in our lifetimes. We do not know how many more upstream irrigation licences will be granted before the lower Murray irrigation industries totally collapse. We have only sketchy ideas of the current cost of salinification to industry, home consumption, the motor trade and to agriculture. We can only guess at how much it might cost to desalinate Murray water if it reaches unacceptable salt levels, or to find alternative sources of water. The total cost to the public and industry would be astronomical and is probably already unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> Because the River Murray catchment does not conform to State boundaries, the information and research on which effective management is based must be national in character. What is done to one part of the river clearly affects conditions elsewhere, yet this elementary fact has been ignored by State and local authorities for more than 100 years. The rapid decline of the river in its lower reaches after 80 years of federation is testimony to the failure to understand the interactions of the river on a basin wide basis. However, the River Murray is only one of Australia's interstate rivers. </PARA>
<PARA>The Problem of Interstate Rivers</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Because of the mismatch between natural catchment boundaries and State boundaries, surface run-off in rivers covering 40 per cent of the area of Australia where rivers and streams exist-that is, excluding the central and western deserts-are involved in interstate transfers. These rivers are generally the interior flowing rivers with low flows. Thus competing demands of the different States and demands within the States are less likely to be readily satisfied and interstate conflicts will arise more readily with these rivers. No agreement exists for any of the interstate river systems, except for the border rivers of New South Wales and Queensland, and for the River Murray. </PARA>
<PARA> One could imagine the stalemate which would exist if Queensland wished to build a large dam on the headwaters of the Cooper or Diamantina, thus diminishing the flows essential to the livelihood of some South Australian pastoralists. Such conflict did, in fact, take place during a proposal to divert part of the Cooper into Lake Yamma Yamma in the 1960s. The proposal was dropped after objections by South Australia. The Institute could carry out studies into possible ways of allocating interstate waters well before conflict arose over specific issues. Parties from the various States could be brought together in an informed manner, free from political pressure, to discuss the implications of various allocations and regulations and make sure that all their interests and concerns were fully identified and accounted for.</PARA>
<PARA> A national institute is also needed to co-ordinate other water research which must necessarily be of a national character. One such example is the national representative basins program, a boldly conceived project which was to have been a showpiece of Australian national hydrology. Unfortunately, the project has failed, and failed miserably because at the fundamental level the States and the Commonwealth were unable to co-ordinate their efforts. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a document detailing this program, including the reasons for its failure. </PARA>

<PARA> In 1964 following the introduction of the International Hydrological Decade, and as part of Australia's contribution to the decade, the concept of a national programme of hydrological investigation of some 100 medium to small river basins throughout Australia was adopted. The programme was known as the Australian Representative Basins Programme. The aim of the programme was to study the hydrological response of these 100 basins, which were chosen to be distinctive, but representative of the larger region surrounding them, and thus to be able to explain why and to what extent the hydrological response of the catchments differed. Success in this programme would have enabled the data collected from these catchments to be used to solve water problems arising on the many other catchments where either no data existed, or where data could not be quickly or economically collected. In other words it was a far sighted plan which attempted to anticipate a whole range of problems the nation might face in the management of its many thousands of such catchments, to collect data on an efficient scale, and to perform analyses which would extend the understanding of scientists and engineers and enable them to solve these problems with a greatly improved efficiency. The programme was enthusiastically adopted by most parties and was to be jointly operated by the States and Commonwealth Authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> However, within a short period, the whole programme ran into problems. One very severe problem was the imbalance between the commitment of the various parties to the data collection operation. The rainfall data was in general to be collected and processed by the Commonwealth Bureau of Meteorology. The streamflow data was to be collected by the various State authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> The States undertook their commitment with varying success, but the Bureau of Meteorology consistently failed to undertake its commitment to collect rainfall data. Despite repeated calls by the AWRC, the Bureau was never funded or manned at the appropriate level by the Commonwealth Government to enable it to meet its commitment. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the main objective of the programme was to study the relationship between rainfall and subsequent streamflow, the absence of adequate rainfall data meant the effective ruin of the whole programme. </PARA>
<PARA> CSIRO spent many man years in attempting to set up a mathematical hydrological model of the catchment processes under their part of the programme, but without sufficient co-ordinated rainfall and streamflow data the model could not be effectively directed or improved. </PARA>
<PARA> In total 6 million dollars were spent on the programme over the period (including CSIRO component). </PARA>
<PARA> A review of the programme is currently underway by the AWRC. These problems with the programme have been noted and it is almost certain that the programme will be severely curtailed, if not scrapped. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The problems of management faced by this program are typical of the problems any national approach to water management in Australia suffers. Had an institute existed, adequate centralised management and representation could have been arranged. Better co-ordination of the involved organisations could have been provided and technical studies undertaken to ensure that the national importance and benefit of the study was fully appreciated by all concerned. The AWRC still suffers from the lack of ability to have technical studies of a national venture undertaken. The AWRC secretariat is not staffed to the appropriate level, not adequately qualified in a sufficiently wide range of areas to undertake a whole range of investigations required to enable the AWRC to reach its policy decisions on an informed basis. The Institute proposed could fill this gap.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is also a natural conservatism in the State authorities to use new technologies. Australian scientists have been amongst world leaders in the development of isotope usage in hydrologic studies and pilot studies have shown the effective and cheap use of these techniques. The role of adapting new technical developments for use by water authorities is a task which is well catered for in the water industries of many developed countries. Again Australia has no such national facility. The Institute could fulfil such a role. </PARA>
<PARA>The Legal Position</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> With the nature of existing and potential water resource problems, there should be no doubt that the Commonwealth has a clear obligation in the national interest to investigate the proper use and management of our inland water resources and move towards a more rational position. The so-called national implied powers of the Commonwealth provide it with the power to establish a body which would investigate and make recommendations on the problems which bedevil our River Murray system. This power has been described by a number of justices, in particular, in the recent Australian Assistance Plan case. Although the scope of this inherent power has yet to be exhaustively defined, a number of justices indicate that the power would be sufficient to extend the involvement of the Commonwealth in research activity, and into management investigations particularly when it is appropriate that there must be planning and research at a national level. However, I stress forcibly that the creation of such a national body would by no means pre-empt the responsibility for management which the States undoubtedly have. The Institute could, in fact, create an opportunity to make use of the expertise available in the States and allow this to be extended in an appropriate manner. Properly constituted, the operation of the Australian Institute of Freshwater Studies could complement the work of the States. </PARA>
<PARA> The reasoning behind the need for an increased Commonwealth role was best summed up by Mr Justice Mason in the AAP case to which I have referred.He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The functions appropriate and adapted to a national government will vary from time to time. As time unfolds, as circumstances and conditions alter, it will transpire that particular enterprises and activities will be undertaken, if they are to be undertaken at all, by the national Government. </PARA>
<PARA>With respect to the River Murray, this comment could be paraphrased as follows: Solutions to the problems of the River Murray will be found, if they are to be found at all, by the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA>Previous Proposals</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> In considering the role of the Federal Government it is opportune to review the important work of Senate committees which have examined water matters. The Senate Select Committee on Water Pollution found, amongst other things:</PARA>
<PARA> There are large gaps in the documentation of our water resources and there is no pragmatic program of research into the causes and consequences of water pollution, or into its economics. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee also recommends that the Commonwealth should take urgent steps to establish a national water commission. This body was objected to by States because of the threat to their bureaucratic empires. In 1978 the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources released a report which recommended a national approach to water resources and supported the establishment of an independent bureau of water resources to undertake all the Commonwealth's non-policy, co-ordination, technical and information activities. In response the Government stated: 'This recommendation would signify a considerable broadening of the Commonwealth's role in water resource matters, but the Government does not believe that such a step is justified at this time. This recommendation will be reviewed if warranted by changed circumstances at some later stage. I would suggest that a considrable broadening of the Commonwealth's role is urgently required and that circumstances relating to the river's management have indeed changed-for the worse. </PARA>
<PARA> In June 1979, the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment also released a progress report which also found</PARA>
<PARA>. . . many people along the river are obviously frustrated by the apparent inability of any one department, Commonwealth or State, to take responsibility for providing responses to views and grievances. </PARA>
<PARA>An Institute of Freshwater Studies that was available to the Commonwealth and States for research into specific matters affecting water management decisions, or that was able to initiate its own research into such questions, would clearly not conflict with the recommendation of these three committees and it would bring many advantages. Firstly, research by the Institute would view the river system as a whole. The evaluation of benefits and costs for proposed river works would be assessed by the Institute from a national viewpoint, rather than from a local or regional perspective. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the Institute would be free of governmental interference so that it would bring impartiality and objectivity to the consideration of such matters. While final decisions on water resource matters will lie with the States, at least the information on which those decisions are made would be the best available. As I have previously shown much key information is presently not available at all. Thirdly, the Institute would examine the environmental and biological aspects of water quality. It has become increasingly well understood that salinity and other problems cannot be tackled effectively, if they are divorced from changes to the river's ecology. The River Murray Commission has in recent years formed sub-committees to look at some of these problems but there is no evidence of any meaningful progress in these areas over the past 5 years. In any case, the expertise available to the States in this area is minimal. By contrast I would expect that the Institute of Freshwater Studies would be staffed by prominent biologists, hydrologists, chemists, microbiologists, and medical researchers with support from economists and engineers. Fourthly, the Institute could play a role in the more rapid introduction of improved technologies and practices which are so vital if many of the poor, present methods are to be avoided. </PARA>
<PARA> Issues associated with the River Murray are the most vexed and most important questions facing us today in the water field. However, there are many other areas where the Institute could undertake useful research for Federal, State and local bodies. The recent and tragic death of a child in South Australia from amoebic brain infection, a water-borne disease, is a case in point. The South Australian Government decided after the death of this child that some research was needed and accordingly voted funds, $150,000, to that purpose. However this is a national problem and research should have commenced beforehand. The need for such research was recognised several years ago. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusions</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Any proposal to establish a new statutory body at this time of unprecedented demands for Commonwealth funds is not a step to be taken lightly. However, there are several points in relation to the cost of the proposed Institute which should be considered. Firstly, the value of the industries and communities at risk from water problems must run into billions of dollars. The cost of protecting these industries and communities is already growing rapidly. In this context the work of the proposed Institute could save taxpayers many millions of dollars by examining ways to improve the management of our threatened waterways. Secondly, if the Institute is available for contract research it could earn substantial income both from government and industry. There is evidence that sections of industry would welcome the services of a top-rate water research body. The problems posed to water supply by certain mining operations are a case in point. A statutory body would be welcomed in such situations, both for its impartiality and reputation, and also for the absence of comparable bodies in the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, there is the question of priorities. We already have an Australian Institute of Marine Science which is housed in a multi-million dollar modern complex near Townsville, and which was given $5.5m in 1980-81 to expand its research into marine biology. We will spend $24.5m on the Antarctic this year, including $1.2m specifically to build up marine research. In addition, a grant of $2.3m is made through the Australian Marine Science and Technologies Advisory Committee for research into marine science, a total of $9m. By contrast, research into inland waters, and particularly into such a vital economic asset as the Murray-Darling system, has been almost completely neglected. Are our inland waters that much less important to us than those around our coast and in the Antarctic?</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I will briefly outline the mechanics of this Bill and the procedure to be followed in the establishment of the Australian Institute of Freshwater Studies. The procedure is similar to that used to set up the Australian Institute of Marine Science in 1970. Firstly, an interim council for the Institute will be appointed by the Minister for Science and Technology. The interim council will consist of five members including two persons with appropriate qualifications. This body will make recommendations to the Minister concerning the functions and powers of the Institute, its constitution, the site of the seat of the Institute, how it should co-operate with Commonwealth and State authorities and other research institutions. Finally, the interim council will estimate the capital and recurrent costs of the Institute. The scope of the interim council's investigations is set out in section 7 (2) of the Bill. After the recommendations of the interim council have been received by the Minister, the Institute will be given such functions and powers as the Parliament then determines. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said at the beginning of this speech, the measures proposed in this Bill will not by themselves solve all the major water resource problems facing Australia. However, this Bill provides a challenge to the national Parliament to assume its responsibilities and take the first steps to correct past failures. It is politicians that have failed to manage properly our water resources, and squabbles over power and empires have put at risk our most precious resource. It is time that parochial and vested interests were swept aside, and that effective, impartial and national approaches were taken to our water resources. As the first step in that direction, I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The principal purpose of this Bill is to amend the Overseas Telecommunications Act 1946 to allow the Overseas Telecommunications Commission (Australia) to form or participate in the formation of a company that may be established to own and manage the national communications satellite system. On 18 September 1980, the then Minister for Post and Telecommunications informed Parliament that tenders were to be called for the supply of a communications satellite system, and that the Government was considering the possibility of establishing a company to own and manage that system, the public sector to hold 51 per cent of the share capital in such a company and the private sector to hold 49 per cent of the shares. A committee of officials was requested to report on the interest of the private sector in participating in such a company in which OTC would have a major interest on behalf of the Government, the company to operate as a commercial tax paying enterprise. As an interim measure, OTC had been designated as the authority to own and manage the communications satellite system. For this purpose, licences under the Wireless Telegraphy Act 1905 had been issued to OTC to provide telecommunications services by way of a satellite system. </PARA>
<PARA> A request for tenders for the satellite communications system was issued in October last year. The request for tenders is a comprehensive set of documents inviting tenders for the supply of the space segment of the satellite system, the major city earth stations and minor earth stations to access the satellite, earth stations required by Telecom for telephony services as well as receive-only earth stations for regional and remote area national broadcasting services. Also included in the request for tender was the supply of earth terminals for the Department of Transport's air safety and navigational services. Twenty tenders were received for the space and earth segments of the satellite communications system and evaluation of tenders is now taking place. </PARA>
<PARA> In introducing this Bill, I would make it clear that the Government has not taken decisions on what the final ownership arrangements should be. The report of officials on their discussions with the private sector on participation in a company to own and manage the satellite communications system is now being considered by the Government. An announcement about the outcome of these considerations should be made in the near future. Honourable senators will appreciate that if the Government decides to proceed with the concept of establishing a company with public and private sector involvement, there will be a need for further discussion and negotiation on the detailed arrangements which might apply before the company, as a legal entity, is established. The provisions of the Bill in this regard should therefore be seen as a contingency measure only. Whether there would be a need for recourse to the provisions of the Bill will depend on government decisions regarding the organisation or authority which will be the ultimate owner of the satellite communications system and the timing for implementing those decisions. For this reason the Bill provides that action by OTC to form or participate in such a company requires the approval of the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Other objectives of the Bill are to enable OTC to provide technical services, on a commercial basis, to such a company, and to enable OTC to provide consultative services to the governments of neighbouring countries on the use of the satellite system for their own purposes. Again the Minister's approval is required before OTC could take action along those lines. The provision for OTC to provide consultative services of this nature to neighbouring countries reflects the Government's policy of assisting less developed nations in the region to develop their telecommunications services. Provision has been made in the design of the system for the satellite to provide telecommunications services for the Government of Papua New Guinea. This is an optional feature in the system design and the Papua New Guinea Government has yet to make decisions regarding its use of the Australian satellite system for its own needs. </PARA>
<PARA> For technical reasons, it has not been possible to provide in the first generation satellite system for services to be available to other countries in the South West Pacific region. The Government has offered, however, to participate in a study of the telecommunications needs of those countries and a formal invitation has now been received for Australia to take part in such a study. The results of that study will be taken into account when planning later generations of communications satellites. The OTC has had considerable experience in the provision of telecommunications services by satellites. It now provides tracking, telemetry, command and monitoring facilities for the Intelsat satellites in orbital locations over the Pacific and Indian oceans. It will provide similar services for satellites to be launched by the European Space Agency. The OTC also provides the major facilities at Moree, Ceduna and Carnarvon for the receiving and transmitting by satellite of international communications. Since the taking of the decision to invest OTC with the interim responsibility for developing the satellite communications system, that authority has built up its technical resources on satellite communications. The skills and experiences of OTC officers in satellite communications systems will be of major benefit in pursuing the Government's policy on extending modern telecommunications services to all people in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In seeking the support of honourable senators to this Bill, I would emphasise that the development of the national communications satellite system is a major project. The evaluation of tenders will be one of the most critical aspects. It has to be undertaken within a time frame which would allow contracts for the supply of the system to be entered into in early 1982, so that the space and earth segments of the system are available to coincide with reservations which have been made with the National Aeronautics and Space Administration-NASA-and the European Space Agency to place the satellites in their orbital positions. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942 to provide for changes covering:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) supplementary licences for radio stations;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) public interest criteria</PARA>
<PARA> (c) ownership or control provisions;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) the Australian Broadcasting Commission's merchandising and contractual activities; and</PARA>
<PARA> (e) other minor amendments. </PARA>
<PARA>Before turning to the detail of the proposed amendments to the Bill, I make general comment on the intent of the changes. The Senate will recall that, in a statement on 9 October 1980, the Honourable A. A. Staley, M.P., foreshadowed legislation to introduce supplementary licences as a means of increasing the range of broadcasting services available in non-metropolitan areas. The Government recogised that in those areas where an additional fully competitive commercial station was not a viable proposition an alternative needed to be found which widened the choice of services. The supplementary licence concept was conceived as a means of providing additional radio and television services, while protecting the commercial viability of existing services in the area and preserving the principle of localism in broadcasting. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for the introduction of supplementary licences for commercial FM radio in areas outside Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth. While commercial FM services have begun operation in mainland metropolitan areas, no commercial FM services are available in regional areas. Many such areas cannot support fully competitive FM services and accordingly the only means of providing these services in those areas is through the supplementary licence concept. This will enable an existing commercial AM operator to provide an FM service in any area not able to support a fully competitive service. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will note that the Bill does not provide for supplementary television licences. The Government has decided not to proceed at this time with supplementary television licences, following extensive discussions with the television industry and following representations by regional television operators that in many cases supplementary television licences would not be commercially viable without a subscription television component. Before any introduction of subscription television services is contemplated, a number of issues will need to be considered, not the least of which is the desirability of such services and the ground rules within which they should operate. Furthermore, the Government believes it would, in any case, be anomalous to introduce subscription television into regional areas without also considering such services for metropolitan areas. Accordingly, the Government has referred the matter of subscription television to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal for consideration in conjunction with its inquiry into cable television. No decision regarding subscription television will be made until the Tribunal has presented its report, which is expected in March 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is conscious of the fact that in a limited number of areas supplementary television licences may be viable without a subscription television component. However, the Government is not prepared to make separate provision specifically for those areas. It believes that any introduction of supplementary television licences to increase commercial services should be considered in a wider context. The Government is anxious that large regional cities and the smaller capitals should have the opportunity for increased services at the earliest practicable opportunity. It is anticipated that Government will be making further decisions on the subject following receipt of the Tribunal's report. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate will also recall that on 9 April 1981, the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) announced to Parliament the broad thrust of the conclusions reached by the Government after its review of the Act, and he foreshadowed amendments covering:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The machinery and procedural aspects of sections 90 to 92KA of the Act; and</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Inadvertent breaches of the Act by shareholders in companies acquiring interests in radio and television broadcasting licences through share trading on the stock exchange. </PARA>
<PARA>Necessarily that statement did not express with the same precision as legislation the changes proposed to the Act, and honourable senators will note that in some respects the Bill differs from the proposals outlined previously. The changes follow from further consultation with the industry. However, that statement did outline in general terms a package of proposals with two major themes which remain relevant. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, the amendments will maintain the basic structure of decision making that has been in operation since 1977. The amendments will provide the means for more effective administration of the broadcasting system in accordance with Government policy. The lack of reference points for the Tribunal in deciding whether a particular licensing decision would be in the 'public interest' has led to some uncertainty in Tribunal proceedings. The incorporation of legislative guidelines for 'public interest' will provide a clearer statement of Government policy in relation to the major discretionary powers of the Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the amendments are designed to ensure that the ownership or control provisions will remain effective and appropriate to the commercial environment of the 1980s. Restrictions on the free transfer of interests should be no greater than are necessary to achieve a reasonable balance between the desirability of preventing uncontrolled trading in licences, and the need for a vigorous share market. It has become apparent that the present share transaction procedures, which require the Tribunal's approval prior to any purchase, may operate to prevent a large diversified industrial corporation, for example, from lawfully purchasing shares on the open market in another such corporation, if the second corporation has an indirect interest in a radio or television station of as little as 6 per cent of issued capital. The Government regards such a result as inappropriate for an Act which is designed only to regulate radio and television, and unnecessary to achieve the aims of the legislation. This applies even more strongly in the case of third party breaches of the Act. It is only in exceptional circumstances in our system of justice that a person should be immediately liable for an offence as a result of some other person's actions. In this instance, the circumstances do not warrant such a result. In the Government's view, any person being put into inadvertent breach of the Act should not face possible prosecution, without first being allowed at least six months to comply with the ownership limitations. </PARA>
<PARA> On 9 April last, the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) and the Minister representing him in the other place tabled in Parliament a report by the Administrative Review Council on the inquiry procedures of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. In his statement to the House of Representatives on the same day, the Minister for Communications said that there would not be any decision as to specific recommendations until the public and the broadcasting industry had the opportunity to comment. Interested persons and organisations have been contacted and asked for their comments on the report by the end of July. It is expected that the Government will be in a position to consider specific recommendations of the report later in the year. I would also point out that during the preparation of the Bill and particularly following the Minister's announcement to the House of Representatives on 9 April there has been considerable public debate. In particular, details of the proposals have been discussed with a wide range of broadcasting and television groups, which are most immediately affected by ownership or control amendments, with the objective of assessing the overall impact of suggested changes before finalising Government decisions. In summary, the intention of the present amendments is to streamline procedures, avoid delays in the Tribunal's consideration of transactions, minimise the necessary number of inquiries and provide clearer guidance in relation to the Tribunal's major discretionary powers. I turn now to the detail of the proposed amendments. </PARA>
<PARA>Supplementary Licences for Radio Stations</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will enable commercial AM licensees, in areas other than Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth, to apply for a supplementary licence to operate an FM radio service in their area. Provision has also been made to allow licensees, in areas where there is more than one AM station, if they so choose, to form a consortium to apply for one supplementary licence on a joint basis. Because of the different propagation characteristics of FM as opposed to AM signals, provision is also made for the Minister to invite an applicant to apply for associated commercial translator licences. The intent behind this provision is to ensure that an area currently served by a commercial AM station and its associated translator stations will as far as possible be able to be served by a supplementary FM station together with its associated translator stations. </PARA>
<PARA> Applicants will make their applications to the Minister in accordance with a form approved by him. Applications can only be made by commercial AM operators to provide a supplementary FM service in their own areas. Unlike other licence applications, where applicants apply in response to an invitation by the Minister, applicants for supplementary licences will be able to apply at any time. The Minister will however be able to refer the application to the Tribunal or to reject the application on grounds relating to technical matters or to the planning or development of broadcasting and television services. This provision arises from the Minister's statutory responsibilities for the planning and development of these services. </PARA>
<PARA> In considering applications for supplementary licences, the Tribunal will follow similar procedures to those applying to other licences. For example, in considering an application for a supplementary licence, the Tribunal will be required to take account of the criteria applying to the grant of other licences. However, an additional provision will enable the Tribunal to refuse to grant a supplementary licence in any area which can sustain a fully competitive commercial broadcasting station without endangering the viability of existing services. If the Tribunal finds that an additional commercial station would be viable then it will be required to inform the Minister of its determination and the reasons for it. </PARA>
<PARA> Supplementary licences will be granted for up to five years and renewed for up to three years. The Tribunal shall, in considering any renewal of a supplementary licence not less than eight years after the initial grant of a supplementary licence, determine whether an additional commercial station is reasonably likely to be viable in that area, and whether it would be in the public interest, as defined, to call for applications for a commercial licence. If the Tribunal is satisfied on both grounds, it shall recommend to the Minister that he invite applications for a commercial licence and shall give the supplementary licensee three years' notice of its intention not to renew the supplementary licence. A licensee, but not a consortium, will be able in such a case to opt to retain the broadcasting station operated under this supplementary licence and instead forgo the station operated under his commercial licence. This provision is intended to cover a broadcaster wishing to retain his supplementary FM station rather than his commercial AM station. In this case the supplementary licence will convert to a normal commercial licence. </PARA>
<PARA> I need to comment on some aspects of supplementary licences which have been the subject of some recent concern by the broadcasting industry. A decision to seek a supplementary licence is entirely a decision for the licensee in the area concerned. The Ministerial discretion to dismiss applications can only be on technical grounds or for planning and development reasons, for example, where no frequencies are available, or where the calling of applications for a fully competitive service is contemplated. I would emphasise that the Ministerial discretion must be interpreted within the scope, purpose and objects of the Act. The minimum duration of a supplementary licence is 11 years with no consideration of non-renewal before eight years. The Government believes this provides an adequate period for licensees to recoup their investment. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, it is not correct to say that there are appeals available for other classes of licences which are not available for supplementary licences. The appeal provisions in section 119A apply equally to supplementary licences as to other classes of licences, the only difference being that there is no appeal against non-renewal after eight years. Special provisions have been inserted to allow the supplementary licence to continue in operation in circumstances where the Tribunal has decided not to renew the licence but for one reason or another competitive licences have not been issued. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill includes a number of special provisions relating to localism and arrangements with other radio stations. Specifically, supplementary licencees will need to seek Tribunal approval for arrangements entered into with other stations for the regular broadcasting of:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the programs of a related commercial AM station or other commercial stations;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the programs of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, the Special Broadcasting Service or public stations. </PARA>
<PARA>This provision will provide some degree of Tribunal oversight over the simulcasting of programs-that is, the simultaneous transmission, in one area of the same radio program by two or more stations-or the networking of radio programs from other areas. Other provisions intended to preserve the principle of localism are those relating to:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) the minimum amount of locally produced or originated programs as provided for by licence conditions; and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the encouragement of local advertising. </PARA>
<PARA>The proposed amendments will provide a legal basis for the introduction of supplementary licences for radio. However, it should be noted that substantial lead times are involved both for industry and for the Department. This involves giving reasonable notice to those required to vacate the 88-108MHz band, and the determination of station service areas. Substantial costs may also be involved. The decisions required can only be made, and the costs minimised, if all concerned in the process of clearing the band are given adequate notice of the Government's intention. There is already a considerable backlog of applications to be considered relating to the existing range of broadcasting and television services. Planning for supplementary licences will proceed in parallel with the clearing of this backlog and the introduction of non-metropolitan commercial FM services. Accordingly, at a later date, the Minister intends to make a major statement regarding planning guidelines for this stage of development of commercial FM services. For these reasons, the Bill includes a transitional provision that no applications for supplementary licences may be made before a date to be fixed by proclamation. </PARA>
<PARA>Public Interest Criteria</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Clauses 13, 16, 18, 19, 28 and 38 of the Bill provide for legislative guidelines for the 'public interest' component of the major discretionary powers of the Tribunal in relation to licence grant, renewal, suspension, revocation or transfer and in relation to the approval of share (or debenture) transactions. Although the words 'public interest' do not currently appear in the Act in respect of licence grants and transfers, the High Court has confirmed in the 2HD case that the concept of public interest is a relevant factor in the exercise of the Tribunal's discretionary powers even where it is not explicitly stated. The Bill provides a consistent codification of public interest for all the major discretionary powers. </PARA>
<PARA> Dependent on the type of application, the public interest criteria will be established according to the following guidelines:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) whether the applicant will meet or has met an undertaking to:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) comply with the conditions of a licence;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) provide an adequate and comprehensive service in pursuance of the licence, having regard to:</PARA>
<PARA> the nature of the community served or to be served;</PARA>
<PARA> the diversity of the interests of that community; and</PARA>
<PARA> the nature of other radio/ television services which may be received in the same area;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) encourage the provision of Australian produced programs and the use of Australian creative resources;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) whether a person or company is fit and proper to hold an interest in a licence;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) the financial, technical and management capacity to undertake the operations of a licence;</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) in non-metropolitan areas-that is, outside the six State capitals-the degree of concentration of influence of radio or television stations; and</PARA>
<PARA> (v) the commercial viability of stations in the area. </PARA>
<PARA>The undertaking concerning the provision of an adequate and comprehensive service in pursuance of the licence provides a focus for public input at licensing inquiries. It is also intended to generate greater awareness in the public and the industry of the need to provide programming which not only complies with general standards, but also to take account of the particular characteristics of the audience served. With regard to the concentration of influence on radio and television in regional areas, honourable senators should be aware that the principal Act already applies much stricter limits on ownership in metropolitan areas than in regional areas. It is not possible for any individual to hold prescribed interests in more than one television station and one radio station in any one State capital city within the overall limit of two television or eight radio stations. On the other hand it would not be illegal for one person to control up to two television stations and four radio stations in a regional city such as Newcastle. In this latter case, it is clearly desirable that the Tribunal should be able to limit undesirable concentration. </PARA>
<PARA>Ownership or Control Provisions</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>PROCEDURES FOR THE EXAMINATION OF SHARE TRANSACTIONS</PARA>
<PARA>The current ownership or control provisions of the Act provide that it is an offence to hold 'prescribed interests' in more than two commercial television licences or more than eight commercial radio licences. The acquisition of a 'prescribed interest' or an increase in a 'prescribed interest', as defined in the Act, is currently subject to prior approval by the Tribunal. The provisions restrict the opportunities to purchase shares or debentures in a company if they would confer on the purchaser a prescribed interest in a licence. It is proposed that the requirement for prior approval of such transactions be relaxed whilst preserving the principle that changes in the ownership or control of licences be subject to effective public scrutiny. Most importantly, the Tribunal is being given effective powers to collect information on proposed transactions, and to give directions to avoid irreversible adverse effects on the licensee prior to approval being given. </PARA>
<PARA> Sections 90J and 92F of the principal Act-clauses 27 and 37 of the Bill-are being amended to provide for the notification to the Tribunal of any intended transaction and the lodgement of an application for approval of either an intended transaction or a completed transaction. Failure to lodge a notice or application prior to a transaction will be an offence on each day until a notice or application is lodged. However, such an offence will not preclude ultimate approval by the Tribunal of a transaction provided an application is lodged within 28 days. These amendments will allow the Tribunal to receive applications for approval of share transactions after, as well as before, transactions have taken place. </PARA>
<PARA> New sections 90JA and 92FAA-clauses 28 and 38 of the Bill-make provision for the approval of share and debenture transactions. In summary, these sections provide:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) that the Tribunal may approve an application in respect of share transactions after, as well as before, a transaction has taken place. </PARA>
<PARA> (ii) that the Tribunal may disapprove an application made before or after a transaction provided that it first holds an inquiry into the intended transaction; that inquiry may at the Tribunal's discretion be:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) a separate inquiry into the transaction; or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) an inquiry into both the transaction and the renewal of the licence;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) that any inquiry may be required by the purchaser, in his application, to commence within three months after the application and if the inquiry does not commence within three months, the transaction is deemed to have been approved; and</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) that the Tribunal shall take all reasonable steps to complete an inquiry within three months of commencing the inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA>Where a transaction has taken place without prior approval the Tribunal may give directions to prevent any action it considers will have an adverse affect on the ability of a company holding the licence to comply with the conditions of the licence, or on the operations, management or the selection or provision of programs by the licensee company. These powers are conferred by clause 40 in new section 92M. Clauses 28 and 38 of the Bill also provide the criteria which must be taken into account by the Tribunal in considering whether to approve a transaction. In particular, the clauses provide the grounds on which the Tribunal may refuse an application for the approval of a transaction, in whole or in part where an application is lodged in accordance with section 90J or 92F. These are:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) in the case of a purchaser acquiring or increasing a 'major' interest in the licence: If the Tribunal would be empowered to refuse consent to the transfer of that licence to the applicant. This provision recognises that a major share transaction affecting a licensee and a transfer of the licence are, in practical terms, similar, and the Tribunal would consider the same public interest criteria and other criteria as are provided for in clause 19, that is, section 89A dealing with transfers. </PARA>
<PARA> (ii) in the case of a purchaser acquiring any interest in the licence: If the licence has been granted within the previous two years. This provision is intended to preserve the integrity of the licence grant process, by preventing an unsuccessful applicant for a licence from taking over the company of the successful applicant. </PARA>
<PARA> (iii) in the case of a purchaser acquiring a minor interest, or any other applicant acquiring an indirect interest through the purchaser: If the applicant does not comply with the public interest criteria. This provision applies the criteria in a more appropriate way to minor and indirect interests than if the acquisition were equated with licence transfers, and takes into account:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the effect the transaction will have on the capacity of the holder of the licence to comply with the conditions of the licence and the written undertakings given to the Tribunal in relation to program services;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) whether the applicant is a fit and proper person to hold a licence and, as far as is relevant, has the necessary financial, technical and management capacities to carry out the requirements of a licence; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the degree of concentration of influence either directly or indirectly, on commercial radio and television stations, in a non-metropolitan area. </PARA>
<PARA>These streamlined procedures and guidelines will provide adequate controls on the ownership of radio and television. The Tribunal's approval will be necessary for the acquisition or increase of a prescribed interest, and the Tribunal will retain a discretion to consider an acquisition in the context of a public inquiry. At the same time the share market will be freed from unnecessary restrictions, but adequate checks will remain to discourage 'trading' in licences. </PARA>
<PARA> I should like to make two further points. Firstly, the Government has decided that the new provisions relating to approval of share transactions will apply only to transactions taking place after commencement of this legislation. Clause 50 gives effect to this decision. Secondly, in 1965 when the last substantial amendments were made to the ownership limitations, special provision was made for persons holding interests in excess of the new limitations, such that those interests could be retained as long as they were not increased or restructured. The commercial environment has changed since 1965. Companies locked in by sub-section 92 (3) have been at a disadvantage in adjusting to the market place. The Government believes that there should not be immediate application of the new share transaction procedures to those few companies whose interests remain frozen under sub-section 92 (3). Accordingly, new section 92FAB provides that the purchase of shares in these companies will be subject to the prior approval of the Tribunal. This restriction ceases on 1 July 1983, when the companies covered by section 92FAB will become subject to the same share transaction procedures as any other company. </PARA>
<PARA>Loan Interest and Registered Lenders</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Under the existing Act, loan interests in a television station may result in a lender acquiring a prescribed interest in a licence. In some cases this will restrict opportunities to obtain finance, except by bank overdraft, to which exemption already applies, when in practice the investor might only be able to influence a licence where a licensee defaults on a loan. New section 91C-clause 31 of the Bill-empowers the Tribunal to register approved lenders and so exclude them from the prescribed interest provisions of the Act provided the Tribunal is satisfied that a person will not be in a position to exercise, directly or indirectly, a significant influence on any company holding a licence. In circumstances where a registered lender used a loan interest to exercise undue control over a licensee the Tribunal could deregister the lender. The lender would then be subject to the prescribed interest provisions applying to loan interests. </PARA>
<PARA>Variation of Limits on Permissible Holdings</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> New section 91D-clause 31 of the Bill-addresses the problem of breaches of section 92 of the Act by third parties acquiring excess prescribed interests as a result of share transactions by other persons. Experience has shown that an investor can be put in breach of the Act through the purchase of shares by another party in which the investor is a shareholder, because of the tracing provisions of the Act. Problems of third party breaches of the Act have arisen particularly with institutional investors, because of their large and diversified portfolio shareholdings. </PARA>
<PARA> New section 91D provides that any person wishing to hold an interest of from 5 per cent up to 10 per cent, on any test, in a television licence without it being considered as a prescribed interest may apply to the Tribunal for a certificate authorising them to do so. However, the benefits of the section will be extended only to persons acquiring an interest in a television licence which operates in an area where there is at least one other commercial television station-that is, the five mainland State capitals-and then only if those persons can satisfy the Tribunal that the interest in question will not give rise to a person exercising, either directly or indirectly, a significant influence on the licensee company. Clause 31 of the Bill -incorporating both section 91 and section 91D-will commence on a date to be proclaimed. Some preliminary work by the Tribunal is necessary to enable introduction of these provisions. However, the Government will be looking to proclaim this provision as soon as practicable. </PARA>
<PARA>Foreign Shareholdings</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The existing sections 90G and 92D of the Act restrict ownership of shares, but not voting rights, in licensee companies by any individual non-resident to 15 per cent, and by the aggregate of non-resident shareholders to 20 per cent, of issued share capital. The interpretation of the provision has presented difficulties because of the lack of definition of 'resident' and the meaning of 'control'-that is, whether it is commercial control, 50 per cent of votes, or control as defined in the Act, 15 per cent of votes and shares. These sections have been redrafted to provide a redefinition of restrictions on foreign shareholdings to provide that only Australian citizens and companies in which Australian citizens hold more than 50 per cent of the votes and/or shares may be 'in a position to control' a licensee company. Clause 53 is a transitional provision for non-resident shareholdings, enabling residents who are not Australian citizens to retain any interests they hold at commencement which comply with the existing provisions of the Act. I should like to emphasise that apart from the alteration of 'resident' to 'Australian citizen' and the introduction of voting rights as a relevant interest, this new provision simply restates the interpretation which has in fact been applied to the existing sections 90G and 92D. </PARA>
<PARA>Provisions Relating to Enforcement and Penalty Provisions</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The changes proposed by the Bill to the ownership or control provisions will produce a system which gives considerably more flexibility to licensees and persons acquiring interests in licences. The Government expects strict compliance with the new provisions. To this end existing sanctions and penalties have been strengthened substantially. New section 92N in clause 40 provides for the Tribunal to give directions for the purpose of securing disposal of excess interests if it is satisfied that a person has breached the provisions of Division 2 or 3 of Part IV of the Act by the acquisition of shares, debenture or loan interests. Directions given under clause 40 will be enforceable in the Federal Court. Additionally, the Bill provides in clauses 40 and 46 that non-compliance with directions will attract substantially higher penalties than those presently in force. </PARA>
<PARA>Australian Broadcasting Commission Merchandising and Contractual Activities</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Clauses 7 and 8 of the Bill amend merchandising and contractual provisions relating to the operations of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. These provisions will enable the ABC to make, promote, circulate or sell non-literary matter associated with its programs. Clause 8 allows the ABC to enter into contracts for the sale of its programs without Ministerial approval. This delegation is essential for the quick negotiation of contracts.</PARA>
<PARA>Other Minor Amendments</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains a number of other provisions which are either consequential to the changes outlined or are minor changes which update and standardise provisions to accord with current legislative practice. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed changes I have outlined to the ownership or control provisions will be the first major alterations for 16 years, yet there have been significant developments in the industry over that time. These changes, together with the introduction of supplementary licences for radio stations, will provide a sound basis for the continued development of broadcasting in the coming decade without undue constraint on commercial activity. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is the first step to be taken in implementing the Government's decision to amalgamate the Australian Capital Territory Totalizatory Agency Board, the Liquor Licensing Board and the Poker Machine Licensing Board and thereby to rationalise the number of statutory authorities in the Territory. The proposed authority will bring together a range of like and interrelated functions leading to a more effective and efficient co-ordination of gambling and liquor controls. The amalgamation offers scope for administrative efficiency with the sharing of common facilities and computer services. </PARA>
<PARA> The new Authority will consist of five members, including a chairman and deputy chairman. No specific membership qualifications are prescribed but because of the important community implications of the Authority's activities I propose that it should include a member of the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly and a legal practitioner. The Bill includes a number of transfer arrangements and savings provisions to facilitate the establishment of the new Authority. It vests all the assets and liabilities of the TAB and the Poker Machine Licensing Board in the Authority and protects the employment conditions of TAB staff. The rights of the public servants who service the Liquor Licensing and Poker Machine Licensing Boards will not be affected under the Bill. Once the legislation is in operation and the new Authority constituted, the Government will consult with it on the further changes that might be necessary to facilitate the amalgamation process.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I was interrupted by the impending adjournment last Thursday, I had just explained that I was not going to deal in detail with the reduction in funding for health care entailed in this legislation. That will be done in detail by Senator Grimes. But I had made a few general observations, and I want to make a few more, about the changes that the Government has made, the most important of which is that this is not a cost reduction measure as far as the Commonwealth is concerned. The net effect of the changes will be that the Commonwealth will be some $340m a year worse off than it would have been without the changes. The reason that on a net basis the changes are costly to the Commonwealth in spite of reduced payments to the States is that health insurance premiums will, from now on, be tax deductible. Provided a person is in a so-called voluntary or more accurately, private health fund, medical costs will be subsidised to the extent of 30 per cent directly by the Commonwealth and to the extent of 32 per cent or, more accurately, something like 24 per cent on a net basis, by the Commonwealth through the taxation system because premiums paid to private health funds will be deductible to arrive at taxable income. Other medical expenses incurred by people who are not members of a private health fund will neither be tax deductible in practice nor attract a Commonwealth subsidy. The only exception will be if total deductions of an individual taxpayer are in excess of $1,590.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is not a measure of encouraging self-reliance; it is a device to subsidise and provide a captive market for private insurance funds. It is also a device to encourage the expansion of private hospitals when there is already, on a national basis, a surplus of hospital capacity. It is a device to guarantee the incomes of doctors operating on a fee-for-service basis. The theory upon which this dreadful policy is based is that of fiscal deterrents-that unless people are charged in an obvious and noticeable way for medical services they will over-use those services. It is ironic that the Bill should have been debated last Friday, the same day that the Liberal member for Moore, Mr Hyde, had an article in the Melbourne Age headed 'A Dry explains his viewpoint' in which, among other things, Mr Hyde said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . an a priori, or doctrinal, position should stand a test of efficacy: It must work in practice. If it doesn't then there is something wrong with the theory and it should be revised.'</PARA>
<PARA>It is ironic that that viewpoint should be published on the day that the Government was having debated these measures which are based on the fiscal deterrent theory-that unles people are charged directly for health services they will over-use them. In other words, the Government assumes we are a nation of hypochondriacs. Apart from any argument there may be about that, the fiscal deterrent theory is in fact cancelled by the provision of private insurance because the nexus between the service which the patient may or may not demand and the payment for that service is broken. Once there is any sort of insurance-whether it be through the so-called voluntary funds, the private funds or on a national basis-that nexus is broken no matter which way we look at it. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is providing a financial deterrent so strong that virtually everybody who can afford it will be in one of these voluntary funds. So the Government thereby destroys the rationale of its own policy and there is a fundamental contradiction between the hypothesis upon which the Government policy is based and the details of the policy itself. Even overlooking that fundamental illogicality it is well known to anyone who has looked even superficially at this question that the great majority of the really expensive medical services involving surgery and/or hospitalisation are initiated not by hypochondriacs but by doctors. These provisions again will certainly provide no financial deterrent to doctors to the use of that sort of service; they will provide a financial incentive to use it. </PARA>
<PARA> The empirical evidence to which Mr Hyde attributes such respect shows that in the area of health services market forces are not efficient. Market forces are efficient in many instances. The empirical evidence clearly shows that they are not efficient in the area of health services. The empirical evidence shows that, for example, in the area of elective surgery-tonsillectomies, appendectomies and so on-the Australian rate of tonsillectomies is about three times as high as the rate in the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom having predominantly a panel system and Australia having predominantly a fee for service system. Of course, most frightening of all is the experience in the United States of America, which has the extreme free market medical system, where operations which are not only superfluous but also, in many cases, actually damaging are encouraged and where there is a very high level of health expenditure and a relatively low standard of health care. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the more absurd manifestations of the United States policy came out recently when it was reported that American women who are assessed-that is, assessed by the doctors and the hospitals which would provide the services and make the profit from them-to be at risk of having breast cancer will have preventive mastectomies performed. That is what lies at the end of the road on which this Government has commenced to travel. If medicine is to be marketed like Coca-Cola or Blue Omo the result will be higher costs and lower health standards. The changes contained in this Bill are a move in that direction. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I wish to address myself to the States (Tax Sharing and Health Grants) Bill 1981 in particular and to make some reference to tax sharing arrangements. Contained in this legislation is some formalising of an agreement made at the Premiers Conference. However, as I understand from Press reports, this week we can expect to see tabled in the Parliament the Commonwealth Grants Commission report on tax relativities. I have also read in the newspapers that after the Premiers Conference scheduled for 19 June there will be an additional meeting which will deal with this issue. I seek, on the general subject of tax sharing, to make comment in relation to the subject of tax sharing arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States and also to take the opportunity to make some specific response to cases that have been put in the Senate in relation to tax sharing and my State in particular.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 14 May, Senator Hamer gave the Senate a full account of events in Australian fiscal federalism with particular emphasis on the current review of State relativities being undertaken by the Commonwealth Grants Commission. As I have said, we understand that the report on that matter will be tabled in Parliament this week. I for one look forward to that report with some eagerness. In the course of this account Senator Hamer outlined in some detail the plight of his home State, Victoria, which he saw as having been severely disadvantaged under current financial arrangements with the Commonwealth. I cannot fault the honourable senator's account of the history of Federal-State financial relations up to and including the recent Premiers Conference, nor can I fault his outline of the principle to be followed by the Grants Commission in its review of State relativities. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it seemed to me that Senator Hamer had come to the conclusion that the Grants Commission has no role to play in the determination of State relativities. In this regard, whilst he claimed that the concept of differential payments to the States is not in dispute, but rather the amount, he concluded that Victoria should receive no less per capita than any other State-in other words, the differential payment should be zero. It would seem to me that, whilst his theoretical understanding of the reasons why there would be differences between relative revenue raising capacities and expenditure needs of the States is basically sound, his understanding of how these factors impact on the States in the practical sense is deficient. I think it is worth mentioning that we are probably all very well aware that the Victorian Government has been waging a very vigorous campaign on the subject of tax relativities and making claims in relation to its State. This campaign was echoed in Senator Hamer's speech. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not my desire nor my intention on this occasion to traverse the background of Federal-State financial relations, but simply to rectify some mistaken ideas about the plight of Victoria versus the too-favourable deal which, it is claimed, is the lot of my State, Queensland. I do not dispute the fact that household income in Victoria is the highest in Australia, nor the fact that the differential between the States has diminished in recent years. However, I believe that we should look behind this simplistic situation and ask ourselves why Victoria is in this advantageous position. The answer is quite simple-protection. Senator Hamer dismissed protection as a significant benefit to Victoria. Indeed, he indicated that the Victorian Government gains only $12 per capita annually from protection, or approximately $48m through payroll tax. It is claimed that this is the only benefit that Victoria receives. I venture to say that this estimate is a gross underestimation. Indeed, protection pervades the entire fabric of the Victorian economy. In pure dollar terms industry in Victoria is subsidised through tariff protection to the extent of over $750m annually. </PARA>
<PARA> Looked at in another way, Victoria received tariff assistance which was estimated in 1977-78-the year for which the most recent figures are available-at $430 per capita compared with the Australian average of $289 per capita, whereas Queensland received only $123 per capita. Again, Victoria has 27 per cent of the population but receives 41 per cent of total tariff assistance. Whilst Queensland has 16 per cent of the population it receives only 7 per cent of the total tariff assistance. These figures are outlined by the Industries Assistance Commission in 'Information Paper No. 1, Trends in the Structure of Assistance to Manufacturing', published in May 1980. These subsidies to Victoria not only add to the cost in Queensland of purchasing Victorian manufactured goods, but also provide Victoria with a higher taxable base. The aggregation and concentration of head office operations in Victoria, which continue in operation only through heavy subsidies, provide Victoria with the benefits of dutiable transactions which occur not only within that State but also in relation to the activities throughout Australia of those large organisations. If we were to reduce tariffs-Senator Hamer proposes this-I suggest that the effect on the Victorian Budget would be far greater than the loss of $48m in payroll tax. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the comparisons made of the percentage of income tax revenue returned to the States, I point out that, as I indicated earlier, Victoria's taxation revenues are inflated by the existence of heavily subsidised industries. Furthermore, while States receive a percentage of personal income taxation back from the Commonwealth, their contribution to Commonwealth revenues and to the economy generally is far greater than personal income tax alone. In this regard profits from unsubsidised industries in Queensland and Western Australia add significantly to national economic wealth, as do the substantial export earnings generated again by both Queensland and Western Australia. Indeed, if it were not for the export surpluses that Queensland and Western Australia earn we could not afford the tariffs which presently obtain so advantageously for Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> As to Senator Hamer's contention that Queensland has done well out of the tax sharing arrangements, I point out that Queensland has been in receipt of a special grant from the Commonwealth on the recommendation of the Commonwealth Grants Commission in every year since 1971-72. These special grants are assessed only after comprehensive inquiry, with evidence under oath, by this expert independent body and are based on a direct comparison between Queensland and the standard States of New South Wales and Victoria. I can assure honourable senators that if they wish to peruse the detailed working papers of the Commission they will discover that Queensland has been assessed as being entitled to supplementary assistance not only because of its relative fiscal position compared with New South Wales but also because of its fiscal situation relative to Victoria. Further, whilst it is true that Queensland has no statutory corporation payments, no petrol tax, no tobacco tax and no probate duty whatsoever, the Grants Commission, through its complex procedures, calculates notional revenues for Queensland based on the taxation rate applicable in the standard States. In other words, it assesses what Queensland would raise if it had those taxes and incorporates this in the assessment it makes of Queensland revenue and expenditure needs. It even calculates the revenue that Queensland would raise if it had poker machines-a form of taxation which, contrary to the claim that taxes in Victoria currently cover every field of taxation available to the States, does not exist in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> Having given this general background to the comparison between Queensland and Victoria I shall now comment on some of the more specific matters raised by Senator Hamer. Firstly, I shall talk about payroll tax. In this regard it is disappointing that Senator Hamer sought leave to incorporate in Hansard a table on payroll tax which indicated a source which is just not correct. It is possible that Senator Hamer made an error; however, without a correction of that error we must take his speech at face value. If he did make an error I cannot deduce just what the simple nature of the error was. His table on 1979-80 revenue from State payroll tax indicates that it came from Budget Paper No. 7 1979-80. The honourable senator must have a different set of Budget papers to the one I have, because I can find no reference in Budget Paper No. 7 to State payroll receipts. Furthermore, the figures indicated in the table, regardless of their source, are incorrect. I seek leave to rectify those inaccuracies by incorporating in Hansard the correct statistics derived from the public Budget Papers for 1980-81 for each of the States. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I comment just briefly on the table, which shows that the payroll tax per capita payment in 1979-80 for Victoria was $142.77 and for Queensland, $113.56. I outlined earlier in my speech the significance of payroll tax payments per capita in relation to tariff policies. Moreover, whilst Senator Hamer correctly stated that payroll tax is uniformly levied at 5 per cent he neglected to make reference to the exemption levels which each State allows. As a consequence of differences in industry concentration as well as employment numbers between States these exemption levels affect quite differently the various States' capacities to raise revenue from this source. Indeed, the Grants Commission, in its 1978-79 assessment of Queensland's special grant, determined that Queensland's needs, using Victoria as the standard, amounted to $58m. In other words, Queensland's taxable capacity in this area was such that it would fall short of Victoria's per capita receipts by $58m, even with the same tax rate and the same exemption levels. Also with regard to payroll tax I cannot accept that Victoria was disadvantaged when payroll tax was transferred to the States. I do not deny that relatively more would have been deducted from Victoria's financial assistance grant base than would have been deducted in Queensland, but Victoria had the capacity to raise more from this revenue source than did Queensland. Indeed, Victoria would have been advantaged over other States in that the States increased the level of payroll tax subsequent to its transfer and this increase would have provided a greater benefit to Victoria than to other States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was surprised that Senator Hamer, in his discussion of hospital funding, referred to discrimination against Victoria in favour of Queensland. I am not claiming that the distribution of hospital funds by the Commonwealth Government is necessarily equitable. The Jamison report hit the nail on the head when it pointed out how the cost sharing arrangements rewarded the expensive and punished the efficient. It is to be regretted that this feature of the arrangements is to be perpetuated for another year at least under the interim arrangements that are applying pending the Grants Commission review. There is no question that Victoria and Queensland are disadvantaged by this situation, and even though Queensland's position has received some recognition by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) offering a further $16m, the Queensland payment from the Commonwealth will still be significantly below the average on a per capita basis, as will Victoria's. </PARA>
<PARA> For the record, I cite the following estimated per capita payments from the Commonwealth to the States in 1981-82 for hospital and certain other health services of a relatively minor nature. The figures are derived from statements recently distributed by the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) and take account of the extra $16m granted to Queensland in recognition of its low per capita payment. They show that New South Wales will receive a per capita payment of $93, Victoria $80, Queensland $75, South Australia $91, Western Australia $118, Tasmania $92 and the Northern Territory $168. The national average is $89 a head. Furthermore, the common position of Queensland and Victoria is brought about for quite different reasons. It is important to note that Victoria, despite its relatively small size, concentrated population, higher level of hospital fee recoveries and greater incidence of private hospital services has not been able to reduce its net per capita hospital operating costs below those of Queensland, which are the lowest in the country. This is despite the fact that Queensland has an above average number of hospital and nursing home beds-a necessity because of the dispersion of our population-and the fact that we have the highest number of aged people, relative to the population, of any State. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Hamer also discussed the matter of revenues from mineral resources. In this regard there has been considerable Press comment in recent weeks about the rich resource developments currently taking place in Queensland and Western Australia and that the economic rent to these States from the exploitation of such resources should lessen these States' dependence on Commonwealth funds. I do not argue with this argument in principle. However, the value of mineral royalties and surrogates such as rail freight profits as a contribution towards State revenues needs to be kept in perspective. For example, in 1979-80 Queensland's revenue from mining royalties was $73m, not $78m as quoted by Senator Hamer, plus $86m in rail profits, not the $108m quoted. That is $159m in total which represents a mere 7.2 per cent of the State's recurrent Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, while the revenue to the State from increasing coal production is likely to trend upwards, the volatile nature of returns from resource developments should be borne in mind. The terms of such enterprises are vitally dependent upon the vagaries of the world markets and Australia has no monopoly powers with any of her resources. A recent example in Queensland of projects which upon commencement appeared to be very attractive and viable but which subsequently turned sour include the production of nickel at Greenvale and phosphate at Duchess. The latter ceased production and the former would not have survived without intervention by the Queensland Government. With regard to the treatment of mineral rail line profits and mineral royalties, Queensland, in its case to the Grants Commission, has never denied that mineral line profits are, in essence, surrogate royalties. However, what I understand it has strenuously argued is that its inventiveness or ingenuity in devising a method for financing the establishment of its rail infrastructure and its successful negotiations with project developers reflects an extra effort to raise State finances not made by the other States. Surely a State should not be penalised when it comes to receiving a share of the tax reimbursement grants because of its extraordinary attempts to raise finances for itself. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the relative needs for police, I note that Senator Hamer has quoted from the Victorian Government's submission to the Grants Commission on the relative police staffing ratios necessary in various population densities. I point out to the Senate that those ratios are based on conditions in Great Britain and Victoria which are not representative of the geographic distribution of population in other parts of Australia, especially Queensland. In this regard, experience in Queensland has shown, and the Grants Commission has accepted this to date, that population dispersion and distances are highly significant in the determination of police staffing needs. Accordingly, in Queensland the police staffing ratios are the reverse of those proposed for Victoria. So far as railways are concerned, Queensland would very much like to be in the same situation as Victoria with its highly concentrated population and small area. However, this is not the case in Queensland and it is unavoidable that State country railways will make substantial losses. In this regard it is interesting to note that Senator Hamer considers that large losses on passenger services in Victoria are acceptable because the Victorian Government is committed to running those services, but at the same time considers it inappropriate that large losses occur in Queensland's rural railway network, even though that State is committed to running these in the same manner as Victoria is in running its suburban passenger services. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now focus some attention on the share of total payments to the States that Victoria receives and particularly on the way in which Senator Hamer and apparently also the Victorian Government see that State as having been hard done by over the past two decades. Senator Hamer started with the premise that it was appropriate for his State to receive almost its population share of the total grant in 1958-59. However, I find this starting point difficult as I am unable to reconcile how a state like Victoria, with an area of 228,000 square kilometres, 91 per cent of its population within 200 kilometres of Melbourne and its acknowledged high per capita household income base, could expect to receive a grant equal in per capita terms to Queensland which has an area of 1,729,000 square kilometres and only 65 per cent of its population within 200 kilometres of Brisbane. Senator Hamer presented no evidence that demonstrated that the 1958-59 distribution of grants was equitable when regard was had to the criterion of this fiscal equalisation. To the contrary, the fact that over the years other States have received special grants on the basis of a comparison with Victoria seems to indicate that the Grants Commission at least did not regard this as so. The mere fact that Victoria once received a percentage of the pool equivalent to its population share is not sacrosanct. Indeed, Senator Hamer provides the explanation of why Victoria receives less than its population share. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>The arguments for Victoria's receiving such a low proportion of income tax funds can only be that Victoria has a significantly higher State taxing capacity than other States or that the cost of providing equivalent services is significantly less in Victoria than in other States, or both. </PARA>
<PARA>I suggest to the Senate that these are precisely the reasons that Victoria receives a less-than-population share. With regard to the raw deal that Victoria is supposedly receiving in the area of specific purpose payments and works and borrowing programs, I can only repeat that Senator Hamer must have a Budget Paper No. 7 different from the one that I have. I seek leave to incorporate the correct table in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA>Honourable senators will see, from perusing that table, that there is not the inequity claimed. In closing, I stress that Queensland has, over the past decade, received no more than its just entitlement from tax sharing and has been able to achieve this only through constant application for grants and special assistance which entail a great deal of extra work and submission to searching inquiry from the Commonwealth Grants Commission. If in future years Queensland's revenue raising capacity is increased at a greater rate than the other States, we would accept that there should be an appropriate adjustment to our share of the tax reimbursement grants. However, it is unlikely that these movements are sufficiently marked at this point to have a serious impact on the recommendation of the current review. Furthermore, we argue that the current relativities do not place adequate weight on the cost imposed on Queensland by virtue of its vast population dispersion, the small scale of many of its operations and the resultant higher unit costs associated therewith. </PARA>
<PARA> I regret that I have had to raise this issue in this chamber, particularly as the Grants Commission has not yet reported on its findings. However, there has been an orchestrated plan by Victoria to attempt to influence the decision of the Grants Commission and the Commonwealth Government by the application of subtle political pressure. This campaign has been mounting in recent months and even extends to the publication of a brochure by the Victorian Government. I also note that recently the Premier of Victoria, Mr Lindsay Thompson, has made direct approaches to the Prime Minister on the matter. I believe that we should let the Commission make its report without pressure at the political level. In any case, I am sure that it will not be swayed. </PARA>
<PARA> The real issue quite simply is that Victoria cannot expect to get a population share of tax sharing payments for two basic reasons. Firstly, it has a higher than average capacity to raise revenue from its own State taxes and, secondly, it is such a compact State that its expenditure on State services will be below the all-States averages. Furthermore, we must not lose sight of the fact that a substantial part of the higher taxable capacity results from the massive tariff subsidisation received in Victoria from citizens in all other States of Australia, and Queensland and Western Australia in particular. During Senator Hamer's speech in the Senate, Senator Thomas and I attempted, by way of interjection, to raise this issue with Senator Hamer. He, as is the wont of Victorians in discussing this subject, waved it aside and said that tariffs are not applicable. If we so radically restructure our tax sharing base, as Senator Hamer suggests, if that is the recommendation of the Grants Commission when it reports to the Parliament this week on tax relativities, then I suggest that there are other issues which would need to be opened. It would be necessary to look at just how that tax sharing base is arrived at and why average household incomes, which consistently show Queensland and Western Australia to be at the bottom of the list, turn out the way they do. In short, I have sought to inject into the debate on tax sharing arrangements with the States, both for the present and for the future, some of the political and financial realities that the Government must face. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Far be it from me to intervene in the internecine debate between Senator Martin and her colleague Senator Hamer on the Government side. Senator Martin in fact gives those of us on the Opposition side of the House even more heart in opposing this sort of legislation, an action which we take in concert with her Premier and all other State Premiers. If I may just comment in passing, I certainly agree with Senator Martin who said that Senator Hamer's proposal that we should have tax sharing arrangements based on a per capita basis is quite contrary to the whole concept of federalism in this country. I also find it strange for Senator Martin to make such a complaint on the basis of Victoria's increased capacity to raise taxes when she, first of all, comes from a State which is willing to forgo large amounts of tax revenue by willy-nilly abolishing probate and estate duties and whose Premier has such a concern for Federation that he considers, as he has said in remarks on many occasions, that Tasmania is a foreign country and in fact states that anyone who favours Tasmanian meat exports, for instance, is favouring a foreign country rather than his or her own State.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> I wish to confine my remarks on this legislation to Part III of the States (Tax Sharing and Health Grants) Bill which in fact deals with health grants to the States and represents the first legislative step towards the latest health and health insurance scheme to be inflicted on the people in this country by the present Government. I repeat that these proposals were in fact opposed by all State Ministers for Health as were the tax sharing arrangements opposed by all the State Premiers at the last Premiers Conference. We of the Labor Party are in strange company, but we believe we are on good grounds, in opposing this legislation. This piece of legislation is the introduction of the fifth health package which has been produced by this Government-a government, I remind the Senate, whose pledge before coming to power was in fact: 'We will preserve Medibank'. It represents not only a turning back to the pre-Medibank days but also a positive effort by the Government to force the citizens of this country into the private health system and into the private insurance funds where in fact wealth will buy privileged health care. It is the first step back to the days of neglect of public funding of public health facilities which will lead to the public squalor and the private affluence that we had in the health system in the past-a system which concerned not only the Opposition at the time but also the Liberal-Country Party governments from 1969 through to 1972. Apart from the inadequacy of the new system which is introduced, the confusion, the inefficiency and chaos in the health systems in this country are compounded where there need be no such chaos, inefficiency and confusion. </PARA>
<PARA> Under this legislation, the States will receive a block grant for health funds to replace the grants under the previous hospital sharing agreements, the community health programs, the programs for women's refuges about which I will have more to say later and the school dental health program. These grants are not to be earmarked. In other words, there is no earmarking of the moneys. The funds need not be directed in any particular direction. In respect of Tasmania and South Australia, the first a Labor State and the other a Liberal State, the governments have wisely decided to persist with their present hospital cost sharing arrangements until they expire. They have taken this decision for the simple and sensible reason that the new arrangements are less generous. The Government funding in these health areas will in fact be some 16 per cent lower. In respect of the hospital portion of the grant, the grant is judged on a base figure on hospital costs which, as Senator Martin said in her speech, is a varying figure in each State. In fact, in each State there was a loss on the operations of hospitals last year. So, we already start off on a low base. Built into the grant is an inflation figure of 10 per cent, which on every prediction will be inadequate for the forthcoming year. These moneys will be discontinued by some 60 per cent of the assessment of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) of what each State can raise from hospital charges. These are that the States will charge $80 a day for a shared ward, $110 a day for a private ward and $15 a day for what is called an out-patient service-an entity that we on the Opposition side do not believe is defined in this legislation. It was not defined by the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) in another place, primarily because he did not appear to defend this legislation in that place. He left it to the Treasurer (Mr Howard). This is obviously causing confusion amongst health funds. Where will, for instance, reimbursement for these out-patient services come from? Will it come from the medical insurance funds or the hospital insurance funds? This is something of which we are uncertain and of which everyone seems to be uncertain. </PARA>
<PARA> These changes to the health funding arrangements were introduced, firstly, without any proper consultation with the States; secondly, the basis of the calculations which were used were disputed by all the States, by every State health department and every State Minister for Health; thirdly, they clearly will not result in any decrease in total health costs and in fact by increasing the number of people in private health care and increasingly encouraging fee for service medicine may, and almost certainly will, increase costs. The changes will reintroduce the system of bad debts, particularly bad debts to public hospitals, at the level that existed before 1975 when Medibank was introduced and they introduced a demeaning and complicated means test for patients in public hospitals in some States, particularly Tasmania and Queensland, for the first time ever. The State Ministers, Labor and conservative, at their meeting on 8 May had this to say: 'We observe we have never been consulted in the real sense of the word. At no time prior to its recent decision has the Commonwealth indicated any clear intention to the States.' At the meeting with the State Ministers to discuss these arrangements, the Federal Minister for Health was asked to produce the figures on which his calculations were based. The meeting was here in Canberra. He replied that he could not do so because the figures were 'over at Woden'. The South Australian Government at least, and the others in agreement, offered to have its officers sit down with officers from the Federal Department of Health and recalculate the figures with the Government and, if the figures were wrong, they would suffer the penalty. The Minister replied that it did not matter as the figures could be fixed up at the end of the financial year anyway. </PARA>
<PARA> This is new federalism at its worst. This sort of distribution of taxpayers' funds at a meeting like this is more suited to a banana republic than what is allegedly an advanced nation. We have a system which is designed to force the States to charge what the Commonwealth wants them to charge, to introduce a means test that the Commonwealth wants and that some of the States do not want, to introduce a funding system that the States say is based on shonky figures, which allegation they are willing to demonstrate is so. The Commonwealth defends all this without putting up adequate argument, without putting up adequate figures, because it has the purpose of introducing a health scheme which will assist the private health industry particularly the private health funds run by the very same people who supply free advertising, donations and free workers at election time for the conservative government and supplied at contributors' expense. This, I suggest, is political patronage at its worst and should be condemned by everyone in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has a view of health care which is held in very few countries, certainly very few advanced countries. The Minister continually compares hospital care and hospital costs with costs in expensive hotels and motels. He forgets or never mentions that the people who stay in expensive hotels do so by choice. They usually are still earning their income while they are there and in many cases, such as in the case of businessmen and in fact in the case of politicians, they have their expenses paid while they are there. The opposite applies to a hospital patient, who frequently is not earning while he is in hospital and is not there by choice. The Government has a view that the user pays principle is appropriate to health funding in this country, forgetting that the user in fact is often someone who is chronically ill, a family member with children or a person with a recurrent illness. The person in hospital is not there by choice. As Senator Walsh pointed out, the choice is not made by the patient. The patient is there from necessity or from what he sees as a necessity because his doctor says that it is necessary for him to be there. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Government has a view that market forces will in some way control costs in health care, and that in particular-we have had this repeated many times in this chamber and in other places-hospital costs can be kept down by increasing the fees paid by people who go to hospital and that therefore, in some mystical way, we will be able to cut down the number of hospital beds which are occupied. I repeat that the choice of hospitalisation is not made by the patient. It is not like a situation with a motel. The decision is almost entirely made by the doctor. The market in this situation is in the control of the middle man, and the middle man in fact will benefit from the person who is in hospital. We wonder what has happened to the community rating principle-a principle which has been espoused in this place in the past by the present Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Peter Baume, and which provided that for essential services whose need was out of the control of the patient or the citizen the principle of ability to pay through levy or direct taxation should apply. That principle simply does not suit those who benefit from the private health industry and therefore that principle is interred in this legislation. The Government is stepping out of responsibility for public hospitals in this country but is bending over backwards to direct people into private funds and private hospitals-private hospitals which are increasingly becoming foreign-owned and increasingly becoming known as hot bed hospitals, hospitals which deal with acute short term illnesses because they are more efficient at handling them and a bigger profit can be made from them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is making the criteria for assistance for disadvantaged persons in another piece of legislation more rigid and in fact is herding people more frequently into public hospitals. What we need is an efficient, effective and economical health system. We will not get it by increasing the number of people treated in this country on a fee for service basis, where the amount of money received depends on the performance of an individual service. We will not get it by turning the health system over to so-called market forces, when the people who are buying have very little knowledge or insufficient knowledge of what they are buying, and of the need for them to buy it. It is a retrograde step and that is why we are disturbed at and opposed to Part III of this legislation as far as the hospitals are concerned. The States are concerned because of the inadequacy of the base figure, the inadequacy of the inflation figure and what they see as the hopeless inadequacy of the amount they will be able to recover from patients. They realise, from years of experience, the difficulties which will arise in this situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Because my time is limited, I will deal now with one other aspect of Part III of this legislation. I wish to express our concern at the fate of funds which are directed to the States from the previous community health budget and, in particular, those funds which were directed to the States for the use of women's refuges. Women's refuges, as everyone in this chamber realises, provide a service which is utilised not only directly by the women and children in distress whom they serve but also by the authorities in each State-by local authorities, by federal governments, by the police departments, by the State welfare departments and by the Department of Social Security-which direct people in distress to women's refuges in every State. They are also utilised by the voluntary welfare agencies, which refer women in distress to these refuges. They are almost univerally, if not universally, run on a shoestring. The whole budget from the Government is less than $5m. In general, those who run the refuges are grossly underpaid, often with two or more sharing a salary. They work in conditions which are emotionally draining and physically unsatisfactory, and if the refuges were under the control of labour regulations and were unionised they would not be tolerated. Despite their use continually by community and government bodies, they are subject at times to denigration by some segments of the community, by honourable senators in this place and certainly more often in other places by State governments. It is for all these reasons-the emotionally draining problems faced by people who work in these refuges, the extreme difficulties they work under, the financial difficulties involved, the long hours these people work and the unsatisfactory conditions they work under-that there was the demonstration here last week. No matter how inappropriate Government senators may consider the actions which were taken last week, no matter how disturbed the more sensitive souls in this Parliament may be by such a display of frustration and anger, the complaints are real and these people's problems are real and severe and will not go away. They perform a service for which they receive little recognition and they certainly receive inadequate support. </PARA>
<PARA> In this legislation they face another threat because the legislation provides that the money which was previously earmarked for women's refuges will be subsumed into the health grant and eventually will be subsumed into general purpose grants. This is a cause for concern because some State governments, particularly the Western Australian and Queensland governments, are hostile to the very existence of women's refuges, despite the fact that their agencies use them, and use them frequently. In the past, Queensland has refused to hand on federal funds for the purpose of women's centres and refuges and the Federal Government had to fund them direct. The present Western Australian Minister for Community Welfare, whose name appropriately is Mr Hassell, put so many restrictions on the distribution of these funds, particularly the child care funds, that life is made almost impossible for those who are trying to run these refuges. </PARA>
<PARA> A majority in this Parliament, I believe, recognise the needs for women's refuges. They recognise that when funding was introduced for women's refuges in the time of the Labor Government those moneys were directed to a worthy cause and what has happened since has demonstrated that they were fulfilling a previously unfulfilled need. We should insist that money previously earmarked for this purpose is directed to these shelters in the future and, if not, the Commonwealth should fund them directly and ensure that the funds go to them. In fact, we should insist that funds for these refuges are increased so that we have increasing support for these people who are doing a job which is recognised by all sections of the community. It is reasonable for us, as a parliament, to do so in the light of recent history. It is reasonable for us as a parliament to do so in view of some of the statements of the more conservative member of State governments. For this purpose, I foreshadow that in the Committee stage I will move an amendment expressing this Parliament's concern that this should be done. I would like to do this also in regard to funding rape crisis centres and health centres. As these are already funded by State funds it is not appropriate to move such an amendment directly to clauses in this legislation. I believe that the Federal Government should watch at all times what is happening to the funding of these centres and be willing to step in at any time to directly take over and fund these important organisations. If it does not, it will neglect a large number of people in the community. If we do not advance the situation which exists now so that women's refuges in fact are properly funded and are properly looked after, I believe we neglect an important section of the community. I foreshadow that in the Committee stages I, on behalf of the Opposition, will move such an amendment on the assumption, of course, that this most unsatisfactory legislation will pass the second reading stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address my remarks to the Local Government (Personal Income Tax Sharing) Amendment Bill 1981. The Opposition is in support of the Government in regard to this Bill because we support an active local government in Australia and an adequately funded role for local government as an equal partner in the three-tier system of government. Of course we support that. We find ourselves in fundamental disagreement with the policies being pursued by the Fraser Administration. I say that because it is clear that in its desire to wind down the public sector, not only are the States under pressure from the Fraser Government but also local government equally is required to cut back and reduce its services to the Australian people. Whilst this Bill provides machinery to allow local government a 2 per cent share in net personal income tax collection through general revenue assistance, it nevertheless fails to take into consideration the expanding role of local government which is so much a part of the way in which the system of government operates in this country. We support the Government because we believe this is only a first step in the need for government at the national level to encourage a more active Federal government involvement in funding local government generally throughout Australia. We see local government in an expanding role. This piece of legislation is assisting in that process and is not developing that process.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Labor's policy in respect of local government differs considerably from that of the Fraser Government. Firstly, we guarantee that the real level of funds made available for the purchasing power of local government will not fall below that of the previous year. Of course, it has to be recognised that in the Budgets of last year and of this year sufficient funds are not taking into account the level of inflation that is so apparent in our country. Particularly is that so in respect of road making and other essential services provided by local government. In fact, as the statistics show, the rate of increase in those areas is greater by far than the general rate of inflation. Secondly, Labor proposes that 30 per cent of general revenue assistance should be allocated on a per capita basis and 70 per cent on the basis of need as assessed by the Commonwealth Grants Commission. The reason is that such a method of distributing payments to local government would take proper account of the principle of equalisation with due regard to the differences in cost disabilities of regions as a result of population structures, area, geography, topography and so on. Thirdly, a Labor Government will provide an additional program of special block grants to areas of need. Surely that should be the basis upon which local government should be assisted by a central government. </PARA>
<PARA> There are, as we have said many times in this place, great differences in need between different regions of local government throughout our country. One only has to compare a municipality in a developed area on the north side of Sydney with the developing suburbs on the far western side of Sydney to see the comparisons which we regard ought to be taken into consideration by a national government prepared to accept its national responsibilities. Of course, since we first raised that relevant question some years back we now see that as a result of the direction in which certain policies are being pursued by the Fraser Administration-that is to say, in regions associated with resource development-a new factor is emerging which has not been taken into consideration by the mere passage of this legislation. There now are specific needs in certain areas with expanded industrial activity and population. I refer particularly to those regions which are affected by what is commonly called the resource boom in this country. We well recall the series of articles that have spoken about the problems in Gladstone, for example, and the problems in the Hunter Valley that obviously have occurred and will occur in those regions as a result of private sector activity, initiated in some cases by the Commonwealth Government and in others by State governments. Of course, that pattern has been repeated in a great number of regions throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> For a Commonwealth Government not to accept some areas of responsibility of Federal funding for these problems that are occurring is an abdication of responsibility. It is this abdication by an irresponsible government headed by Malcolm Fraser that causes us to be so critical of the Government's general direction. I refer to the migrant intake of some 80,000 to 90,000 per annum. When one relates that intake to the next 20 years or so one sees that one has to recognise the need, therefore, to duplicate our urban infrastructure. Consequently, this can be done only by either a Federal government accepting financial responsibility, by the taxpayers or, in this case, by the ratepayers accepting an undue proportion of the costs involved in that duplication. As we know, of course, the rating system is an unfair form of taxation insofar as it does not have regard to the ability of a person to pay. Rather, it is related in a great majority of cases to the value of the land rather than to income. As a result of policies pursued in Canberra by the Fraser Administration we see very drastic changes taking place in manufacturing activities; the closure of rail services, post offices, banks and other service sector activities. Changes are taking place in our population and in our demography. Changes are taking place on a location basis. We have some responsibility, therefore, as a national government, to take this into consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> Local government, therefore, in order to retain its viability, needs to be able to assess both the needs and the potential of the region over which it has responsibility. A sensible government should be able to intervene in these areas not only to enable the areas to fulfil their proper function of government but also to establish a viable and durable employment generating activity. That, of course, is ignored by the Fraser Administration. It is important to have an expanding local government because it is substantially the most labour intensive public sector in our country. Whilst we accept that these locally felt problems require local responses, they also require national responses as they are often problems which are not of local origin, as I have indicated. They are problems that will follow from broader decisions made not only by a Federal government but also by the corporate sector in our society. It is the corporate sector that decides to develop regions as a result of the exploitation of our natural resources. The corporate sector makes decisions based upon the location of an area and upon the nature and scale of investment. These matters are related to economic management into which the local authority has absolutely no input whatsoever, even though it is conceded that the States often are consulted as a result of the major decisions which materially alter a region. </PARA>
<PARA> Consequently, the problems to which I refer require co-operative intervention at the different levels of government and the active participation of regional communities. Obviously, if there are to be dramatic changes, such as have taken place in Gladstone, the local communities should be involved. As honourable senators know, the people of that region have just stated that they do not want any more private sector development. The thrust of this Government's approach to inter-government relations, especially between itself and the local level, is merely one involving a flow of money. That is all that this legislation seeks to do. Important as it is to have such funding, it bears no relationship to the problems created as a result of private and public sector activity. </PARA>
<PARA> The reductions in specific purpose grants have meant that there has been a reduction in the amount and quality of contract between bureaucrats at the different levels of government. Honourable senators will recall that during the term of the Whitlam Government there was close consultation in regard to the way in which the Grants Commission operated and on input of funds based upon need. Unfortunately, this Government has seen fit to undo practically all of the positive work done then, work which is so essential to a proper relationship between the three arms of government. The national Government has cut itself off from that essential contact which so greatly assists in the designing and implementation of programs that will meet real needs. After all, we are discussing the needs of people. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government, in all its philosophical statements, talks of the need for the citizen to have freedom of choice. In so many cases, the citizens of Australia are not consulted at all. They do not enjoy freedom of choice. The choice is made by the captains of industry, the corporate sector, often acting at the behest of Commonwealth or State governments. Thus, in the last few years we have seen the Fraser Government's withdrawal from the responsibility for expenditure in these areas, and a reduction in social services and the provision of social amenities. As a consequence, local government is forced into the position of either allowing services to run down or increasing rates in order to be able to continue to provide them. The problem has reached such dramatic proportions that the Labor Government of New South Wales, as a result of this abdication of responsibility, of the philosophical and ideological position of the Fraser Government, has put a ceiling on the amount of rate increases which local government may impose. The consequence is that local government is labouring under the task of providing an increasing range of services without adequate funds with which to do so. When one looks at what is happening in some of the newly developed areas, one shudders at the way in which citizens of our country are forced to live. Therefore, we are critical of this Government's whole approach to social needs in the majority of local government areas and in regional areas which have become larger and more neglected. </PARA>
<PARA> Local government is called upon to meet emergency housing needs, to provide children's services, to care for aged persons and to provide community information services. Hardly a local government authority escapes being called upon to fulfil some of these needs. In the shire in which I live the council is constantly being called upon by its citizens to provide community information services and the wider range of facilities upon which a modern community insists. In a nation that has the reputation of being a lucky country, that is claimed to be one of the richest countries in the world, why is there not a flow-on of these riches down to the grass roots level, so that ordinary people can benefit from the wealth that is being tapped by the corporate sector and especially the multinational companies that are bleeding the country white of the funds that could make possible in every region the provision of adequate community services. </PARA>
<PARA> For these reasons, local government authorities must devote a higher proportion of their outlay to the provision of infrastructure associated with resource projects or expanded commercial facilities. A month or six weeks ago, at a seminar conducted in Sydney by the Local Government Association, the problems facing local government, in developing regions in particular, were raised. One could only condemn the spectacle of the Treasurer (Mr Howard) suggesting that local government should tighten its belt and enable funds to be made available to the private sector so that an attractive investment climate could be created. The Treasurer made absolutely no commitment at that important seminar, to the need of local government to become an actual sharing partner in the development of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent years we have seen a heavy increase in the borrowing programs of the Federal Government and semi-governmental authorities but in the last few weeks, as honourable senators are aware, the Fraser Government has indicated that the States must cut back on infrastructure borrowing programs which are needed by local government and semi-governmental authorities. The squeeze is now being put on the funds generally available in the country for the provision of these services. I do not believe that this Government really knows where it is going in respect of these matters. A year or two ago it was claiming that Australia was on the verge of a major industrial and economic development of tremendous magnitude. The States took the Prime Minister at his word and began to plan for this great industrial development. But when they reached the stage of beginning to plan, in conjunction with local governments, the provision of the funds needed for the development of the infrastructure for the regions which were such an essential part of the Fraser Government's philosophical position, suddenly we found the Treasurer and the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) suggesting-as I understand a submission will be made to the special Premiers Conference of 19 June-that the States should examine the Government's new parameters for infrastructure borrowing with a view to their reducing the amount of borrowing undertaken for that purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> If that proposal is to be pursued to the ultimate, as is, I suggest, the policy of the Fraser Government, it will mean that the citizens of newly-developed regions will suffer tremendously from the impact of incorrect policies and will be denied elementary services which they have come to regard as an essential part of the Australian environment. We are being told that borrowings on the domestic capital market have been undertaken in competition with those of larger authorities and corporations. Thus the Government has told State and local governments-which are already experiencing tremendous difficulties-seeking to raise funds in order to carry out works programs, that they should step aside and allow the big corporations to have unlimited access to the domestic capital market. </PARA>
<PARA> The high levels of foreign capital inflow in recent times, in the context of the restrictive monetary policy of the Government, have created conditions in the domestic capital market which disadvantage small borrowers, whether home buyers, small businessmen, small farmers or small local government authorities. That may seem to be unusual, but it is not when considered in terms of the Government's basic ideological position. It is always talking about small government but it encourages the development of large corporations. It never talks of small government and small business. Rather, it describes them in contradictory terms. </PARA>
<PARA> The smaller local government authorities are experiencing great difficulty in gaining access to finance. The significant aspect of the policies being pursued in Canberra is that the local government authorities are being forced to seek finance at higher interest rates. These are the realities facing local Government authorities throughout our country. But they are realities that this Government either cannot see or chooses to neglect. The economic policies being pursued by this Government are at fault because its whole philosophical and ideological position is untenable from the point of view of the citizens of our cities, regions, shires and municipalities. As much as this legislation seeks to make available a small sum of money, it does nothing more than just maintain the existing sum of money. It does nothing to solve the basic problems facing local government throughout our country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is considering the States (Tax Sharing and Health Grants) Bill 1981 and the Local Government (Personal Income Tax Sharing) Amendment Bill 1981. It has agreed to consider them cognately for the purposes of debate although I understand that questions will be put separately after I have finished my summing up. I wish to respond to some of the points that have been made by honourable senators in the contributions which have been put before the Senate. Over the past five years, the Commonwealth has provided very substantial grants to the States as the figures available in each of the Budget Papers will show. Because of these substantial grants, the Commonwealth has considered it appropriate now to take a far more restrictive approach in 1981-82 to the tax sharing arrangements with the States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commonwealth had wished to discuss this matter with the States at some length. Although the States have argued that there has been insufficient consultation about the arrangements incorporated in the Bill, it is worth noting and putting on the record that a year ago the Commonwealth sought discussions with the States on the arrangements which are being debated today. The States chose, however, to hold their discussions in the absence of the Commonwealth. It was very difficult for the kind of consultation to take place that people say should have occurred. Arising from these discussions, the States presented their views to the Commonwealth in February. The Commonwealth put the view to the States a year ago that it would be more desirable for the Commonwealth to have been present all along but the States chose otherwise. The argument of inadequate consultation is fairly hard to sustain in the light of the events which occurred over the past year or so. Premier Wran rejected the concept of total tax at the Premiers Conference. Most of the other Premiers rejected it also. It could not be denied that in the papers prepared by the States on this matter-the States actually produced some papers-some advantage was seen in the total tax as an aggregate that fluctuated a little less than net personal income tax collections. This matter was considered by the Premiers and had been noted by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> I think I need to pick up some of the points made by honourable senators. Perhaps I should start with Senator Gietzelt's comments and relate them to the situation facing local government. There is no doubt that, following the program announced, introduced and implemented step by step by this Government, local government in Australia now has a more secure financial base-because of its access to a guaranteed share of personal income tax collections-and is in a more satisfactory position that it has ever been before. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind honourable senators of the fairly sharp step by step increase that occurred so that local government now can call upon 2 per cent of personal income tax collections. I make the point that this arrangement has not been disturbed by the new Bills before the Senate. In fact, the continuation of personal income tax collections as the base for local government tax sharing is desirable and, indeed, it should cause no anxiety for a number of reasons. Firstly, our record shows that we have been not only reasonable but also generous in the allocation of funds for local government, especially under those personal income tax sharing arrangements. As I have observed the amount has gone up step by step. It has gone up from 1.52 per cent to 2 per cent and the dollar amount of assistance to local government from the Commonwealth has more than doubled. In 1976-77 it was $140m and it is over $300m in 1980-81. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, there is evidence to show that, at least in the short term, local government will not be disadvantaged by the arrangements which are proposed and which are continuing. Further to the increases received so far, on the basis of 1980-81 Budget estimates of net personal income tax collections-that, of course, is the basis on which one would try to predict what local government will get next year-it is estimated that the level of Commonwealth tax sharing assistance for local government in the States would increase in the next financial year-that is, 1981-82-by 13.5 per cent to some $341m. Local government faces no disadvantage. While the funding of local government has been a matter of concern for some time to a number of honourable senators, it is in a stronger, more secure, more stable and more satisfactory position now than it has been in the past. This is due to the tax sharing arrangements introduced by the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Several speakers in this debate have addressed themselves to the new health arrangements. The Jamison Commission of Inquiry into the Efficiency and Administration of Hospitals in Australia found that a major factor behind inefficiencies in State hospitals and related services was the divided responsibility which existed between the Commonwealth and the States. The basis of the new arrangements proposed is that the States will accept their constitutional authority and responsibility for the provision of health services, that they will do this fully and that they will be able to determine their own priorities as to how funds are to be allocated within their global budget and how they are to be allocated between the different parts of the health care system according to the priorities which any State might hold. </PARA>
<PARA> If honourable senators accept the Jamison Commission's statement that the way in which we funded the system was one of the reasons for inefficiency, the new proposals can only assist in reducing the level of that inefficiency. Despite what Senator Grimes has said, State Health Ministers did not disagree with the thrust of the new arrangements. The States know full well that the arrangements should provide them with increased resources and increased capacity to make their own Budget decisions. The Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) met with the State Health Ministers on two occasions. The State Health Ministers had every opportunity to express their views. Whilst they were quite vociferous on the question of cash, they did not express an objection to the main thrust of the proposals. The Minister for Health has taken the State Ministers' views back to the Government. Of course, as a result of that, the Government has agreed that a review will be made towards the end of 1981-82 of the assessment of the States' capacity to increase revenue in the light of experience. This again is a reasonable response to doubts which have been expressed by the States. If it is necessary to make any adjustments at that time, it will be possible in the light of experience. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Grimes made an impassioned plea for women's refuges. There is no doubt that they have certainly performed some good work and fulfilled a necessary and previously unfulfilled function. The refuges are part of the health system; they are part of a total system. The States have the responsibility for that system within their own borders. The States will have the capacity to take up that responsibility. Further, the funding of women's refuges is quite considerable. The estimated expenditure in 1980-81 was $5.16m, of which the Commonwealth provided $3.82m and the States provided $1.34m. The Commonwealth's contribution for women's refuges will be included in the total amount of grants to the States for 1981-82 and the calculation for the amount to be allowed for women's refuges will be the 1980-81 figure, escalated by 10 per cent. A very considerable amount of money is being provided to State treasuries in terms of the global allocation. It is up to the States now--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They have to be answerable to their electors, Senator Georges. The amount of money which was made available this year in relation to women's refuges will be escalated by 10 per cent for 1981-82. It is entirely up to the States whether they choose to allocate more of their own resources to women's refuges. It is entirely up to them to place a priority and to respond to that priority. I say again that the amounts of money provided will be adequate. Because of that-I am just putting the view now so that I will not have to take the time of the Senate later-the amendments proposed to be moved at the Committee stage would defeat the purpose of absorption, which is to enable the States to determine their expenditures as they see fit and to avoid Commonwealth involvement in matters which really are matters for State determination. No specific amount is identified in these Bills for the absorption of women's refuges, but the amount has been included, as I have already pointed out. I thank honourable senators for their contributions to this debate. I indicate that the Government will oppose the amendments to be moved in the Committee stage. I commend the Bills.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I foreshadowed, I wish to move an amendment to this legislation. I wish merely to comment on some of the remarks made by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) on the general principles behind Part III of the Bill, which has to do with health funding in general, and, in particular, on some of his remarks about the attitude of the States. I merely put on record again, in case Senator Baume did not hear me, the statement of the State Health Ministers which was made on 8 May after the Government had announced its policy. Unanimously they said that they observed that they had never been consulted in the real sense of the word and at no time prior to its recent decision had the Commonwealth indicated any clear intention to the States. Quite apart from that, it is wrong to treat this legislation in isolation from the other health legislation which is to come forward shortly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The import of all this legislation is to push people into the private health funds, into private hospitals and into a private hospital scheme. I repeat the Opposition's assertion that there is no way in which that will result in a more efficient use of or reduction in health funds in this country. The Government intends to push people into a fee for service situation. Such a situation exists in the United States, for instance, where health costs as a percentage of gross domestic product are considerably higher than they are in this country. That is the inevitable result of this situation. The States also disagree with the calculations made by the Commonwealth both on base levels and on the amount of money that the Treasurer (Mr Howard) believes will be able to be clawed back under the new fees system. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth claims, through Senator Baume, that it wants to put health back where it should be-back with the States. Yet the Commonwealth is, in fact, directing the States what to charge, where to charge it, how to charge, to put on a means test and how to conduct their health systems. If it were fair dinkum it would just hand the whole thing back to the States, but that is not the situation. I finally say on this matter that we as a party believe that health is a national matter, that the health of the citizens in every corner of this country deserves national attention and that to back away from this situation is quite wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> I come to the amendments I will move to clauses 14 and 15 of this legislation which would have the effect of earmarking the amounts paid by the Commonwealth to women's refuges and make sure that they are allocated specifically for that purpose. In this situation we believe there is a special case. Until the period between 1972 and 1975 there were few, if any, women's refuges at all in this country. This Parliament accepted that, in fact, in this situation there was a problem which deserved national attention. There were women in this country who were being forced to stay at home in unsatisfactory environments or who were being forced out of the home into desperate and unsatisfactory situations because of domestic violence and problems in the home. It was not only the Opposition but also people in medical practice and welfare agencies who realised the seriousness of this situation. For that reason funding for women's refuges was introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> We are now at the stage where, in fact, some 35,000 women pass through the hundred or so funded refuges in this country. Two-thirds of these women have children. There is no funding to maintain and feed those children. There is a grant from the Office of Child Care to pay in some cases a child care worker some $10,000 a year but, in fact, that funding has remained the same for two years. We have a situation in which certain groups in the community and certain State Governments in the community are extremely hostile on philosophical grounds to the establishment of these refuges. I refer in particular to the Queensland Government which, in the past, has refused to hand on Commonwealth funds and to the Western Australian Government which so restricts any funding it has for these refuges that it makes life very difficult and sometimes impossible for the women who run them. </PARA>
<PARA> In spite of the increasing numbers of women's refuges in the community the problems have not diminished. Bashings are increasing. Nine out of 10 women reporting violence claim it is associated with alcohol. Increasing unemployment and increasing economic difficulties in the community all add to the number of problems we have. I repeat that this is recognised by State governments, State government welfare agencies, local government welfare agencies where they exist, and police forces which refer people to the refuges. Because of difficulties in funding in other areas we are getting increasing reports of people referred to the refuges who have, in fact, acute psychiatric problems. Because there is nowhere else for them to go and because they have no families to care for them, people tend to refer these people to refuges which, at the moment, because of their low funding, their inadequate facilities and the strain on the people who are running them, are having difficulties in handling them. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that I believe almost everyone in this Parliament recognises the work these refuges do. It is important that this Parliament has some national responsibilities for the welfare of women and children in this community. I believe it is quite irresponsible for this Parliament to hand over willy-nilly the funds for women's refuges to State governments-some of whom are hostile to the existence of these refuges-for them to do with it what they will. They need not even hand on the money to refuges. We have a situation in which the Federal Government is the chief money revenue raiser in this community. Yet it will hand over this small, inadequate amount of money to the States without any reasonable control and without any direction as to where these funds will go. </PARA>
<PARA> In future years we will find that the same restrictions as have been applied to State funds will apply to the funds for women's refuges, which are one of the success stories-inadequate as the funding is-of Federal initiative in this country. We should not just hand back the matter like this. We must have some national responsibility in this area. I put it to the Minister that this is a particular area which needs assistance. It was a Federal initiative and it should remain a Federal initiative and responsibility. We, as a parliament, who initiated the funding and who have followed up with funding every year, should not just hand over this funding to governments which have demonstrated their hostility in this situation. The amount is the total Federal Budget is, in fact, minuscule. We need to make sure that this one group of people receives our support just as we need to make sure that other disadvantaged groups get the support of the Federal Government. I seek leave to move the two amendments together. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the amendments moved by my colleague Senator Grimes. In doing so I remind the Senate of a debate that took place in the Senate in May 1979. In that month we on this side proposed an urgency debate on women's shelters, support for women's shelters, the need for them and the need for more of them. On that occasion the Government agreed with us that women's shelters were a very necessary part of our community and that they deserved and should have continuing Federal Government support. I remind the Senate of remarks made by the then Minister for Social Security, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle. She said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This shows that the Government recognises the need for women's refuges, recognises with alarm-as I think Senator Coleman put it-the increasing need for provision of such refuges in order to help people who are in distress, in danger or in terror, as well as children who are subjected to what is widely-spread abuse. No-one would argue against those propositions and I think the Government has shown its consideration for the program by developing it to the extent that I have mentioned and by providing funds in a way in which it has. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government understood in that debate that in two States there was a problem of commitment. Knowing even that, the Minister went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> However, as far as women's refuges are concerned, their increased development and the continuing and growing support that has been given to them by the Federal Government would lead everyone to understand that the Government recognises the need for them and that it must provide substantial funds to continue their existence. </PARA>
<PARA>I repeat the last phrase:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . and that it must provide substantial funds to continue their existence. </PARA>
<PARA>What has happened in the meantime? On 29 May 1979 the Government showed some commitment to the need for womens' refuges and to the role it must play in relation to them; yet here we are in June 1981 and the Government is moving out of all responsibility for women's refuges-leaving them to the States-knowing as it does that some States have no commitment to women's refuges. In fact, some have a less than realistic commitment to women's refuges. It was not just Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle who supported us then. Senator Walters on that day also supported us in our move to have women's refuges and the need for them declared urgent. Senator Walters said:</PARA>
<PARA> The need is certainly there. I could not agree more with Senator Melzer. </PARA>
<PARA>She went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> I feel that the debate today has been initiated in an attempt to cause concern for the people administering the shelters and that this is completely wrong. This Government has recognised the necessity for shelters. Government funding has increased to the extent that in the 1978-79 Budget nearly $3m was allocated for these shelters. Those people who are administering the shelters should be well satisfied that the Government is now showing some concern for them. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask again: What has happened between 29 May 1979 and June 1981? Are women's refuges any less essential now than they were then? Is there any less need for them now than there was then? Suddenly there is no care that refuges be maintained at a time when they are needed more than they have ever been needed previously. Refuges cannot be designated just as a part of the health system. They cannot be left to the whim of the States. They are too important for the mental and physical health of women and children in this country. What will be the outcome of the Government opting out of its direct role in women's refuges? It will mean that if a few dollars are left over in some States, they will go to women's refuges and that in some States no money at all will be put into women's refuges. We all know that. Yet members of the Government sit there calmly and say: 'It is now a matter of the States making up their own minds as to how they spend their money'. The Federal Government is just opting out of any responsibility whatever. </PARA>
<PARA> What will be the outcome? We all know what the outcome will be. There will be more injured, hurt women. More women's lives will be ruined, physically and mentally. There will be more injured children. This is happening at a time when there is more unemployment, more poverty and more pressure on people than there has ever been in this country before. With more poverty, more unemployment and more pressure come more problems. Women find themselves in situations that they cannot physically stand up to, that they cannot mentally put up with any more. They have to get out of such situations. Where are they to go now? We know that the States are finding it difficult to balance their Budgets. We know that this Federal Government is forcing the States into a position in which they will not have sufficient funds to carry out all the programs that they know are needed. The Federal Government, knowing that there is a greater need for refuges, knows too that the States will be unable to cope with this problem of providing refuges for women. I feel it is time that this Government showed some real commitment to women's problems and, knowing that the States do not have the same commitment, took the matter into its hands and did something about it. </PARA>
<PARA> Some of my colleagues on both sides of the Parliament were shocked that women should demonstrate as they have done in the last two weeks. I put it to honourable senators that women have been put into a position in which they can do very little else. They have been polite. They have handed in petitions, they have written letters, they have gone to see members of parliament and nothing has happened. They have put a case to the Government for refuges. The Government has accepted that there is a case for women's refuges, that they are a necessary part of our lives today. Unpalatable as that fact may be, it has been accepted that they are necessary; yet the Government opts out altogether. Honourable senators opposite are shocked that women should sit out there in King's Hall making a noise, trying to attract people's attention to this very real problem. I suggest that if the Government does not take heed of what has happened up until now, it is likely to have to face up to more demonstrations. People will have to take it more into their own hands to drag this Government, screaming though it may be, to the point where it has to recognise that the money it spends or does not spend on refuges is not its money, but our money. It is money that belongs to the people of this country. The people of this country have demonstrated very forcibly that they believe women's shelters are needed. They have demonstrated that they will demand that governments such as this Federal Government fund refuges. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the amendment moved by my colleague, Senator Grimes, and supported so ably by my colleague, Senator Melzer. At this stage of the debate I simply wish to say that the Federal Government's decision to offload the responsibility for women's refuges-rape crisis centres and women's health centres have already been offloaded to the States-is indefensible in any terms. It is indefensible in terms of cost. As Senator Grimes has said, the cost of funding women's refuges has been absolutely minuscule in terms of the total Federal Government. Last year 96 per cent of Commonwealth funded refuges received between them less than $3m. So the cost saving, if that were to be put forward by the Government and the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) as a justification for this abrogation of responsibility, is laughable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Cost saving ought not to be put forward as any kind of justification for the decision to rid the Government's area of responsibility of women's refuges. In terms of administrative efficiency-something that the Government thinks it is concerned about and pretends it will achieve through many of the decisions of the razor gang-there is no case to be made. What happens, as honourable senators opposite may not know-I hope they know; I hope they have acquainted themselves with how refuges work-is that an unceasing demand is made by various bureaucracies on the women working within refuges to present their accounts in a certain way, to put in submissions, to adapt submissions and to change submissions. Generally speaking, women who work in refuges, often on a voluntary basis and certainly on an underpaid basis, spend a great deal of their time, instead of counselling, helping and advising the women and children who are the victims of domestic violence, in trying to meet the various bureaucratic demands that are put to them. What will happen as a result of the Federal responsibility going to the States is that women working in refuges will have a whole fresh series of demands placed upon them. There will be a whole new fresh series of bureaucracies that they must satisfy in order to show that the tiny amount of money they are receiving for these essential services is in fact being spent on these services. I believe that the bureaucratic problems will increase and that the administration of refuges will become even more complex. There is no cost saving or administrative efficiency to be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> Why is the Federal Government doing this? In trying to answer that question we must look at the record of the States and the Northern Territory in regard to refuges and other priceless services for women. In the Northern Territory, which I visited in February of this year, there is now no crisis service at all for women. There was a women's health service and a women's refuge in Alice Springs. There was a rape crisis centre in Darwin and some rape crisis counselling was provided in Alice Springs. All of that has gone because the Northern Territory Administration is hostile to the whole aim of women's crisis services. Similarly, in Western Australia and Queensland, ever since the Fraser Government was elected and there was some withdrawal from direct funding of women's crisis services, there has been a battle to maintain services and a number of services have gone under. In the States where there is support for women's refuges and women's crisis services-the States of New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and Tasmania-those States have had to struggle to provide a whole range of health and community services. Women's refuges, women's health centres and rape crisis centres are just not going to able to compete with the much better organised, much larger services that will be struggling for their share of the health services cake. </PARA>
<PARA> Undoubtedly the direct result of the Federal Government withdrawing from direct responsibility for women's refuges is that many women's refuges will fail to operate. I do not need to go over the consequences of that for battered women and children because my colleague Senator Melzer has, I think, very adequately described those consequences. But I point to the hypocrisy on the part of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) with regard to the funding of these programs. A women's services delegation saw the Prime Minister last week and proposed the establishment of a new women's services program, administered federally by one department and funded with a special purpose grant. Such a proposal has the support of the Federal Labor Party. The Prime Minister turned down the proposal. Instead he offered to write to the State Premiers supporting women's services programs. Considering Mr Fraser's current disastrous relationships with State governments, this step is unlikely to achieve anything at all for women. I point to the hypocrisy of a Government which on the one hand attempts to attract international kudos by signing the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women overseas, while on the other hand at home cuts back on women's services. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, not only has the Government left women's services in the lurch but also it has abolished all existing women's units in Commonwealth departments. This leaves the one remaining unit concerned with women's affairs-the Office of Women's Affairs-without accurate advice on what Commonwealth Government decisions mean for women. I ask the Minister: Now that the women's unit within the Department of Health and the women's consultative committee within the Department of Social Security have been abolished, how will the Federal Government get information as to what is happening with women's refuges in the States? What direct monitoring will there be of what was a Federal program, as my colleague Senator Grimes described it? How will there be any feedback at all to the Federal Government as to what is happening with women's refuges and what is happening with rape crisis centres and women's health centres? There will be none. Not only has the Federal Government withdrawn from direct funding but also has it disbanded those advisory units, those policy units within its bureaucracy, which may have been in a position to monitor what was happening to women and children and to give this information to the Federal Government. So it is a complete abrogation of responsibility. It is one which, as I have said, is indefensible. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that, at the Committee stage of the debate, it is not too late for senators sitting opposite to give serious consideration to the amendments moved by my colleague, Senator Grimes, and to support him. In doing so, I believe that they will only be making good many promises and many undertakings given to women by the Federal Government. They will only be acting in accordance with their stated policy of equal opportunity for women and special programs for women in need. They will not be doing anything contrary to their stated policy. They will not be doing anything other than supporting the best of causes. They will be doing something to retrieve this Government's appalling reputation with regard to consideration for disadvantaged women and children in this community. I urge that course of action upon senators sitting opposite. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to foreshadow a further amendment. I will not keep the Senate long. I consider that all honourable senators realise that there is a need for the provision of substantial funds for women's refuges. I certainly do. Anyone who is involved in community activity knows that certain situations occur in which women and children are terrified and some refuge for those victims needs to be provided. Equally, it is necessary that the women's refuges deserve, and act in a way so that they can attract, public support. The public needs to be confident that women and their children who, when faced with a crisis and are terrified out of their wits, are given compassionate understanding support and are not subject to political indoctrination. All of us here are grown men and women. We know over a period that circumstances have arisen in certain women's refuges where there is political indoctrination. That is a major facet in some of the refuges.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer to a question that I asked the then Minister for Social Security, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, wherein I mentioned an advertisement which was placed in the 'positions vacant' column in the Age by the Victorian Western Region Women's Refuge. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The refuge operates as a feminist collective, and the positions involve organising political actions around women's issues, as well as co-ordinating the day-to-day running of the house. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the type of thing that I think the public should be assured that women who are in this crisis situation are not subjected to. The last thing that a woman in such a crisis position wants is political indoctrination. I feel that the amendment that I will move-actually, it is an addendum to the Opposition's amendments-gives recognition to the fact that a substantial amount of money needs to be put aside for this purpose but that it should be done so as to attract public support and confidence. As an amendment to Senator Grimes's amendments relating to clause 14 sub-clause (3) and clause 15, sub-clause (3), I move:</PARA>
<PARA> At the end of the words proposed to be inserted (in each case), add ', namely women's refuges which cater for women and children in emergency situations and do not subject their occupants to political indoctrination'. </PARA>
<PARA>If my amendment is agreed to, the relevant portion of Senator Grimes's amendments will read:</PARA>
<PARA> But so that the amounts paid by the Commonwealth in respect of women's refuges are allocated specifically for that purpose, namely, women's refuges which cater for women and children in emergency situations and do not subject their occupants to political indoctrination. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, I believe that that proposition ought to be acceptable all round. I can see the argument which is put forward by the Government that perhaps the States are in closer contact with the situation, for example, people who work in departments of social welfare at State level and in the police departments. I can see their argument that the State governments need to have control over the situation. I can see also the argument that, if there is public support for and confidence in refuges and if the funding of same is in the hands of the State government, there is more direct influence by the people of that State over the State government. I can understand that argument. But I still feel that if the Commonwealth Government sees its way clear to ensure that the payments are made in accordance with the proposition that I am putting forward-it has not up to this point-I think that we should all support the amendment moved by the Opposition with my addendum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In some strange way, I find myself on the side of Senator Walters in respect of this tiny item, but let me say first of all that I share Senator Harradine's view that women who go into shelters are in a vulnerable position and a difficult position and, because they are vulnerable, I believe they should not be subject to proselytising of any kind, whether it is political, religious or whatever. I have always expressed that view. I have expressed that view at Estimates committee hearings in this place. I believe that Senator Harradine is trying to introduce a very dangerous principle into Commonwealth funding. He proposes to insert the words 'namely, women's refuges which cater for women and children in emergency situations'-I suggest they all do that-'and do not subject their occupants to political indoctrination'. Who on earth is to make that sort of judgment? Is it to be the bureaucracy? Is it to be someone in the Department of Health?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is it to be the situation that because someone who is deeply involved in a political party is also involved in a refuge that refuge will not be funded, whether the person is in the Australian Labor Party or, as in the north of Tasmania, a prominent member of the Liberal Party? Are we to refuse funding only to those people whose views oppose the views of the government of the day so that we will have musical chairs in the funding of women's refuges over and over again as governments change? What would be the situation if the Queensland Government, for instance, had control of the funding of refuges and it had to make the judgment as to whether a refuge was a politically associated refuge or involved in political indoctrination? What would happen if a staff member of a refuge was working on a booth for a political party or wearing a badge for a political party at election time? I suggest it is a very dangerous principle to introduce into legislation that someone be given the right to make such a judgment about the politics of a refuge. Does it mean that people who run a refuge cannot take political action to try to get governments to increase their funding or the direction of their funding?</PARA>
<PARA> I think it is unfortunate that Senator Harradine has introduced this sort of element into amendments which are merely trying to ensure that the national government maintains responsibility for a program it started and that the national government supports a series of organisations which would fulfil a need which obviously was unfulfilled in the past. Only a week or so ago Senator Ryan and I were subjected to some criticism, and pretty trenchant criticism, from women who were demonstrating on behalf of women's refuges. In that situation are we to say that because these people disagree with us politically and because they are taking political action to try to improve the position of their refuges, we should refuse them funding? I do not believe anyone should be given the right to make that sort of judgment and I suspect that people who want the right to make that sort of judgment should be the last ones to be given it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the amendments which have been moved by Senator Grimes. I would like to make the point that if we had women and children who were refugees from a foreign country it would be the Federal Government's responsibility to give them shelter, support services and health services. Yet we have women and children in our own country who are also refugees from violence and the Federal Government says that it does not have that responsibility. In Victoria alone, on average, 15 families are turned away from a shelter every day. We do not know how many there are in other States. It is disgraceful that any woman and her child or children in our country should be turned away from the shelter that she seeks. Many of these women have lived with and known terror and the sheer panic of fear and emotional, physical and mental violence over a long period. It is damaging to their children; it is damaging to themselves. Not only do we need more money for refuges but also we need money to investigate the causes of the breakdowns in families and the causes of the violence. This violence is often the result of financial and social pressures. These pressures are caused by the insecurity which the present Government's policies are producing. I think we must look not only at the fact that shelters must continue but also the fact that they are a federal Government responsibility, as are the causes of the need for them.</PARA></TALK.START>

I then went on to comment that Senator Hearn, I think it was, had said that the various States needed different emphasis and that different States required various numbers of refuges. It was this point that I was taking up with her. I was saying that that is why I believe that while the Federal Government hands full funding to the States as it has done in the past the States are best able to cope with this matter themselves and to come up with their own priorities. They can use as much money as the Federal Government can give them. In fact, they can use more. But that is up to the States. I see no problem and I really do not understand why the shelters should be concerned in this regard.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have to comment on the amendment moved by Senator Harradine because I am concerned that it says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the end of the words proposed to be inserted (in each case), add ', namely women's refuges which cater for women and children in emergency situations and do not subject their occupants to political indoctrination'. </PARA>
<PARA>The whole amendment appears to be based on an advertisement which was placed, I understand, in one of the Tasmanian newspapers and which talks about an assistant at a refuge who can cater for the needs of the people in the refuge as well as motivating political actions. To my mind, there is a big difference in the meaning of the words 'indoctrination' and 'actions'. I would think that a lot of work being done at refuges would be political. But it does not necessarily apply that it is political indoctrination. For instance, the gaining of legal aid for people in refuges and in the refuge situation could be seen as being a political action, but surely it could not possibly be seen as a political indoctrination. To my mind, getting advice on how to go about getting supporting parent's benefit would be political action; and it would not necessarily be political indoctrination. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5V4">Senator COLEMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It certainly would. But the advertisement which is the basis for the amendment which has been moved by Senator Harradine talks about political indoctrination, whereas the advertisement that I saw and which I asked Senator Harradine to show me talks about political actions, political activity. I am just suggesting that a number of situations in a refuge could be considered to be politically active but they may not necessarily amount to political indoctrination.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the things which concern me is that in West Australia at the moment about eight refuges are operating. We are turning away about 1,500 women and children each year. I have given the figures in this chamber. I gave them in the urgency motion which I moved in May 1979 and I repeated them some weeks ago. We are turning away more than 1,500 women and children each year. My concern is that if the Government does go ahead and hand over this responsibility to the States and the States do not give it a sufficiently high enough priority, we will not get the necessary extra refuges that we need and we will not get additional funding for the refuges we have already. We have a situation in West Australia which perhaps is unique, which perhaps does not apply in any other State; I do not know. But I am vitally concerned that the women who work those refuges and who see the needs in the community and the people who use the services of the refuges should have their needs satisfied. I have to vote against Senator Harradine's amendment because it talks about political indocrination and, like Senator Grimes, I would not put myself in the position of being a judge of what is political indoctrination and what is not; where we could have this pussy-footing around where a government may fund a refuge one year because it is politically motivated in the same manner as the Government but the refuge is not funded in the next session of Parliament purely and simply because the Government has changed in the meantime. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the amendments moved by my colleague Don Grimes because I believe that the funding of refuges is a federal government responsibility. It was introduced as a federal government responsibility. The Federal Government claimed responsibility for it in answering my urgency motion on 29 May 1979. It should not have changed its mind because the situation has not changed. If anything, the situation in each State has become worse. More people are subject to social stress now than there were in 1979. More family units-women with children-require the use of refuges and more refuges and more funds should be made available to them. The amount of money spent last year is trifling if we look at it in the context of the entire Budget. We are talking about less than $3m to fund the 96 refuges already operating. If we were talking about $30m it still would not be a great amount of money if, in fact, that money were being spent on relieving social pressures and on providing people with a service to cater for their needs. We are talking at this point about a very small amount. The Federal Government should not be relinquishing its responsibility in this area. It is the Federal Government's responsibility on a national basis; it is not just something that can be handed over to the Bjelke-Petersens or the Sir Charles Courts of this world. </PARA>
<PARA> Direct funding was given by the Federal Government to two Queensland refuges because of the situation that arose in Queensland within perhaps the last three years. That money was allocated to the Queensland Government specifically for two refuges. But it was not given to them. The Queensland Government knows what that money was spent on; I do not know what it was spent on. When Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle was Minister for Social Security she made a specific point of giving a direct grant to those refuges to ensure that they were funded. One has to question what will be the situation in Queensland if Mr Bjelke-Petersen is asked to fund the additional refuges which have sprung up over the last few years. Is he then going to say: 'They are of no concern to me'? He was given money in 1978, I believe it was, to fund those refuges but refused to do so. Are we now to ask the women and children in need in the Queensland community to go without the services of a refuge just because the Federal Government does not want to accept the responsibility it should be accepting?</PARA>

If these people commit all their time to care for women and children in crisis situations, they will have little time to raise funds which will enable them to get further funds. The raising of $1 in order to receive $8 is an impossible burden.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are saying that the Federal Government in this area-we are not arguing about the other areas, although we could put a case-should continue to accept responsibility. I believe that there is more humanity and concern in this place than in the Queensland Parliament. We know the nature, record and background of the Queensland Parliament in this respect. I cannot speak for Western Australia; I am merely speaking for Queensland. It seems to me that by supporting these amendments we can be assured that the Federal Government will have a direct commitment to support these services which are provided by women for themselves in crisis situations. I will not go into the details because Senator Melzer and others have spoken very clearly on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I recommend that the editorial writer in the Canberra Times on Friday of last week should print the speech Senator Melzer made today. There was far more understanding and sympathy in one phrase of Senator Melzer's speech than in the whole of the editorial which I considered to be very inhuman. It showed no understanding of the problems these women faced. It was more concerned with the respectability of Parliament than it was for the problems of these people. It failed to realise that this Parliament has failed to earn the respect of its constituents especially those from this group. The editorial writer ought to look at the speeches made in this place today. Let me reinforce what others have said. Already an impossible condition is imposed in Queensland. There are limitations as to the type of refuges. The attitude of the Queensland Government is to send these people to institutions which have no proper understanding and cannot properly solve the problems with which this group is very conversant. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last few days some of us, by the action of these women, have been fronted with the facts. Fortunately the authority of this place which refused people entry on occasions has been relaxed because of the pressure of members of parliament from both sides. This has enabled some of us to talk, to receive information and to understand. I have had experience, as I have explained before, of the conditions under which people are held in Queensland in watchhouses and in the solitary areas of Boggo Road gaol. I know that the conditions in the watchhouses are bad enough, but two instances which were related to me in the previous week shocked me. Women who had been sexually assaulted were brought under the notice of the police and confined as if they were the criminals. They were held in the watchhouse in conditions which, to say the very least, limit one's feedom considerably. Those people were held and treated as the guilty parties. It seems to me that the need for crisis centres in Queensland is very great. What I have described happened on two occasions last week-not two years ago. These women had nowhere else to go. They had no resort to the assistance that appears to be available in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that I have been very remiss in my responsibilities in not knowing that those conditions existed. Because of that I am now eager to redress those shortcomings. I can see that, by this very legislation, any endeavour on my part will fail; I now have to deal with the Queensland Government. My experience of the Queensland Government is that it is not responsive to the needs of these people. I would be wasting my time if I were to make representations, but if I were to go to the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) I know I would get a hearing; I know that I would get sympathy-but he would be limited by the fact that he could not fund directly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am constrained to enter this debate because I feel that we have reached a new dimension in the need for the basic Christian principle, the morality of comforting the afflicted. We are living at a time when we have developed a certain consciousness that aged people, invalids, quadriplegics, paraplegics and others in the community can accept their case and maintenance as a right. The Commonwealth Government has accepted that responsibility. While we were in government, we saw a growing need to finance refuges for women. I can remember then women had only one place to go, and that was to the wash house or the poor house. Men have always asserted and have been granted superiority in the home. Women had to bear whatever the consequences were in the home because of the risk that if they left they would be seen to be the guilty person. But society has now become brutalised by the selfish, aggressive system under which we live. Everyone gets in for his cut and the devil takes the hindmost. The victim in this society is so often the woman and the mother. It is no great request to ask the Commonwealth Government to continue with the established precedent that has been created whereby it finances this phenomenon of the neglected, the bashed and brutalised wife. Someone has to take up the cudgels and look to this responsibility. The effect of the way in which the new federalism works-it is an entirely different element-is that the meat in the sandwich are these people. The States are being cut to the extent that they cannot afford the growing charges that will arise in this society as a result of the growing need for these services.</PARA></TALK.START>

It appals me to think how badly she represents the people of Tasmania when she sits there, says nothing, and does not join in a debate as this to put up a case for this new dimension that I speak about. I will not listen to her because her interjections are inane. People are forced to leave their homes because of brutality, the frustrations of unemployment, the lack of hope for the future of men, the inability of people to cope with the enormous effects of social, political and economic pressures. All these deep psychological side effects are released in the home. As a result, society has to look at this great problem of supplying a refuge for every person in the community who is aflicted by this phenomenon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All that this amendment is asking the Government to do is not to pass the buck, as it is doing in so many areas under this airy fairy thing called federalism. It is handing problems back to the States to deal with. It gives the resultant savings to the multinationals. That is what all federalism is about-divide and rule. I assure honourable senators that history will prove that what I am saying is right. The Government is too blind, blinkered or purblind even to understand this, but it is true. This philosophy is a false one. The Friedman-Ayn Rand philosophy is a false philosophy. It is destined to fail. We have to make provision for the victims of this philosophy in the interim until a new system, a new order and a new approach are established and a more sympathetic, benevolent and kindly group of people are running the exchequer. I appeal to the Committee to take this view. It is within our power to tell the Treasury and the bureaucrats that this is not just a run of the mill matter. It is a deep, moral and social problem that has to be treated separately. It is bad enough to have the aged and invalid pensioners on the borderline. This is an area that needs the closest scrutiny to determine how we are to cope with it. It is bigger than people realise. If one has close contact with people who go to the refuges-their last resort-one sees the hopelessness of the situation when they arrive, the rockbottom nature of their depravity of mind and the degradation of human beings. </PARA>
<PARA> Here we are arguing about the importance of this matter. I think that the Committee will be judged as recreant if it does not do something about this now. This is not a States matter. The States have never had the responsibility before. The Commonwealth took it up as the situation developed and took on the responsibility of supplying funds for these refuges. We are duty bound and morally bound to continue to pay it. I hope that, as Senator Georges suggested, we report progress and push this matter right back to where it belongs and have a new look at it. The subject is so important that those who follow us will judge us as being callous and indifferent to human needs if we do not do something at this moment. This legislation is about to be dealt with by numbers-the old cynical, hypocritical numbers game that arises at election time and, when one gets the numbers, everyone else can jump in the lake. The appeal that I make at this time is one directed to decency and to morality. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Grimes says that the Labor Party started the refuges. I acknowledge that it did. I am simply saying that the need for women's refuges, for the provision of refuge for those who are suffering the kinds of conditions that have been decribed by Senator O'Byrne, is recognised on both sides of the chamber. That is not the argument tonight. It is one about where the funding should be administered, where the authority should rest. In winding up the second reading debate I indicated that the Government would not accept the amendments moved by Senator Grimes and I will not repeat the arguments then advanced. I simply assure the Senate that the Government believes that the funding of women's refuges rests properly at State level. I remind the Senate of the report produced by Mr Peter Bailey, I believe, in 1976, in which he drew a distinction between welfare programs having to do with income maintenance and those having to do with the provision of services. The general principle that those which deal with services are better administered closer to the people is being applied here. It is not correct to say that the States have no role, or have had no role, in the funding of women's refuges. They have had an administrative role thoughout. I have before me the annual report of the Commonwealth Director-General of Health for 1979-80, at page 60 of which Dr Howells says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . in all States except Western Australia, Commonwealth funding is channelled to women's refuges through the State welfare authorities. Only in Western Australia is the health authority responsible for refuges. </PARA>
<PARA>What emerges is that in every State a State instrumentality is responsible for the administration of the funds. I repeat, the amount being provided this year is to be increased by 10 per cent for the purpose of computing the amount next year. That additional return will be included in the money which the States may use. I refer to States such as Tasmania, New South Wales, Queensland and Western Australia, indeed to all the States. </PARA>
<PARA> On 28 May, following a meeting with representatives of women's refuges, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) communicated with all Premiers and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory concerning the continued funding of such refuges. </PARA>

<PARA> The Prime Minister also informed the Premiers and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory of the Commonwealth's intention to review existing programs of crisis accommodation and to consider the possibility of bringing them together under an integrated, flexible program. The Prime Minister sought the co-operation of the States and the Northern Territory in this review, which will include consideration of women's refuges. What we have is simply a clash of two views of government, one which says that things can be done better by central funding and responsibility, and another which says that in this area it can be done better by the States, which are closer to the people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am trying to make this an argument that is free of passion. I repeat, two sets of values are involved, one which says that State administration is more appropriate and one which says that such services should be centrally funded through the Commonwealth. The Government adheres to its position and therefore is not willing to accept the amendments moved by the Opposition. That leaves for consideration the amendment moved by Senator Harradine, which has been rejected by Senator Grimes and, I believe, Senator Georges. Since we are going to oppose the amendments, it is quite inappropriate for us to support Senator Harradine's wording and, if carried, vote against it when we vote against the Opposition's amendments. It simply would not be a consistent position for the Government to take. Senator Walters has already pointed to some of the practical difficulties involved in Senator Harradine's amendment. I appreciate the point that the honourable senator makes and the difficulties which have arisen in the administration of some of the refuges where an undue amount of propaganda has been present. I am aware that some refuges lost their funding some years ago when certain difficulties arose, but most have done a useful, important and vital job. Most of those refuges with which I have been associated are ones that I would want to see continued. I ask Senator Harradine to accept the Government's assurance that in not supporting his amendment it is not rejecting the concern that he has expressed. Since the Government intends to vote against the Opposition's amendments it would not be appropriate for it to support any of the amendments before the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise only to reply on one or two matters which have been raised in respect of the addendum which I have moved to the Opposition's amendments. I emphasise that it is an addendum. There seems to be general acceptance of the view that the last thing persons who seek refuge need is political indoctrination.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Grimes says: 'Any indoctrination'. Let me deal with that straight away, for it seems to have been the burden of his argument. I think his words were: 'If not political indoctrination, why not religious or other indoctrination?' Frankly, over a period representations have been made to me on the subject of political indoctrination in refuges. None have been made to me about religious indoctrination, nor have I heard of any taking place. If Senator Grimes has any organisation or refuge in mind it is for him to get up and say so. There are people running refuges who are motivated by the high Christian principles that Senator O'Byrne mentioned-those of compassion and of comforting the afflicted. If any honourable senator is suggesting that any refuge which receives funding from the Commonwealth is imposing sectarian or religious indoctrination he should get up and say so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other argument that was advanced was one advanced in unison, I might say, by Senator Walters and Senator Grimes. That is: Who makes the judgment as to what political indoctrination, political action, means? Let me say to Senator Walters in the gentlest possible way that, although she seems to think that I share her political points of view, we differ rather radically on a number of matters. Further, I would like to suggest equally gently that I do not agree, as apparently Senator Walters does, with the philosophy expressed by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in the first sentence of his address to the Federal Council of the Liberal Party at the Lakeside Hotel in Canberra on 31 May 1981. I wish to quote it because it is a gem. The Prime Minister said: 'Let us never forget that the future of Australia is totally dependent upon the Liberal Party'. It is an extraordinary statement to make and one which I feel at times Senator Walters, though she might wish to do something else, adheres to. Senator Walters asked: 'Who makes the decision?'. The Department of Health and the Minister for Health, of course, make the decision as to what is political action and what is political indoctrination. The Minister makes that decision at the present moment. I am just pointing out that the Minister is responsible to this Parliament for the disbursement of taxpayers' funds. If funds in this particular vote are to be used for refuges, to provide the comfort and the compassion for those who are in need in those refuges, it should not be used for political indoctrination. For Senator Walters's benefit, I should like to refer to the reply of Mr Hunt through Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle to a question I asked in 1979. Mr Hunt said quite bluntly that community health program funds are not available for political activities. I mentioned the advertisement for a co-ordinator. Honourable senators will recall that the advertisement stipulated certain things. It said:</PARA>
<PARA> The refuge operates as a feminist collective, and the positions involve organising political actions around women's issues, as well as co-ordinating the day-to-day running of the house. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hunt, through Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Victorian welfare authorities, which have the immediate responsibility for the supervision of refuges in that State and through which the Commonwealth funds are channelled, will be requested to obtain from the organisation a firm written undertaking that future advertisements will not contain statements of this type and further that in the course of their employment refuge workers will be engaged fully in the care of refuge residents and not in any other outside activities such as political actions. If such an undertaking is not given or, if given, is not adhered to, immediate consideration will be given to the withdrawal of Commonwealth financial support. </PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, it is unreal for Senator Walters to ask me who will make the decision. Of course the Government has already made the decision that that ought not to take place but it has not given effect to it. The final brief point I wish to reassert is that it is important for the future funding of women's refuges, which I strongly support, that they gain the support of the community. The issue of community health program funds being used for political action, for political indoctrination, must be faced at some time or another. The Commonwealth has not faced up to this situation. I believe it has made a statement along those lines. I believe that it ought to have the further opportunity to be able to ensure that its policy is put forward. Therefore, I will be supporting the proposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I merely wish to rise because of some of the remarks made by Senator Harradine. I should like to say that in my opening remarks after Senator Harradine had moved his amendment I stated the principle, which I believe, that women in this vulnerable situation, and they are vulnerable and in distress, should not be subject to indoctrination-in fact, I think I used the word 'proselytising'-of any kind, be it political, religious or any other kind of proselytising. I hold to that principle. I did not, as I believe could be inferred from Senator Harradine's remarks, suggest that I was opposed to those refuges which are run by Christians, by people who believe and who are motivated by Christian principles. I did not say that. No one, I suggest, in this debate has suggested that there was any sectarian motive or indoctrination involved in this question. The first person to use the word 'sectarian', I suggest, was Senator Harradine. In establishing that principle, I then went on to say that I disagreed with Senator Harradine's amendment because of its nature and because of the wording when he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . do not subject their occupants to political indoctrination. </PARA>
<PARA>This opened up the area for governments of any type to withhold funding from refuges because people in those refuges held political views or took part in political actions. I do not approve-I resent Senator Harradine's suggestion that I do-of Commonwealth Government funds which have been given for the care and attention of women and children in distress being used for party political purposes. I do not agree with that and I have never agreed with that. The nature of Senator Harradine's amendment, I suggest, as honourable senators on the other side have suggested, opens the way for political discrimination of the worst type in the funding of women's refuges. Senator Harradine, in his last remarks, went even further. He suggested that women who run refuges-he can correct me if I am wrong; but I am sure this is the purport of what he said-should not take part in political actions outside the running of those refuges. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Mr Hunt said that, I disagree with him. I believe that funds which are voted for by this Parliament for the purpose of caring for women and children in refuges should be used for that purpose. I am not suggesting they should be used for other purposes. But to introduce a political test into funding, I believe, is a dangerous principle. It is a principle, I suggest, that we do not use in other areas of funding. If a political test is to be introduced then we may as well go the whole hog and really turn this country into a mess by introducing religious tests and other tests. That was the only reason I bought up that matter. I do not believe that these vulnerable people should be subject to this kind of proselytising. It is for that reason that I cannot support Senator Harradine's amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I support my amendments for the reasons I have previously outlined. Until the time of the Labor Government, the States could not care less about the funding of women's refuges. Since 1975 two States, at least, have been extremely hostile to the funding of women's refuges. This was a Federal program. It has been a successful program despite its meagre funding. I believe it should continue as a Federal funding program and it is no good Senator Baume suggesting that because the States in the past have passed on earmarked funds, specific purpose funds, to the refuges-they had to do that-that in future they will pass on funds that are not so earmarked. I suggest that the history of Queensland and Western Australia suggests that they will not. I suggest that the history of the States in this matter shows that they will not increase the funding even in line with inflation each year. For that reason I prefer my amendment. Because I believe that Senator Harradine's amendment introduces a dangerous principle, I reject his amendment. </PARA>

I ask the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume): What do the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) and the Treasurer (Mr Howard) mean when they say that the State governments will be required to charge $15 per day per patient service? I think the term used in the other place was 'out-patient occasion'. When individuals in the community pay for this service and claim it from their health funds, will the payment come from their medical insurance or their hospital insurance? Does it mean that it will cost $15 for each individual item of service in an out-patient department, which could be a considerable sum of money for, of course, an uninsured patient, or does it mean just $15 per out-patient visit?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Three Bills are being dealt with in this cognate debate. They are the Broadcasting and Television Amendment Bill, the Overseas Telecommunications Amendment Bill and the Broadcasting Stations Licence Fees Amendment Bill. The three Bills all relate basically to the present and future structure of broadcasting in Australia. I should indicate that the Opposition does not oppose the Broadcasting Stations Licence Fees Amendment Bill or the Overseas Telecommunications Amendment Bill. I say at the beginning, because I want to devote my remarks basically to the Broadcasting and Television Amendment Bill, that the Overseas Telecommunications Amendment Bill is in some way a sort of machinery Bill which has the effect of making the Overseas Telecommunications Commission the manager and owner of the domestic satellite until such time as a government organised company is established to carry out those two functions. I should state that the position of the Opposition on the satellite has been that the Opposition favours the satellite being in public ownership and, in the context of public ownership, we would have a preference for a closer examination of the common sense and rationality of having Telecom Australia as the owner and controller of that satellite. Nonetheless, the OTC is a body which has built up considerable expertise in recent years in the management of satellites and this function is to be given to it by the Government on an interim basis only. It is on that basis that we accept the intent of this legislation for the time being.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Broadcasting and Television Amendment Bill in its present form is opposed by the Opposition. I want to spell out that opposition in some detail. We have already had an opportunity, in a sense, to discuss this matter in the Senate. I guess I will repeat some of the things that I said about this legislation several weeks ago because my remarks clearly have not sunk in with a number of Government senators and I feel they should have the opportunity of a second round. Hope springs eternal in the human heart. This Bill has now had a seven months period of gestation since the idea was first conceived by the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair). It has come to this chamber in the form of a deformed birth. It is a complex and difficult legislation. It will be a lawyer's dream and a broadcaster's nightmare. The main function of complexity in relation to this Bill is to bamboozle Government senators, Government back bench senators in particular. Tonight I will listen in vain for a contribution from a Government senator which indicates that he or she fully understands the effects of this Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would not have thought that Senator MacGibbon could tell the substance from the rest, but if he listens for a minute he might be able to pick it out. Throughout the history of broadcasting legislation in Australia it has been recognised by governments of all political persuasions that broadcasting is an area of special sensitivity and special concern. I just put the situation in these terms: The media defines the agenda of public debate on public issues. The Liberal Party platform recognises that most explicitly. Senator MacGibbon's party's platform states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>We believe that in the interests of objective reporting of news the widest possible spread of ownership of the media is desirable. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what Senator MacGibbon believes. That statement from the Liberal Party platform recognises the relationship between ownership and diversity of content in the media. The platform of the Australian Democrats is similiar. I have consulted it with a great deal of interest. The Democrats state:</PARA>
<PARA> Undue concentration of ownership and/or control of the media should be avoided. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Labor Party-needless to say, a party competing for office in a democratic society-has a similar view. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not with much luck, but it is still competing, still persisting. It is not for me to argue the philosophical position of the Liberal Party or the Democrats. No doubt we will hear people such as Senator MacGibbon doing that. It will be a fascinating exercise indeed. That is the position of his party's platform. What I am concerned about is our position and the position which this Parliament should adopt. There is, of course, already a heavy concentration of media ownership in Australia, both within the electronic media and in cross ownership. Australia was singled out for a special mention by Lord Annan's committee in Great Britain on the future of broadcasting in that country. Lord Annan's committee gave Australia the following special mention:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In Australia newspaper interests have gained control of television stations with very strong repercussions upon political expression and news. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what Lord Annan's committee said about us. It is not a comment which is differrent from anything which has been said by media commentators in Australia-indeed, by honourable senators on both sides of this chamber. Liberal governments until now have opposed increased concentration of media ownership. The last Minister but one was a man who sought, as he said, to take politics out of broadcasting. This legislation is the most blatant example of putting politics right back into broadcasting and interfering with the broadcasting system. Let me ask one or two rhetorical questions. What are the special reasons why broadcasting should no longer be treated as a special case. What special reasons have emerged as to why broadcasting should no longer be treated as a special case, as it has been treated by Liberal governments since the beginning of the days of Menzies? What are the special reasons which dictate a change now? Secondly, what compelling clamour has there been from the broadcasting industry or the public for these changes to be made? What legions of troops outside will Government senators conjure up in support of the changes that are to be made to this legislation by this Bill?</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Puplick" NAMEID="TI4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TI4">Senator Puplick</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, not me. I thought it was the basis on which Senator Puplick made changes, because that is the only way he can justify a departure from his own philosophy, stated in this place. When he was no longer a man of straw but a man of substance with preselection assured and a Senate career ahead of him, he screwed his courage to the sticking-plate and said all those things, but not now. I ask again: How will a better system result from these changes? There has not been a word about that from the Minister for Communications in his second reading speech or anywhere else. Again, what was wrong with the system established by this Government in 1977 which makes this legislation urgently necessary now? Where did the Government go wrong in 1977 when it amended the broadcasting legislation, taking broadcasting out of politics? Where did the Fraser Government go wrong then that it demands these important changes now?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator would not know what he did and I do not think it matters much from the point of view of explaining the point to him. Why has this legislation now to be rushed through to work these changes which were so important and which the Government made in 1977? I guess that there are two clues as to why this legislation has to be rushed through now. Let me give them. The first clue was given by the Minister for Communications on 4 December last year when, in answer to a question in the House of Representatives as to why he was suggesting these legislative changes, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are a couple of instances of recent times which have caused the Government to consider the implications of the present provisions of the Broadcasting and Television Act. One is the decision by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal with respect to Channel 10 in Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA>A month later, as reported in the Journal Australian Business, he said in an interview that one of the reasons for the change was:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that there is an appeal under way before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. If there are to be changes it would be totally inequitable for the Administrative Appeals Tribunal not to know the law as it will operate at the time that it hears the case. </PARA>
<PARA>They are the two clues as to why these changes are being made. Since 1965 the law in Australia relating to institutional investors and broadcasting companies in Australia has not needed to be changed. Since 1965 the law in Australia relating to foreign residents and broadcasting proprietors has not been changed. One had to be a resident of Australia to be a broadcasting proprietor. That is now to be changed. I ask just one more question in the light of the Minister's clues. Have we reached the point in government in Australia at which we can now say that what is good for Rupert Murdoch is good for Australia?</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator MacGibbon" NAMEID="YH4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Clearly not.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad to hear it. I am very encouraged. Have we come to that point? The Government may believe that that is so, but I do not. The industry does not believe that that is so; nor does Mr Murdoch. In relation to the clues given by the Minister as to why this legislation is being introduced with such concern, detail and haste, of course, Dr Mark Armstrong in the Australian Financial Review this morning had this to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . the bill would give a gorilla of average intelligence a fair chance of circumventing the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>That is right. We have an environmental lobby in this place but I thought the Fraser Government was to be a government for all the people and that did not include gorillas, as I understood it when the statement was made by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). But this legislation does include gorillas. I have said that the Government may believe that what is good for Mr Murdoch is good for Australia, but Mr Murdoch does not. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Chipp" NAMEID="3V4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3V4">Senator Chipp</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Which gorilla have you in mind when you say that? You seem to be relishing the word.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Do not tempt me. If the Government believes that, I do not and Mr Murdoch does not either. In 1977, when talking about the broadcasting system in Australia and the role of government, Mr Murdoch said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it would be a pity if I grew any bigger in Australia. There are now basically three groups in Australia and that's too few already. If I were to grow bigger and take over one of the other groups-or to be taken over-that would be against the public interest. I'd like there to be six groups. The fewer there are the worse it is. </PARA>
<PARA>In a similar passage later on he added much the same thing to those comments. I assert that this legislation will in fact lay the way open for greater concentration of power and ownership in an area which in this Parliament has in the past been singled out for special treatment which has been accorded to it by all sides of politics, that is, in the area of ownership and control of the media. I noted with interest, when Mr Sinclair was asked on the PM program the other night whether it would result in greater concentration of media ownership, he said a few words which seemed fairly unintelligible, but he then said that in his view it would free up market forces. That was the answer to the question. I have grave difficulty in understanding what this Government is about as a matter of political principle of any kind. Need I remind honourable senators of the immortal words, which I am sure will cause a rush of blood to the heads of people such as Senator Martyr and Senator MacGibbon, of the Prime Minister spoken by Senator Chaney in Adelaide on 5 December when there was an extraordinarily abortive attempt to explain the Liberal Party's philosophy-if one can dignify it with that term. On that occasion the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> Liberalism believes that society is healthier . . . when responsibility, enterprise and power are spread widely throughout the community rather than concentrated in one of a few places. That is the ideal to be aimed at and any deviation from it requires special justification. </PARA>
<PARA>What is the special justification in this legislation in an area which has always in the past been singled out for special legislation of a kind different to that applicable to the wider business community? Frankly, is it not time that this Government puts its legislation where its mouth is in relation to these various matters which have been the subject of debate in the Senate in the last week or so? The functions of the States, for example, are said by this Government to be very important in terms of decentralisation of power. We were told that a couple of weeks ago in relation to the razor gang. I quote what was said:</PARA>
<PARA> One of the many virtues of the free enterprise system based on the market is that it decentralises influence and control over what is produced to the greatest extent possible. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the jurisdiction for the razor gang's action in this area of most critical importance. The exact opposite is happening. It is not just a question of rushing legislation through the Parli- ament. This legislation will come back to haunt this Government. Every time an Australian radio or television station falls into the control of a foreign company it will be reminded about that fact. That will happen after this legislation is passed. Every time it falls into foreign ownership or the hands of an Australian citizen who is not a resident of this country the Government will be reminded about it. Every time there is a further aggregation of power it will be set right back to this legislation which is now before the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to some of the details of what this Bill does. I will deal briefly with it point by point. Firstly, this Bill introduces supplementary radio licences for FM radio and regional areas particularly one station markets. That particular amendment is uncalled for by the public and is unsatisfactory to the industry body the Federation of Australian Radio Broadcasters. Most honourable senators will have received a letter bearing, I think, today's date from the Secretary of the Federation of Australian Radio Broadcasters, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> Federation members generally support the concept, but are dismayed at some of the provisions which seek to give effect to it, and are particularly disturbed at the haste with which the legislation is being handled. No cogent reason has been given for this urgency. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to urge a course of action in respect of the Bill. I do not want to dwell on the section relating to supplemantary licences because it at least has the virtue of the Minister indicating that it will not be proclaimed for some time. The second thing the legislation does is to change--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will continue, Mr President. I am persuaded of the view that in Senator MacGibbon's case, my words probably fall on deaf ears. The second thing which the legislation does is to change the traditional ownership and control provisions of the legislation. Simply stated, it no longer requires prior approval for a takeover of a television or radio company. That is, except in the case of the Herald and Weekly Times. It no longer requires the prior approval of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal for a takeover of a radio or television company except in the case of the Herald and Weekly Times, as a result of an amendment rushed into the House of Representatives on Friday of last week. It is very interesting to record that the Herald and Weekly Times amendment-as we might call it; the Thomas Nationwide Transport amendment is another clause in the Bill and there are several other amendments all of which can be attributed to the interests of particular companies-resulted from a deputation to the Prime Minister last Friday week, after the Bill had gone to print. Of course, as a result of that representation this amendment was moved last Friday while the debate was being carried on in the House of Representatives. As I have said, it is fascinating to see the way in which this Government does business on these matters. If the editor of the Woy Woy Gazette turned up tonight, the Bill would be taken out and another amendment would be put in tomorrow to deal with that particular newspaper. It is unlikely though because I do not think the Government believes what it says about concentrations of power. I do not think it is concerned to reflect in this legislation the interests of other than the large corporations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The third important point is that as a result of this legislation there is effectively no limitation on the number of licences which can be controlled by any one company for a limited period, say, six months plus three months, depending on the largesse or otherwise of the Broadcasting Tribunal. That provision effectively would allow a takeover to occur and there is no limitation in that period imposed on the number of licences which can be controlled by any one person or company. That lays the way open for potential total domination by major media companies. I would simply put it in these terms. It is open for a major media company in the city to say to a regional television station: 'Just buy our programs on our terms or we will buy you and after six months sell your company to somebody who will take our programs on our conditions'. Under the provisions of this legislation, that quite clearly seems to be open to a large proprietor. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can we come to that a little later? I have some doubt about that. Of course, that is done in the name of freeing up the market. But it is freeing up the market in a most undesirable way, having regard to the special nature of the market with which we are concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The next thing the legislation does is to insert a definition of public interest-a definition which, I might point out, was still being amended on Friday when the matter was in the House of Representatives. That definition now runs right through the legislation-it appears in six places, I think-in place of the discretion previously vested in the Tribunal since the 1977 legislation introduced by this Government. That legislation vested a discretion in the Tribunal. The new definition appears, as I have said, several times in the legislation and essentially it introduces an exhaustive description of what public interest is and leaves no discretion in the Tribunal on a number of important matters. In regional areas the Tribunal will still have regard to local concentration of media ownership but in metropolitan areas where 70 per cent of the Australian population lives it will not have a discretion. In addition, the new criteria are narrow. They include, for example, whether the company or a person is fit and proper to hold a licence; the commercial viability of the applicant; whether the applicant will provide comprehensive programming and so on. Four or five criteria are set out in the second reading speech of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume). </PARA>
<PARA> I should just remind the Senate that since 1977 the Tribunal has been developing criteria which included concentration of media ownership in particular areas and in the Channel 10 case in Melbourne even included a reference to cross-ownership between newspapers and the electronic media. Those criteria have been developed in a number of cases which were referred to in debate in the Senate, I think by both me and Senator Missen in discussing the statement of the Minister for Communications of 9 April. All those criteria which had the explicit and implicit approval of the High Court will now, if I might use a colloquialism, go down the chute in favour of the narrow definition of public interest set down in this legislation. Those criteria of the Tribunal were established in the 2HD case and the ATV 10 case in particular. </PARA>
<PARA> The next point I would make about the legislation is that it includes provisions for institutional investors in media companies. A register of institutional investors will be prepared. The prescribed interest which an institutional investor can have in a television company has been increased from 5 per cent to 10 per cent. We of the Opposition are not necessarily saying that this is bad in itself. It is an attempt suggested by the Herald and Weekly Times group to resolve a particular problem. But under the scheme of this legislation it will be possible for an institutional investor to have a 10 per cent interest in a large number of metropolitan television stations. I suggest, whilst I say it is not necessarily bad, that it will probably introduce a note of great uncertainty into the industry and place institutional investors in a very strong bargaining position in relation to the industry as a whole across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The next point I want to make is that the legislation also alters the foreign ownership provisions in relation to Australian media companies. I do not know what member of the Australian public clamoured for this change, what ordinary Australians asked for this to be done; I do not know what television or radio companies asked for this to be done. I just wonder whether the Government in its haste to placate particular interests has thought through the consequences of this change because under the Broadcasting and Television Act it is no longer necessary for a person with a controlling interest in licences to be an Australian resident-a requirement which has existed since the commencement of the Act. One can only speculate about the consequences of that change. Let me just remind the Senate that there are plenty of Australian citizens living overseas in Hong Kong and elsewhere who might have a particular interest in this matter. It goes far wider than the case it has been designed to fix up. There are, I believe, very serious potential ramifications in that change. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point on foreign ownership is that the legislation in my view-I emphasise the words 'in my view'-provides a very neat method whereby foreign interests can gain a very substantial control of Australian radio and television companies because the tracing provisions of the Act in relation to foreign companies are to be removed. That simply means that once the Act is amended in this way the National Broadcasting Co. of the United States, for example, will not be able to buy a direct interest in an Australian television company in excess of 20 per cent; that the National Broadcasting Co. of the United States will be able to buy up to a 50 per cent interest in-let us say Thomas Enterprises-in Australia and Thomas Enterprises will be able to buy up to a 50 per cent controlling interest in a broadcasting company. If two companies in the United States want to get into Australian media, they can buy interests-one in Thomas Enterprises and the other in Puplick Pty Ltd and from there they can make raids on television companies in this country. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think they are; I think that is the point. I think shareholders in many American companies will see this as a very sound investment because Australian television is of course now very profitable and has been for a few years. That is an important fact to remember. I do not think the Australian broadcasting industry, when it stops to think about these proposals which are designed to satisfy Rupert Murdoch on the one hand and Thomas Nationwide Transport Ltd on the other hand, will be quite intoxicated with the ramifications of those provisions relating to foreign investment. My God, I tell you, Mr President, the Australian people will not be intoxicated either. Those are matters which I think a careful Senate would consider in great detail because they are matters, I believe, of very great concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I mentioned that there is now no requirement for prior approval of the Broadcasting Tribunal of a takeover. The only exception is in relation to the Herald and Weekly Times group and the Daily Mirror group of companies in Britain which are said to be recipients of the benefits of the so-called grandfather clause. Prior approval will be required in relation to those two companies. Looking at the drafting of this legislation and at the proposal in relation to the Herald and Weekly Times, whilst the Goverment may have the best intentions towards complying with the particular vested interests of those companies, I think most lawyers would say that the Government has mucked it up. The Government has gone out of its way to satisfy the Herald and Weekly Times and has messed it up. I am just asserting that. I am not going to tell the Government how it mucked it up but I am sure it has and the Herald and Weekly Times will find out about that in due course. </PARA>
<PARA> The provision that the prior approval of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal is required has not been a terrible inhibition to Australian companies and those who seek to take over media companies. Mr Holmes a'Court, not, I would think, an unsuccessful businessman in Australia, did not have too much difficulty when he sought to take over the Herald and Weekly Times in obtaining the prior approval of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. Sir Peter Abeles said on behalf of TNT in evidence to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal that it was not a great problem for that company to make a conditional offer for shares in Ansett Transport Industries subject to the approval of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. He stood in the market-place and made a conditional offer subject to that approval; it was not a great bother to him. I do not know who this particular provision is really concerned to satisfy as a matter of urgency. Those are the principal objections which the Opposition has to this legislation. They are all, in my view, matters of grave concern and matters of substantial principle in relation to this industry and the sorts of developments in this industry which Australians want to see happening. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the intention to amend this Bill was first announced, the Minister has invited comment about it from various people and institutions. Many of those who were invited to make comment about it sought a public inquiry on the changes in the ownership and control provisions of the broadcasting legislation. Many of them sought a public inquiry on the broadcasting industry generally. The Minister described those as hare-brained suggestions. Many whose views were sought opposed specific proposals which are now in this legislation. All sorts of proposals which the Minister made last November and which he was still making as at 9 April have been abandoned or changed. Last minute amendments and reprints were going on when the Bill was being debated in the House of Representatives last week. All of these matters amount, if I might summarise, to a saga of incompetence, connivance and persistence, about which the Minister for Communications is to be congratulated. At least he has been persistent about the fundamental purpose of this legislation. Many of the 55 pages of it are really guff designed to confuse. </PARA>
<PARA> After all this saga of seven or eight months, all the changes which have been made and the changes which were still being made to the Bill last week, there is still very substantial opposition to this legislation. I mention some of that opposition. Regional Television of Australia-the industry body for regional television-is opposed to this legislation. The Canberra Times, in an editorial this morning, said this:</PARA>
<PARA> It is obviously complex and has ambiguities, and some of its provisions are questionable, to say the least. If passed in its present form, as is all too likely, there is little doubt that it will undergo time-consuming and costly testing in the courts. </PARA>
<PARA>That is good for the lawyers, not good for broadcasting. The Federation of Australian Radio Broadcasters is opposed to the legislation in its present form for specific reasons relating to its interests. Professor Julius Stone has written at length on the need to strengthen the public interest provisions in this legislation. Myles Wright, a former chairman of the Broadcasting Control Board, has expressed concern about the haste with which this legislation has been proceeded and about the changes which it is making. Dr Mark Armstrong, a media law specialist, is reported in today's Australian Financial Review as expressing concern about the provisions of this Bill. Again I mention the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations. I do not know what its position is today but last week it was very concerned about the public interest provisions of this legislation and it was concerned about the desirability of prior approval for all transactions in broadcasting licences. I am sure there will be much more concern if this legislation is passed. The public interest group, Justice in Broadcasting, which has taken a long interest in broadcasting matters-it is not a vested interest group but a public interest group in the true sense because its interest is not in any sense vested but altruistic-is opposed to this legislation. So are bodies like the Victorian Council for Children's Film and Television, the South Australian Council of the same body, the Australian Broadcasting Commission body Aunty's Nieces and Nephews, various social justice groups of the churches and the Rupert Public Interest Movement which I must say is distinct from Rupert private interest which this Bill is designed to serve. </PARA>
<PARA> The sad thing, of course, is that no one is prepared to come out and say and no Government senator will come out and tell us tonight how this legislation will improve and benefit the broadcasting system, how it will be justified in terms of the great, long history of broadcasting legislation in Australia. Nobody is really going to tell us why these changes are justified. They are things which are going to be, as it were, swept under the carpet. There has been no great pride in this legislation by any Liberal with whom I have discussed it. They know that it is a sordid little piece of legislation. There will be no crowing from the rooftops by the Liberal Party about what it has done for the broadcasting system in Australia by presenting this Bill to the Senate and to the Parliament as a whole. That is the sad thing about it all. Everybody in this chamber knows why it all happened and the industry knows why it all happened. By the next general election the people will know why it all happened. No one is going to stand up and say that this Government has done great things for Australia by changing this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, this Senate over which you preside is said to be a House of review. A former Clerk of the Senate, Mr Odgers, justified the Senate's existence in that immortal phrase that two sieves are better than one. Well, the House of Representatives had two hours to sieve this piece of legislation and, with respect to it, it did not do much of a job. This place will not have much longer at this stage of the year to sieve this piece of legislation. But if the glib words about the Senate being a House of review are to mean anything, this Senate should have a close look at this legislation which has been criticised all over the place, which has not been clamoured for, as I said, by the people of Australia, which was not called for by the broadcasting industry, which was conceived in a sordid moment after the last election and which has been pursued with diligence and persistence. The only virtue that can be associated with the legislation is that at least the Government has been persistent about it and the results which the legislation is designed to achieve. And we all know what those are. </PARA>
<PARA> If this Senate is to mean anything as a House of review, it would be derelict in its functions if it failed to review this legislation because of some sort of clamour to go on holidays or something of that kind. That is, as I understand it, what the Senate is all about. I only understand it because I have heard it said time and time again by so many Government senators as we seek to justify our existence in this place. We seek to justify it by saying: 'Look, we are a House of review. No sloppy legislation, no sordid legislation gets past our diligent eyes; not here in the Senate. It is all very thoroughly dealt with, because we are a House of review'. I accordingly move:</PARA>
<PARA> Leave out all words after 'That', insert:</PARA>
<PARA> 'the Bill be referred to a Select Committee of the Senate for inquiry and report by the first sitting day in August 1981, and that the membership and powers of the Select Committee be contained in a subsequent resolution'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats agree with a great deal of what Senator Button has said. We certainly agree with the content of his amendment, namely, that the matter be referred to a select committee of the Senate. If Senator Button's amendment is defeated by the Senate, I will have the honour to move, pursuant to Standing Order 196A, that the Bill be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts for inquiry and report by the first sitting day in August 1981. The Democrats absolutely agree with Senator Button and the Australian Labor Party that this is a sloppy Bill. It will cause havoc in the broadcasting industry and joy among the legal profession. God knows what it will do to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. Let me quote the remarks of someone who is much more learned than I on this matter. I refer to Mr Mark Armstrong, a senior lecturer in law at the University of New South Wales, who said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Tribunal could find itself a statutory company manager, caught in the crossfire between warring factions. But in reality, staff ceilings have been repeatedly lowered. Tribunal offices outside Sydney are likely to close and there is a large backlog of work. The section will probably stand as a lifeless memorial to the sensibilities of the rebel senators whom it was apparently designed to appease. </PARA>
<PARA>Without making any cheap political points, I am astonished that of all the legislation that has come with a rush in the latter part of this session there should be such acquiescence on the part of all Liberal senators in this legislation. I do not refer just to points of philosophy. One can understand how they would agree to a package from the Government which stated: 'If you agree to the amendments on the Freedom of Information Bill and the airlines legislation, we will cave in on the Broadcasting and Television Bill'. I am referring to the question of English expression and the kind of morass that this Bill will bring to the industry and all associated with it if it is allowed to pass tonight. That is why we say that the matter should be referred to a committee of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I will move my amendment to ward off criticism by honourable senators opposite who say that they will not vote for a select committee to inquire into the matter because they would not have control over its membership or when it reports. My amendment seeks to have the matter referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts, a committee that already has distinguished itself in many areas in the lifetime of this Senate. </PARA>

If my amendment were carried, at least we would have an all party committee of the Senate looking at the legislation to try to tidy it up. If Senator Puplick raises that as an objection, I respect it but do not accept it. I ask him, as a senator who sadly will soon be leaving us, temporarily one would hope, to look at this legislation objectively. Is he happy, in his mind, for this legislation to go on to the statute book? Is he happy for the legislation, as it stands, to be impacted onto the television industry?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me give a brief history of the lead up to this legislation. As soon as Mr Sinclair was appointed Minister for Communications he was issuing statements and having discussions with all sorts of people about changes to the Broadcasting and Television Act. From December statements were coming out fairly regularly, but the definitive one was his statement of 9 April, only two months ago today. That was his first real statement. There have been literally dozens of changes made to this Bill from what was indicated in the original statement of 9 April. This Bill is hardly recognisable as coming from the same family as the parent statement as so many changes have been made. If Senator Puplick were to say that the back benchers were responsible for that, I would commend him. I would say on record: 'Thank goodness a group of senators, including Senator Puplick, was prepared to stand up to Mr Sinclair and say that the legislation was absurd and the group would not have a bar of it'. Let me mention the classic example of Mr Sinclair wanting to put to the Tribunal his view as to what public interest should be. I am glad that Liberals such as Senator Puplick destroyed that outrageous proposition very quickly. Then the proposal for a type of supplementary television licence for regional areas was dropped. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill was introduced into the House of Representatives last Wednesday. The Bill I have in my hand is the Bill that was read a third time in the House of Representatives. It bears almost no resemblance to the Bill that was originally introduced into the House of Representatives last Wednesday, not a week ago. Eight pages of complicated amendments were circulated in the House of Representatives during the two hours provided for debate on this Bill. Although I would love to incorporate the amendments in Hansard I will not do so because I would bore the Senate. If the amendments were incorporated, readers could see the absurdity of the situation concerning the debate tonight on this complex matter which will have so much impact on the industry and Australia. In fact, there were amendments to amendments. Some amendments were wrong because of misprints, bad English or whatever. </PARA>
<PARA> It is crystal clear that this Bill has been drafted in great haste and rammed through the House of Representatives. Its present form shows that. Let me give an example of a couple of the absurdities that were contained in the Bill. Senator Puplick could well say that they were in the Bill but they have been taken out. Notwithstanding the keenness of people such as Senator Puplick, I dare say other absurdities are still left in this complicated piece of legislation that he and his colleagues did not pick up. We on this side of the chamber have not had the privilege he has had. We saw the Bill only last Wednesday or Thursday. He and his colleagues apparently have had at least since April to discuss the matter with the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give an example of something that happened, not a month ago, but last Thursday. I understand that the Broadcasting Tribunal basically has six powers in regard to television licences. It can grant a licence, review a licence, approve the transfer of a licence, approve share transactions with regard to a licence, suspend a licence or revoke a licence. They are its six basic powers over licences. Even as late as last Thursday the following provision at page 11, line 20, was in the section dealing with the renewal of licences. I invite Senator Puplick to listen to this. I am sure he would find it amusing if it were not so sad. Sub-clause (iii), which was still in the Bill last Thursday instructed the Tribunal not to renew the licence:</PARA>
<PARA>Where, in the opinion of the Tribunal, in the area to be served in pursuance of the licence, satisfactory reception is being obtained of programs from one or more broadcasting or televisions stations-the need for the commercial viability of that station or those stations. </PARA>
<PARA>That was in the Bill last Thursday. Of course, it has been taken out. It was an error. What would it have meant if it had been left in the Bill? This is not a draft, typewritten Bill. This is a printed Bill brought into a House of the Parliament which is being asked to pass it. When say, Channel 9 in Melbourne, was having its application for a renewal of its licence heard, this clause would have instructed the Tribunal to have regard to the commercial viability of that station, Channel 9, or the other stations. Let us assume that when that hearing was underway Channel 7 in Melbourne was having a very bad run, that its ratings were down, that its advertising was down and that it was losing money hand over fist. The Tribunal would have been forced to call Channel 9, Channel 10 and Channel 7 to the hearing and say: 'Look, we are obliged by this Act, before renewing your licence, Channel 9, to have regard to the commercial viability of the other stations'. What would it have done then? Would it have said to Channel 9 and Channel 10: 'You are being far too entertaining for the viewing public. Put some more boring stuff on so that you will lose your ratings and will drag yourself down to the level of Channel 7'.</PARA>
<PARA> I have discussed this matter with lawyers, and that is precisely what this provision would have done. I am not blaming officers of the Department of Communications. I am not blaming anybody except the Minister and the Government for saying that this legislation must be rushed through. Thankfully, somebody picked that up. I had a look at it last Thursday and thought it was a little odd, and now it has been taken out altogether. But it was a clear mistake. If a mistake of that magnitude was allowed to creep into the Act, what others are still there which those of us who have had little time to examine the Bill have not found?</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button mentioned that representatives from the Herald and Weekly Times group were in Canberra last week pleading for a certain amendment to the Act. I do not blame them for that. It is their duty to do that. If an amendment to an Act disadvantages any group, of course it is their right. In fact it is their responsibility to their shareholders to come and point it out to the Minister. Senator Button who, sometimes like a more important person, moves in most mysterious ways, did not enlighten us as to how that so-called Herald and Weekly Times amendment would not work, but I take his point. Maybe it will not work. That again will not be the fault of the Department or of the Herald and Weekly Times. It will be the fault of the Government for rushing this matter through. Let me now refer to the supplementary licences for radio. Senator Button said:</PARA>
<PARA> In effect, no new FM radio station can be established in a non-metropolitan area unless the existing AM station applies to the Broadcasting Tribunal for a supplementary licence. Only when that happens is the question of whether the markets can sustain a new radio station, and an independent one, up for consideration. </PARA>
<PARA>I have had that checked and that basically is the situation. That is outrageous. In a country or regional town if there is one radio station or one commercial radio station-which is almost invariably the case-that has an AM frequency, which it would have, the people in that area cannot have FM radio unless that station applies to the Tribunal for one. There is an exception to that. The Minister has power to ask other people to put in a licence application if he considers it to be in the public interest so to do. I ask the Senate to look at the reality of this. We are talking about broadcasting, an incredibly important part of the fabric of our life. Let us assume, without necessarily impugning anybody in particular, that this is largely a National Country Party town. Let us assume that the radio station in that country town is owned by National Country Party interests, and God knows that applies to about 90 per cent of country radio stations in Australia. Let us further assume that there is a National Country Party Minister and that when he goes to that electorate the radio station management invites him for a drink in the board room and says: 'Look Minister, you are not going to fiddle around with this licence. We are doing very well here with our AM. Our profits are way up. Why should we complicate the business and worry our shareholders by asking for another licence and going to additional expense? The status quo will suit us fine'. It would suit them fine and it would suit the National Country Party Minister fine because it is in his political interest to leave the status quo as it is. But what about the people in the area which that radio station services? Are they not entitled to hear classical music? Are they not entitled to hear some varied programs? I would have thought that there would be some arrangement for citizens' access so that citizens' initiative could have some application in that situation and so that it would not be up to the initiative of either the management of the radio station or the Minister. I suggest that this surely needs a re-think. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us now refer to the minimum six-month period of grace after the Tribunal has made a decision that a takeover company has to unload unlawful ownership of excess television stations. I have respect for Senator Puplick and I suggest without impertinence that even he has not caught on to this next thing which I will mention. I would like him to answer when he speaks. I am indebted to Senator Button again for pointing it out. Because of this six-month period of grace after the Tribunal has made a decision it is now open for the major media companies to say, for example, to a regional television station: 'Buy our programs on our terms or we will buy you. After six months we will sell your company to somebody who will take our programs on our conditions'. I say through you, Mr Acting Deputy President, straight to Senator Puplick, the kind of advice I have had and the Australian Democrats have had is that that is absolutely possible as this amendment is redrafted. I shall take Kerry Packer's name in vain, but I do not think he will mind. I have great admiration for him. Kerry Packer could go to the Dubbo television station-I do not think that Kerry Packer would do this; I believe he is an honourable person and I am not impugning him-and he could say: 'Buy my Sixty Minutes for X thousand dollars'-an outrageous price-'and unless you agree to do that, Dubbo'-or whatever the name of the station is-'we will buy you'. There will be a period of grace until the Tribunal considers the application. They have six months to divest themselves of that new station. He could say: 'Then we will sell your company in Dubbo to somebody who will take our programs'. What sort of country television station or regional television station could withstand that kind of standover tactic? Again at the end of the story I apologise to Kerry Packer for taking his name in vain but I did so to make the point more realistic. </PARA>

Legal advice is that with the change in overseas ownership requirements, foreign interests may now own up to 49 per cent of a television station; that a friend could purchase an additional 2 per cent of the shares and, the friend being in the service of the foreign company, such company could control an Australian television station or several stations.</PARA></TALK.START>

Thus, Paramount or NBC-foreign companies-and John Smith, an Australian citizen, in the pay of one of those foreign companies, could own between them 51 per cent. According to the best legal advice under this amendment that is absolutely possible. That is another reason why the Australian Democrats plead with the Senate and, through you Mr Acting Deputy President, with Liberals like Senator Puplick to say that there is no hurry for this to go through; that we should let it wait until the first sitting in August and in the meantime refer it to either a select or a standing committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to refer to some of the areas in respect of which the Australian Democrats might be at variance, in principle, with the Australian Labor Party. We believe that defining the public interest is a good thing. I would agree with that provision of the Bill and would commend those Liberal Party back benchers who have forced the Minister to insert in the measure a definition of public interest. I have always been interested in sport. One of the unbreakable traditions is that the rules are set before the game begins, whether it be cricket, tennis or football, so that the participants will know what they can do and in what circumstances. To have an umpire arbitrate part way through the game and say, 'In my discretion this rule ought to be changed,' or 'that rule added' seems to me to be absurd, unfair and inequitable, especially when it is not a sporting contest but rather an activity in which people have invested millions of dollars. I am referring to a television station or a series of television stations. I believe that their interests ought to be protected so that station managements will know what the rules are. </PARA>
<PARA> I might have some quarrel with the way in which public interest has been defined in the measure. In general terms, I have not. It could be argued that the definition is too narrow or too exhaustive, but in general terms I would have no great objection to it, nor would the Australian Democrats. It appals me to leave the definition of public interest to an arbiter, or arbiters, who are not directly responsible to the people. That is why I say, with the greatest respect to the members of the Tribunal, that the task of determining what is or is not in the public interest should never have been allotted to them. Politicians are by far the best people to determine what is in the public interest. We are a much maligned group of people, in some cases properly so, but if in our lifetime of service as politicians we have not learned what is or is not in the public interest, no matter to which party we belong, we have been gross failures. I would not have been averse to the public interest being defined by the Parliament itself but one can understand in a flash the kind of pressures that would be brought to bear on the political party systems. Therefore, I believe that to provide for this in the legislation is wise and I commend the Government for so doing. </PARA>
<PARA> I am worried about the future, insofar as television is concerned. Supplementary licences are not dealt with in the legislation, nor are satellites or transponders-whatever they may be. Such matters will present the industry with massive problems in the future. That is what makes it even more vital that this basic legislation should be sound, so that the other aspects may be added in the next year or two. </PARA>
<PARA> I still confess to having an open mind on what form of networking should be allowed in Australia. I confess to having an open mind on whether it is necessarily a bad thing for three organisations to own two stations, one each in Melbourne and Sydney. Is that against the public interest? I could make a fairly powerful case that it is in the public interest. Let me be the devil's advocate just for a moment. To begin with, the competition for ratings in Melbourne and Sydney between channels 10, 7 and 9 is as fierce as any champion of private enterprise would want to see anywhere. To that extent, the competition itself would keep the participants honest. Would Mr Packer have been able to produce the magnificent documentary Sixty Minutes unless he owned or controlled two stations? I do not know the answer. I suspect that he could not. His company, and other companies which own two stations, have produced much Australian drama and have given much employment to Australian actors and actresses, whether or not we might agree or disagree with the intellectual or entertainment merits of programs such as Cop Shop or Prisoner. </PARA>

It might well be in the public interests of the advertisers, the actors, the writers, the scripters and so on to have this kind of system. Whichever way it goes, I believe that this is a matter which, as Senator Button has suggested, ought to be referred, if not to a standing committee, to a select committee. Again, why should we not require of the applicant for a television licence that he be both an Australian citizen and an Australian resident. Is there any reason for not requiring that? For these and many other reasons, the Democrats support very strenuously, and commend, the attitude taken by the Labor Party on this Bill in requesting that it be referred to a committee.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is quite true to say that this is an extremely difficult and complicated debate and an extremely difficult and complicated piece of legislation. It is equally true to say that the role of broadcasting and of the media generally within Australian social, political and cultural life is one of the principal determinants of what Australian society, in the foreseeable future, is going to be like. To that extent, I think it is incumbent on as many honourable senators as possible to try to get some understanding of the complexities of this legislation. I do not for a moment pretend that I am in a position to explain every clause and sub-clause either of this legislation or, indeed, of the primary Act. I don't know if anyone is. I do believe however that the essence of this amendment Bill can be understood and can be put within its context in terms of developing a more flexible, more open and more modern broadcasting system and legislative framework for broadcasting in Australia than we have at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Three point were directly put to me for some sort of specific answer. Two points were put to me by Senator Chipp and one by Senator Button. One of the points referred to by Senator Chipp was the situation of the Kerry Packer standover tactic, if I might use that shorthand expression. The other referred to foreign ownership provisions. It is certainly my intention in the course of my remarks to come back to both of those two matters which Senator Chipp raised. The third point was put in a more global sense by Senator Button when he asked: 'Can anybody explain why any of the changes in this legislation are necessary or are justified?' Therefore, I will start at that point. I simply wish to indicate some of the things that are in this legislation which I believe are appropriate to this stage of our broadcasting development in Australia. Again, I will come back to nearly all these points in the course of my remarks. </PARA>
<PARA> The first point is that I do believe that it is now time for the question of supplementary radio licences to be brought into some sort of legislative framework. I believe that the question of the provision of frequency modulation services into increasing areas in Australia is important. I believe that the regime which is put forward in this piece of legislation, which depends initially on the willingness of the existing amplitude modulation operators to expand their services, is not left in an unqualified situation, and that the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair), responding to the sort of public pressure, the sort of public interest groups of which Senator Chipp has very properly mentioned, is himself in a position to initiate these additional expansions of FM radio services in non-metropolitan areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, I think it is quite clear that it is necessary to spell out a more precise position so far as the situation faced by institutional investors is concerned. The ownership, control and the deeming provisions have led to the sorts of situations in which major investors like Australian Mutual Provident Society have found themselves unwittingly in breach of the Act. Clearly it is necessary that this needs to be tidied up. This Bill does that by variations between the 5 per cent and 10 per cent control and limitation of holdings which is to be found in proposed new section 91D. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, I think there is a need for clarity in the concept of Australian resident or Australian citizen. I spent a pleasant enough hour and a half, I think, listening to Senator Evans leading for the Australian Labor Party at a hearing of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal at which he had the great joy, which undoubtedly many of his colleagues would give their eye teeth for, of being able to put certain questions to Mr Murdoch under oath and to explore whether in fact Mr Murdoch did live at Cavan, Yass, or whether he lived in some penthouse on Fifth Avenue or wherever it happened to be. He explored at length the question whether he was--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Evans" NAMEID="VD4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TI4">Senator PUPLICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, Senator. I recall it quite clearly. The Chairman said: 'I am going to give you a limit of 30 minutes'. You, Senator Evans, took an hour and a half after producing all the documentary evidence that showed that the Chairman could not do that to you and if he tried to do it to you he would find himself in trouble.</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Evans" NAMEID="VD4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TI4">Senator PUPLICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot imagine you being shut up. If we all had the powers of Mr Gyngell, Senator Evans, it might indeed have saved us a great deal of time. The fourth area in this legislation which I think clearly needs to be tidied up is the question of the meaning of the term 'control'. Confusion has existed between the 15 per cent ownership provision and the control of 50 per cent of the shares and the voting power in particular companies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fifth point that I think needs to be cleared up and which this legislation seeks to clear up is to improve some of the procedures of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal regarding the time of hearings, the expedition of hearings and, indeed, the power of the Tribunal to give certain directions regarding the nature and conditions attached to licences which will be found in proposed new section 92M of the proposed amendments. The sixth point is that there is in this legislation a positive encouragement to localism in terms of programming and in terms of advertising. I refer the Senate to the proposed new sub-section 85 (5) (d) (i) and (ii) of section 83 as set out in clause 13 (d) and proposed new section 105R (3). </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, as Senator Chipp has rightly said-I will certainly come back to this-there is a need for clarity in the definition of the public interest criteria. If, indeed, one looks at the report of the Administrative Review Council on the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal procedures, one will find at page 33 of that report and following that the weaknesses described by the Administrative Review Council as revealed by experience of the ABT. It mentions lack of inquiry experience, imperfect legislation, insufficiently defined procedures, inadequate definition of issues, over-emphasis on renewal inquiries, unnecessary hearings, unprepared hearings, unclear right of participation and difficulties of investigation. It then goes on to make a series of recommendations, including the recommendation regarding the definition of public interest. I think it clearly indicates that at this stage in the development of our broadcasting legislation that amendments along the lines that this Bill proposes are clearly justified and are clearly necessary.</PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, before going on to some other of the major parts of this legislation, I would like to indicate that there are a number of comparatively minor matters raised in this legislation which, nevertheless, are of great significance. For instance, I refer to the decision to institute through proposed new section 91C a system of what are called registered lenders so that people who are seeking funds within this particular area instead of being constrained to go only to trading banks will be able to raise funds from those lenders who are registered for that purpose with the Tribunal. There are certainly, as I have said, the variations on the limits of holdings-the five per cent to 10 per cent rise-and the particular problem confronted by the Australian Mutual Provident Society which section 91D seeks to deal with. There are amendments to the merchandising powers of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. There are a number of other minor amendments. There are the questions of increased penalties, more appropriate penalties for various breaches which will be found in clauses 40 and 46 of this particular piece of legislation relating to proposed new sections 92M and P and section 132 of the primary legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to draw attention again to certain matters which will be found in this legislation that I believe are important and which will add to the diversity and the quality of the nature of broadcasting in Australia. In proposed new section 83 (5) (d) (i) and 83 (5) (d) (ii) one sees that the Tribunal is able to set certain types of standards to ensure that a licensee provides</PARA>
<PARA>. . . an adequate and comprehensive service in pursuance of the licence having regard to-</PARA>
<PARA> (A) the nature of the community to be served in pursuance of the licence;</PARA>
<PARA> (B) the diversity of the interests of that community and;</PARA>
<PARA> (C) the nature of the other broadcasting and television services (if any) of which satisfactory reception is obtained by that community; and</PARA>
<PARA>(ii) encourage the provision of programs</PARA>
<PARA> wholly or substantially produced in Australia and use, and encourage the use of Australian creative resources and in connection with the provision of programs. </PARA>
<PARA>There is a positive encouragement in the legislation which will be found in that section. In terms of local advertising, which will be found in section 105R (3), the Bill states:</PARA>
<PARA> The holder of a supplementary licence shall, in the broadcasting of advertisements, encourage as far as practicable advertisements that are produced, or relate to businesses, undertakings, activities or other matters, in the area served in pursuance of the licence and of any associated commercial translator licence, and, to the extent of his compliance with this sub-section, that licensee shall not be taken to contravene sub-section 100 (3). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The introduction of proposed new paragraph 92FAA (7) (b), which relates to the early and expeditious hearings of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, is important. Perhaps most important of all is the introduction of proposed new section 92M, which relates specifically to the matter which Senator Chipp raised at an earlier stage about what I called, in my shorthand, the Kerry Packer standover tactic about which he was worried. Proposed new sub-section 92M (1), if I may read it in full, provides:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At any time after a transaction takes place, being a transaction in relation to which section 90J or 92F applies, the Tribunal may, by notice in writing served on-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) a person who is a prescribed party to the transaction within the meaning of that section;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) a person, being the company holding the licence to which the transaction relates; or</PARA>
<PARA> (c) a person who is in a position to control that company,</PARA>
<PARA>give such directions to the person as it thinks fit for the purpose of preventing the person or any servant or agent of the person from doing any act or thing likely to have an adverse effect on-</PARA>
<PARA> (d) the ability of the company holding the licence to comply with the conditions of the licence; or</PARA>
<PARA> (e) the operations conducted under or by virtue of the licence, the management of the station in respect of which the licence is in force or the selection or provision of the programs to be broadcast or televised by that station. </PARA>
<PARA>Quite clearly in that proposed new sub-section there is spelt out the power of the Tribunal to give directions, not at the end of a six-month period but, in the words of the proposed new sub-section, 'at any time after a transaction takes place', to any person who is a prescribed party or to a company which is a prescribed party to such a transaction. It may give such directions as it sees fit dealing with programming, changes to programming, management, and changes to management which in the opinion of the Tribunal should not be undertaken while that matter is still before the Tribunal for its consideration of the eventual approval or non-approval of the transaction in question. I put to the Senate that quite clearly in proposed new section 92M the powers are given to the Tribunal to take account of the particular interference, the particular standover tactic, to which Senator Chipp was alluding when he spoke earlier in the debate. The Bill then goes on to give, in proposed new section 92N, certain powers to the Tribunal to order divestiture and to make those powers enforceable powers in relation to proposed new section 92P regarding the powers of the Federal Court of Australia to give teeth, to give judicial effect, to the decision that the Tribunal has made. So the first of those points raised by Senator Chipp, I believe, can be answered in that fashion. </PARA>
<PARA> It is certainly true that a number of matters have fallen to the floor, as it were, between Mr Sinclair's statement of 9 April and the eventual emergence of this piece of legislation. Senator Button has been unkind enough to misquote, as it were, a certain attitude that I took to this matter by saying that things were going to be done over my dead body. On 27 November 1980 I asked a question about the university proposed for Darwin. I asked whether Mr Murdoch had been pressing for amendments to the Broadcasting and Television Act 'which, I would add, would be vigorously opposed by some Government senators . . .'. That was as much as I said and the specific thing that was being touted about at that time was the question of whether the action Mr Murdoch had underway could be overtaken by changes to the Act so that, as Senator Chipp said, the rules of the game were altered during the play. I am delighted to say that those Government senators who vigorously opposed that course of action were successful in their vigorous opposition. Senator Button went on to say that I said that only after my preselection was secured and I had no worries, despite the fact that I said it after the Federal election when the result of that election was already known, and he invited me to 'screw my courage to the sticking-place'. I recall what happened to the gentleman who took Lady Macbeth's advice in that quotation and I have absolutely no intention of following him down that primrose path. </PARA>
<PARA> The first matter that I said was missing from Mr Sinclair's statement related to the question of supplementary television licences. Representations were made and quite clearly the idea of supplementary television licences was abandoned for the purposes of this legislation, although related specifically to awaiting the result of the investigation that the Broadcasting Tribunal is undertaking into the question of cable television and subscription television. Quite clearly the television stations said that they did not want a system of supplementaries forced on them until they had answers to the STV questions. The Government has clearly said: 'If that is the view of the television stations, we will not force this matter until we have the STV report which we will be able to consider in some depth'. I am sorry for CTC 7 in Canberra, which I think was one of the stations which would have been able-should have been able-to pursue the question of supplementary licences without this being linked to STV. I hope that its problem can be responded to appropriately as soon as the ABT report is to hand. </PARA>
<PARA> The second thing which was previously in Mr Sinclair's statement and which no longer is there is the ministerial discretion on the question of public interest-the right of the Minister to give directions to the Tribunal about public interest. I am glad to see that that has been removed. The third thing that has been removed is the transitional provisions. Mr Sinclair, in his statement to the House of Representatives on 9 April, said:</PARA>
<PARA> At the same time, there will be appropriate transitional provisions, so that any unresolved application can be treated as a fresh application under the new procedures, unless the applicant wishes to proceed under the old provisions. </PARA>
<PARA>That certainly appeared, on the face of it, to be a situation of changing the rules once the game got underway. That has been removed. The transitional provisions have been removed from the Bill. Finally, the unrestrained power of persons involved in a takeover situation to interfere in the programming and management of stations in the six months transitional provision allowed in the legislation before the ABT has to come to a final determination has been altered, as I have previously indicated, by the introduction of proposed new section 92M. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, I believe the important thing is to move on to the other question that Senator Chipp raised-the question of foreign ownership. This has always been a difficult and complex part of the legislation. Present sections 90G and 92D present difficulties in interpretation. Those difficulties arise, firstly, because 'resident' is not defined in any way and because there is no cross-reference to a definition in any other Act and, secondly, because there is confusion over the meaning of the word 'controlled'. In those sections 'controlled' could mean the 15 per cent shares and/or votes test currently applied under section 92B or it could mean the 50 per cent vote test used under common law. The first interpretation-that is to say, the 15 per cent of shares and/or votes test-would allow non-residents to own directly 84 per cent of the shares in a licensee provided no individual non-resident or company which non-residents were in a position to control, and they are the words of section 92B, held more than 15 per cent of the shares. </PARA>
<PARA> The second interpretation-the common law interpretation of 50 per cent-would allow, for example, 100 per cent of the shares in the licensee to be held by a company in which 80 per cent or more of the shares were held by non-residents, provided the non-residents held less than 50 per cent of the voting rights in that company. It has to be acknowledged that the existence of those varying interpretations has led to some confusion. In recent years one would suspect that the Tribunal has inclined to the 50 per cent rule. If one looks at decisions regarding Wollongong and TNT's interest in Channel 10 in Melbourne one can see quite clearly that the Tribunal has tended towards that interpretation, in effect the 50 per cent rule. The redrafted sections apply the current interpretation and strengthen it. Apart from whatever consequences may flow from the alteration of the word 'resident' to 'citizen' it is not true to suggest that proposed new sections 90G and 92D allow a larger proportion of the shares in the licensee to be held by persons who are not citizens than was allowed for non-residents previously. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the matter of public interest. I make my own point of view quite clear, as I have throughout this debate. I have not been in favour of making legislative definition of the term 'public interest'. I believe that once one defines terms such as this and Bills of Rights they become limiting. That is why I do not support the general proposition of defining within this piece of legislation or any piece of legislation the term 'public interest'. I want to raise a couple of arguments about the matter which I think needs serious consideration and to which I hope I have given serious consideration. The Administrative Review Council, a body for which I have a great deal of time and respect, looked in some depth at the procedures of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. Recommendation 30, which is to be found on page 21 of its report, reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The Act should be amended to include clear statements of the policy criteria seen by the Government as relevant to the exercise of the Tribunal's import powers. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the point Senator Chipp was making earlier-that it is the responsibility of the Government to define these matters and not the responsibility of the Tribunal. That was clearly stated in a major review of the whole of the procedures of the ABT. It is clear and it is true that the ABT had been developing its own set of guidelines. The first of these, I think, is to be found in the Townsville inquiry of 6 July 1977. The Tribunal, talking about public interest, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The following considerations have therefore been kept in mind:</PARA>
<PARA> the extent of local ownership of broadcasting facilities; the extent of concentration of ownership or control of broadcasting interests in an area, i.e., cross-ownership of radio and television interests;</PARA>
<PARA> the extent of concentration of ownership or control of mass media generally;</PARA>
<PARA> public accountability and public access; capital employed;</PARA>
<PARA> program services. </PARA>
<PARA>That is to be found reproduced on 2 August 1977 in the Ballarat inquiry. It is to be found reproduced in February 1978 in the 4IP Ipswich licence transfer inquiry. It is to be found spelt out in even more clear and precise terms in the 2HD Newcastle inquiry. The Tribunal, in rejecting the takeover of 2HD, was concerned that:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the real possibility exists for a degree of control and influence by Broadcast Investments Pty Ltd of stations 2KO, NBN-3 and 2 HD that would, in the Tribunal's view, be contrary to the interests of the Newcastle public as they relate to broadcasting services available to them. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, it reached its primary focus in the decision given in the ATV-10 case. On page 64 of the reasons for judgment the Tribunal stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Tribunal is of the view that the concentration of media interests by the News Group resulting from the common ownership of Sydney and Melbourne, will have an adverse effect on the freedom of choice of the other members of the network, and is not in the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA>I think one thing has to be laid to rest in the public interest debate and that is, the restriction of this in terms of the criteria laid down in the Act to allow the Tribunal to have regard to the concentration of ownership in non-metropolitan areas. I believe the safeguard exists there because the undue concentration of influence on radio and television is only specified as public interest criteria for non-metropolitan areas, as I have said. This is because the Act already applies much stricter limits on ownership in metropolitan areas than in regional areas. For instance the Act provides:</PARA>
<PARA> It is not possible for any individual to hold prescribed interests in more than one . . . radio station in any one State capital city within the overall limit of two television or eight radio stations. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it would not be illegal for one person to control up to two television stations and four radio stations in a regional city such as Newcastle. </PARA>
<PARA>It is desirable that the Tribunal should be able to continue its application of the public interest test to those areas such as Newcastle where the stricter control of ownership in terms of the number of licences that can be owned is far greater than it is in the metropolitan area. This point is made quite clearly in the second reading speech of the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) when he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . honourable members should be aware that the principal Act already applies much stricter limits on ownership in metropolitan areas than in regional areas. </PARA>
<PARA>In discussing public interest matters I come finally to the devil quoting scripture for his own purposes to take cognisance of a speech made by Senator Button to the Australian Communications Law Association which was reported in the Australian Financial Review of 23 March 1981. The Australian Financial Review report states that in Senator Button's address he made some main points. It lists a number of them. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> The main points in his address were that . . . there should be a clearer definition of public interest in the Broadcasting and Television Act. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, Senator Button-I have not seen this refuted or denied-in a speech made to the Australian Communications Law Association said:</PARA>
<PARA> There should be a clearer definition of public interest in the Broadcasting and Television Act. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To that extent Senator Button has got far more of his way than I have. The greatest implication of all of this is clearly what the lack of Tribunal power over the concentration of media in metropolitan areas will mean in terms of government policy on the issue of networking. We are still somewhat in the dark about that. Networking is the inevitable consequence of both technology in terms of the satellite and in terms of cost. It is not a question of whether there should be networking. It is a question of what sort of networking there should be. Time does not permit me this evening to go into the three models which we have available. There is a clear American model of networking, domination of small stations by the largest metropolitan majors, which one would certainly not want to see in Australia under any circumstances. There is the Canadian model of networking which may be a little more acceptable but still has certain problems and there is a British practice of networking which may, in fact, be the general direction in which we should move. Of course, networking is not a new phenomenon. In 1942, in dealing with the matter of radios, the Joint Committee on Wireless Broadcasting presented a report to both Houses of Parliament in which it said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having before us very considerable information as to the position of chain or network broadcasting in the United States of America as disclosed in evidence before the Federal Communications Commission of that country, we feel that, whilst there is nothing inherently wrong with the network system, its future development might well be watched carefully by the proposed Parliamentary Standing Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>I think it is absolutely true to say that networking is a sensitive area in which the Parliament must be involved in the determination of policy guidelines. I will conclude on these two brief observations: I regret that Australian broadcasting law has got itself into the situation in which a person who owns interests in a newspaper can own any interests in any broadcasting licence whatsoever. I think the ideal in this country and, indeed, in any parliamentary democracy, would be for these people who own interests in newspapers to be prohibited by law from owning interests in any other form of mass communications. That is an argument that should have been raised in 1935 when the Lyons Government started to grapple with this problem. It was not dealt with at that stage. There was no chance of its being dealt with at that stage. At this stage unscrambling the omelet appears to be all but impossible. One can look at the second report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Broadcasting in June 1943. It warned quite clearly:</PARA>
<PARA> For the preservation of democratic principles, it is essential that there should be restraint on efforts to obtain an undue measure of control of the air; otherwise those who succeeded in securing it would have an undemocratic advantage in aligning public opinion in directions they favour. This advantage could be used in many subtle ways not discernible to listeners. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1959 the Australian Broadcasting Control Board came back to precisely the same thing. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the legislation is clearly, on the one hand to prevent any trend towards concentration of ownership of stations, and, on the other hand, and as a consequence, to encourage the local ownership of stations. </PARA>
<PARA>One can look at the United Kingdom Royal Commission under Lord Annan on the future of broadcasting to see the same thing. One can look at Professor McGregor's 1977 Royal Commission report on the Press. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> We do not recommend that newspaper holdings in television or radio should be prohibited, but believe that the existing policy of ensuring that no broadcasting company is effectively controlled by a newspaper company should be maintained and strengthened to exclude effective control by newspaper companies in combination. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, I think we ought also to understand what the limitations of broadcasting legislation are. All the legislation in the world cannot ensure that good broadcasting services are provided or can be made available. All of the legislation in the world cannot ensure the sort of quality programming that we want. There is a remarkable book written by Anthony Smith titled The Shadow in the Cave. That is an allusion to one of Plato's dialogues in which Smith says, I think rightly:</PARA>
<PARA> Broadcasting will inevitably remain in the hands of large and powerful bodies who will continue to act as giant impressarios and considerable employers in the future as in the past. Broadcasting, in all its main streams, will stay in the hands of the tiny unelected elite of professionals whose knowledge and understanding of their mass clientele will be the main mesh through which most of the messages have to pass. There is no way of avoiding this. The real question of 'access' therefore resolves itself into one of access to the interest and good judgment of the professionals who mediate the entire process. It is the broadcasters' minds which have to be opened up, their working practices, their own personal outlooks on life. </PARA>
<PARA>Given the fact that the legislation can only achieve so much, given the clear necessity to come to grips with the changes in society, the fact that while he may be dead and largely forgotten, Marshall McLuhan is still a person whose views on the position of broadcasting in the community need to be understood and appreciated, I am prepared to give my support to this legislation. I believe that, as Senator Chipp has said, had the legislation come down based precisely on those immutable principles announced by the Minister on 9 April there would have been great difficulty. People such as Senator Missen and I would certainly not have been able to support a piece of legislation such as that. But as this legislation covers those points which have been raised-the powers of the Tribunal, the new section 92M, the foreign ownership provisions, the need to get our broadcasting legislation back into some shape to meet the technological and social challenges of the future, I am prepared to support it. I hope that it will be passed through the Senate tonight. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Puplick has just put forward what I might call a very faint-hearted defence of the legislation that is before us this evening. Faint-hearted he might indeed be. After all the puffing and blowing and spouting of Liberal philosophy about diversity and choice, about options and opening up the airwaves and, indeed, about opening up broadcasters' minds, he, like his colleagues opposite, has yet again caved into Government pressure. Yet again, he has come in here tonight advocating and demanding that we support legislation which is in its essence anti-Liberal and pro-monopolistic-all the sorts of things about which Senator Puplick has attempted to attract so much kudos to himself.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Puplick did point to some minor provisions of the Bill which are useful and perhaps timely. Of course, the Australian Labor Party is not opposed to every detail of the legislation before us, nor are the Australian Democrats. But it is simply not good enough to deal in this chamber with legislation of enormous consequence in terms of the restructuring of broadcasting in this country, point to a few minor provisions and say: 'They are all right; I have read all about this in the Annan report and in the book by Anthony Smith. There are a few things in this legislation that are all right, therefore it is perfectly all right to support the whole package.' It is not perfectly all right to support the whole package, because the major provisions of this Bill are indefensible. </PARA>
<PARA> The major provisions of this Bill destroy the long-standing consensus on broadcasting policy in this country. That consensus, for all its weaknesses and faults, was that the broadcasting legislation was designed to be anti-monopolistic. It was anti-monopolistic in intention and it was to some extent anti-monopolistic in effect. It was legislation introduced by conservative governments. It was supported by governments of different complexions through the last four decades because it reflected what was a consensus in the community about the way in which broadcasting ought to be organised. That consensus was that the air waves were a public utility, that the use of the air waves was to be licensed, regulated by government in the public interest and, as I have said, be anti-monopolistic. All of these things are to be thrown out by the major provisions before us. It is simply not good enough for Senator Puplick to point to a few minor and peripheral aspects of the Bill to which we, generally speaking, have no objection, and say: 'The Bill is something that people who espouse Liberal philosophy can support'. Indeed, he even suggested that it is something which people who generally are interested in broadcasting can support. It is none of those things. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Puplick boasted that there had been many changes. I say that Senator Puplick should hang his head in shame about the changes and the way in which they were introduced-the last minute ad hoc chaotic process by which they have come before us. We wish to see the Senate as a chamber in which legislation can be changed and improved but the episode in which we are now engaged makes a mockery of the rights and responsibilities of the Senate unless Government senators are prepared to support the amendment moved by Senator Button-that is, to refer the whole matter to a select committee of the Senate. That amendment of course, is supported by the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation, in the form that is before us tonight, really represents the greatest saga of incompetence and of blatant political partisanship that I have seen since I came into this place. It seems to me that perhaps the incompetence of the way in which the responsible Minister handled the legislation is the outstanding, the most notorious feature of the whole exercise. It seems to honourable senators on this side of the chamber that the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) still does not understand the Act which he is now seeking to amend in this place. That is a disgraceful state of affairs, but I am afraid that it is the state of affairs that we are faced with. </PARA>
<PARA> The saga of the drafting of this Bill involved a litany of Government ad hockery in decision and compromise. In trying to be all things to all media moguls, the Government lost any semblance of coherence of consistency. It has come up with a piece of legislation which is as complicated and chaotic as the process which produced it. There have been changes about which Senator Puplick thinks we ought to be pleased but the point that I wish to make is that the changes which are before us mean that the legislation will differ significantly from that foreshadowed by the Minister for Communications, Mr Sinclair, in his speech to the House on 9 April. As if that were not enough, to demonstrate the Government's vacillation and lack of a policy, the Government itself introduced some major amendments to the legislation when it was debated in the House on Friday. For example, in his 9 April statement the Minister said that the legislation would provide for ministerial discretion in prescribing the public interest and that the transitional provisions would allow current inquiries-for example, the Murdoch appeal-to elect to be heard under the new legislation. These two undertakings were dropped in the Bill introduced into the House on 5 June. That Bill was amended after its introduction into the House to provide a grandfather clause protection for the Herald and Weekly Times Ltd. Prior Australian Broadcasting Tribunal approval is now not required for the purchase of shares in any television or broadcasting company except the Herald and Weekly Times. These are the sorts of changes about which Senator Puplick has boasted. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the major effect and the worst effect of this Bill is that a longstanding and bi-partisan policy of avoiding undue concentration of power or control in the media industry has been abandoned. We have to look at the reasons for amending the Broadcasting and Television Act in this way. Obviously, as has been stated very effectively and very conclusively in the debate on this matter in the House of Representatives, the original aim was to get Mr Murdoch off the hook. He failed to get approval for his takeover of Channel 10 in Melbourne. Mr Murdoch was unhappy about that. The Government was prepared to go to inordinate lengths to solve Mr Murdoch's problem. Later, under pressure from other large, influential corporations, Mr Murdoch took second place. The current Bill does as much to satisfy the wishes of the Herald and the Weekly Times group and the Australian Mutual Provident Society as Mr Murdoch, although he does not lose out by any means. He can now sell his interests in ATV 10 to a nominee or Shell company and they buy it back after the Bill is passed and the public interest provisions on which the ABT found against him are no longer available. To furnish proof of the Government's lack of a media policy and its Sale of the Century attitude towards formulating media legislation, Mr Sinclair's fall-back positions on this legislation have come to light. I seek leave to table to telex from Australian Associated Press which gives details of those fall-back positions which were available to Mr Sinclair. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GD5">Senator RYAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. Apparently Mr Sinclair went to the back bench communications committee and the Government party members equipped, as was Mr Fraser at the last Premiers Conference, with fall-back positions. Firstly, he was prepared to leave the Tribunal's broad discretion on public interest as it was, with one exception. It would be written into the Bill that the holding of two metropolitan television licences would not, in itself, be against the public interest. Secondly, Mr Sinclair would have been prepared to retain the prior approval requirements for share transactions. Both are changes which would have improved the Bill and both are changes which, I hope, Government senators will now demand. I believe the information that I just put forward to the Senate puts beyond doubt the fact that the legislation is simply a result of external and internal pressures on the Government. What does the legislation now do? The amendments remove discretion by the Tribunal; they spell out public interest in a way that is exhaustive; they acknowlege the fact that the concentration of ownership and control are important factors to be considered in regional areas but not in metropolitan areas. This piece of double think is a transparent example of trying to pork barrel two conflicting interest groups at once; that is, to keep the regional television lobby happy by protecting it from takeovers by media giants and to keep the major metropolitan conglomerates happy by allowing them scope to expand in the very profitable metropolitan areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As far as institutional investors are concerned, the increased limit on shareholdings from 5 per cent to 10 per cent is designed specifically to counter the problems experienced by the AMP Society. Then there is the provision for the criterion for foreign ownership to be Australian citizenship rather than residence. My colleague, Senator Button, has said a great deal about this but I point out again that this is of direct benefit to Mr Murdoch who was accused at the ATV 10 hearing of not complying with the residency criteria. It seems to us that this provision is inconsistent with the provisions of the Foreign Takeovers Act. In any case, as has been pointed out by Labor Party spokespeople, this certainly reduces the Australian control of what is happening to our media industry because there are various ways in which citizenship but not residence will be used to increase foreign control of our media operations. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course controls on foreign ownership are loosened. By loosening the tracing provisions of the foreign ownership clause and allowing 50 per cent foreign ownership in parent companies, the Bill puts, for example, Sir Peter Abeles's Thomas Nationwide Transport group out of danger. There is now no prior Tribunal approval required for takeovers except, as I said, for the Herald and Weekly Times group which are covered by a grandfather clause. All of these moves are against the most fundamental principles on which a democratic media policy ought to be based and indeed on which the Labor Party bases our media policy. </PARA>
<PARA> I will go over some of these principles because it seems to me that the debate can very easily degenerate into arguments about particular points whereas, in fact, the principle of how broadcasting is organised and controlled in a democratic society is the central issue that we ought to be addressing in the second reading debate. The principles that we espouse are these. The boardcasting system belongs to the Australian people-not to any sectional interests-and should be used only under licence and in the public interest. The monopoly ownership of mass communications resources is inconsistent with the aims of freedom and diversity in the communications system. I do not think that any Liberal in this place tonight could argue against that principle, although clearly honourable senators opposite are prepared to support legislation which violates it. </PARA>
<PARA> Another important principle is that the aims of freedom and diversity must be accompanied by the fostering of an independent, national identity and culture, something which will not be assisted by allowing increased foreign control of Australia's media. I believe that the question of an Australian identity in our media is one that is becoming increasingly of concern to the Australian people. I believe that Australian people are sick and tired of seeking Australian resources-be they mineral resources, media resources or the film industry-sold out to foreign interests. We are sick of being tacked on first of all to the British Empire and then to the empire of the United Statles of America. It is not the desire of the Australian people to form simply a small part of the multinational English speaking market in any area of activity and certinly not in the area of broadcasting. The actions of the Government in this legisliation make it increasingly possible that this will ultimately become the case. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party believes that it is the responsibility of the Australian Parliament to determine and provide guidelines for the maintenance and development of a communications system in the interests of a community as a whole. Of course, in the way that the legislation is being formulated and presented, the Parliament is not being permitted to do this. The Fraser Government has failed to develop a media policy which is in the interests of the community as a whole. In fact, as demonstrated by this mish mash piece of legislation, it has failed to develop any consistent media policy. This Government's method of developing broadcasting legislation has been to barter favours with the media corporations and some lobby groups until it has come up with something which pleases the most influential of these groups and does not make the others too unhappy. The people not consulted in this exercise are, of course, the general public, the media audience, the product sold by the media proprietors to their advertisers. </PARA>
<PARA> Where the Government failed to develop a media policy, the Australian Labor Party took action through the only means available to it-the Broadcasting Tribunal and the courts. The Tribunal found in favour of the arguments put forward by the Labor Party and acted in the public interest to stop the takeover of ATV 10. But this amendment is designed to prevent any recurrence of such action. The Tribunal will now be compelled to consider, in isolation, the restricted question of whether each applicant, taken out of context, is a fit and proper person to hold a licence. In this morning's Australian Financial Review, Mark Armstrong, senior lecturer in Law at the University of New South Wales and one time Department of Post and Telecommunications legal expert, points out:</PARA>
<PARA> Many of the other revolutionary changes in the Bill have their seeds in the unsuccessful arguments of the News counsel in the inquiries and litigation about the 0-10 network takeovers. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Armstrong continues:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it will be difficult to refuse to allow any group from taking control of one Television station in each of Sydney and Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA> Once a group controls Sydney and Melbourne, it is in the cockpit of a national network. And that offers a dominanant satellite position, even apart from the prospects for video tex services and cable-perhaps even a large piece of a dismembered Telecom. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Armstrong goes on to conclude:</PARA>
<PARA> It has always been said that the purpose of the ownership and control laws is to encourage the maximum number of locally based competitive groups in an industry unique for its effect on freedom of speech. That purpose is obviously less likely to survive under the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>At this stage I can only endorse the remarks of Mr Armstrong. In this Senate, on previous occasions, we have had very informed debates about broadcasting matters. We have seen government senators take principled stands on broadcasting questions. I hope that it is not too late to see such a thing again. After all, by moving an amendment that the whole matter be referred to a Senate select committee, we are only seeking to do what many Government senators have said is the proper role of the Senate, and that is scrutinise and examine thoroughly controversial legislation. If ever there has been controversial legislation in this Parliament it is the broadcasting and television amendments we are concerned with tonight. They have been extraordinarily controversial, and properly so, since they affect every citizen of this country and, as I think Senator Puplick pointed out, they affect them in a way that determines the political, social and economic structure of this country. This is extraordinarily important legislation. It is clear that the legislation has been prepared in a fragmentary, incoherent and chaotic way. In the interests of the Australian public, in the interests of trying to attain a democratic, properly structured broadcasting policy, I urge Government senators to do the sensible and rational thing tonight, that is, support the amendment moved by Senator Button, which seeks to refer the whole of the matter to a Senate select committee for further investigation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to refer to a question that I asked Senator Baume, the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, on 29 May 1981. I regard the failure of the Government to respond adequately to that question as an indication of its total disregard for the attitudes of the people of Australia as expressed through that question. I asked:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Does the Minister representing the Minister for Communications agree that the observance of common standards of decency and good taste by broadcasting and television stations, including the Australian Broadcasting Commission, is the matter of most concern to the listening and viewing public? Is the Minister aware that virtually no monitoring of television programs is now taking place and that in the last three years no enforcement directives have been made under section 99 of the Broadcasting and Television Act as to program standards? Why has the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal cut by 86 per cent its program of research to ascertain what the public expects from television and broadcasting? In view of these facts and the Government's intention to axe the Broadcasting Information Office, will the Government give a firm assurance that by legislative and administrative action it will ensure that appropriate broadcasting and television standards are maintained and enforced, which it will need to do if it expects public respect for its forthcoming legislation?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Baume answered as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that all honourable senators would agree with Senator Harradine that the observance of common standards of decency, and proper standards on electronic media, are important in any country. They are important in Australia. Whether or not they are the matter of most concern in Australia, as the honourable senator suggested-</PARA>
<PARA>I did not suggest that-</PARA>
<PARA>is unimportant. The fact is that they are matters of concern and importance. I have no difficulty at all in endorsing his view to that extent. I am unable to give the honourable senator specific information in relation to his question as to whether there has been little or no enforcement-as he set out-and whether a particular budget has been cut. I am unable to tell him but I will try to obtain these facts for him. I see benefits flowing to the Australian public from the maintenance of a system of broadcasting and television viewing which endorses and sets out standards, particularly for those in their formative years who are impressionable. I recall that a question was asked yesterday, I think concerning the Broadcasting Information Office, and I gave some information. It is not that that office has been abolished, but simply that we have not proceeded to establish it. This was one of the decisions of the Review of Commonwealth Functions. In relation to the other question the honourable senator asked about what we intend to do to ensure that adequate standards are maintained, I will refer that to my colleague and try to obtain extra information for Senator Harradine. </PARA>
<PARA>It was made perfectly clear, both publicly and privately, to the Government that my attitude to this piece of legislation would be formed having regard to information to be supplied to me by the Government as to its intention to ensure excellence and proper standards on the electronic media throughout Australia. That information has not been supplied to me. I have been totally ignored in respect of this matter. It has been virtually impossible for me and probably other honourable senators to catch up with the welter of amendments that have come through on this piece of legislation. Even tonight I received on my desk a page that deals with the leaving out of clauses. I and many other people in Australia--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Chipp" NAMEID="3V4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3V4">Senator Chipp</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;From the Government?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, from the Government, precisely. I am concerned and many other people in Australia are concerned not so much as to who controls the media but what types of programs come across, the excellence of those programs and whether they meet standards of common decency and good taste. The situation in Australia is that in fact section 99 of the Broadcasting and Television Act provides the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal with clear powers to set and enforce program standards in commercial television. The same Act gives the Minister for Communications powers of censorship independent of that Tribunal. The Green report in 1976 recommended that complaints from the public should be handled by industry associations and that regular monitoring of programs should cease. But a second report in 1977 recommended that a Broadcasting Information Office should be established which would, amongst other things, register complaints from the public. A director of the Broadcasting Information Office was in fact appointed in 1980 but the Office has never reached operational status.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the pre-tribunal days, as honourable senators will recall, the Australian Broadcasting Control Board maintained a staff in its State offices sufficient to enable it to carry out full time monitoring of all programs broadcast on radio and television. By 1979-80 the Board had reached a stage of decline where no items under the heading 'Televising of Objectionable Matter' were included in its annual report. No directives were issued to stations under section 99 of the Act. Its successor-the Tribunal-does not engage in full time monitoring of programs but 'spot monitoring' is carried out in selected areas. The spot monitoring is determined by complaints from the public. For a time the Tribunal did carry on the functions of the Board and the Board's research into what the public wanted in broadcasting and television. However, as a result of the 1980-81 Budget, the Tribunal was obliged to cut is research budget by 86 per cent, and that was one of the points I raised in my question which has not been properly and adequately answered. Meanwhile, the Broadcasting Information Office, which was to assume the role of receiving, registering and investigating complaints from the public, is due for the chop; it has not got off the ground. </PARA>
<PARA> So we have a situation in which virtually no monitoring at all is done of the excellence of programs or their standards of decency or good taste. That is the matter of greatest issue and greatest concern to the viewing and listening public of Australia. Yet we have a situation whereby a question was asked by me on this matter in which the Government was given an indication very clearly as to what my attitude on the matter would be and I am totally ignored on this particular point. I believe that I have the right to express the viewpoint of the electors of my State to the Government by way of questions. The Government can be cavalier to me as much as it likes but it does not have the right to be cavalier towards the bulk of the Australian public who regard this issue as one of the most important issues so far as broadcasting and television is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> This issue does not go only to the question of commercial television and broadcasting stations; it also goes to the Australian Broadcasting Commission as well. What is the Government doing about the question of excellence and standards of decency and good taste in the ABC? Only recently an elector, quite an intelligent level-headed sort of a bloke, came to my office and said that while he and his family were viewing, I think the seven o'clock news on the ABC, without any warning whatsoever on to the television screen came the sight of a soldier in Northern Ireland being incinerated and the sounds of his anguished cries for help and pity. Let us compare that with the same ABC news service approximately three months beforehand which showed sheep, which had been burnt in a bushfire in, I think, Western Australia, being shot. Before that particular clip a warning was given. I wonder whether the ABC has more respect for the life of a sheep than it does for the life of a human being. That possibly is all right; it was an isolated instance. But I believe I have a responsibility and a duty to express the feeling which is widespread throughout the community that it wants something done about the monitoring of standards of excellence and standards of decency and good taste in regard to television and broadcasting in Australia. It is not being done. </PARA>
<PARA> Unlike other changes by this Government which are often accompanied by a fanfare of publicity, I believe that successive governments have deliberately allowed the question of the monitoring of television standards to be pushed into the background. I guarantee that before a number of people hear what I have to say and before a number of people wake up to what is happening and how this matter is being pushed into the background, they were not aware for about the last five years that they themselves, namely, the public of Australia, have had to shoulder the responsibility of monitoring television and broadcasting programs. They are not, of course, equipped to do that. Unless viewers complain, it is automatically assumed that everything is unobjectionable. Is that a proper way in which to maintain standards of broadcasting and television in this country? It certainly is not good enough. If the Government wants the public to support this Broadcasting and Television Amendment Bill, it should earn that support by demonstrating a genuine concern about program standards. If it wants my support on the legislation it ought to start by answering the questions I have put down in this Senate on this important aspect. Until such time as it does so, it cannot have my support on this particular legislation. I will support the Opposition's amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The debate on these proposed amendments has ranged over the major issues. The basis of this proposal goes back to a statement which the Minister for Communications, Mr Sinclair, made soon after his appointment to the portfolio of communications. I think it was early in December last year when the Government proposed to have an inquiry into the way in which the Broadcasting and Television Act was operating in certain respects. It called for submissions and many were received and considered and over a period of months of this year until the introduction of this Bill, there was a great deal of consideration of the views which were put to the Government. There was consultation with interested parties and a statement was made by the Minister on 9 April as to what the Government's views then were as to the proposals it had in mind, the comments it had received and the decisions which had been made. Again, since April there has been a great number of further submissions and a great deal of further consideration. The final result of that was that legislation was introduced last week. I appreciate that this is a complicated area. The Act itself is very complicated and the amendments to it naturally appear to be complicated. In fairness to honourable senators I say that the amendments are complicated. Nevertheless, the issues which are presented by this Bill appear to be clearly understood by those honourable senators who have taken part in this debate. I am not aware of there being any issues that have been overlooked. Generally speaking, I think that the matters that are before the Senate and on which we have to vote have been clearly drawn out. They are matters of controversy on which the Opposition has taken, as it may be expected to take, a different view from that of the Governmet. But certainly it does not appear to me that there is any need for further delay to enable those issues to be more clearly identified and for decisions to be made about them.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Chipp is saying that public interest ought to have some definition. The definition given may involve an area of controversy. The Government has included its views as to what the public interest should contain. The concept of giving definition to public interest is one of the major areas of controversy between the Government and the Opposition. The Opposition has taken the view, as I understand it, that there should not be that definition, but that--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It may be only an issue of a different definition. I understand the Opposition to have the view that the public interest would be better left in broad terms.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The purpose of this legislation is to deal with a number of difficulties which the Government has identified in the operation of the existing legislation. The Opposition has endeavoured in this debate to make a case that the Government was somehow overturning its own policies on broadcasting and television and the basic provisions of the existing legislation. That is not the case at all. The Government has brought forward proposals to deal, as I have said, with the definition of public interest which has not been defined. We believe it ought to be defined. As I said, I am glad that apparently the Opposition, as well as Senator Chipp, now agree with that even though there naturally may be differences about the extent of the definition of public interest. The Government found difficulties in some respects with the provisions of the Act dealing with the obtaining of approval by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal to transactions in purchasing interests and has come up with what I believe are much clearer provisions in that regard. At the same time, it is protecting the licences if there are major changes in ownership as a result of transactions in the stock market. It has also identified the anomalies that occurred with what we might call the Australian Mutual Provident Society situation. It has dealt with proposals for ownership by registered investors of up to 10 per cent of companies which have licences. </PARA>
<PARA> Difficulties also arose in the interpretation of the existing foreign ownership provisions. The Opposition, quite wrongly, has made great play of this circumstance. The legislation is giving effect only to what has been adopted by the Tribunal as its understanding of these provisions. There may be some controversy about what they are, but in fact the provisions of the Bill dealing with foreign ownership are giving effect only to what, as I have said, has been the position taken by the Tribunal on these matters. We believe that the changes proposed in this legislation are important but are not of the far-reaching and revolutionary kind which the Opposition would have us believe. As I have said, issues have been clearly identified in this debate and the Government believes therefore that the Senate should proceed to deal with this legislation and to give a decision on it. I hope it will give it a speedy passage. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been, of course, other representations. There may be many other desirable changes in relation to this legislation which ought to be considered for the future. One such representation has been made recently by the Federation of Australian Commerical Television Stations in relation to undertakings which are required to be given by a licensee in regard to the performance of those undertakings at a renewal hearing. The Government believes that questions of this kind are ones that should be considered in the light of consideration of the report it has received from the Administrative Review Council in regard to the procedures of the Broadcasting Tribunal. Those are further decisions which will need to be made and given effect to at a future date. At this stage, without ruling out any other questions of amendment to this important Act in the immediate future, we believe that the changes now proposed are ones which are called for. They clarify matters, many of which are now in doubt. We believe they will improve the workings of this Act. We believe and hope that the Senate will support them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The interjection might be right but I am reminded of the Duke of Wellington's comments about his troops when they marched into the battle of Waterloo. The purpose of these amendments is to ensure that the public interest criteria laid down in the Bill are not exhaustive. There has been a long period of public and quasi-public debate as to whether there should be an attempt in the legislation to define the public interest. In this legislation the Government has put forward a definition of public interest which in our view is an extremely narrow one. The first limb of that definition is whether an applicant or person seeking control of the television licence or seeking renewal of it is a fit and proper person to hold such a licence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It might be appropriate when mentioning that criterion in relation to this matter to refer the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) to clause 38 on page 41 of the Bill. The clause is headed 'Approval of transactions'. As a matter of interest I as the Minister-this is a matter about which he might wish to receive some instructions-whether clause 92FAA as included means, as I would argue that it means, that in the future in determining whether a person is a fit and proper person the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal will not be able to go behind the applicant; that is to say, it will have to look at the application company to determine whether it is fit and proper and it will not be able to go behind the corporate veil, to use Lord Denning's expression. That is an expression taken up by the High Court in Hardiman's case in which it was laid down that it was the duty of the Tribunal to look behind the actual applicant to see who was behind it. In this case the question involves the term 'fit and proper person'. </PARA>
<PARA>I raise this matter, of course, at this stage because it is quite fundamental to the first criterion of public interest. To put it simply, I think it means that a company which has, if I may use a non-company law expression, a cleanskin character about it, can apply for a licence or, in particular, apply for a transfer of a licence. The Tribunal will be entitled to look at whether that company is a fit and proper person in law. It will not be able to look at who is behind the application. If that view is correct, in a sense, it is the most radical departure from the traditional view of the Broadcasting and Television Act, with its tracing provisions. It is concerned to see exactly what is in fact happening in the transaction and not what merely appears to be happening on the surface. I draw the attention of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) to the Hardiman case and to the following passage in the High Court judgment:</PARA>
<PARA> To discharge its duty the Tribunal must in an appropriate case investigate for itself the possibility of contravention, even in circumstances where there is no party before the Tribunal willing, anxious or able to pursue the issue. </PARA>
<PARA>That appears at page 321 of the judgment. The headnote of another part of the judgment of the High Court states:</PARA>
<PARA> Although under sub-s. (4A) of s. 92 of the Tribunal was bound not to refuse to grant approval in certain circumstances, the boundaries of the Tribunal's inquiry were not necessarily to be governed or circumscribed by such circumstances, while in any event the language of sub-s. (4A) with its reference, inter alia, to 'public interest', showed that a contravention of s. 92 (1) (a) on the part of a person other than the applicant might have an obvious relevance to the maintenance of such indirect ownership and control of the company holding the licence as would best accord with the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that the appropriate clause of the Bill is, in effect, fundamental to the fit and proper person criterion referred to in amendments Nos 1 to 4 moved by the Opposition. The other purpose of the Opposition's amendments Nos 1 to 4 is, first of all, to say that the public interest criteria should not be exhaustive, that there should be a general discretion in a body such as the Tribunal to deal with matters not prescribed in the narrow definition of public interest as it appears. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the Committee's attention to the fact that the Government's amendments introduced on Friday-the Herald and the Weekly Times Ltd clause as I called it-ensure that the criteria in this Bill are quite exclusive and puts it beyond doubt. In other amendments introduced on Friday in the House of Representatives there were drafting errors in the six definitions of public interest. In all those clauses now it has made it quite clear, by insertion of the word 'only' in every one of them, that they are the only circumstances to be taken into account by the Tribunal. The other thing which the amendments do is to insert into the public interest criteria, criteria regarding the concentration of ownership which, in our view, ought to exist in any democratic country. It has been a matter of great concern by Liberal statesmen from Postmaster-General Davidson when television was first introduced in this country in 1956 right down to Minister Staley in 1979-80 that the question of concentration of ownership should be considered. We want to insert in the definition the criteria laid down in the case law by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal in the Townsville case, the 2HD case and, to a lesser extent, to the Hardiman case. I make the point that the wording of the proposed amendment is taken directly from the first hearing of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal in the Townsville inquiry. We also seek to include the same criteria in relation to regional public interest, and there the wording is based on the 2HD case. That is the purpose of the amendments. We draw them to the attention of the Committee in some detail on this occasion, but at a later stage we can perhaps handle the matter in another way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The public interest issue is perhaps the central one in this whole debate. It is for that reason that I do propose to spend some little time in discussing the arguments. For those who might be minded to be a little intolerant about this, given the lateness of the hour, might I simply remind them and the Committee that I did not trespass on anyone's patience at all during the second reading debate and I do not propose to do so again during the Committee debate. I do believe the public interest issue needs a lengthier canvassing than it has been able to get so far in either house of this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me begin by saying that of all the things that are wrong with the Broadcasting and Television Amendment Bill-there are many, including its allowing of unconditional takeovers without prior approval and with later approvals by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal which is necessarily reduced to an empty cypher; its making of citizenship rather than residence the test of local control to bail out, as has been said, Rupert Murdoch; its opening of the door to foreign control by stipulating 50 per cent rather than 15 per cent as the cut-off point when overseas capital is involved; its failure entirely to tackle the issues of share warehousing and discretionary trusts and the other kinds of familiar devices which, as Mark Armstrong said in the Australian Financial Review this morning and which has already been cited, would give a gorilla of average intelligence a fair chance of circumventing the Act; its effective removal of the constraints governing network arrangements which have, of course, concerned the Tribunal in the past, especially in the Murdoch-Channel ATV 10 case; the encouragement it gives in various ways to the creation of three monolithic Sydney-Melbourne based television networks; the cosy arrangements it creates for the granting and renewal of supplementary radio licences and the tortuous, appalling incomprehensibility of its drafting, which is bad enough in any Bill but quite indefensible in a Bill supposedly meant to be used in the public interest by individuals and community groups-undoubtedly the worst single aspect of it, symbolising and summarising in itself just everything that is wrong with it, is its treatment of the public interest question. </PARA>
<PARA> The present Act is certainly somewhat less than satisfactory in its explicit treatment of this issue. One of the objects of the Opposition's amendments is to remedy that situation in the present Act. The expression 'public interest' does not explicitly appear at all in the provisions governing licence grants. When it does appear in other contexts-for example, in the share transfer provisions which are contained in section 92F (4) (a)-then it is hedged about in various ways. Nonetheless, the High Court of Australia made it perfectly clear, in the 2HD case in 1979 and again, although less directly, in the Hardiman case in 1980 arising out of the ATV 10 hearings that the concept of public interest is a relevant factor in the exercise of discretionary powers by the Tribunal even if it is not explicitly so stated in legislation. As has been said, the Tribunal, since the Ballarat and Townsville inquiries back in 1977-there are a number of subsequent cases-has been evolving its own detailed criteria to give force, effect and application to the notion of public interest in the broadcasting context. In relation to the Ballarat case, at page 5 the Tribunal said, as has been repeated on a number of subsequent occasions:</PARA>
<PARA> The following considerations have been kept in mind in relation to public interest criteria:</PARA>
<PARA> The extent of local ownership of broadcasting facilities;</PARA>
<PARA> the extent of concentration of ownership or control of broadcasting interests in an area, i.e. cross ownership of radio and television interests;</PARA>
<PARA> the extent of concentration of ownership or control of mass media generally;</PARA>
<PARA> public accountability; public access; program services. </PARA>
<PARA>Those, of course, as Senator Button has said, are the propositions which it is now sought to incorporate specifically in the language of the Act. It has to be appreciated that it was no mere paper tiger which was thus developed and articulated by the Tribunal in those earlier cases because concentration considerations, which were held to be wrapped up in the public interest criteria thus articulated, were, of course, crucial in the 2HD case when the High Court upheld the Tribunal's finding that the Act, although it set a maximum of stations, nonetheless could be construed as allowing and, indeed, requiring the Tribunal to take into account concentrations within that particular ceiling if there were special features about the local circumstances which rendered that concentration contrary to the public interest. Now in this Bill, of course, as it has been brought forward by the Government, we find that not only is there no general or residual public interest criterion expressly provided for but also most of the criteria which have already been laid down by the Tribunal in its evolving jurisprudence have been expressly excluded. There are a number of criteria which are explicitly contained in the Bill and which recur, with minor variations depending on the context, in the provisions governing grants, renewals, suspensions and revocations, transfers and share approvals. But in each case when that list of criteria recurs, as has been pointed out, it is preceded by the word 'only', making it perfectly clear that the Tribunal cannot go beyond the expressly laid out criteria. The criteria in question have been conveniently summarised in the explanatory memorandum as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>compliance with the conditions of a licence;</PARA>
<PARA>whether the applicant will provide an adequate and comprehensive service in pursuance of the licence, having regard to:</PARA>
<PARA> the nature of the community to be served;</PARA>
<PARA> the diversity of the interests of that community; and</PARA>
<PARA> the nature of other radio/television services in the area;</PARA>
<PARA>whether the applicant will encourage the provision of Australian produced programs and the use of Australian creative resources;</PARA>
<PARA>whether a person or company is fit and proper to hold an interest in a licence;</PARA>
<PARA>the financial, technical and management capabilities to undertake the operations of a licence;</PARA>
<PARA>in non-metropolitan areas (i.e. outside the six State capitals) the degree of concentration of influence of-</PARA>
<PARA>It is not clear whether the right word is 'of' or 'on', and that is one of the numerous drafting difficulties we have with this Bill--</PARA>
<PARA>radio or television stations; and</PARA>
<PARA>commercial viability of stations in the area;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought I had made reference to that criterion of whether the applicant will encourage the provision of Australian produced programs and the use of Australian creative resources. If I left that out of the litany, I apologise for doing so. I had no intention other than to set out the provisions which are in the Bill because the point I want to make is that when one lays out the provisions in that way there are some conspicuous omissions. The most conspicuous omissions from the list are those very criteria which have been articulated by the Tribunal in those earlier Ballarat, Townsville and subsequent cases and which are contained in the various provisions throughout the Opposition's amendments which we seek to write into the legislation, namely, the criteria of the extent of local ownership of broadcasting facilities, the extent of cross-ownership of radio and television interests, the extent of concentration of ownership or control of mass media generally and public accountability and access. Those are the specific matters which have been identified by a number of tribunals in the past as being implicit in the loose public interest language of the Act, as it stands at the moment. But they are criteria which not only are not expressly included in the Government's Bill but which also are expressly excluded from the Tribunal's consideration. I note that there is an explicit provision-for example, the proposed new section 83 (6) (c) (ii) (B) with respect to non-metropolitan commercial licences, which does refer to:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . the need to avoid undue concentration of influence, whether direct or indirect, on the person--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the person applying-</PARA>
<PARA>and on the company or companies holding the other licence or licences;</PARA>
<PARA>There are a couple of points to be made about that. The first is that it is, again, rather extraordinarily impenetrable language which does not make it all clear whether cross-ownership of media interests generally is meant to be subsumed or whether it is just the influence exercised by the holding of radio and television licences alone that is contemplated. There is also a linguistic problem about the word 'on' as distinct from the word 'of' which appears in the explanatory memorandum. That just serves to throw the whole meaning of this clause into something close to total confusion. The other point about this clause is the obvious one that, even if it does have some coherent meaning as a vehicle for knocking out, in the public interest, concentrations in the non-metropolitan area, it has no application in the metropolitan area. Senator Puplick made the obvious point that the ceilings are lower to start with in the metropolitan area, but that does not answer the basic contention of the Opposition that just because a maximum is prescribed for particular ownership interests that should not be regarded as amounting to the norm and that there ought to be room for manoeuvre in determining whether concentrations falling short of the maximum are nonetheless against the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA> This late in the day, knowing what we do about the existing pattern of concentration of ownership and the likely future developments in this respect, it might be thought that it is hardly necessary to argue why it is that public interest questions are involved here. For the Government to bring forward this Bill in the way it has, with the criteria that are now built into it, and for Government senators to accept the Bill in this form, seems to indicate that it is necessary to restate briefly, because of time constraints, some of the basic arguments that underlie our concern with there being a viable public interest criterion. I think we need to re-examine why it is that, as Senator Ryan has said, there has been a consensus for so many years about the necessity for anti-monopolistic, anti-concentration public interest provisions in this legislation. We need to examine why it is that that consensus is breaking down and more particularly why it ought to be recreated. </PARA>
<PARA> The background against which this consideration is made ought to be well enough known; namely, that three basic commercial enterprises-the Herald and Weekly Times Ltd, the Murdoch organisation and the Packer organisation-will have, if the present application succeeds, wrapped up the Sydney and Melbourne television accesses between them. In conjunction with the Fairfax organisation, these four media organisations have just about sewn up the electronic media in every major city in the country. At the same time, these are the organisations which exercise the dominant role in the print media-the Herald and Weekly Times having 52 per cent of circulation, News Ltd, which is the Murdoch group, 24.7 per cent, and the Fairfax group 22.6 per cent. Together with Consolidated Press Holdings Ltd, the Packer organisation, these are the same interests which control radio and television stations as well as magazines and suburban papers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am indebted to Senator Chipp for concentrating my mind on one of the key issues which I think the Senate needs to resolve in this respect. I think that, while there is a case for actually incorporating in Hansard an up to date table as to who owns what in terms of the major print media organisations, one matter to which I can refer Senator Chipp and the Senate, although it is now three or four years out of date, is the table about the electronic media ownership interests of the Herald and Weekly Times Ltd, John Fairfax Ltd, News Ltd and Australian Consolidated Press Ltd that appears in Trevor Barr's book entitled Reflections of Reality: the Media in Australia which is one of the more convenient and useful texts to emerge in recent years about the media in Australia. It is from that book that I want to read further now, incidentally, because I think it quite neatly and succinctly sets out what really are the two basic arguments about excessive concentration of media ownership generally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The arguments can be very succinctly stated. It is just a pity that they need to be restated because they seem to have been forgotten by the Government and Government senators. Really the arguments are of two kinds. In the first place there is the matter of power and accountability. Barr states:</PARA>
<PARA> Control of the media in the hands of a few groups is undesirable and potentially dangerous. If we assume that the media is influential in shaping our attitudes, then those who own the communication channels possess great potential power to influence the public in ways they choose. They can and do strongly support or oppose governments and political parties. The press is less accountable than most other institutions in our society. Unlike political leaders those who own the press are not, and never have been elected. </PARA>
<PARA>That passage states obvious truths but states them, I think, succinctly. The other point that is made-and it is a distinct argument which ought not to be confused with that first argument about power and accountability-is in terms of diversity of views. Barr states the argument in a short passage which reads:</PARA>
<PARA> It is a democratic right for individuals to receive a free flow of information. Monopoly controls reduce variety; the more forms of ownership the greater the chances are of receiving diverse views, opinions, attitudes on a wide range of subjects. The possibility for suppressing particular views is greatest when there are only a few owners. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe those propositions are self-evident and would be accepted by honourable senators opposite. I just wish they would accept the implications of those sorts of arguments in the context of this Bill. What all these arguments involve in one way or another is this central core notion of the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA> I think one of the best short statements linking those sorts of arguments with the focal point with which we are concerned now is a letter to the Press-in this case, the Melbourne Age-on Wednesday, 22 April from Professor Julius Stone of the Faculty of Law of the University of New South Wales who is, of course, one of Australia's most internationally distinguished jurists. In the interests of brevity and given the lateness of the hour, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard that letter. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>'PUBLIC INTEREST' DEMANDS STRONGER POWERS FOR BROADCASTING TRIBUNAL</PARA>
<PARA>from Professor J. Stone, Faculty of Law, University of New South Wales</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The notion that monopolistic or oligopolistic control of the media in Australia (especially the electronic media) does not involve 'the public interest' is a startling one. </PARA>
<PARA> In democratic politics which seek to hold power responsive to the citizenry, the claims of free belief, opinion, expression and access to the means of expression, approach nearer to absolutes than perhaps any other. </PARA>
<PARA> The goals of such a society involve providing for the maximum satisfaction of human demands. These goals are frustrated not only by direct physical suppression of belief and opinion, but by arbitrary control by a few individuals of access to the means of expression. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that radio and television, no less than the Press, require capital commitments of a scale which tends to concentrate more and more power in a few hands, makes this truth more urgent. </PARA>
<PARA> To bar the Broadcasting Tribunal from considering such concentration of power in determining 'the public interest' for metropolitan radio and television is, therefore, to trivialise both the tribunal and whatever we mean by 'the public interest'. How can it not concern ''the public interest'' how few people are in key positions for influencing the opinions and beliefs of the community and for controlling their expressions and access to them?</PARA>
<PARA> It is no comfort to be told that matters of concentration of media control will henceforth be left to Ministerial guidelines, or even to the Parliament. The threat to democracy comes from concentration in few hands, whether these hands be 'private' or 'public'. </PARA>
<PARA> The manipulation of citizen opinion through the media to support political power is as repugnant to our political institutions as is its manipulation by private monopoly or oligopoly. </PARA>
<PARA> Both are forbidden by 'the public interest'. Whatever the scope of this slippery notion, it must include the best adjustment available when all competing demands are brought to conscientious judgment by impartial communtiy authority. If, as many believe, there are deficiencies in the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, the remedies lie rather in strengthening than in emasculating its authority and its capacities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Labor Party's amendments with respect to the public interest issues have been moved firstly in the context of the grant of licence, but exactly the same amendments are proposed for all those relevant later parts of the Bill which deal with revocation of licences and approval of share transactions and so on. The principles are the same, but in each case the amendments try to do two quite different things. It seems that the Attorney-General (Senator Durack), who is in charge of this Bill, quite failed to appreciate what we are on about in this respect. In the first place we are seeking by these amendments to articulate as clearly as possible some of the specific additional public interest criteria which have already been developed and applied by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, and which are now being abandoned. The first part of our amendment seeks simply to add to the list of specific considerations which the Tribunal should be obliged to have regard to and to take into account.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other aspect of the amendment is to open out the different public interest criterion by allowing the Tribunal to have regard not 'only' to the matters which are specifically set out but also 'to any other matter and circumstance which it considers appropriate'. What, in effect, the amendment is trying to do-I think the Attorney and Senator Puplick both tended to confuse the issue in the way they approached what they assumed would be the Labor Party amendments in the earlier stages of the debate-is basically to create a general public interest criterion which the Tribunal can apply and have regard to in matters or circumstances which it regards as going to the question of public interest. In particular, it should be obliged to have regard to a whole series of specific matters. Many of them are set out in the Government's amendment. We do not contest them in any way, but we think a number of other more specific criteria of this kind ought to be added and directly drawn to the Tribunal's attention rather than being left to chance. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the general part of what we are about-the opening out of the public interest criteria, giving the Tribunal a general residual discretion-this is the last matter I want to advert to-there has been a reluctance in a number of quarters to concede the appropriateness of courts or quasi-judicial tribunals being given open ended public interest criteria of this kind. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me quickly try to deal with the justification-this will be my final comment-for having an open ended public interest criterion, rather than trying to go all the way down the line and articulate every conceivable ground of public interest that might come into play. There is a very substantial body of thought and argument supporting the view that rather than leaving any open ended discretion we ought to have an extended list, that the Parliament ought to get it right and that responsibility ought to be the Parliament's, not the court's or that of any other quasi-judicial tribunal. Let me say to Senator Chipp and others who share that view that this is something with which I have wrestled, not so much in this context but in the context of the freedom of information legislation where it was a very live issue as to whether there should be a general public criterion governing the release of documents or whether there should be explicit criteria articulating what in essence the public interest considerations are.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the way I personally resolved this dilemma and the way the bipartisan Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs resolved it in the context of freedom of information might help resolve it for Senator Chipp and others. I refer him to that part of the Committee's report on freedom of information-pages 64 to 67-which deals with the question of public interest criteria. In particular I refer to paragraphs 5.25 and 5.29 which make the points most specifically of all. I will read quickly the relevant sections into the record to make it clear. The reference follows a discussion of the Sankey and Whitlam case in 1978 which had extensive regard to the public interest criteria. The discussion in Sankey and Whitlam and the conclusions drawn from it as to the utility of public interest considerations are in my mind, much reinforced by the decision of Mr Justice Mason in the defence papers case involving the Commonwealth and Fairfax at the end of last year which, again, was an admirable demonstration of the way in which courts and tribunals of this kind can effectively and sensibly use open ended public interest criteria. I will quote a couple of sentences from paragraphs 5.25 and 5.29 of the report. Paragraph 5.25 states:</PARA>
<PARA> To our mind, this analysis by the court--</PARA>
<PARA>This relates to the Sankey case-</PARA>
<PARA>indicates that 'public interest' is a convenient and useful concept for aggregating any number of interests that may bear upon a disputed question that is of general-as opposed to merely private-concern. Although in that case--</PARA>
<PARA>Again the report refers to the Sankey case-</PARA>
<PARA>the starting point was the nebulous interest of 'due administration of justice' and 'proper functioning of the public service', the court broke these down to practical, recognisable considerations that were capable of being weighed, one against the other. The 'public interest' which has been described as an amorphous concept, incapable of useful definition, proved to be a viable concept enabling all relevant considerations to be brought to bear. </PARA>
<PARA>In paragraph 5.29, in reference to a number of other cases, it stated:</PARA>
<PARA> These cases demonstrate that the relevant public interest factors may vary from case to case-or in the oft-quoted dictum of Lord Hailsham of Marylebone 'The categories of public interest are not closed'. It is essential therefore that wherever the phrase is used the Bill should provide scope for adequate argument as to what result the public interest may require. This scope may only exist if the Tribunal is empowered to adjudicate on the question. 'Public interest' is not a balancing test that is customarily applied by administrators. </PARA>
<PARA>Or by executive governments. It continued:</PARA>
<PARA> It is a test that must be weighed by an adjudicator who has no interest in the outcome of the proceeding and who is skilled by professional experience in weighing factors one against the other. </PARA>
<PARA>It seems to me, and I take it that it seems to Senator Puplick, who has supported this point of view, that there is some real utility in having open-ended discretions of this kind. Indeed, the Tribunal was demonstrating the utility of that kind of language in the earlier Ballarat and Townsville cases. The option to evolve further detailed criteria ought to be allowed to the Tribunal in the view of the Labor Party. So there it is. The new provisions ignore in their terms the cross-media ownership question. They ignore connections at a national and State media level. They not only ignore them; they in fact exclude them from the Tribunal's consideration. The Bill that we now have before us completely emasculates the current pro-competitive provisions of the Act. The purpose of these amendments, to provisions which recur over and over again throughout the Bill, is to perform the necessary restorative surgery following that emasculation and also to inject some hormones into the potential operation of the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A number of matters have been raised by these amendments. First of all, let me say that the policy behind the amendments has been to provide a strict, exclusive and prescribed-or however one might like to describe it-consideration for public interest. In other words, they are designed to restrict the consideration of the public interest to the matters raised in the Bill and not to go outside the Bill. Senator Button wanted me to confirm that point although I understood him to accept that as being the intention of the provisions of the Bill. The Government's policy on that matter has already been discussed. We have formed the view that the provision is appropriate. I understood Senator Chipp to be also saying that he wanted the rules to be defined and not be able to be changed.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose one can always get some variations in interpretations, even with matters set out in an Act, but we tried to minimise that as much as possible. That was the thinking behind this legislation. As I understand it, the Administrative Review Council also indicated in its report that it believed that public interest should be defined. One other matter Senator Button raised was the meaning of a fit and proper person and he referred to the fact that the granting of a licence may be refused if it is decided that a person is not a fit and proper person to hold a licence. Of course, that is a question of fact, and I would have thought that a very wide inquiry would be available to the Tribunal in determining that question. I am absolutely sure that I understood the full ambit of Senator Button's query, but certainly we would expect that that inquiry would be a wide one. I cannot see why it could not go behind the actual corporate veil-I think that was the word he used-to see who has control of a company, if that could be established. I do not know of any reason why that should not be possible. Of course, in relation to having a prescribed interest, ownership of shares and so on, there are very wide provisions in the Act in other respects for tracing those interests. In this case it is not set out, but I would have thought that it was open to the Tribunal, in satisfying itself on that matter, to have a very wide inquiry. The other matter in relation to these amendments is one that has been emphasised by Senator Evans. As he said, the Opposition wants, in a sense, to have the best of both worlds. It wants to have reasonable guidelines indicating what the Parliament believes should be taken into account, but it thinks the Tribunal should be able to range as widely as it likes.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it may be appropriate in some cases if the Parliament cannot give a clear definition as to what its policy on public interest is. However, I think it is desirable that the Parliament should endeavour to do that. I am pleased to say that it has agreed in relation to the freedom of information legislation as well. We have tried to eliminate as far as possible vague concepts of public interest from that piece of legislation. There may be a difference of view between Senator Evans and myself on both this and other matters. The question arises as to what are the appropriate matters to be specified, and whether they are exclusive of non-exclusive. Senator Evans concentrated his remarks very much on the question of the media generally. I think Senator Puplick dealt with that matter rather effectively when he said it was a little late in the day to be raising the question of whether people who own newspapers should or should not have interests in television and radio. It has been with us for a long time, and the major structures in this area presents a feature of such cross-ownership.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Broadcasting and Television Act has contained very clear policies for many years, and the Government is certainly supporting and making no attempt to change them. I refer to the basic provisions of limiting ownership and control in the television and radio area. We believe that that is the right way. Parliament may believe that it is too heavy a concentration for a person to hold a prescribed interest in two television stations and eight radio stations. The numbers are limited in any one capital city. We believe that that is the right approach. The Act makes those provisions. The Tribunal should not be able to restrict them. If Parliament believes the provision is not restrictive enough it ought to make special provision. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other point that I have to deal with is the point raised by Senator Button concerning page 11 of the Bill and the restriction on concentration of influence in regard to commercial licences outside the metropolitan area. This may be rather a drafting type question, but I am advised that the language is designed to indentify any situation in which there is an undue concentration of interest, whether direct or indirect, from whatever quarter in respect of the applicant and the existing licensees-both radio and television. Linguistically the word 'on' instead of 'of' is the correct usage. I take it that that was the concern. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to the point that I directed to the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) regarding proposed new section 92FAA which is mentioned on page 41 of the Bill. Perhaps the Attorney cannot provide an answer to my question tonight. The proposed new section states that the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal shall, by notice in writing served on the applicant, approve a transaction insofar as it affects the applicant. That provision is subject to proposed new sub-section (2). Proposed new sub-paragraph (2) (c) (ii) states:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>The effect of amendment No. 13 is to remove a provision which will, if passed, be used to increase control of broadcasting and television stations. At present a prescribed interest in a television station is limited to 5 per cent and no one can have more than two prescribed interests in a television station. In the view of the Opposition the proposed new section would permit the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal to disregard those limitations if it is not the person coming before the Tribunal who has acquired a prescribed interest. The intention of this provision in the Bill is to let off the institutional investors, so-called, from an inadvertent breach charge. What we of the Opposition argue is that the amended legislation will permit someone to acquire control up to a 15 per cent interest in a television station by way of a nominee company without section 92, which is referred to in clause 19 (1E), disqualifying the applicant as having a prescribed interest in too many stations. We seek to delete this because in our view it creates an anomoly in that someone can set up a nominee company to which these words in the clause which we seek to have deleted would apply. That is the purpose of our amendment because the clause simply permits an evasion of the intention of the legislation by the establishment of a nominee company. </PARA>

<PARA>The amendments which I have moved have the consequence of reinstating the requirement of prior notice of transactions.

In summary terms, they simply point out that broadcasting is not like any other industry and from a social and political point of view it should not be regarded as being like any other industry. We are also concerned at this farce of the six months' grace period. Both Senator Chipp and I commented on that in the course of the second reading debate. That is the purpose of those amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Attorney a hypothetical question. I know that it is a little late at night for hypothetical questions, but I raised this matter in the second reading debate. I asked: Is it possible for a person who now owns a television station-I gave, with due apologies, the example of Kerry Packer who now owns a television station-and a commodity like 60 Minutes to threaten a regional station? Could that person say: 'You buy my 60 Minutes program at an outrageous price or I will buy you out'? If that person then buys out that regional station, he has a period of grace up to the time of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal's hearing and then six months after that. Then, if the Tribunal makes him divest himself of his shares he could say: 'I will sell them to our friends who will take our 60 Minutes program at the outrageous price we offered'. Again, I apologise to Kerry Packer. I used the name simply because it suits the purpose of the hypothetical question. I ask the Attorney: Is it possible, under this legislation for someone in that situation to bully the management or the owners of a regional station to do what he wanted?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know whether that specific situation is catered for in this legislation. New provision 92M as set out on page 46 of the Bill deals with the situation where a person has, without prior approval, gone in and obtained control of a company with a licence. If that person then was seeking to take action which would affect the licence, the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal may, as this provision provides, give directions as it thinks fit for the purpose of preventing the person from doing an act or thing which would have an adverse effect on the ability of a company to comply with the conditions of a licence or the operations conducted under the licence. The idea of that provision is to enable the Tribunal to keep control over management which may be taking action which would jeopardise the licence. I think that proposed new section would contain a fair bit of power to stop that sort of thing happening.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are a number of amendments to clause 26-amendments Nos (17), (18) and (19)-which all deal with the question of foreign interests in radio and television. I should point out that Opposition amendment No. (17) deals with what we consider to be a possible ambiguity in proposed new section 90G (2) as to whether the 20 per cent limit on foreign ownership applies separately to foreign ownership acquired before and foreign ownership acquired after the commencement of the Act. I ask the Attorney to have a look at this amendment because I am not sure what his intentions are. We think there is an ambiguity. We believe that the amendment would clarify the ambiguity and aggregate all foreign interests, whether acquired before or after the commencement of this legislation. I would have thought that it was the intention that they should be so aggregated. But under the existing clause in the Bill it is not in our view clear that they are. That is the purport of amendment No. (17) which is the first of our amendments relating to clause 26. Perhaps it is a matter on which some advice could be obtained from the Attorney-General's Department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second amendment-amendment No. (18)-involves leaving out the word 'citizen' where it appears in proposed new section 90G (3) and reinserting the word 'resident'. I do not know whether Government senators who are dozing in their places really want the Australian broadcasting system to be controlled by Australian citizens living in Hong Kong, Macao or somewhere else. If they do they will support the legislation. I do not know whether they are concerned about that possiblity. I see that Senator Bjelke-Peterson is. She would be concerned about a Victorian company, let alone a Chinese one, controlling a Queensland company. That is what this amendment is about. It seeks to restore the definition of 'resident'. The resident requirements in the Broadcasting and Television Amendment Act, if this legislation is passed, will be quite different from those in the foreign investment legislation. For that reason we move that the word be changed back to 'resident', so that to be in a position of control one has to be a resident of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The third amendment, which is amendment No. (19), tightens the tracing provisions for foreign ownership to the same degree as exists elsewhere in the principal Act. We see every reason why foreign ownership tracing provisions should be at least as strong if not stronger than the other tracing provisions in the legislation. They will not be if this amending legislation is passed. I seek leave to move together those three amendments which deal with the question of foreign interests in Australian radio and television companies. </PARA>

We find it rather quaint that the Government wants to put 'resident' in and the Opposition wants to put 'citizen' in.

<PARA> The other amendments raise the major issues as to foreign ownership. They have been canvassed in the debate and I do not propose to go over that ground again. Senator Chipp has asked why we cannot have a test requiring that a person be both a citizen and a resident. Of course that would make the legislation more restrictive than it is now. At present the requirement is that a person be a resident. In fact an Australian resident who is not a citizen has a licence in Australia. If one were to make it both 'citizen' and 'resident' of course that would be more restrictive than the present provision. It really is a matter of choice as to what is the more appropriate test in this situation. The Government believes that Australian citizenship is the appropriate test rather than residency in these circumstances. Residence in Australia may be quite an impermanent situation. There are difficulties about determining whether a person is resident. That certainly has been clarified by the experience with the test. On the other hand the test of citizenship is a much more definite one. It seems rather strange to impose the idea that an Australian citizen should not be entitled to acquire interests under this Act. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remind the Minister that Australian citizenship really is pretty easy to obtain if one knows the ropes. I ask the Minister whether he agrees with the scenario which has been postulated-if I may use those two dreadful words 'scenario' and 'postulated'-by Senator Chipp, for example, in regard to amendment No. (19). That scenario is simply that any Hong Kong investor can acquire now a 49 per cent interest, or up to a 50 per cent interest, in an Australian investment company. That investment company can then obtain 50 per cent interest in an Australian television licence and that investment company is not deemed to be a foreign company for the purposes of this legislation. I ask the Attorney-General whether it is also a fact that the scenario can be double headed, that is, two Hong Kong companies could each acquire up to a 50 per cent interest in separate Australian investment companies-say, company Durack and company Bonner-and those two companies then buy between them what is effectively a 100 per cent interest in an Australian television licence, and neither of those investment companies will be deemed to be foreign companies for the purpose of this legislation, once it is amended. I ask the Attorney-General whether he agrees with that. I am not asking whether he agrees with it as a matter of principle but whether he agrees with that interpretation.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>Those amendments deal with public interest matters and increasing the discretion of the Tribunal. I have moved them in the spirit in which previous amendments were moved. I will talk about them for a minute while I find a question which I propose to direct to the Attorney-General (Senator Durack). On a number of occasions we have drawn attention to the public interest provisions with which this legislation is riddled as being inadequate, and this question of the discretion of the Tribunal goes to the heart of this legislation also. The question arises in relation to an earlier matter with which we dealt. I raised the question of the relationship between legal ownership of shares and equitable ownership of shares in connection with an earlier amendment; this also falls into this bracket of amendments. I remind the Attorney-General that the amendments to the Broadcasting and Television Act before the senate create a special category of share transaction in a licensee company, namely, a transaction resulting in the transfer of legal ownership of shares as opposed to the transfer of equitable ownership. That type of transaction will be presumably treated differently to other transactions. Can the Attorney-General get some advice as to why the Government has decided to treat those two classes of shareholding, equitable shareholding and legal ownership of shares, in a different way?</PARA>

<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill now before the Senate represents the results of much careful and difficult work carried out to establish appropriate provisions to deal in a general way with the sort of artificial schemes of tax avoidance with which of recent times we have become only too familiar. In short, this Bill proposes new general anti-avoidance measures to replace section 260 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. </PARA>
<PARA> As I shall explain in more detail later, the measures in the Bill are designed to operate against avoidance schemes of a blatant, artificial or contrived kind and to have an impact in respect of both domestic and international transactions. </PARA>
<PARA> In the international area, however, even more is needed by way of a general legislative response to problems of avoidance of Australian tax and, as announced by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) in introducing this Bill in the House of Representatives, the Government will be proposing changes to section 136 of the Income Tax Assessment Act which is, of course, the provision dealing generally with avoidance in international business and transactions. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will be aware that for some time now the Government has been actively carrying through processes to design provisions to overcome the limitations on the scope of section 260 that have been revealed by a series of court decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of the special nature of this task, the processes have not been confined to the work carried out by officials, but have extended to taking advice from senior private counsel and from the Taxation Advisory Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> This external advice along with contributions from the Government Members' Taxation Committee have played a significant part in determining the final form of the Bill. The Government is appreciative of the contributions that have been made. </PARA>
<PARA> And it is appropriate on this occasion to say that the Bill substantially accords with advice coming to the Government from both official and non-official sources. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, it is the belief of the Government that there is a wide community consensus that Australia must have an effective general anti-avoidance provision. </PARA>
<PARA> There is widespread abhorrence of blatant tax avoidance of the kind that we have recently experienced. </PARA>
<PARA> It distorts in a most unacceptable way the relative burdens of tax that are borne by different sectors of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> In pursuing the Government's firm resolve to counter this kind of activity we have, over the past 3 years or so, introduced a series of specific, yet complex, anti-avoidance measures. </PARA>
<PARA> That has been a necessary response in the circumstances, but unless something is done along general lines there is a very real danger that our income tax legislation will become so volumin- ous and so complicated as to be virtually incomprehensible. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not say that the measures in this Bill will provide a cure-all in respect of all future avoidance arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> The problems inherent in expressing solutions in a general, but controlled, way may mean that there will be tax avoidance arrangements contrived in the future that escape being struck down by the new measures. </PARA>
<PARA> As to that, let me say simply that the Government will, where necessary, follow up this measure with whatever further action may be appropriate in the circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> What is it that general anti-avoidance provisions should aim to achieve? Few people have faced up squarely to that question. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has faced up to it, and also to the probably even more difficult problem of finding the legal language in which to express the conclusions reached about desired policy objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> We are acutely aware that the term 'tax avoidance' means different things to different people. </PARA>
<PARA> Reasonable men and women are bound to differ on this crucial question and on the subsidiary matter of the appropriate tests for determining what behavior a general anti-avoidance provision ought to proscribe. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed provisions-embodied in a new Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act-seek to give effect to a policy that such measures ought to strike down blatant, artificial or contrived arrangements, but not cast unnecessary inhibitions on normal commercial transactions by which taxpayers legitimately take advantage of opportunities available for the arrangement of their affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, a husband and wife who choose to run a business as partners will need have no fear of having their arrangements affected by Part IVA. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be no question, either, of the new provisions impeding a parent who wishes to pass to a spouse or to children the use and enjoyment of some income-producing assets. </PARA>
<PARA> Some writers on the subject suggest that tax avoidance involves conduct entered into for the sole or dominant purpose of obtaining a particular tax advantage. </PARA>
<PARA> That description could be expected to cover the types of tax avoidance that, again using the language of social or political debate, are blatant, artificial or contrived, and which are indeed intended to be covered by this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> But it is also apt to describe other arrangements, including some family arrangements, which are beyond the appropriate scope of general anti-avoidance measures and ought, if need be, to be dealt with by specific measures. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to confine the scope of the proposed provisions to schemes of the 'blatant' or 'paper' variety, the measures in this Bill are expressed so as to render ineffective a scheme whereby a tax benefit is obtained and an objective examination, having regard to the scheme itself and to its surrounding circumstances and practical results, leads to the conclusion that the scheme was entered into for the sole or dominant purpose of obtaining a tax benefit. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly, different approaches might have been taken. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government tried many of them in the course of developing this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> One possibility considered was to adopt the language of the Privy Council in the well-known decision in Newton's case, and, positive tests of inclusion having been expressed, make the new provisions inapplicable to schemes entered into in the course of 'ordinary business or family dealing'. It has been decided, however, that the better test of what is 'blatant', 'contrived' or 'artificial' is the positive one that has been adopted. </PARA>
<PARA> That test seems best to capture the essence of the views expressed by the Privy Council which, in fact, characterised an 'ordinary business or family dealing' as representing a situation other than one of which it can be predicated that it was implemented in the particular way so as to avoid tax. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already said that one of the conditions for the application of the new Part IVA is to be that a taxpayer has obtained what the Bill terms a 'tax benefit'. </PARA>
<PARA> Such a benefit will have been obtained if, after all other provisions of the income tax law have been applied, an amount is not included in a taxpayer's assessable income that might reasonably be expected to have been included if the scheme had not been entered into. </PARA>
<PARA> The other form of tax benefit covered by the Bill concerns an amount that, again after all other provisions have been applied, is an allowable deduction to a taxpayer, but is one the whole or a part of which might reasonably be expected not to have been allowable if the scheme had not been entered into. </PARA>
<PARA> This approach-of specifying in the new provisions what constitutes a tax benefit and that the relevant purpose for application of the provisions is one of obtaining such a benefit-should help to eliminate some of the uncertainties associated with the use in section 260 of less precise expressions. </PARA>
<PARA> That section uses phrases that speak of 'altering the incidence of any income tax' and 'defeating, evading or avoiding any duty or liability imposed on any person by this Act.'</PARA>
<PARA> These very wide, but uncertain, expressions appear to have been at the root of the development by the courts of the so-called 'choice principle', a rule of interpretation which, together with other established defects, has greatly limited the scope of section 260. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two other significant limitations on the effectiveness of section 260 which the new part can be expected to remove. </PARA>
<PARA> The present section does not permit the purposes of the persons entering into an arrangement to be enquired into, except by reference to the effect of the arrangement itself. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, it does not provide a power or procedure, once an arrangement is struck down, to reconstruct a taxable situation. </PARA>
<PARA> As to these points, I have already mentioned that, under the provisions of this Bill, an inquiry must be made, on objective grounds, into the purpose of a person who entered into the arrangement. </PARA>
<PARA> The 'reconstruction' problem is to be overcome by an express provision for the cancellation of a tax benefit obtained under a scheme to which the Part applies. </PARA>
<PARA> Authority will be given to the Commissioner of Taxation to eliminate the benefit in an appropriate way. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, the Commissioner will be specifically authorised to disallow the whole or an appropriate part of a deduction or to include in assessable income an omitted amount. </PARA>
<PARA> This method of eliminating the sought-after benefit, or part of it, is designed also to remove another uncertainty which surrounded the application of section 260. </PARA>
<PARA> It was unclear whether an arrangement to which that section applied had to be treated as wholly void or could be treated as only partly void as against the Commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw to the attention of honourable senators that Part IVA contains a supplementary code applicable to schemes that are commonly called dividend stripping-and to similar schemes-under which shareholders in effect receive company profits in a tax-free form, in substitution for taxable dividends. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason for such specially-tailored provisions within the new general measures is to be found in particular features of such schemes when viewed in the context of the structure it has been necessary to give to the basic provisions of Part IVA. </PARA>
<PARA> It is this. </PARA>
<PARA> When profits have been accumulating in a company, possibly for extended periods, there will be no clear answer to the question whether those profits might reasonably be expected to have been distributed as dividends if the scheme had not been entered into. </PARA>
<PARA> As often as not, that expectation could not be established to exist. </PARA>
<PARA> Where this is so-and despite the fact that the company had been stripped of profits-the result under the basic provisions would be that there is technically no 'tax benefit' obtained. </PARA>
<PARA> Dividend stripping cannot be allowed to escape the new provisions on a technicality of this kind. </PARA>
<PARA> In the simpler schemes of dividend stripping, assets of a company are generally converted into cash, the shareholders sell their shares for a capital sum and the purchaser arranges for the profits of the company to be stripped by way of a tax-free dividend or other payment from the company. </PARA>
<PARA> The purchaser is thus reimbursed for the price of the shares, while the former owners have effectively obtained the accumulated profits of the company in a tax-free form. </PARA>
<PARA> Other schemes of a dividend stripping kind involve the sale of shares in 'current year profit' companies. </PARA>
<PARA> Both kinds of scheme are within the supplementary code. </PARA>
<PARA> The dividend stripping provisions will treat a shareholder who disposes of his or her shares in the context of one of these schemes as having obtained a tax benefit of the amount which he or she would have derived as a dividend if the profits stripped under the scheme had been paid as a dividend. </PARA>
<PARA> A tax benefit so obtained will be subject to the new general provisions for cancellation of tax benefits that I have described. </PARA>
<PARA> Where a tax benefit has been cancelled under Part IVA, the Commissioner of Taxation will be empowered to effect corresponding adjustments to reduce the tax liability of others affected by the arrangements, if it is fair and reasonable in the circumstances to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> Another key part of the legislation covers the imposition of statutory additional tax on taxpayers whose future schemes are struck down by Part IVA. </PARA>
<PARA> Bearing in mind that the Part is concerned with blatant, contrived and artificial schemes, the Government has concluded that taxpayers who, in the face of it, wish to persist with such schemes should be exposed to something more than only the tax they seek to avoid. </PARA>
<PARA> We have seen it as highly relevant that a taxpayer who omits assessable income from a return, or who claims deductions in excess of expenditure actually incurred, is liable to statutory additional tax of twice the tax avoided. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, a taxpayer to whom the new Part applies will be liable by statute to pay an amount of additional tax equal to double the tax sought to be avoided. </PARA>
<PARA> As under the existing provisions, however, that amount will be subject to remission by the Commissioner of Taxation and his decision will similarly, on objection by the taxpayer, be open to review by one of the independent taxation boards of review. </PARA>
<PARA> I add the observation that, in the absence of these penalty provisions, taxpayers would have the 'odds to nothing' in participating in future avoidance schemes and in risking the application of Part IVA. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions of Part IVA as a whole will operate with paramount force in the income tax law, but only in relation to schemes entered into after 27 May 1981, the date of introduction of the Bill into the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> However, in line with settled policy in relation to anti-avoidance legislation, carry-forward losses resulting from schemes that had already been entered into will not be available for deduction against income of the 1980-81 or any later year. </PARA>
<PARA> In harmony with the rules for application of Part IVA, section 260 is being made inapplicable to arrangements entered into after 27 May. </PARA>
<PARA> There are, of course, other things of note about the Bill but these are covered by the comprehensive explanatory memorandum available to honourable senators and I think it is not necessary for me to speak about them at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA> I do, however, want to touch on just one point. </PARA>
<PARA> This is that the Bill indicates specifically that a tax benefit cannot arise in respect of the deduction available for deposits made under the income equalisation deposits scheme, and that the mere making of an election or the giving of a notice specifically provided for in the Act will not be affected by Part IVA. </PARA>
<PARA> I note these things as a prelude to my response to concern that I can foresee being expressed in some quarters that taxpayers who simply take advantage of certain incentives in the law will find themselves at risk under Part IVA. </PARA>
<PARA> Other critics of the Bill will, no doubt, say that arrangements that survive the application of specific anti-avoidance provisions inserted to support particular provisions are in double jeopardy in then having to face and survive the paramount general provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> I made no apology for the approach adopted in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> But I do assert that taxpayers who simply take advantage of concessions for the purposes for which they were put in the law cannot and will not be affected by the new provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> Specifically, for example, Part IVA will not deny to people who simply respond to our concessions for investment in Australian films the benefit of the tax advantages that are part of those concessions. </PARA>
<PARA> But I think it incontrovertible that blatant misuse of those and other 'incentive' concessions ought to be within the scope of Part IVA. </PARA>
<PARA> A general anti-avoidance provision would be of little worth if it could not be used to prevent the unintended exploitation of such concessions in the law, or to operate as a back-up to a specific anti-avoidance provision in circumstances where a taxpayer has tailored arrangements so that the provision is circumvented in form, but not in substance. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the measures contained in this Bill together with the proposed changes to section 136 that have been outlined by the Treasurer are, by any test, significant ones. </PARA>
<PARA> Leaving aside those with an axe to grind, some people may be concerned about the breadth of the measures. </PARA>
<PARA> We will probably hear a lot about their 'uncertainty'. </PARA>
<PARA> To that I say that any problems of that kind are an inevitable outcome of the approach of tackling a widespread and intricate problem by provisions of a general kind. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the measures represent a sober, and appropriately restrained, response to a difficult problem and will be welcomed by all responsible members of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> I warmly commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill contains measures to give effect to the income tax concessions for investors in Australian films that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) first outlined in the policy speech for the election last October. </PARA>
<PARA> A joint statement by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and the then Minister for Home Affairs and Environment on 18 December last set out details of the concession in a comprehensive way. </PARA>
<PARA> In those circumstances, I think it is sufficient in this introductory speech to draw attention to the key points of the legislation now brought forward. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will amend the Income Tax Assessment Act to provide a deduction equal to 150 per cent of capital expenditure on the acquisition of the initial copyright in a new Australian film. </PARA>
<PARA> Also to be provided by the Bill is a tax exemption for an investor's net earnings from such a film. </PARA>
<PARA> The maximum exemption is an amount equal to 50 per cent of the capital expenditure that qualifies for the 150 per cent deduction. </PARA>
<PARA> To be entitled to the deduction, an investor must become the first owner, or one of the first owners, of the copyright in a film that the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment certifies to be an eligible Australian film. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains extensive guidelines that the Minister is required to have regard to in deciding whether or not to certify a film as eligible. </PARA>
<PARA> Primarily, a film must have an appropriate Australian content. </PARA>
<PARA> Tests in existing legislation authorising a deduction over two years for investment in films will be used for that purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister's function will, however, go further than the process of certification of Australian content. </PARA>
<PARA> As set out in the Bill he will also have the responsibility of determining whether a particular film is one produced for exhibition to the public cinemas or by way of television broadcasting. </PARA>
<PARA> To qualify, a film must be a feature film, a documentary or a mini-series of television drama. </PARA>
<PARA> Day-to-day productions, such as commercials, variety programs and films of sporting or other public events will not be eligible. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the classes of expenditure that will be eligible for the special deductions and the time at which the deductions will be available. </PARA>
<PARA> Only expenditure under contracts entered into on or after 1 October 1980 will qualify. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation will, of course, express the deductions to be available to companies and individuals who incur eligible expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> Partnerships are, however, a common vehicle for film production arrangements and the legislation therefore contains some special provisions in this respect. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides that each partner is to be taken to have personally incurred his or her share of expenditure incurred by the partnership. </PARA>
<PARA> As is usual in the tax context, expenditure will qualify only if incurred with a view to production of assessable income. </PARA>
<PARA> Only expenditure outlaid directly in the production of a film will qualify, but the legislation is framed so that, again taking into account practices in the film industry, individuals or partners whose expenditure is in the form of a contribution to a production account will enjoy the deduction to the extent that the moneys contributed are so outlaid. </PARA>
<PARA> Among safeguards necessary to protect these generous concessions from unintended exploitation are measures to counter inflation of film production costs above the levels which persons dealing at arm's length would pay. </PARA>
<PARA> Another key provision is based on the concept that, if taxpayers are to enjoy a deduction of 150 per cent of their outlays, they should only do so for moneys in respect of which they are at risk of a true economic loss. </PARA>
<PARA> The 'at-risk' requirement in the legislation will limit the special deduction to expenditure that is not greater in amount than that for which the person is at risk of loss in relation to the film. </PARA>
<PARA> To illustrate, if a person is protected against loss because the financier who has supplied moneys to expend on the film has recourse only against the film, or income from it, that person will not be at risk. </PARA>
<PARA> Nor will a partner in a limited partnership be regarded under the legislation as at risk for a share of expenditure out of borrowed funds which, because it exceeds capital personally contributed, represents money for which, under the rules of such partnerships, the partner is not liable. </PARA>
<PARA> People whose risk of loss is removed or abated simply because they are able, before the film is made, to find a market for it will not run foul of the at-risk test. </PARA>
<PARA> However, a person who, under one and the same arrangement, borrows money to expend on a film and is guaranteed a flow of income from the film is in a different situation. </PARA>
<PARA> To the extent of the guaranteed income the investment of the borrowed funds is in no way at risk. </PARA>
<PARA> In these cases, the special deduction will not be available for any amount not really at risk. </PARA>
<PARA> I come now to the question of when the special deduction is to be available. </PARA>
<PARA> When details of the concession were announced last December it was indicated that the deduction would be available in the year of income in which the investor expends capital moneys in or towards the production of the film. </PARA>
<PARA> Measures of a safeguarding kind that were foreshadowed then were to operate so that deductions were, however, not allowable if the film was not completed and marketed to produce a yield for investors. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has since concluded that it would be appropriate to vary these rules, but I stress that only a change in the time for taking deductions under the scheme is involved in the variation that is reflected in the Bill before the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that there has been very strong response to the Government's initiative. </PARA>
<PARA> To the end of May, application for certification as Australian films had been made in respect of 200 films and the total budgeted cost for them is some $145m. </PARA>
<PARA> Unhappily, there has also been noted some intervention by elements whose only concern appears to be exploitation of the concession in unacceptable ways. </PARA>
<PARA> Responsible film authorities have registered their concern about that. </PARA>
<PARA> The safeguarding measures I referred to a moment ago would not have been completely effective in closing off avenues for exploitation and would have significantly further complicated the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Accordingly, the Government decided that, fundamentally, deductions should not be available until the relevant film has both been completed and used to produce income. </PARA>
<PARA> However, in the light of representations received since the Bill was brought before the House of Representatives, the deduction is to be allowed on the originally-announced basis for expenditure under contracts entered into on or before 27 May 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I note that representations have been made to the Government that the effect of the modifications to the December Statement will be to direct investment away from quality productions which may take some time to reach the market place. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has examined these comments carefully but does not consider that, with the exception of pre-28 May contracts, they should lead to any departure from the approach taken in the bill. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be remembered that even with the change in the timing of deductions-and I stress again that the modification means no more than that-the concession remains extremely generous and is unparalled in our taxation law. </PARA>
<PARA> The taxation benefits conferred by the Scheme, plus the ordinary economic incentive to obtain a maximum return on any investment, should result in moneys being attracted to quality productions having the potential for significant box-office success. </PARA>
<PARA> This incentive towards quality is in fact reinforced by the second limb of the concessions, the income exemption, which in itself is a strong incentive to investment in films with potential for success. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, the operation of the scheme will be carefully monitored over the next six to 12 months and, if the need is demonstrated, appropriate action will be taken. </PARA>
<PARA> I also observe that a misconception seems to have arisen as to how the modification will apply in circumstances where a qualifying film is produced and televised in parts, for example, as a mini-series of television drama. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to such productions a separate copyright exists in each complete part, with the result that expenditure in the production of a particular part will qualify for deduction when that part is completed and used in the production of income. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning now in detail to the exempt income side of the new concessions, a person eligible for the deduction will be exempt from tax on proceeds from the film, with an exemption limit of 50 per cent of the qualifying amount expended in producing the film. </PARA>
<PARA> Reflecting this, there are in the Bill previously foreshadowed measures that set out what are to be regarded as proceeds from a film for this purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> In brief, all proceeds-whether technically of a capital or income kind-are to be taken into account, as well as foreign-source income, otherwise exempt from tax, that does not flow from the overseas country in which the film is exhibited. </PARA>
<PARA> These rules are, of course, of an anti-avoidance kind. </PARA>
<PARA> Related and previously foreshadowed provisions of the Bill require that expenditure of a revenue nature be set off only against film income and that film losses arising in one year be carried forward only for deduction against film income. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I do not think that I need say more at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA> A memorandum has been prepared to explain the detailed provisions of the Bill, and is being circulated to honourable senators. Also being circulated is a supplementary memorandum which explains the amendments made in the House of Representatives to give effect to the Government's decisions on the timing of the new deduction. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the debate on this Bill was adjourned on 4 June I had started to speak on the media. I repeat what I said at the time. This is not intended to be an exercise of bashing the media; rather it is a plea to the media for a better, more responsible and, if at all possible, a restrained presentation of the news and reports of events in Australia and overseas. The column 'On the other hand', until recently was written by Mr Guy Harriott, a prominent journalist who unfortunately passed away only a few days ago. Under the heading 'Press made the scapegoat for bungling politicians', when referring to the Press, he wrote:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The manner in which it performs this function can be the subject of legitimate criticism;-</PARA>
<PARA>I have a criticism of the Press in relation to its handling of my contribution to the debate on the Census and Statistics Amendment Bill on 13 May 1981. When I spoke previously, I quoted from the Hansard of that date. To save time I will not repeat what I quoted from the Hansard but only what the Age reported on 14 May. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Lajovic (Liberal, New South Wales) asked for an explanation of why the provision was necessary. He recalled that he came from a country with a communist regime (Yugoslavia) and did not want to see anything similar here. </PARA>
<PARA>At that point the debate was adjourned. If anybody can find any similarity between my speech in the Senate and the report in the Age under the heading: 'Three disputes add to Government's troubles' by Stephen Mills, it would be a strange coincidence. It is quite possible that Mr Mills was not able to understand what I said. On the other hand, he may be a new man in a new job. There is also the possibility that he is an aspiring fiction writer, as it is quite obvious that he used a lot of imagination to write what he wrote. I have never asked the Minister 'for an explanation of why the provision was necessary'. I have never 'recalled that I came from a country with a communist regime (Yugoslavia)'. I have never said that 'I did not want to see anything similar here'. (Quorum formed). The fact is that in the seven lines he wrote about me the only true information given was my name, my party and the State I represent. I repeat that Guy Harriott stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The manner in which it-</PARA>
<PARA>that is the Press-</PARA>
<PARA>performs this function can be the subject of legitimate criticism;-</PARA>
<PARA>One of its functions is to report what is happening in the national Parliament. I now ask: Who was bungling in this instance? It was certainly not a politician, but a journalist whose report appears in a major daily newspaper which is supposedly ranked among the best in this country. How can anyone believe anything he or she reads in the Press when such sloppy reporting is allowed and tolerated by the people responsible for the printing of such irresponsible reports? This is only one instance that I am citing as it concerns me directly. How often does it occur in the thousands and thousands of reports and articles which are published in the Press. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many cases in which I was able to observe, to be kind to the journalists the same cavalier treatment of facts concerning events, in our Parliament. Unfortunately it is a fact also that the media tends to exaggerate. Certainly, this is their way of achieving bigger sales or higher ratings. But the effect that this kind of treatment of facts has had on the reader is another matter. I have many examples of the points I make. I have selected only a few which came to my notice recently. The Sydney Morning Herald of 27 April 1981 published an article under the title 'The sorry tale of a reporter who lied', showing the lack of responsibility in the journalists' ranks not only at the reporters' level but also in the supervisory capacity. That article states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Washington Post, which should know, has described it as 'the most far-ranging debate in a decade on how newspapers do their jobs'. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly the sad, sordid story of 'Jimmy's world'-the fabricated article about an eight-year-old heroin addict that won Washington Post reporter Janet Cooke a Pulitzer prize which has since been withdrawn-has created unparalleled turmoil within the American newspaper industry. </PARA>
<PARA>No wonder if it appeared in a newspaper with such a reputation. It is interesting to note what Bob Woodward of Watergate fame-now the Post's Assistant Managing Editor for metropolitan news-recalled later. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>'This story-</PARA>
<PARA>He was referring to the story by Janet Cooke-</PARA>
<PARA>was so well written and tied together so well that my alarm bells simply didn't go off. My scepticism left me. I was personally negligent'. </PARA>
<PARA>But even stranger is what this article says later on. </PARA>
<PARA> The Post stuck by its story and insisted on its right or protest it reporter's sources. In spite of scepticism among many Post reporters, and even some executives, the 'Jimmy' hoax might never have been exposed had it not been nominted by the Post's senior editors for a Pulitzer. </PARA>
<PARA>This brings the following question to my mind: How often do we read so-called authentic stories which could quite easily be a fraud when even a paper like the Washington Post can fall for a cleverly imaginative reporter hiding behind so-called rights to protect reporters' sources. I was suprised when I read that a man as eminent as Mr Justice Kirby was recently quoted in the Daily Telegraph of 29 May as predicting:</PARA>
<PARA> Changes in the law to protect individual privacy and to give journalists the privilege not to disclose sources of information could be on the way. </PARA>
<PARA>Would that change of law give a protection to any reporter to hide behind such a law and write a story which would be nothing but a figment of his imagination? The same thing happened to New York Daily News columnist Michael Daly, as reported in the Australian of 16 May 1981 under the title 'Media Snipers take Aim at another phoney'. That article states:</PARA>
<PARA> New York Daily News columnist Michael Daly has not been so lucky resigning from the paper after a story he wrote about Northern Ireland was challenged as a 'pack of lies' by the London Daily Mail. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Daly quoted a British soldier named Christopher Spell saying: 'Go for their heads', and 'If I'm lucky, the little Fenian will die' during a shooting incident between soldiers and a group of Irish youths in Belfast. </PARA>
<PARA> Announcing Mr Daly's resignation, new editor, Michael O'Neill, said Daly had admitted inventing the name Christopher Spell, and that he was 'unable to substantiate the story'. </PARA>
<PARA> The writer never signalled the reader it was an anonymous source. </PARA>
<PARA> What worried me even more was the report in the Australian of 17 May 1981 under the title 'Hungry for war the world's press urges Ireland on'. The article relates the facts which, to me, represent the greatest lack of responsibility which can be found and which show exploitation of the tragic situation in Ireland. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> Have correspondents of the world's press based in Northern Ireland been reporting riots or inciting them?</PARA>
<PARA> 'For the first time in 12 years of covering the world's conflicts and especially the troubles in Northern Ireland', said British news photographer Tony McGrath, 'I have felt sufficiently angry and disturbed to question seriously the objectivity of some of my colleagues'. </PARA>
<PARA> One American newspaperman resigned after his graphic description of Belfast rioting was exposed as a fabrication. </PARA>
<PARA> American television crewmen and photographers from other nations have been accused, MaGrath said, of 'paying young thugs to throw rocks and bottles at passing army vehicles'. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt some newsmen desperate to provide hungry audiences with colorful words and dramatic film-helped fuel the fire and perhaps unwittingly, spread propaganda pleasing to many factions of the republican cause, most notably the main IRA groups. </PARA>
<PARA>Further, the same reporter said:</PARA>
<PARA> British news photographer Brian Harris said he heard an American photographer shout to a child: 'Can you do that again? I didn't get you throwing that rock'. Harris said: 'I saw kids standing with bottles in their hands, holding them up to the cameras and saying: 'Over here, I've got one'. That was when I left. </PARA>
<PARA>Is there no decency in today's journalistic world? Is there no self-restraint imposed by the profession to regulate and discipline such irresponsible people? Is it any wonder that we have more and more crime and cruelty in our society when our media focuses its attention on and gives front page headlines and prominence to rioters and those who break the law and constantly emphasises in big 10 centimetre headlines, words such as: 'revolt', 'crisis', 'butchery', and all possible superlatives? (Quorum formed) When our media constantly emphasises in big 10 centimetre headlines words such as: 'revolt', 'crisis', 'butchery', and all possible superlatives describing the lowest instincts and actions of human beings, I ask: What can we expect from our young people when they are fed daily the headlines such as 'scandal', 'murder' and 'treason'? Do we really have to suffer this kind of journalism? Is there no way to influence or to convince those who are responsible for the media that what we need is a decent, proper, responsible way of journalism, not the kind that we are getting now. There is, I believe, an Australian Press Council under the chairmanship of Sir Frank Kitto. The Council has a lot of prestige but, unfortunately, no teeth. I believe newspapers are not obliged to do what the Council asks or recommends them to do. What has to be done to correct this sad state of affairs? Should we recommend something similar to that which is proposed by John Basten who is a senior lecturer in law at the University of New South Wales? He wrote in the Australian Quarterly, Summer 1980, issue under the heading 'Judicial accountability: a proposal for a Judicial Commission':</PARA>
<PARA>In this paper I propose the establishment of a Judicial Commission to bear responsibility for selecting judges, for providing training for them and for investigating complaints about them. The Commission should also have disciplinary powers to cope with misconduct and disabilities not warranting impeachment by parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> A few years ago such a suggestion would have been dis- missed in many circles. Nowadays, for better or worse, many of the old traditions surrounding the judiciary are disappearing. . . . These examples also indicate that the traditional belief that judges stand outside the political arena is increasingly being called into question. Much lip-service is paid to the concept of 'independence' of the judiciary and in particular the necessity of keeping judges independent of government and party-political pressures. Unfortunately little attention has traditionally been paid to the ambiguity of this concept. . . . A more open and realistic attitude towards the political nature of the judicial function calls for new mechanisms to protect the valuable aspects of independence. </PARA>
<PARA>To solve our problems would we have to substitute the judges and judiciary with journalists? If anybody can suggest seriously the establishment of a judicial commission which questions the integrity of our judges, what would be more proper and even more necessary would be a body to question the competence, responsibility, decency and integrity of those who are responsible for the formation of our public opinion, those who interpret for us the events from all parts of the world and those who have in their hands one of the most powerful weapons in today's society - the communications industry. I must admit that there are many responsible journalists and contributors to the newspapers who see the dangers of the facts as I mentioned them today. The Age published an article which is entitled 'Media spreads the vision of violence'. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Television makes us all, willy-nilly, voyeurs of public violence these days. </PARA>
<PARA>* * * * There is, however, one new element in all these situations: the vast contemporary international communications machine, which often seems to be actively crying out for new blood, as when foreign television crews in Belfast bribe local teenagers with money, or just with publicity, for 'action shots' to make vivid the evening television news in Amsterdam or Frankfurt. </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, publicity is the chief end to which much violence (including the self-destroying violence of the hunger striker) is the strategy. In measure as the means of publicity (the media) have expanded, so has the rationale for violence. </PARA>
<PARA> * * * * Even quite sober 'investigative journalism', in print or television, unfortunately operates not only to magnify the visibility of violence, but to provide a sort of short course on how to do likewise, for those who feel they have reason to follow in the footsteps of earlier insurgents. </PARA>
<PARA>The article finally states:</PARA>
<PARA> One has sometimes the feeling that the 20th century has created, in the great international communications machine, a sort of Frankenstein's monster that will stalk and bring down many political personages, and assorted celebrities, and even Governments, before we learn to cope with it. </PARA>
<PARA> That should be a sobering thought, especially for those of us who work in the media. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to congratulate that writer, Dr Bell. I only hope that an article like the one I have quoted will have an impact on his colleagues in the media. I would like to say that most probably if my speech is noted at all, which I doubt very much, there will be somebody somewhere who will talk about censorship and the freedom of the media; but the fact is that as far as we can see there is only one censorship and that is exercised totally and completely by the media itself. It is the media's decision what it prints, says or shows. It is its decision and nobody else's how it presents certain actions or happenings. It is its personal view which we have to believe or not to believe. </PARA>
<PARA> Again I emphasise that this is not a bashing the journalists exercise. It is a serious and honest plea to all those who are in a position to influence their colleagues in the media for the sake of a better society and, in particular, for the new generation to change its attitude to reporting. What we need today and tomorrow in the media from those who work in it is facts, not fiction, and even more importantly that the facts be presented with moderation and not exaggeration. </PARA>

<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> This bill, together with its companion Bill, Supply Bill (No. 2) 1981-82, seeks interim appropriations for the services of the Government for the period 1 July 1981 to 30 November 1981, by which date it is expected that the Appropriation Bills (Nos 1 and 2), forming part of the Budget for 1981-82, will have been enacted. Supply Bill (No. 1) seeks appropriations totalling some $4,363m for the ordinary annual services of the Government. This is $116m, or 3 per cent greater than the amounts provided in the Supply Act (No. 1) 1980-81. The provisions made in this Bill take account of the new health funding arrangements announced by the Government and of other decisions arising from the review of Commonwealth functions. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, I mention that no provision is made in these Supply Bills for payments to the States for hospital cost sharing, the school dental scheme or the community health program. Interim funding of these programs will be sought in new States grants (income tax sharing) legislation to be introduced shortly, pending their absorption in general tax sharing grants. That legislation will also provide a standing appropriation for payments to South Australia and Tasmania under the existing hospital cost sharing agreements, pending advice from those States on whether they wish the agreements to continue or for the program to be absorbed in tax sharing grants. Except to the extent already indicated, the Supply Bills do not anticipate decisions yet to be taken in the 1981-82 Budget context. The Bill includes $100m for the advance to the Minister for Finance, which is the same amount as has been provided in Supply Act (No. 1) in each of the last several years. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>

The people who have made a mockery of the proceedings in the Senate this week and last week are the ones who talk outside this place, whenever it suits their perceived political advantages, of the Senate being a House of review.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will truncate the speech that I had intended to deliver. I will shortly be seeking leave to incorporate in Hansard four tables, which I now make available to the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) to examine before I seek leave. Those tables reveal the dismal economic record of the Fraser Government compared with the situation in Australia on most economic indices prior to this Government gaining office and, even more importantly, the dismal economic record of the Fraser Government compared with the average for the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and in particular the countries of Austria, Japan, Germany, Norway and Sweden which I have selected. There is a reason for the selection of those countries which I will explain in a minute. Because of the difficulties in obtaining up to date data for all the countries, the tables terminate in 1979, but the picture revealed by those tables has not changed since.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That dismal economic record is no accident. It is on the record because the Government's economic policies, to the extent that they are thought through or are coherent at all, are built upon a multiplicity of fallacies which constitute a dogma that is credible only to those who are conditioned to filtering out so much of reality as is in conflict with that dogma. I will enumerate about ten of those fallacies. (Quorum formed). The first of the fallacies is this: The sole cause of inflation is money supply growth. When people who assert that refer to money supply, what they really mean is the money value, the money total, of all transactions. They ignore the fact that the number of transactions as well as their price are variable. Less money, as the Thatcher Government has convincingly, albeit tragically, demonstrated in the United Kingdom, does not necessarily mean lower prices. In that case and in many other cases it has been transformed into lower output and higher unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> The second fallacy is that Budget deficits increase the money supply. Budget deficits funded by borrowings from the public have a neutral effect on the money supply. Those first two fallacies are supposed to be understood by any first year student of economics. The fact that they can be mouthed in public by the Secretary to the Treasury says a great deal about the contempt which the Secretary to the Treasury has for the Australian public. The third fallacy is that inflation is tied to Budget deficits and, in particular, that deficits caused inflation to rise in the early 1970s. In fact, up until September 1974 the Australian domestic budget was in surplus. By that time the quarterly inflation rate had reached 5.1 per cent, which incidentally was the highest for all of the 1970s and the highest since the days of the Menzies Government in 1951, which of course recorded the highest rate of inflation ever. In 1975, when the domestic deficit was very much larger, inflation fell by more than 3 per cent from the previous year's peak. In contrast, sharply falling deficits in the last two years have been accompanied by rising inflation, and there is a common cause for that. The common cause of both the rising inflation and the falling deficit is the enormous increase in the crude oil levy. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth fallacy is that Australia's inflation in the 1970s was cause by the wages explosion of 1974. To believe that, it is necessary to believe in retrospective causation. The biggest increase in inflation was in 1973, before the so-called explosion. This explosion did of course help sustain inflation at high rates in the succeeding years. The fifth fallacy is that full wage indexation will perpetuate existing inflation rates. This was one of the most cherished Treasury myths mouthed ad infinitum in 1975 and 1976. On purely theoretical grounds that assertion ignores both the possibility of productivity increases and the possibility of changes in the relative shares of income to labour and capital. For those who are not impressed by such theoretical possibilities the empirical evidence shows that 100 per cent indexation was instituted in mid-1975 and lasted through to mid-1976. In the period from June 1975 to June 1976 the annual inflation rate fell by 3.7 per cent. I stress that this occurred throughout a period when 100 per cent wage indexation was prevailing. </PARA>
<PARA> Gross domestic product from the December quarter 1975 to the December quarter 1976 went up by 6.2 per cent which incidentally is the highest growth in GDP for any year since 1973. For the whole calendar year of 1976 the GDP growth of 4.2 per cent was also the highest since 1973, including 1980. These things were happening at a time when the Prime Minister and Treasury were ranting about 100 per cent wage indexation locking in the inflation rate and stultifying growth. One hundred per cent wage indexation was in fact accompanied by a 3.7 per cent fall in the inflation rate and the highest growth rate that has been recorded in any year since the Fraser Government has been in power. This was, incidentally, accompanied also by a large domestic deficit. All of those things, according to the dogma of the Treasury and the Government, could not happen. Treasury's inflationary expectation theory is not rescued by the fact that inflation was falling from mid-1975 to mid-1976. The Treasury might say that growth was high in that year because inflationary expectations were falling, and in fact inflation did fall in the end. But expectations are, by definition, expectations about the future. In fact throughout late 1975 and early 1976 Mr Fraser, both as Leader of the Opposition and as Prime Minister, and the Treasury were pontificating that wage indexation at 100 per cent as it prevailed would lock in forever the existing rate of inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> The sixth fallacy is that a large public sector stultifies growth and causes inflation-the so-called crowding-out effect. In the 1970s Norway, Sweden, Denmark, the Netherlands, West Germany and Austria all had larger public sectors than Australia but lower inflation and unemployment rates and higher rates of GDP growth. The seventh fallacy is that the 1974-75 and the 1975-76 deficits were irresponsibly large and economically disastrous. The Australian deficit in the calendar year 1975-and this can be verified in the tables-was 4.3 per cent of GDP which was the same as Japan's deficit in that same year and considerably lower than West Germany's which stood at 5.8 per cent of GDP in 1975. Economic growth in West Germany in 1976 was 5.2 per cent, which was high by historical standards. In Australia, as I have already mentioned, it was 4.2 per cent-that was taking the four quarters of 1976 over the four quarters of 1975-which is the highest rate of economic growth recorded in any year since the Fraser Government came to office. Japan also recorded an economic growth rate of 5.2 per cent in 1976 compared with a negative growth of one per cent in the preceding year. (Quorum formed). Both in Germany and in Japan these large deficits in 1975 were followed by high growth rates and falling inflation. Japan, incidentally, during the rest of the 1970s continued to run large deficits which were accompanied by falling inflation. The Minister has had a chance to look at my tables showing unemployment rates, real GDP growth, consumer price index figures and deficits in the countries named and also the OECD average. I seek leave to have those four tables incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a couple of brief comments about those tables. Only in Australia has there been a significant increase in unemployment since 1975 and 1976. The averages for unemployment in Australia for 1974 to 1976, which were the years which were affected most by the economic policies of the Labor Government, show that unemployment rates were below the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average. For the subsequent years up to the end of 1979 they are significantly above the OECD average. They are well above the rates for all of the other countries listed. Australia's GDP growth in 1974, 1975 and 1976 was well above the OECD average. For the succeeding years it has been well below the average of all but one of the other countries listed. Only in regard to the consumer price index, loosely called inflation, is Australia's performance better than the OECD average. Even at the end of 1975 Australia's inflation rate was above the OECD average and falling. By the end of 1979 it was slightly below the OECD average and rising. The only moderate and valid claim to success which the Fraser Government has is having achieved, relative to the past and relative to the rest of the OECD countries, a moderate reduction in the rate of inflation purchased at extrenely high cost, compared with those other countries and compared with the pre-1976 period, in terms of economic growth and unemployment rates. What should be noted about the countries which have, by Australia's standards, brilliant records in economic management, on inflation control, on GDP growth and on low rates of unemployment, countries such as Austria, Norway, West Germany and Japan-although in a slightly more paternalistic way-is that all those other countries have incomes policies which are effective</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The eighth fallacy is that interest rates are determined by the size of the deficit. In other words, there is a positive and inexorable correlation between the size of the deficit and the interest rates. This year the deficit is the lowest since 1973. Interest rates went up another 2 per cent to the highest rates ever. In 1977-78 there was a big domestic deficit, almost $2.5 billion which was substantially higher than that in the preceding year, accompanying a fall in interest rates of around 2 per cent. The recent variant of the fallacy that deficits determine the level of interest rates is that the prevailing high interest rates have been caused by the voracious borrowing demands of the public sector, which is equally fallacious. In 1977-78 public sector borrowing requirements were 5.6 per cent of gross domestic product. They have fallen to 5.4 per cent and then to 3.6 per cent this year. The Public Service borrowing requirement as a proportion of gross domestic product has been falling ever since 1978-79, and throughout that period interest rates have risen. It would be foolish to argue the the size of the public sector borrowing requirement has no influence on interest rates, but it is only one of many factors affecting interest rates, frequently not the most important. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the ninth fallacy. A positive correlation exists between changes in inflation and the household savings ratio, therefore higher inflation equals lower household consumption and falling business investment. According to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Treasury, that too is an inexorable economic law. Australian evidence on this pont is mixed, but in 1979 and 1980 rising inflation was accompanied by a falling household savings ratio and rising business investments. The Government simultaneously boasts of that empirical result and ignores the fact that the result defies its own dogma-it contradicts its own dogma. </PARA>
<PARA> The tenth fallacy is that real wage overhang in 1974 and onwards caused unemployment because of the substitution of capital for labour. That fallacy ignored the fact that was deducible at that time even, namely that capital equipment prices were in fact rising faster than wages, although since the stupid investment allowance of 1976, the stupid 40 per cent investment allowance, that market reality was somewhat distorted by inept government interference. But apart from that which was empirically observable at the time, subsequent evidence also contradicted the dogma and showed it to be a fallacy. If labour had been displaced at above normal rates by capital equipment, productivity would have also increased at above normal rates. In fact, from 1974-75 to 1978-1979 productivity increased at an average rate of 2.9 per cent compared with the higher rate of 3.3 per cent in the previous seven years. </PARA>
<PARA> Fallacy number 11, the most important of all, is that incomes policies cannot controlinflation and will increase unemployment. That of course is contradicted by the evidence in the tables from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development as a whole, in particular from the OECD countries in which effective incomes policies are in operation and have been in operation throughout the 1970s. That incomes policies cannot control inflation is not the most obviously fallacious of those that I have cited, it is probably the most damaging. In Sweden, Norway and Japan, full employment is alive and well and has been throughout the seventies. All those countries have had lower inflation rates and, except for Japan, where the population is static, better rates of economic growth and larger public sectors. I should add that the Japanese incomes policy is not so much a deliberate policy of the Govenment as one that is associated with the general paternalistic economic policies of that country, as of course are Japan's social services. </PARA>
<PARA> All those countries have effective wages policies. Their record economic performance confounds and contradicts what in Australia is asserted to be ubiquitous economic verity. By any objective assessment it must be concluded that an effective wages policy is the key to economic success. Whether it would work in Australia may legitimatley be questioned. It certainly is unrealistic to expect an effective wages policy to be implemented in Australia under the present Government which has broken faith with almost every group in the nation except a group of tax dodgers, which apparently it feels obliged in isolation to maintain its promises to. The Government has imposed a number of taxes which have changed significantly the distribution of income in a regressive way and which generally have the distrust not only of the Labour movement but of a much wider section of the population. However, it seems highly unlikely that Australia can regain, under any Government, full employment with acceptable stability of prices and rates of economic growth without an effective wages policy. Above all, the management of the economy is much more complicated than the vulgar simplifications and misrepresentations of the Prime Minister. </PARA>

The amounts included in the Supply Bills are calculated to meet ongoing requirements under existing policies or new proposals for which authority exists. Each Bill includes the provision of $100m for the Advance to the Minister for Finance, which is at the same level as that provided in recent years. Supply Bill (No. 1) provides some $4,363m for the ordinary services of government. This is about $116m or 3 per cent greater than was provided in the previous year. The comparatively small increase is the result of the decisions taken with regard to health funding, the provision for which was included in the tax sharing Bills, a procedure in that area which was different from that followed last year. Supply Bill (No. 2) provides a sum of $660m for expenditure on capital works and services. As is usual at this time of the year, these Supply Bills are passed pending the passing of the Appropriation Bills later in the year. I commend the Bills to the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I feel like a batsman in 1946 after Barnes and Bradman put on 400 runs. I have been sitting here for a long time waiting to get an innings. I simply want to make a request to the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Carrick. He has been alerted to it. In 48 hours or less the Senate will adjourn for the winter recess. I would like to receive some clear cut statement on the Government's attitude to the future operation of Senate committees after the Senate resumes in August. I know that two ideas have been touted. One concerned whether the work of Estimates committees would be ongoing and the other was whether their functions would be taken on board by legislative and standing committees. One-fifth or thereabouts of the members of the Senate will be leaving us. We know that they would be rated as very excellent parliamentary artifices. There is no question about that. I think that when the Government and the Opposition are assessing their replacement members on Senate committees the matter will need a certain amount of advance planning. I have a personal interest in this. As Senator Carrick knows, I have had a request on the Notice Paper for a Senate select committee on immigration to be established. I have had informal talks with the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee) who has said to me: 'You get a pretty fair opportunity when Estimates committees meet twice a year'. The Government Whip in the Senate, who is Chairman of Estimates Committee D, was reported by Laurie Oakes as saying that he believes the work of Senate Estimates Committees ought to be ongoing. So do I. A lot of things happen in between the times and Estimates committee meets twice a year. As I am mindful of the time, I simply say-I think that Senator Carrick will agree with me-that we should be informed by tomorrow night as to the Government's intentions in regard to Estimates committees. I ask whether they will be ongoing.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise two matters. Firstly, I point out that whoever scheduled these meetings of the Senate to end at quarter to three or later must be crazy and needs his head read. Most of us have been here since 8.30 yesterday morning. To go through until 2.45 a.m. is absolutely ridiculous. People who represent the States in this place cannot possibly legislate in a proper manner when the Senate sits for so long. I would just like to make my protest because I am sure there will be a few more protests before we finish.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second matter I wish to raise is that last Wednesday I asked the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Carrick) a question in relation to Sir Phillip Lynch. Part of my question went like this:</PARA>
<PARA> Does or did Sir Phillip Lynch or any member of his family have any financial or other interest in a private employment agency or like organisation? If so, what are the details of that interest?</PARA>
<PARA>I do not think Senator Carrick realised, when I asked that question, that I asked it in what I thought was a quite proper manner. I thought I asked it in a responsible manner, having heard stories about the matter from professional employment officers. Senator Carrick, in answer to a supplementary question, said that he would check the information for me. I ask Senator Carrick at this stage whether he has any information on that question that I asked last Wednesday. If he has not, could he get the information before the Senate rises or perhaps even before Senator Carrick leaves, as I believe he is leaving before the Senate rises for the winter recess?</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Insufficient information is available to answer this question.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Commissioner of Taxation has advised that action is taken to verify returns in this respect as far as is reasonably practicable having regard to the many exigencies of tax administration.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) This information is not available.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The Commissioner of Taxation has pointed out that it must always be a matter of administrative judgment how enforcement resources can be used most effectively from time to time, but that the fact that a category of assessable income may generally accrue to individual taxpayers in relatively small amounts does not necessarily mean that enforcement procedures in respect of it would not be cost-effective, particularly as a means of encouraging wider general compliance with the law.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The provision of facilities for the enforcement of section 26 (e), or any other provision, is a matter for decision by the Commissioner of Taxation, having regard to his other responsibilities in the administration of the taxation laws.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) This aspect of income tax law, in Australia and elsewhere, involves special difficulties which are not caused by deficient or unclear legislation but by the need to convert a large variety of benefits in kind given to taxpayers into appropriate money values in their hands. The Government has looked at this part of the law from time to time but has not concluded that a different approach is warranted.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 5 March 1981 (Hansard, page 319), Senator Elstob asked the Minister for National Development and Energy the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Recently the Farmers and Stockowners Association of South Australia expressed a real concern over the purchase of rural land by foreign investors. The members believe that a situation may develop whereby it will be impossible for young Australian nationals to become established on land in their own right. Will the Minister consider introducing legislation similar to that of New Zealand where it is stipulated that foreigners must live in the country for at least two years before purchasing rural land, or to the legislation of the United States where foreigners are prevented from owning more than 0.405 hectares of land.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Carrick undertook to refer the question to the Treasurer, who has provided the following answer:</PARA>
<PARA> Proposals for foreign interests to acquire Australian rural land are subject to examination under the Foreign Takeovers Act and other foreign investment policy criteria.</PARA>
<PARA> Rural land is treated with special attention in the Government's policy on foreign investment and the Government is concerned to ensure that foreign interests should not engage in specultative land acquisitions of the kind intended purely for capital gain without accompanying benefits to Australia. Approval for the sale of rural land to a foreign investor would normally only be given after careful consideration of the proposal by the Foreign Investment Review Board and where the Government is satisfied that the sale would offer net benefits to the Australian economy and that Australians had been given adequate opportunity to buy the land.</PARA>
<PARA> From information available to the Foreign Investment Review Board, it would appear, contrary to the views of concern expressed by the Farmers and Stockowners Association, that there has been little interest shown by foreigners in purchasing rural land in South Australia. I am forwarding to the honourable senator a paper on foreign investment in rural land which outlines in some detail the Government's policy and provides detailed statistics.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator's understanding of policies in New Zealand and the United States of America differs from the information available to the Government which is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> New Zealand-</PARA>
<PARA> Under the Land Settlement Promotion and Land Acquisition Act 1952, as amended, foreign interests are restricted from acquiring rural land, offshore islands and any land required for public use. The legislation aims to restrict absentee foreign ownership of certain types of land in New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA> For the purposes of the Act a person ordinarily resident in New Zealand is required to have resided there for not less than 2 1/2 years of a 3 year period immediately preceding the purchase of the land, and that person must intend to continue to reside there permanently.</PARA>
<PARA> Restriction of foreign ownership applies to any land of two hectares (five acres) or over an area which is zoned for rural purposes, or is so zoned that farming of any kind is a predominant or conditional use in that zone.</PARA>
<PARA> However, acquisition of land by a foreign interest may be permitted if:</PARA>
<PARA> the acquisition is for experimental and research purposes which would benefit New Zealand; or</PARA>
<PARA> intended uses of the land, other than for agriculture, clearly show significant benefits to New Zealand and thus are in the national interest; or</PARA>
<PARA> an individual alien permanently resident in New Zealand farms the land exclusively for his own use and benefit and has the ability and means to achieve these purposes.</PARA>
<PARA> If land is part of the assets of a business, and where the consideration involved exceeds $NZ100,000, a non-resident has to notify full details to the Overseas Investment Commission of any proposal that would lead to the non-resident interests controlling 25 per cent or more of the voting rights of the business. Each proposal is considered by the Commission on its merits.</PARA>
<PARA> The United States-</PARA>
<PARA> Under the Agricultural Foreign Investment Disclosure Act 1978, all foreign interests who own or acquire United States agricultural land are required to report their holdings with the United States Department of Agriculture. This legislation is not intended to restrict or regulate land purchases or sales by foreign interests. It is aimed primarily at strengthening the efforts to monitor foreign investment in United States agricultural land.</PARA>
<PARA> The American States generally have no restrictions on ownership of land by resident aliens. However, nine States have laws that generally prohibit or restrict in a major way, non-resident aliens from owning real estate. Some of these States also have restrictions on ownership of land by resident aliens. An additional four States have laws that limit the total acreage that aliens can acquire or hold and the limites range from 5 acres to 500,000 acres. Six States, five of which are included in the nine States mentioned above, have laws that permit aliens to hold land for a limited duration or require aliens to dispose of all or part of their holdings within specified time periods if they do not become United States citizens or residents of the State.</PARA>
<PARA> The policies of these countries are of course related to their particular circumstances just as the Australian policy which I have briefly explained above is aimed at meeting Australia's needs. This Government's policy and the way in which it is administered provide a reasonable basis for exercising supervision and, where necessary, restraint of excessive foreign investment in Australian land.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 28 April 1981 (Hansard, page 1387), Senator MacGibbon asked the Minister representing the Prime Minister the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is the Minister representing the Prime Minister aware of concern, particularly in Queensland, at the growing level of foreign ownership of real estate and property in both urban and rural areas? Recognising that the Commonwealth has no constitutional responsibility in this field, will the Government consider recommending to the State and Territory governments that a register be maintained listing all beneficial owners of property-not nominees-together with their residency and nationality status?</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Carrick undertook to bring the question to the attention of the Treasurer, who has provided the following answer:</PARA>
<PARA> Yes, I am aware that some organisations have expressed concern about foreign ownership of Australian rural and urban real estate. The Government respects such views and through its policy on foreign investment looks very closely at proposed acquisitions of real estate by foreign interests. Before any approval is given, other than in cases where the purchasers are Australian citizens resident abroad or genuinely intending immigrants, the parties must demonstrate that there will be benefits through development of the real estate or otherwise to Australia from the investment and, in the case of rural land, that Australians have been given adequate prior opportunity to purchase the land if they wished to do so.</PARA>
<PARA> I have noted the honourable senator's question concerning the maintenance by the State and Territory governments of registers of property ownership. The practice of the Foreign Investment Review Board is to consult the appropriate State and Territory government authorities in the examination of important cases and on certain other foreign investment matters. I have asked the Board to consult these authorities on the proposal which the honourable senator has raised.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Government is concerned about disabled people in remote areas and initiatives have been taken to help them. For example, the Isolated Patients' Travel and Accommodation Assistance Scheme (IPTAAS), administered by my colleague the Minister for Health, provides financial help to persons residing in isolated areas who are referred by a medical practitioner for specialist treatment and who need to travel more than 200 kilometres from their home to obtain such treatment. In addition, the IYDP National Committee of Non-Government Organisations, which is responsible for promoting the aims of IYDP through the voluntary sector, has as its Northern Territory representative a disabled person from Alice Springs who speaks for disabled people in remote areas on that Committee.</PARA>
<PARA> The needs of disabled Aboriginals in remote areas are also being investigated by the Government. My colleague, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, has set aside funds to employ Mr Kevin Coombs to co-ordinate the involvement of Aboriginals in the IYDP throughout Australia. Mr Coombs is also a member of the IYDP National Committee and in that capacity is personally visiting remote Aboriginal communities in each State and Territory to gain first hand information on the problems faced by the disabled. The matter is being further investigated by individual committees advising my State Ministerial colleagues and by representatives of my Department and the Departments of Aboriginal Affairs and Health who are liaising with Mr Coombs. The National Advisory Committee on the Handicapped and the Standing Inter-Departmental Committee on Rehabilitation are also considering the special needs of handicapped Aboriginals at the request of my colleague the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, on 19 August 1980, the Minister for Health announced details of a new Commonwealth program under which a range of aids to daily living, such as wheelchairs, walking aids, splints, calipers, braces and personal aids, are to be provided to disabled people not eligible for assistance under existing assistance programs. Assistance under this new Program of Aids for Disabled People, which is expected to commence in the near future, will be available to disabled people throughout Australia, including disabled people residing in isolated areas. The new program is a Commonwealth initiative for the International Year of Disabled Persons.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Following normal banking practices, the Commonwealth Savings Bank of Australia's operating instructions are private and confidential to the Bank's officers and it would not be appropriate to make them public.</PARA>
<PARA> Subject to that qualification, the managing director of the Commonwealth Banking Corporation has provided the following information:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) and (2) In summary, with regard to building loans made by the Commonwealth Savings Bank, the Bank's Branch Instructions-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) require that the borrower must enter a satisfactory contract with the builder;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) state that the contract plans and specifications will be examined by the Bank to ensure the Bank's requirements are met;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) make provision for acceptance of a contract other than in the Bank's form, provided that certain basic aspects as follows are covered:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) a reasonable completion time</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) identification of plans and specifications</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) a minimum standard of construction</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) access by the Bank's officers for inspection purposes</PARA>
<PARA> (v) acceptable progress payment provisions</PARA>
<PARA> (vi) satisfactory workers' compensation and public risk insurances</PARA>
<PARA> (vii) a known contract price.</PARA>
<PARA> The Bank is not a party to a building contract either on its own form or any other form of contract. The parties involved are the owner and the builder.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Bank does not maintain statistics regarding the various home building contracts used by its housing borrowers and consequently is not in a position to provide the details sought.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Provided the Bank's requirements as set out in the answer to Part (2) are met, acceptance of a building contract is made at branch level. Provision exists in instructions for referral of contracts containing special clauses to higher authority. These are examined on their merits. The Bank's preference for its own form of contract (CSBH 35) stems from the knowledge that the contract clauses are fully acceptable without the need for special examination but, as indicated in (2), its use is not compulsory.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The Bank's legal advisers are of the opinion that there is no inconsistency between the provisions of the Bank's building contract and the relevant Victorian legislation. In these circumstances, the arbitration clause in the Bank's building contract as it applies in Victoria is not currently under review.</PARA>

<PARA> (b) $6.5m for unemployment, sickness and special beneficiaries; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) $0.6m for recipients of sheltered employment allowance.</PARA>
<PARA> These costs are based on the number of pensioners, supporting parents and recipients of sheltered employment allowance current at 19 December 1980, and estimated average unemployment, sickness and special beneficiaries in 1980-81.</PARA>
<PARA> The costs for pensioners include a rough estimate of the likely additional cost in respect of those pensioners who would become newly eligible as a result of the increase in the income limits.</PARA>
<PARA> The estimated cost for beneficiaries is based on the present distribution of continuing income of existing beneficiaries. It takes no account of the impact of the proposals on casual earnings or labour force patterns. Adoption of these proposals would have the additional effect of making eligible for a part-rate benefit some persons currently excluded by the income test. Not enough information is available to estimate the cost in respect of these new beneficiaries but the additional expenditure might well be substantial.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) to (4) I have seen the article referred to and I am aware of the strong demand for geoscientists, not only in Australia, but also in most countries in the western world.

<PARA> I ask a question of the Minister representing the Treasurer. I preface it by saying that I am one of those who believe this country should follow such energetic countries as Hong Hong and Switzerland and establish a tax rate that is constant no matter what income a person works toward because I believe the present tax rates do remove incentive. Is the Minister able to say how much money would be lost to the Treasury if the maximum tax rate were reduced from the present 60c in the dollar to 50c in the dollar, something that would be at least a step in the direction of an even tax rate? If the Minister is not able to let me know the exact amount at this stage from his notes, I would be grateful if, when he can, he would also advise the percentage loss to revenue of such reduction. Finally, will be Minister advise the Treasurer that many senators and members do believe that a flat tax rate is possible and that the proposition should be examined again in discussions leading up to the Budget?</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Based on a projected income distribution of taxable individuals for 1980-81, the loss to income tax revenue for the 1980-81 income year from reducing the maximum marginal rate of tax from 60 cents in the dollar to 50 cents in the dollar is estimated at about $125m.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 6 May 1981 (Hansard, page 1646) Senator Bjelke-Petersen asked me a question, without notice, in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Defence in the Senate. The question concerned the Defence Forces Retirement Benefits (DFRB) Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence has supplied the following information:</PARA>
<PARA> Although you mentioned the Jess Committee's 1972 Report and recommendations I am not sure specifically what you have in mind in referring to anomalies which have disadvantaged some 7000 ex-servicemen and between thirty and forty widows. I suspect, however, that it is in some way related to the fact that the levels of pensions of DFRB pensioners are generally lower than those granted to their counterparts under the DFRDB scheme which succeeded the DFRB scheme with effect from 1 October 1972.</PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps some background to the events emanating from the recommendations of the Jess Committee would be helpful. First the Committee recommended:</PARA>
<PARA> 'That all contributors to the DFRB Fund be transferred to the Proposed DFRB scheme (ie the DFRDB scheme). The conditions of the scheme should then apply to them.'</PARA>
<PARA>and second:</PARA>
<PARA> 'That pensions and benefits payable under the DFRB legislation at the time the Proposed DFRB Scheme is introduced remain in force and, thereafter, be adjusted in the same manner as benefits payable to recipient members of the Proposed DFRB Scheme.'</PARA>
<PARA>Thus it should be clear that there was never any intention that DFRB pensions should be recalculated by applying to them the terms and conditions of the succeeding DFRDB scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> DFRB pensioners were in fact granted a pension increase in 1973 under legislation introduced and passed at the same time as the Parliament dealt with the legislation establishing the new DFRDB scheme; and further pension increases have been granted on an annual basis since then to both DFRB and DFRDB pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA> I can confirm that DFRB pensions have more than doubled since 1972 and I am informed that the further increases to be granted in July next will be of the order of 9.4 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> It is true of course the DFRB pensions are generally lower than DFRDB pensions. However, there is nothing new about differences of this kind. They existed in levels of DFRB pensions granted at different points in time during the life of that scheme; and for the same reasons they are occurring within the DFRDB scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> In other words, the differences are attributable more to tying pension levels to final salary, rather than to changes in the methods used for calculating pension amounts. As salaries continue to rise, so will pensions payable on retirement.</PARA>
<PARA> Pension increases in Government sponsored occupational superannuation schemes generally are designed primarily to maintain the real value of retirement pensions. This aim has been more than satisfactorily achieved so far as DFRB pensioners are concerned.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 7 May 1981 (Hansard page 1726) Senator Robertson asked me a question, without notice, in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in the Senate. The question concerned the migration and settlement of East Timorese.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> People from East Timor being resettled in Australia are not refugees and are not considered so by the Australian Government. The United Nations Convention definition of a refugee which is used as a guideline in Government decisions on designation requires that a refugee must be outside his/her country and unable or unwilling to return for fear of persecution. Timorese leaving Indonesia have automatic right to Portuguese nationality and are readily accorded this status by the Portuguese authorities on request. As a consequence, they have a country which is willing to accept them. There is also the issue of return to Indonesia. As all Timorese leaving Indonesia do so legally under normal exit arrangements, the possibility of return to Indonesia is always available to them.</PARA>
<PARA> Timorese accepted for resettlement in Australia enter under three separate programs: the group of 625 whose admission was agreed between the Australian and Indonesian Governments in 1978, the special humanitarian program for those outside East Timor on or before 30 september 1980, and normal family reunion migration.</PARA>
<PARA> None of these groups is able to meet the terms of the internationally accepted refugee definitions, but nevertheless Australia has relaxed normal entry rules for the first two groups and other Timorese programs in recent years in recognition of their humanitarian claims on our resettlement resources.</PARA>
<PARA> East Timorese whose names appear on the list agreed between the Australian and Indonesian Governments are required to do no more than lodge an application form and satisfy normal health and character requirements. Nominations covering in excess of 2,000 East Timorese have already been sent to overseas posts for processing under the special humanitarian program. A similarly abbreviated processing regime applies to these nominees, although it is necessary for individuals to establish that they were in fact outside East Timor on or before 30 September 1980. Some family units, split between Lisbon and Jakarta, are required to complete all visa processing requirements so that entry visas can be granted to all family members at the same time. The delays resulting from these two last mentioned factors are minimal and similar to those occurring under other refugee and special humanitarian programs.</PARA>
<PARA> The principal causes of delays in reuniting East Timorese with their relatives in Australia are the difficulties and expenses incurred in gaining permission to leave East Timor for Jakarta and then to travel abroad. The Australian Government has on a number of occasions urged the Indonesian authorities to facilitate family reunion movement from East Timor to Australia and although the Indonesian Government has given positive assurances, the rate of movement to Australia remains slow and irregular.</PARA>
<PARA> In reply to the question on the number of East Timorese currently being admitted, of the agreed list total of 625 people 345 have so far arrived here, 45 of them in the 1980-81 program year. I have mentioned that nominations in favour of over 2000 East Timorese have been referred to overseas posts for action, and over 700 persons have been granted entry visas since the commencement of the program in October 1980. Remaining cases are being completed as quickly as possible.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industry has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Wool Industry Act provided that the Australian Wool Testing Authority (AWTA) has no power to hold real or personal property except monies that become payable to it. The equipment, materials and facilities used by the Authority are owned by the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) and its staff are employees of that Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA> The initial funds to set up the AWTA were supplied by the Commonwealth Government and were eventually repaid. Over the years the total operating surpluses generated by the Authority's activities have more or less approximated the cost value of the facilities it employs. Growers have, of course, contributed singificantly to those operating surpluses through use of AWTA services.</PARA>
<PARA> The proceeds of the sale of the AWTA will go to the AWC.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Wool Measurement Standards Authority, is not a statutory body but a section of the Department of Primary Industry. Its establishment was requested originally by representative wool industry organisations.</PARA>
<PARA> Since it was first established, its staff has been reduced as the industry gained experience with objective measurement and sale bly certificate and sample, and following the closure of two laboratories which operated in competition with the AWTA. Currently, AWMSA staff totals twelve.
