<PARA> 1. Note that legislation establishing plant breeders' rights in other countries has had serious adverse effects, namely:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Virtual monopoly control of seed production has passed into the hands of a few large international corporations seeking to profit from the exclusive rights over plant genetic materials created by such legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The varieties of seeds available have been restricted mainly to hybrids which will not reproduce truly and will not grow without the aid of artificial fertilisers and pesticides, thus maximising corporate profits without regard for the interests of growers and consumers.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The genetic diversity of crops has been eroded, rendering them vulnerable to disease and other environmental threats.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Recognise that maintenance of the genetic diversity of plant varieties is crucial to the continued well-being of the Australian nation, and take all necessary steps to preserve and promote such genetic diversity as a public resource and to prevent exclusive control over plant genetic materials from falling into private hands.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Can the Minister confirm the report, published in today's Bulletin, that the Government has been trying to persuade Israel and Egypt to issue an invitation to Australian troops to join the proposed force in Sinai? Was this invitation, if it was in fact made, designed to lend an air of legitimacy to the involvement of Australian troops, in much the same way that pressure was applied to South Vietnam to invite Australia into the Vietnam war? Does the statement by the Deputy Prime Minister in Argentina, of all places, that Australian troops will not be sent mean that Egypt and Israel would not meet the Government's request for an invitation? Finally, why was the announcement made by the Deputy Prime Minister, off the cuff, apparently thousands of miles from Australia, while the Government was saying in Australia that the matter has not yet been decided?</PARA></TALK.START>

Therefore, the latter part of Senator Button's question is irrelevant. It is not a question of the Government trying to persuade Egypt and Israel. Discussions are taking place around the world, in the absence of a United Nations force, for the composition of a peacekeeping force in the Middle East. It has been suggested that if Israel and Egypt were to make joint approaches to various nations that might form an acceptable base.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Torres Strait Treaty was signed by the Prime Minister and the Foreign Minister on 18 December 1978. The treaty, in addition to establishing maritime boundaries and dealing with other related matters, seeks to protect the traditional way of life of the traditional Australian inhabitants in the Torres Strait and of Papua New Guineans living in the coastal area of that country. The treaty will come into force after the necessary legislation has been passed in both Australia and Papua New Guinea and the instruments of ratification have been exchanged.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As to the latter part of Senator Walsh's question, of course the only excuse I would give is that Senator Walsh cannot understand the simple statement of facts as published in the Press, and therefore he draws entirely the wrong conclusion. I repeat, the shares in the Australian Rundle partners fell very heavily-in halves-between November and early February, at a time that he is alleging I made statements talking up the shares. So there can be absolutely no truth in the matter at all. Day by day the published figures-they have been published in the Press-showed that because of the information that shareholders had they believed that there were varying circumstances, unknown then to the Government, and the shares fell. After the Government invited the partners to make a clear statement the shares fell only fractionally. So the real fall in the shares, and the major fall, was during the time that Senator Walsh suggests that there was a talking up. That, of course, is absolute nonsense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not recall the particular question itself or, indeed, the answer because we answer many questions. But the fact of the matter is that if it is based on the inference that anything I have said talked up the shares then factually that is wrong because the trend on the stock exchange, as borne out by the published figures and those incorporated in Hansard, show exactly the reverse.</PARA>

I ask Senator Carrick whether he believes that the assertion which he re-endorsed in August last year that the company Esso had given clearly to the public an undertaking of a multi-billion dollar investment in the project had the effect of talking up the Rundle shares which, as the Minister said, peaked in October and November, and whether the Minister still stands by that statement.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am utterly sure that nothing that the Government said had such effects at all. The fact is that it is abundantly clear that the stock market held views on Rundle which caused the shares to decline and fall. I have been particularly careful in reference to all mining and mineral projects not to do other than to state the evidence which has been given to me, basically by my Department. I have been meticulous in that because it would be utterly wrong to give evidence that either falsely raised or falsely dropped the price of shares.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Indeed, there was a considerable amount of soul-searching on my part and on the part of my Government when we found that there was a vast difference between what was the public perception and what was the picture as revealed because we knew that, unless the facts could come out, that action would influence wrongly the price of shares. We gave very great attention to that matter and, I think, acted with entire probity.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2922" SPEAKER="Carrick Sen The Hon J.L." NAMEID="2U4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In responding to that question yesterday, I said that whilst we were not thoroughly clear on the precise fall, the drop looked as though it would be about $A20 a tonne. I would like to clarify my answer yesterday because reading extracts of the Press report could give something of a wrong impression. There is a formula to create the price of automotive LPG and a formula that creates the country use of LPG as fuel and, of course, a market formula for other uses. As to automotive LPG, that formula will take place with a reference to the body that succeeds the Prices Justification Tribunal. There will be a determination and, clearly, on that basis and assuming the prices are as indicated, there should be a fall in the price of automotive LPG.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Yesterday Senator Walsh asked me whether the results of the price fall would be that the companies would get the profits or that the profits would be passed on. I had in mind specifically in regard to automotive LPG that the mechanism would ensure the passing on of such profits. As to the petrochemicals, of course they will take the export or market value. As to the domestic consumers, what I set out to indicate was that we would not be able to make any legislation this side of August, but that we expected that, in the interim, the companies, the utilities, would pass on any benefit as such to the consumers. I pointed out that there is a subsidy at this moment of $80 a tonne. The Government has made no policy determinations now, but it is possible that the Government could consider adjusting that subsidy so that the fall in price left the domestic price for gas at the same level as it is now. I cannot foreshadow that at all, but the aim would be that prior to any policy actions at all the consumers should get the benefit.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The very first thing to say is that at all times when I made statements in the Senate they were based not on my own beliefs but upon the advice that I had received from the Department, from the Bureau of Mineral Resources and from the companies concerned. In other words, they were statements which at no time represented a difference as between my Department, which provides objective advice, and the advice from the market place-except when, on my visit to Gladstone on 18 February, I found that there was a very great difference in perception. When I found that great difference it became absolutely necessary to conform to the very principle that I had articulated before-to ensure that the public perception was in line with the emerging facts. I took those steps. Let me make it clear: You cannot have it both ways. If there were some plan on my part-and there was none-to talk up the price of the shares and if talking up the shares was my interest, why would I take steps on 18 February which could have only one inevitable conclusion, that of depressing, over a very long period, the shares?

We will do our darndest as quickly as possible to get the information in shape'. The whole Government said to them, 'Do it as quickly as possible.' It would have been utterly wrong of us had we on 19 February publicly exposed something on which there would have been no firmness of fact for the market place. What we said was: 'Do your homework as quickly as possible and get the information out as quickly as possible'. If Senator McLaren reads the answer that I gave, he will see that it was a measured and considered answer which indicated then that there was emerging a difference of opinion, a difference of perception.

He has informed me that while national highways are eligible for full Commonwealth funding, land and associated road assets are vested in the States and the acquisition procedures for the national highways, therefore, are governed by the legislation of each State. It is also pointed out that it has been the practice in rural areas of Tasmania for the Main Roads Department to seek permission of landowners to enter property with a view to commencing road construction, including national highways, and for negotiation to take place on the price of land acquired for the roadway while construction is under way. As negotiation often can be lengthy it is not uncommon for roads to have been constructed and open to traffic for some time before the settlement price has been reached. This practice has meant that lengthy delays have been avoided in the provision of improved road conditions for the travelling public. Mr Hunt has also pointed out that some legal argument promoted recently in Tasmania suggests that, if acquisition is not completed prior to the commencement of road construction, landowners might be able to claim for the value of all improvements carried out on their land prior to the settlement being reached.

The fact, as acknowledged by many overseas authorities, is that Australia is moving both in the control of its own economic management and in its developmental activities in ways which are attracting the admiration of many people in the world. The fact is that the Government finds no necessity to hold a major public inquiry. All the evidence is there. The Government has foreign investment guidelines to ensure that there is a significant and majority Australian equity and co-partnership. The Government has, through its own export controls, the ability to ensure a full pricing for its exports. It has through its taxing system at all levels a capacity to take a fair return and pass it back to the public.

Information as to whether Australia is currently getting a world price for aluminium is available for him to seek and to find. It is a fact before his nose. The evidence that we charge a particular percentage of company tax and other taxation is there for him to decide. Of course, the question whether the cost of coal, the cost of electric power, as provided to the various smelting factories, is a real one and one that, as has been said here, is a matter for the States. I am interested to note that the New South Wales and the Victorian governments have come out flatly asserting that what they are charging by way of tariffs for alumina smelting is a fair and reasonable charge and not one that shifts the burden on to other consumers. It is not for me to decide whether that is so. I suggest to Senator Mason that he and I will pursue with great interest the evidence before the committees of inquiry. Indeed, I would want to see the full thrust of public inquiry into every activity. In the end the test of what we are doing is a number of things: First of all, are we using the resources with wisdom and prudence as against the heritage for the future? Secondly, are we using them with full knowledge of the instability of the world and the fact that we have a very heavy responsibility to contribute to the maintenance of the stability and living standards of other countries? Thirdly, consistent with all that, are the Australians taking part in this development and the older generations sharing in the benefits? Those tests can be applied. I think that if they are applied objectively the answer comes out very well for Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

I do not have in front of me the specific figures for the flow of money to the various States but they can be made available.

The Minister claims that the talk about deregulation of Australian coastal shipping controls is misleading when it refers to controls other than those required for safety and is limited to the requirement to operate under Australian conditions for manning, accommodation and rates of pay. There is no restriction on the entry to the industry or on prices charged by private operators. Other countries with extensive coast lines reserve domestic shipping for national flag carriers. The high cost of coastal liner shipping mainly results from terminal costs in Australia.

With the prospect that the average world price may fall below that of Saudi Arabian light over the winter recess, I ask: Is it a fact that Australian refiners are free to purchase crude oil on the world market-I do not simply mean the spot market-that is, they are not bound to purchase Saudi Arabian light, the price of which sets the world parity price payable by the Australian consumer for domestic crude? Will the Government set the world parity price at a level related to any lower average world price or at actual prices being paid for imported crude, whichever is the lower, so that Australian consumers can enjoy a decline in petrol prices as is the case in the United States of America?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At this moment there is happening, happily, a phenomenon in world oil prices. That phenomenon is not accidental. It has happened for two main reasons. The first is the decision of the International Energy Agency and its members to reduce their imports by 5 per cent and not to operate on the spot markets, but to draw down on their stocks. The second is what I regard as a very courageous and very wise decision of Saudi Arabia, that against its own interests it would increase its output by more than a million barrels a day and keep its prices low. The effect has been to convert what had been a shortage of oil in world markets to a temporary glut. The Saudi Arabians are pursuing a situation in which they are trying to get stability in pricing by a formula which would allow for an inflation factor plus a small real growth factor. They understand fully that a very large amount of the recession which has crept over the world in the last five to six years has come from unduly high oil prices, and they are endeavouring to abate that. I will spend the latter part of this week and next week heavily involved in this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No one can predict what will happen or whether it would be likely that the price of any oil would fall below the price of the Saudi light market crude which is our market price. It is true that our oil companies will be free to purchase oil on the world market, but they will be free only in the sense that there are no restrictions on their doing so except the availability. Since there is, with only relative flexibility, little availability for manoeuvre they would not be able to pursue that course too long. The Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries meeting decided to allow 10 per cent reductions in most countries but not Saudi, Iran and Iraq. Production from Iran and Iraq, if the war does not intensify, may increase. There will be some abatement of volume. I have to stress to Senator Tate that the best informed view is that we can guess that all we are looking at is a short Indian summer of glut, and that in fact the production of oil in the world is falling. We are using oil at twice the rate we are finding it. Indeed, the predictions by IEA in regard to production of oil five to ten years ahead are less than they were last year. There is a downwards modification on this. It is an Indian summer and therefore it is not likely to persist. I think it hypothetical that there would be available in the world any large quantities of oil at a price lower than the Saudi market price. We chose the Saudi market price basically because a significant amount of our crude comes from there but also because it happened to be one of the lowest prices in the world. I think the overall situation is that, sadly, it is an Indian summer and that the trends are not likely to persist unless there is a continued severe recession in the world.</PARA>

Because it has that price, conservation and conversion or substitution will take place, as well as encouragement of exploration and of synthetics. The fundamental principle is that world price should persist. I repeat: It is hypothetical. I cannot see how any considerable volumes of oil could be available to Australian refiners at below the light market price. There is not a flexibility of shopping around of any quantities at all. Indeed, one of our companies is endeavouring to find a relatively small amount of oil, and it cannot be done at this moment. Basically, the honourable senator's proposition is hypothetical.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I wish to make a personal explanation. On 14 May I made a speech to the Senate outlining the problems facing the Commonwealth Grants Commission in trying to determine the relative shares of tax money to be paid to State governments so that, with equivalent local tax raising efforts, they can provide equivalent State government services. I also pointed out the way in which Victoria and New South Wales are seriously disadvantaged by the present formula. In a speech to the Senate yesterday, Senator Martin criticised my speech in a farrago of distortions, misrepresentations and quotations out of context which reflect little credit on the Queensland Treasury.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I shall deal with three areas in which I was accused, totally inaccurately, of misleading the Senate. I was accused of failing to deal with benefits to the Victorian State Government of having company headquarters located in Melbourne, although the main activities of those companies are in other States. In fact, as I said in my speech, these headquarters are in Melbourne because of the financial infrastructure there. They are of negligible benefit to State Government revenue. Company tax is paid to the Federal Government, not the State Government. I was also accused of failing to deal with the benefits of protection. In fact, as I pointed out, tariff protection is decided by the Federal Government on national interest grounds. None of it goes to State governments. The only significant benefit to State government revenue is through payroll tax. Victoria receives about $12 per capita annually from payroll tax on protected industries. This is trivial compared with the $70 per capita less than the national average Victoria receives in tax reimbursements. Many believe that excessive tariffs harm economic activity and that Victorian industry, far from being helped by tariffs imposed by the Federal Government, is seriously harmed by them. But that is a different issue which has nothing to do with State Government revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, Senator Martin challenged the accuracy of two tables I used showing the benefits to State governments of payroll tax and mining royalties. I have had these tables checked and they are correctly quoted and sourced. They are a true and fair representation of the situation. In any case the alternative figures cited by Senator Martin strengthen rather than weaken my argument. There are many more mistakes and misrepresentations in Senator Martin's speech, but it is all rather academic since the Grants Commission has already made its decision, which I do not think will disadvantage Queensland and which I am sure will result in a fairer deal for Victoria and New South Wales. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is well known that my view is that this place is not and never has been a States House. I would never do anything so absurd as to compete with Senator Hamer in that respect. The particular matter to which I wish to refer is an article which appeared in last weekend's National Times,the date of which is 7 to 13 June 1981, dealing with the architect Romaldo Giurgola and the design for the new Parliament House. The article, written by John Sandeman, appeared on pages 16 and 17 of the newspaper under the heading: 'One man's house on the hill'. It was indeed a very prominently advertised article because the front page of the National Times for last weekend billed it as the lead article under the heading: 'The real designer of Parliament House: Aldo Giurgola'. Whilst that article was generally very informative, perceptive and interesting, it did contain one passage which it is necessary for me to correct on the public record. I refer to the passage which reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Gareth Evans, an assessor in the competition, says bluntly 'Giurgola is the architect, not Thorp.'</PARA>
<PARA>While I am certainly delighted to see Aldo Giurgola getting the public recognition he undoubtedly deserves for the Parliament House design, it was more than a little mischievous and certainly more than a little unfair to Richard Thorp and myself for the writer to purport to quote me in those terms. What I did say to Sandeman in a telephone conversation-it was simply by way of an aside during a conversation about something else, namely, the cost of the building-was that I though the basic design concept, and indeed such element of genius as that concept might be thought to possess, was clearly Giurgola's. But I was not then making, nor have I ever made, any big dramatic point about it, not least because Rick Thorp himself has always acknowledged-as he does again in the course of this article when quoted-the central role of Giurgola in generating the basic form and design approach of the winning scheme. Thorp is quoted as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> Obviously Aldo is the central figure in the form of the Parliament House, and in particular the design approach the firm takes. </PARA>
<PARA>The point I make very clearly is that the reality is that this design project was so huge and complex that its realisation must necessarily have been a team effort, involving not only the collaboration of Giurgola and Thorp but also the work of a host of other architects and specialist consultants. 'The' architect was not so much either Thorp or Giurgola as the firm of Mitchell-Giurgola and Thorp, of which they are both principals. I have no doubt whatsoever that Richard Thorp's personal contribution to the evolution of the winning design was, and remains, indispensable, both in the overall co-ordination of the design project and in the bringing to it of a distinctively Australian feel for landscape, location and function. I find it regrettable that the National Times found it necessary to downgrade Thorp's role at the price of boosting Giurgola's. Certainly I do not want to be thought of as in any way contributing to or associating myself with that enterprise. I have written to the National Times in similar terms to those I have just used. Given the importance of this matter for the reputation and the future of Mr Thorp, and indeed the interest of honourable senators and members of the House of Representatives in the matter, given that it is after all the new Parliament House that is in issue, I thought that it would be appropriate for me also to make that statement on the parliamentary record. I appreciate the Senate granting leave to enable me to do so. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OP7">Senator ROBERTSON</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Northern Territory)</ELECTORATE></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I wish to make a personal explanation. Last week, on 5 June, the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) in the course of a personal explanation said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 16 May 1980 in the Senate Senator Robertson referred to the Kimberley election and stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It is understandable that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Chaney) is sensitive about this area. He is sensitive because he is a member of the Liberal Party of Australia and because the Western Australian Liberal Party took the shameful action against the people of the north-west. He is sensitive because his own brother was involved in this matter. I do not like to raise these personal matters but . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Chaney then went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Once again, I made no reply at the time but I think honourable senators would know that I would have found that reference objectionable. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Chaney in the course of his speech went on to say that it was a pity that the people who spoke on this matter did not check their facts. He indicated that the facts related to the Kimberley by-election are recorded in the record of the Court of Disputed Returns, No. 1 of 1977. Then he read an apology from Nationwide. I wish to make a very brief personal explanation about my involvement. I have checked the facts, as Senator Chaney suggested. I have done this as he suggested, by reference to the findings of His Honour Mr Justice Smith. I have the documents. The facts are as I stated them when I spoke on 16 May 1980. I believe that the Minister would be sensitive, as I said in my statement, because of the actions of his party, the Western Australian branch of the Liberal Party, which set out to deprive Aboriginal voters of the vote, particularly at the time when he was Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. Members of his party set out to do this in two ways, as indicated in the findings of the Court of Disputed Returns. I will not go into those in any great detail. Certainly the Minister and most others would be aware of them. The first way was through the plan referred to as G16 in the proceedings, and the other was through improper directions to polling staff. The plan basically was that five Liberal laywers were to act as scrutineers and 'use of technicalities of the law to the fullest extent' to deprive Aboriginal people of their franchise. These are the people to whom the person involved, Mr Ridge, referred in a letter to J. P. Quilty of Hall's Creek, which was quoted in the Nation Review in September 1977. Speaking of Aboriginal people he said:</PARA>
<PARA> It was a degrading experience to have to campaign amongst the Aborigines to the extent I did and it offended me to know that whilst I was concentrating my efforts on these simple people over the last couple of weeks, I was neglecting a more informed and intelligent section of the community . . . It is indeed a travesty of justice that a comparative handfull of such ill-informed people . . . should have the right or the power to determine the future of our state. </PARA>
<PARA>A little further on he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . by the next election there could be in the order of 3,000 to 4,000 Aborigines on the roll and under such circumstances the Liberal Party would be doomed to failure . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Justice Smith in the Court said of the plan:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . it seems to me that the only inference open on the evidence is that the intention was to stultify the use by illiterate voters of How to Vote Cards as a medium of instruction. </PARA>
<PARA>I repeat that phrase. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . to stulify the use of How to Vote Cards . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The second matter to which I referred was the improper directions given to staff at polling booths. Mr Neil McNeill, the Minister for Justice-there is a strange contradiction-who is, of course, a member of the Liberal Party, directed the Chief Electoral Officer to send telegrams to all the presiding officers on illiterate voting procedures. The purpose of this, quite clearly, in the words of the Court was 'to stultify the use of How to Vote Cards' and to deny the people their right to vote. The telegrams referred to this purpose. The Chief Electoral Officer himself and his Returning Officer believed that the how to vote card:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . was an adequate and proper mode as to the marking of his (illiterates) ballot paper. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course it is. This is accepted by anyone with experience of illiterate voters-anyone, that is, except those who were trying to deprive the Aboriginal people of their franchise. In the Court Mr Justice Smith made it clear that he agreed. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The majority of the electors were elderly people and many of them were frail, but nevertheless they crossed the (flooded) creek carrying their 'How to Vote' cards aloft so that the cards would not get wet. </PARA>
<PARA>Then he commented:</PARA>
<PARA> Each had a card, kept and shown to the Judge at the field sitting. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Justice Smith then said:</PARA>
<PARA> The impression I gained of their evidence was of a simple, but sensible and sincere people who were anxious to exercise the franchise . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Liberals, of course, were trying to deprive them of that very thing. Since the Minister has mentioned his brother, I state that specific mention was made of Mr John Chaney in the Court proceedings. He was indicated as one of the lawyers selected to act as scrutineers. It was indicated in the proceedings that he went to Turkey Creek by helicopter but arrived there too late. The work that he was to do had already been done. He went on to Kununurra where he acted as a scrutineer. Professor Tatz in his book Race Politics in Australia referring to the activities of Mr Chaney in Kununurra, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The atmosphere at Kununurra was tense-but the Court found one single difference from Hall's Creek: 'Mr J. M. Chaney, the respondent's admitted . . . agent at this polling place, found that aspect of his instructions, he said, to be distasteful--</PARA>
<PARA>He was referring to the putting of the questions-</PARA>
<PARA>and he did not request that the questions be put.' However the Court found constant interjections from scrutineers . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, I do not deviate from my original statement. I was disgusted by what the Liberal Party did. I was in the electorate shortly after the election, after the plan was put into effect. I am pleased to say that the Liberal supporters to whom I spoke in that area were also disgusted. I would have thought that the Minister would have been embarrassed. He has made some fine speeches in this place and outside it-I will not bother to quote them-and these would suggest that he would be embarrassed about the matter. I would have thought that he would have been sensitive about the issue. If he is not, I am surprised and, frankly, disappointed. If he is not sensitive, than I am in error on that point but I am in no other error in respect of the issue I raised. It was a shameful action, it was carried out by the Western Australian Liberal Party of which the Minister is a member, his brother was involved and his brother indicated his own shame in the record of proceedings. </PARA>

<PARA>Today when he started his explanation he referred to his words as being: 'Sensitive because of the actions of his party'. There is a significant distinction between the two phrases. My personal explanation related to the role of my brother. My brother, who was referred to in an Australian Broadcasting Commission report, sought and recovered damages and received an apology. I put that matter on the public record. I ask Senator Robertson to look at the difference between the words he used on 16 May and the word he used today. I suggest that he ought to be a little more careful in composing such an explanation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not intend to oppose this motion because I realise the futility of doing that. But I want to use this motion to make some reference to the sitting hours that we have been subjected to over the last couple of weeks. Last week, we met until 3 a.m. and this morning we rose at almost 3 o'clock. I think that business was concluded at about 2.45 a.m. when there were a couple of short adjournment speeches. Last night I demonstrated a lack of finesse, I suppose, by saying that the person responsible for us sitting at that hour of the night should have his head read. That is not the sort of language that I normally use but I think that it probably expressed precisely my feelings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Senate simply cannnot function properly if we sit until 3 o'clock in the morning, and follow that up with sittings to 2 a.m. Continual late sittings do not assist us. We are sent here to represent the people of our States and to watch over the legislation that passes through this chamber. We cannot do that properly if we sit these hours. In addition, one must remember that not only are senators affected but also are all sorts of people affected. Staff of the Parliamentary Library must stay back to unearthly hours simply because we are here. Attendants in this place have families waiting for them and they are deprived of their family contact and of the sleep that they need because they are here until 3 o'clock in the morning and thereafter. Transport officers get away after the last of us leaves and they are here before most of us arrive. They get very little time for rest or recreation. All of these people should be considered. Just think what it must be doing to their health. We have a few medical practitioners in this place and I am sure that they will tell us that continued late sittings, such as we have had, are no good for the health of the people who are affected by them. </PARA>
<PARA> What about the health of honourable senators? We seem to forget that in this very parliament two members passed away this year through heart ailments-one in the House of Representatives, the Honourable Eric Robinson, and the other in this chamber, a young person whose death shocked us all. Yet what are we doing? We are placing strains on the health of all members in this Parliament by making them sit here until 3 o'clock in the morning when they have been here from about 8.30 the previous morning. Not only are we sitting until 3 o'clock in the morning but also we are having to front up for committee meetings and for early morning sittings the same day. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know what the plan is for tonight. I am not sure whether there was a plan for last night, but, even if the plan for tonight is that we finish at 11 o'clock, we must be back here at 9 a.m., after having sat until nearly 3 o'clock this morning. This is not good enough. People in the community cannot believe that we have the stupidity to sit these hours, or that we have the crush of legislation to get through that we have at the moment. I believe that we are tempting fate with respect to the health of every person in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> When we come back after the winter recess, I hope that we will bring a bit more sanity into the sitting hours than we have had this session. Recently we all voted on what we think the sitting hours should be, but it is not much use sitting those hours if at 10.30 or 11 o'clock at night it is decided that, instead of adjourning, as the Standing Orders provide, we go on and on until the business is finished. As I have said, I will not oppose this motion of sitting at 9 o'clock tomorrow morning because I see the futility of opposing it. But I point out that the community expects a lot better from us, the people who work for us deserve a lot better from us and honourable senators in this chamber should look at their health and performance and start sitting proper hours. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take advantage of this motion not only to echo and to endorse the sentiments just expressed by Senator Colston but also to express my protest, which I believe is shared by a great majority of senators in this chamber on both sides, about the whole way in which Government business is being managed this session and, in particular, in the last few weeks. It has become an absolute travesty of disgrace. I am not simply making a ritual protest about the consequences of the necessary log jam of business which always occurs at the end of every session but which has been particularly acute on this occasion; nor am I making my other personal ritual protest about the contemptible way in which important pieces of legislation such as the Freedom of Information Bill have been treated in the Government's programming. I am making a more general point about the extraordinary incapacity that this Government seems to have to be able to predict from day to day or even some times from hour to hour what business will come on and as the result the incapacity for senators to give even a semblance of organised attention to the Bills with which they have to deal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The reality is that Bills and motions have come and gone from the Notice Paper like the Scarlet Pimpernel over the last few weeks. Honourable senators see them here and see them there but we do not see them when we expect to find them when they are initially scheduled to come up. It has happened again this morning. The appearance of the red business paper on our desks indicated that a number of major Bills, which are not expected to come on until tomorrow-including the income taxation tax law amendments to section 260 which were not completed in the House of Representatives until late yesterday-are, in fact, coming on today. That change was made, I understand, without any consultation with the Whips on our side or indeed with anyone on our side of the chamber to indicate that this was happening. As a matter of courtesy I will make the point and then sit down. The conduct of business has been a disgrace to everyone--</PARA>

But the reality of the matter is also that the Whip's Office, whether through its incapacity, inattention or inability simply to keep up with the pace of things, has undoubtedly contributed to, as I read the situation, the all-pervading sense of confusion that has prevailed over the last few weeks.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to this motion in support of what my colleagues Senator Colston and Senator Evans have already said. I have raised objections on many occasions to the manner in which Bills come from the other place when we get to the end of a session. A very important Bill-the Health Acts Amendment Bill-is due to come into this place today and we are to debate that Bill today. The Senate is supposed to be a House of review. The motion provides that we will resume at 9 o'clock tomorrow morning. I have previously expressed in this chamber my concern for the health of the attendants, particularly those who serve this chamber. When we sit to 3 o'clock in the morning and they have to be back here, as they had to do last week, at 9 o'clock they are out on their feet, and when certain things take place here they are the ones who get the blame. It is happening all because the Government cannot manage its business. That has been most evident this session because of the disarray in the Government's ranks over certain Bills. Paper tigers have been making statements that they will oppose Bills and the Government has had to take the Bills back to the Cabinet, only to find that these people are still not satisfied. They make outlandish statements about the things they will do, but when the chips are down they knuckle under to their party and act in here at the behest of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). As a matter of fact, they are nothing but damp squibs. We on this side of the Parliament know that the staff that service this place-the staff in the dining rooms, the transport drivers, the Hansard staff in particular, some of whom do not get away until daylight-have to suffer because of the enormous rows and disunity in the Fraser Government at this time. I say that it is absolute madness, as my colleague Senator Colston said, to be sitting here till 3 o'clock in the morning and them coming back at 9 o'clock.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Last week I asked Senator Durack, I think it was, whether he could give us an undertaking that we would sit reasonable hours if leave were given to incorporate second reading speeches in Hansard and he said that he would look at it. But he did not have much of a look at it, or if he did he just turned a blind eye, because the same thing has happened this week. Having sat till 3 o'clock this morning, we are now being asked to come back here at 9 o'clock tomorrow morning, Thursday, without any indication being given to the Senate as to what time we will get up tonight. Are we to get up according to the time laid down by the Standing Orders, that is, 11 p.m. or are we to negate the adjournment question?</PARA>

Unless the Minister can say that we will adjourn at a reasonable hour tonight, the Minister might well have to read that second reading speech because, having got to this stage, I could not care less about her having to read it. The Government has got us all to the point of frustration. I say again, in speaking to this motion, that I am most disappointed, as are my two colleagues who have spoken to this motion, with the way in which the Government is treating this Parliament.

Nevertheless, I do not think that the sin can be visited entirely upon the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Carrick) or the Whips. Senator McLaren, Senator Evans and Senator Colston have indicated where the blame lies. It really lies in the Cabinet room or with the Government. I must say that I have received courteous attention from both the Government Whip and the Opposition Whip, and I acknowledge that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Looking to the long term, I consider that the sort of exercise that has been undertaken recently-that is to say, the distribution of a voting paper upon which we have three options as to future Senate sitting times-was inadequate in that no opportunity was given, as I understand it, for these options to be debated in the Senate. In particular, I would regard anyone opting for the first option to be laying the foundation for a decline in the role of the Senate. It might do something for the night life in Canberra but it certainly will not do any good for the Senate or honourable senators. I would have liked to see, before this paper was distributed to honourable senators for a vote, a proper debate on this subject and a committee established to look at the question of options to see whether a compromise could be reached between the various viewpoints of honourable senators on this very important question of sitting hours. Frankly, before the matter is determined, I will be seeking the co-operation of other senators to establish such a committee because there are further options that I have considered. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I will clarify for the Senate the program for today. A number of senators have requested information in regard to the Government's program and the expected time for the rising of the Senate tonight. The last item on the order of business is the Health Acts Amendment Bill 1981. That message has not yet been received. It is expected that the Bill will come into this place today, but it will not be part of the program of the Government to debate it today. That Bill was listed in the expectation that that message would be received and we would be in a position, if time permitted, to debate it. But it is the expectation of the Government that the other matters, with the exception of that last item, will comprise the program for today. I draw attention to the fact that there are to be cognate debates on those Bills which relate to the work of the Review of Commonwealth Functions committee and there is to be a cognate debate on the income tax legislation. It would seem that the program is one that should be completed in a reasonable time if honourable senators do not debate whether we are busy but actually debate the Bills that are before the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I made the mistake of taking seriously the business paper that the Government issued about two hours ago and I thought that some legislation would be introduced-that there would be a first reading before this second reading debate took place. However, I am speaking on the second reading of the Commonwealth Functions (Statutes Review) Bill and the Income Tax (Assessment and Rates) Amendment Bill. The first Bill is comprised almost entirely of decisions made by the razor gang which require legislative backing. I must protest at the method which the Government has chosen because of its past ineptitude in dealing with these legislative changes. It has shown its contempt for Parliament in lumping a whole range of disparate legislation into one Bill. It makes one wonder whether in the next session the Government will decide to simplify its procedures even more and tack all legislation on to the Budget and put it in one Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before moving on to the substance of the Bills, I will quote some extracts from a speech made in February 1976 by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcom Fraser). He said:</PARA>
<PARA> In the past two weeks, the Government has undertaken a searching review of all its spending programs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is determined to manage Australia's fiscal affairs properly. It is determined to tackle inflation and unemployment firmly. </PARA>
<PARA> . . . we aim to cut back the unnecessary growth in government and the excessive deficit which has accompanied it. </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister referred to 'ways of achieving maximum administrative efficiency and of eliminating waste and duplication within and between government departments, and between Commonwealth and State departments'. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> There has been a rationalisation of commissions, boards of inquiry, and other advisory bodies as announced yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> . . . A total of no less than 230 expenditure items was individually examined. Decisions were made to end, reduce or defer spending on most of these items. </PARA>
<PARA>If that language sounds familiar, if it sounds very similar to the language we heard on 30 April this year-just five years later than the extracts I have quoted-it is no accident, because in February 1976 the Fraser Government was conducting a political stunt and in April 1981 and in the months which preceded April 1981 it was engaged on another political stunt, the legislative consequence of which is before us now. Let there be no mistake about this: The razor gang exercise was a political stunt by Australia's greatest ever political stuntman-the Prime Minister. It has been misrepresented as a watershed, to use the Prime Minister's words. In fact, it is not just rhetoric; it is recycled rhetoric. It is the rhetoric of 1976 recycled in 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> According to the Government's own estimates, the ultimate-I stress the word 'ultimate'-gross savings of the razor gang's decisions will be $560m. The Government claims that 360 decisions were made. I could not find quite that many. The net result, however, the net savings, are not estimated by the Government but they will certainly be considerably less than $560m, for a variety of reasons, chief among them probably being that there are 32 decisions to transfer functions currently performed by the Commonwealth Public Service, by salaried public servants-engineering, architectural and other professional services-to the private sector. There is little doubt that as a result of those activities being transferred to the private sector, costs to the public purse will increase. There are a handful of very highly paid public servants. There are some who receive just over $1,000 a week but the private consultants hired by this Government frequently receive $1,000 a day. </PARA>
<PARA> No one should be more conscious of this, of the enormous cost of hiring private consultants on a part time basis, than a Minister of the razor gang, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, because it was she who a few years ago initiated the social security conspiracy case which has so far cost the taxpayer between about $6m and $7m. I repeat that the action initiated by Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle as Minister for Social Security has cost the taxpayer between $6m and $7m. Mr Rofe, Q.C., the senior counsel hired by the Government, hired by Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, received over $1,000 a day. His assistant receives just under $1,000 a day. In calendar year 1980, both Mr Rofe and his assistant who, I believe, is Mr Arden, received from the Commonwealth in fees something over $140,000. We have a decision in the name of cost paring to dispense with public servants who, at the very top of the range-at permanent head status-will be paid over $1,000 a week. We know that there are only a handful of them and, I might add, they pay tax on that $1,000 a week. But the decision has been made to replace them with private consultants costing anything between $500 and $1,000 a day. In many cases, there is little doubt that tax on that money would be avoided in one way or another. There have been 32 of those decisions. It may well be that the additional costs incurred by the Commonwealth in transferring those functions to the private sector will cancel out the gross savings. </PARA>
<PARA> Eighteen functions are to be transferred to the States. Some of those functions-for example, women's refuges which required in the context of a Commonwealth Budget a very small allocation of $3m, which is about 0.01 per cent of total Commonwealth outlays-are to be transferred to the States. There is little doubt that some of the States will decline to fund those women's refuges-the consequence of that contemptible decision we have witnessed around Parliament House in the last couple of weeks. Those functions transferred compulsorily to the States and which the States do not decide to drop, will be financed by State taxes and charges which are inequitable, insofar as they are regressive, and will be inflationary. The functions transferred to the States include nuclear supervisory activities. Leaving aside the fact that this is in breach of several international treaties to which Australia is a party, the Commonwealth is proposing to transfer activities to eccentric Premiers, one of whom takes his medical advice from Milan Brych and his nuclear advice from Stephen Hogarth who says that he has a fusion reactor in the boot of a motor car producing hydrogen. The Commonwealth actually proposes to transfer nuclear supervisory activities to that government headed by a man who takes his medical advice from Milan Brych and his nuclear advice from Stephen Hogarth. That not only is irresponsibility but also verges on criminal irresponsibility. Although I suppose, given that the Prime Minister takes his economic and taxation advice from the make-up girl at a television studio, at enormous cost to the taxpayer, it is not inconsistent that he should decide to transfer nuclear supervisory obligations to the Premier of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> There were 39 decisions to amalgamate pre-existing boards and 81 decisions to terminate or reduce authorities and programs. Some of those decisions, of course, were eminently sensible, such as the decision to abolish the post of rabbit scalp or fox scalp collector in the Australian Capital Territory, especially since none have been presented to be examined for a couple of decades, or the decision to abolish the Balloon Launching Co-ordinating Committee. Not all of those decisions were irresponsible or unjustified. But as the honourable member for Canning, one of the Government's own back benchers, Mr Bungey, pointed out on 1 May on the radio program AM, to the extent that those 120 decisions, amalgamations, terminations, reductions and so on, were justified, they reflect upon pre-existing ministerial negligence. Why have the Ministers responsible for the Balloon Launching Co-ordinating Committee and the rabbit scalp collector position not abolished those sorts of positions in the past? If they were properly discharging their ministerial duties they would not have to be prodded into doing them by the political stunt people of the razor gang. </PARA>
<PARA> There were 15 decisions to sell assets, some of them Commonwealth assets. Some of them, although apparently unbeknown to Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) and other members of the razor gang, such as the Australian Wool Testing Authority are not Commonwealth assets in the true sense of the word. I will say more about that decision and will move an amendment in the Committee stages. There were 36 decisions to review functions. What that means is that they were the matters that were too hard. They were the matters on which the desires of the Liberal Party conflicted with those of the National Country Party whose Ministers were on the Committee, and those functions of which the Country Party was conscious. It is quite clear that the Minister for Primary Industry was so culpably negligent and so culpably fundamentally incompetent, that he did not grasp the implications of the sale of the Australian Wool Testing Authority. When it came to selling airports and flogging off some of the functions of Telecom Australia the Government was impinging on what the Country Party regards as heartland territory. There were 36 decisions to review and 13 decisions to allow the functions to remain as they are. </PARA>
<PARA> I remember the then Prime Minister being rightly ridiculed in 1971 or 1972 for saying: 'The Government has made a decision. The Government has decided to make no decision'. Prime Minister McMahon was ridiculed for that, but the present razor gang in effect said that 13 times. There are some truly absurd decisions in this list of 338 or 360 decisions-whatever the number is. There is the abolition of the Australian Plague Locust Commission. Unfortunately, locusts do not recognise the territorial imperatives of State governments and they do not stop at State borders. If ever there was an interstate problem requiring Commonwealth action it must be the problem of locust plague control. The Commonwealth has abolished the Australian Plague Locust Commission. The Australian Government Publishing Service is to have some of its activities transferred to the private sector, says one decision. Another decision says that the publishing activities of the Department of Defence will be transferred to the Australian Government Publishing Service. Did Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle ever actually look at those decisions in total? If she did, how does she explain such contradictory decisions being contained in the same report? The Curriculum Development Centre, which only six weeks before the Minister for Education, Mr Fife, was eulogising, is to be abolished. The Australia Post Courier service was to be abolished, so the report said. But if one scratches a little deeper one finds that it is to be replaced by the Australia Post parcel service which, so far as anyone could tell, affected only parcels that weighed more than about half a tonne and the colour of the vans. It was decided to keep the Australian Information Service in New Delhi, Mexico City and Vienna while shutting it down at such major overseas posts as London and Washington. The Commonwealth Council for Rural Research and Extension, set up only two years ago by the Government, is also to be abolished by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The report signalled the third change in eight months in depreciation rates applicable for investment by reducing the loading on depreciation rates from 20 per cent to 18 per cent. What that in fact means, and it is worth explaining just to demonstrate how trivial the decision was, is that last year a 20 per cent loading on depreciation rates was introduced pursuant to the Budget. An item of plant or equipment previously depreciable at 15 per cent per annum would be depreciable at 18 per cent per annum. As a result of the razor gang decision, that 3 per cent increase in annual depreciation rates is to be reduced by one-tenth, in other words by 0.3 recurring per cent. So instead of having a depreciation rate of 18 per cent for those items of equipment, the new depreciation rate will be 17.6 recurring per cent. That surely must be regarded not as fine tuning of the economy but as super-fine tuning. It ought to be regarded far more accurately as yet another political stunt. </PARA>
<PARA> We have already seen several backdowns arising mostly from the fundamental initial incompetence of the Minister for Primary Industry but also delving into other areas such as a modification of the decision to impose fees for second degrees, colleges of advanced education amalgamations and the Glebe housing estate in Sydney. The report was supported by reams of rhetoric about the Fraser Government's commitment to small government. The next day we received a very telling demonstration of how strong that commitment is when the Fraser Government, moved by ministerial fiat, decided to limit the trivial imports of canned ham into Australia because it was pressurised by a vocal but minuscule vested interest group. That is how the Fraser Government's real commitment to small government is. Never mind what the consequences of that decision might be for Australia's international trade in general. Whenever a minority makes a lot of noise and is in a position to apply pressure to the Country Party especially, the Fraser Government caves in and misuses its legislative and regulatory administrative powers to protect any noisy vested interest, providing that vested interest has some leverage on those two parties. Women's refuges do not come into that category. </PARA>
<PARA> Later in the last week or so we saw further evidence of the Fraser Government's phoney commitment to small government. We saw the twentieth century version of the old Tudor mercantilist chartered monopoly when chartered duopolies or oligopolies, reinforced by legislation, were handed out by this Government to pay off its political obligations to Rupert Murdoch with the two airlines agreement and the Broadcasting and Television Act amendments.</PARA>
<PARA> Again on the subject of small government, I mention that the major gross saving claimed by the Government will come from the projected reduction in the Public Service. I am not and have never been, nor has my party even been, an advocate of a bloated and superfluous Public Service; but, given the Government's decision to reduce the Public Service on cost saving grounds, it is ironic that simultaneously it should maintain trade and protectionist policies with a view to maintaining employment. The marginal cost of maintaining employment in the public sector is certainly lower than that of maintaining employment in the most highly protected industries. </PARA>
<PARA> One decision of the razor gang, which is partially related to that aspect and is incorporated in the legislation before us, is that of halving export incentive payments after mid-1982. One of the objectives of the generally protectionist policy of the Fraser Government is to discourage imports. Whether this Government is conscious of it or not, at least one of the effects of that policy is to provide a disincentive for exports. One wonders why a government would simultaneously provide, at the very great cost-if the Government were to be honest-of around $300m a year, a system of export incentives. One might wonder why a government which ostensibly is committed to small government should on the one hand apply a protectionist policy which provides disincentives for exports and on the other simultaneously apply a policy which provides incentives for exports-with two regiments of bureaucrats simultaneously administering schemes which have contradictory consequences, all in the name of small government. Of course, the Prime Minister is notorious for his penchant for assorted tax dodges for business investment, the underlying assumption of which is that governments are better able to judge than is private management the areas into which business investment should be directed and encouraged. That also is a repudiation of the fundamental tenet of small government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister is no disciple of Adam Smith, let alone of Ayn Rand or Friedrich von Hayek. His economic philosophy, if it could be dignified by such a name, is a crazy and innumerate mixture of physiocracy and mercantilism, of which the chartered duopolies and oligopolies which we have seen passing through this House are prime examples. They are straight from Tudor mercantilism and probably have similar sordid motives. </PARA>
<PARA> From this so called cost-cutting exercise there are many notable omissions. In fact, there is sacred territory on which the so called razor gang committee was instructed not to intrude. The one thing that those omissions have in common is that some of them, which I am about to enumerate, were the Prime Minister's pet projects and others were 1980 electoral bribes. I refer first to the proposed Northern Territory railway. A cost-benefit analysis shows that there will be no return for the capital outlay on the railway of $430m. In the meantime, foreign corporations are encouraged to come to Australia and take up equity in our profitable investment projects, on the ground that we have a shortage of domestic capital. If we recklessly fritter away domestic capital on such projects, we are likely to have a shortage of it forever. </PARA>
<PARA> Assorted pork barrelling commitments on airports, are to cost another $400m. The new Parliament House, the grand Fraser monument, is to cost, as was admitted just last week, in 1981 dollars $295m. The Commonwealth's commitment for the Burdekin Dam is to cost in 1981 dollars $121m. The Casey University, which was opposed by the parliamentary committee which studied it-the Joint Committee on Public Works-and almost certainly by a majority of Liberal Party members of parliament, is to cost $90m. The fuel storage rort, legislation for which I believe is to be introduced in the Senate tomorrow, if it achieves its objectives of inducing farmers, only, to store an emergency fuel reserve equivalent to six months consumption, will cost the country $70m. </PARA>
<PARA> The notorious film tax rort-the television make-up girl's economic policy which was taken over by the Prime Minister-is to impose a cost on revenue in the next financial year that is now admitted to be $30m. I hasten to add that initially the cost was given as $2m. We are told that that was the costing given by the industry. Does the Fraser Government propose to adopt the practice of accepting as the costing for any program that given by the industry which has a vested interest in it? Is the Treasury to be abolished? Is it a new government policy to cost programs on the basis of figures worked out by those who have a vested interest in them? If so, the razor gang should have sliced into the Treasury and removed about half of it. But of course that is not the policy of the Government. The fraudulent costing figure of $2m was adopted for purely political purposes before the last election so that the Prime Minister could prop up his sagging image of economic responsibility. In fact, he was committing the taxpayers to what was in its original form-I will be saying more about this subject tomorrow-an open-ended commitment for tax deferral by people who would never even had made a movie. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer next to the proposed $20m cost of the Boeing 707s, which represent the Prime Minister's greatest self-indulgence. The Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, the Prime Minister's ego trip, will cost $12m, not counting the postman missions on one of which Senator Carrick has left today to race around the world and try to con everybody into coming to the meeting in Melbourne. It is to be the Prime Minister's ego trip for 1981. According to recent Press reports, it will result in an additional cost of $90m in the form of foreign aid which will be the subject of a dramatic announcement by the Prime Minister at the conference. The Canberra motor race track, which hardly anyone even in Canberra wants, is to cost $2m, merely because the Prime Minister, along with other things, is a motor racing freak. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, though not quantitatively important, the Liberal Party propaganda unit which operates out of Senator Carrick's office in Sydney, among other places, and is called the Government Imformation Unit, is to be expanded at a cost of half a million dollars. I have not the time to mention some 50 other pre-electoral bribes. </PARA>
<PARA> The second Bill before us is the Income Tax (Assessment and Rates) Amendment Bill. Its principal purpose is to complete the Government's sell-out of personal tax indexation, which the Prime Minister in 1975 and beyond had promised would end the great tax revolt. The Prime Minister then referred to unindexed tax schedules as vast, unlegislated increases in taxation, as taxation by stealth, and so on. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I have a table from the Sydney Morning Herald of last Thursday which I will seek leave shortly to incorporate in Hansard. Prior to the suspension of the sitting I had just moved on to the Income Tax (Assessment and Rates) Amendment Bill, the major feature of which is the final repudiation of the Prime Minister's and the Government's solemn pledges of 1975 and beyond on personal income tax indexation. Of course, we have never had indexation. Despite the promises, we have had a shonky, corrupt and perverted form of indexation manipulated by the Government to impose secret increases in taxation but to a lesser extent than it will be imposing in the future following its final repudiation of indexation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One point ought to be established very clearly and that is that anything less than 100 per cent indexation-and, strictly speaking, indexation tied to wages and not the consumer price index-is, in fact, a real increase in tax. An increase in the proportion of income which will be paid in tax. The second effect of not indexing the taxation schedule is that it makes the schedule more regressive. At this stage, I seek leave to incorporate into Hansard a table prepared by Mr Collins of Macquarie University and published by the Sydney Morning Herald last week which shows that, in fact, for constant real incomes equivalent to $50,000 five years ago there has been a 3 per cent real reduction in taxation and an increase in real taxation of about one-third for the lowest income bracket. I foreshadow that I will move an amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Income Tax (Assessment and Rates) Amendment Bill. I seek leave to incorporate the table in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to refer to some of the matters reviewed by the Review of Commonwealth Functions committee. It seems to me that Senator Walsh has, to a large extent, missed the point of this review. He may have established today that he can count, but even that is open to some doubt. As I understand it, the main purpose of the Review of Commonwealth Functions was to get a direction of government activity more consistent with Liberal Party philosophy and, as the Minister for Finance, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, said in her second reading speech, to have more room for people to make their own choices. It also sought to eliminate unnecessary costs but financial purposes were not the main function of the review.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A number of the decisions that have been made do, in fact, have a particular impact on the Australian Capital Territory because of the extent to which government is so involved with the Australian Capital Territory. Perhaps the real answer to some of these problems is for the economy of the Territory to seek to diversify much further so that we can establish a broader commercial base and, to as great an extent as is possible, become freed from the effect of government decisions, become insulated more from government decisions. The government in Canberra has several roles. Of course, it is a federal government. It plays the role of State government and, in many of its functions, it is also local government. The Minister, in her second reading speech, dealt with the philosophy and details of the review. I will refer to just a few of the aspects. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government proposes to wind up the activities of the Canberra Commercial Development Authority and to direct the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) to take such steps as are necessary to do this-in effect, to sell the Belconnen shopping mall. Much taxpayers' money is tied up in this enterprise and, in my view, it is quite inappropriate for taxpayers' money to be tied up in this way. It is not a proper function of the Commonwealth Government to be involved as a landlord in such a retail enterprise. Certainly, the position of the tenants must be taken into account, but the Minister is authorised to set the terms and conditions of the sale. I have no doubt that he will have the interests of the tenants in mind when he sets the terms and conditions upon which the mall will be sold. Money will then be released which, as I have said, is taxpayers' money and which should be more properly used by government in other ways. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for the Capital Territory will also play a role in relation to the Canberra Retail Market Trust. He may direct the Trust to enter into an agreement for sale on such terms and conditions as he specifies. These markets have grown to have a very special place in the life of Canberra. The stall holders are independent traders who have added much colour and interest to the city as well as provided a service in selling their goods. I believe it would be a great pity if this were to change. In my view the markets, ideally, should be owned by a co-operative of the stall holders at the markets, should be free and independent as a co-operative and should not be owned by one person or company. I think a co-operative should be so structured that it cannot be taken over or dominated by one person or company. I would want the integrity, individuality and character of these markets to be maintained. They can be under the terms of this Bill and in a way that the Minister can stipulate. </PARA>
<PARA> A part of the Government's decision in this review is to reduce the size of the Public Service. This would need to be done in a way that is not, in my view, just a flat two per cent cut. I think there needs to be a review of the staffing formulas so that both in Canberra and in places where the Commonwealth has a presence in the States the greatest efficiency can be achieved and the greatest service to those who in fact fund the Commonwealth can be obtained. It may be that in many places the staff cuts will be greatly in excess of 2 per cent. As a result of this review, there may be some areas in which the staff cuts will be extremely high. Also, there may be other places where additional staff is needed. I would urge those in the Public Service responsible for reviewing this matter to see that this is done in a way that achieves the best possible result. </PARA>
<PARA> From the Australian Capital Territory's point of view, perhaps the most controversial area of the Review of Commonwealth Functions which relates to the Australian Capital Territory is contained in clause 90-a perhaps deceptively short clause which deregulates shopping hours; that is, allows shopping hours to respond to the needs of shoppers. No Liberal can really make out a case for the Commonwealth Government being for regulating shopping hours. As one telephone caller said to me, the Commonwealth Government should not interfere with shopping. Many issues have been raised by those involved and not all the reasons advanced for opposing the deregulation could possibly turn out to be correct. If the unions are correct in suggesting that the prices in the big stores will rise, surely the small traders would benefit and there would also be more flexibility for consumers. Whilst, in principle, I support the Government's decision, I am mindful of the concerns of the many small traders who have contacted me and of the problems that they perceive will flow as a result of the deregulation of shopping hours. I believe that small traders provide a friendly service which most shoppers appreciate and which cannot be matched by the type of trading of the big stores these days. </PARA>
<PARA> Shops, of course, have several purposes. The first is to provide an income for the owner. Secondly, shops provide employment and, also, they provide a service for customers. These three aspects must be kept in mind. It is my view that a deregulation of trading hours in the Australian Capital Territory would in fact attract shoppers to Canberra from surrounding districts. It may be that with deregulation there will be a few changes. The big stores may stay open a little longer, but there will be a continuing demand for the service and convenience that a small local store can offer. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no doubt that for Canberra to have shops open and people about will help to make it a more interesting city and a more interesting place for tourists to be. Tourists in those circumstances would spend more money in Canberra. However, in many respects Canberra is not a normal market place. It has large shopping centres. It has been structured under a philosophy that the National Capital Development Commission has introduced of large shopping areas and small neighbourhood areas. It is not the same as the major cities where, mostly, shops are established along roads, among houses and all over the place, and are not congregated as they are in Canberra. The geography of shopping centres here is quite different. I am very concerned about some of the worries which the small business community has expressed to me over these last few days. Equally, I have had callers urging that I support the earliest possible introduction of the deregulation of trading hours. These calls have come from some small traders and consumers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for the Capital Territory said last week that he would set up a committee to monitor the effects of deregulation. I urge him to go a little further than this and request the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory to inquire into and report on the matters relevant to the implementation of that decision. There are many other decisions throughout the Bill, all I believe consistent with the Government's philosophy of being less involved in decision making. The ones I have referred to are a few of those that are particularly relevant to the electorate which I represent. I repeat my request to the Minister for the Capital Territory that he pursue that one matter in the way I have suggested. </PARA>

It covers a whole range of things from agents and architects through co-operative societies, life insurance holding companies, the Landlord and Tenant Ordinance, rabbit destruction, sewerage rates to trading hours and whatever. In addition to matters affecting the Australian Capital Territory, the Bill contains 22 other headings, among which are the Australian Postal Commission, the Australian Wool Corporation, bankruptcy, the Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Act, the Housing Loans Insurance Corporation and so on.

I point out, with the greatest respect to the honourable senator for whom I do have a regard, that he was conspicuous by his absence from the chamber, particularly at 10 minutes to two this morning when we were debating the final stages of the Bill. The honourable senator did not make a contribution to the debate. I repeat that this mechanism of joining the functions of 22 or 23 departments under the one Bill is a dangerous precedent.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3V4">Senator CHIPP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Townley for his interjection. He asks why indeed. Let me give listeners to this broadcast a clue. On 12 September 1978 a well-known Australian, a leading politician, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have said that we wanted to end for all time the deceit of a tax system which, through the process of inflation, brought larger and larger funds to the coffers of government. We said that if governments wanted more funds they should tax for them openly and plainly. I would not want to be taking more and more from the people of Australia by the hidden process of inflation, and trying to pretend that taxes had not in fact been increased. </PARA>
<PARA>One might wonder who made that remarkably generous and statesmanlike statement. Of course it was Malcolm Fraser who did so, on 12 September 1978. He virtually said that the abolition of tax indexation was a deceit. He said anybody who did this would be a deceitful person. The following words were spoken by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) in the second reading speech on the Income Tax (Assessment and Rates) Amendment Bill:</PARA>
<PARA> Also dealt with is the announcement . . . that there is to be half-indexation of personal income tax for 1981-82, and that that year is to be the last year in which the system of tax indexation will apply. </PARA>
<PARA>That is spoken with the authority of the Prime Minister of Australia in June 1981. So in June 1981 we can afford to be deceitful. I do not think I transgress Standing Orders when I say that putting those two statements side by side proves beyond any shadow of doubt that the Prime Minister of this country is a deceitful man. </PARA>

I know the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs is itching to get on his feet to speak to it too. I am not using my words. 'Deceit' is not my word. The word 'deceit' is the word of the Prime Minister of this country, Malcolm Fraser. On 12 September 1978 he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have said that we wanted to end for all time the deceit of a tax system which, through the process of inflation, brought larger and larger funds to the coffers of government. </PARA>
<PARA>Then in June 1981 he said that that year, namely 1981-82, would be the last year in which the system of tax indexation would apply. The point I am making, Mr Acting Deputy President, is that in September 1978 the Prime Minister said that the abolition of tax indexation is a deceitful thing to do. Those were his words, not mine.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. I leave that subject to move on to other matters. I shall deal with why this legislation is being introduced now. Again, listeners to this broadcast might wonder: Why introduce, on the second last day of the sitting, a Bill covering 23 or 24 matters that affect different departments? Why bring it on when we met until 3 o'clock this morning and when, without a shadow of a doubt, we will meet until 3 o'clock or 4 o'clock tomorrow morning? Again, I hope I do not transgress the Standing Orders, Mr Acting Deputy President, but there was a party which did extraordinarily well at the last election on the slogan 'keep the bastards honest'. This legislation is an example of absolute deception and dishonesty. Mr Fraser knows that if this Bill, which breaks the promise made in regard to tax indexation, were to be introduced on 18 August or thereafter when the Government will not have control of the Senate, there is no way in the world that it would pass this Senate. That is the reason for its being before the Senate today. It affects 24 or 25 departments. That is why the galleries are jampacked with public servants advising the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume), who is at the table, on the 24 or 25 components of this Bill. I look forward with great anticipation to sitting in this place knowing that the Government cannot ram legislation connected with broken promises through the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Without making a great point of it, one might well ask in passing: Why do all senators on the Government back benches sit by and allow a promise made so overtly and in unmistakable language to maintain tax indexation to be broken? Why do they sit there now and allow this Bill to be passed without raising a voice in anger or in protest? It is not a small matter. Every person in Australia who earns income will be affected by this broken promise. The Labor Party and the Australian Democrats at this stage can do absolutely nothing about the situation. We will be swamped by the sheer weight of voting numbers. Government back bench senators have been told how to vote and to support this particular broken promise. One hopes that they can live happily with that situation. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the razor gang itself, I point to the blatant incongruity in the Prime Minister's opening remarks when he introduced the razor gang functions. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Review's starting point is that Australia's greatest asset is the Australian people . . . exercising their abilities, their skills, their imagination and their enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the things that leap out of the recommendations of the razor gang is the attempt to reintroduce fees for university courses for second degrees. The razor gang seemed to have inordinate pleasure in disadvantaging students and making life harder for them. Yet that situation sits rather unhappily with the Prime Minister's opening statement that our greatest asset is the Australian people, with their abilities and skills. On the question of education, which is not subject to this Bill, I mention in passing what the Government has done to the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme. It will make it even more difficult for tertiary students to undertake their education by reintroducing tertiary tuition fees. Whilst the Democrats do not encourage the concept of lifetime professional students, we disagree with a reintroduction of fees for second degree and post-graduate students. The rationalisation of councils of adult education is something that the Democrats would support, but not with the incredibly stupid haste with which the razor gang has recommended that it proceed. </PARA>
<PARA> In talking about incongruities, I would have thought that the thoughts of Senator Reid, who spoke before me and who represents the Australian Capital Territory, and my thoughts about the deregulation of trading hours would not be terribly different. I am unhappy to say that she will vote for the deregulation of shop trading hours. I, as a Democrat, will vote against deregulation. Like her, I share the concern of small shopkeepers. I share the worry of the consumers of Canberra. The prices they have to pay will undoubtedly increase as a result of this move. Like her I share the concern of shop employees who, if experience elsewhere proves correct here, will face casualisation of their industry and unemployment. But I, unlike Senator Reid, will vote against deregulation of shopping hours, not only for the reasons pertinent to Canberra but also because I believe that it will be the thin end of the wedge of something that will spread to other capital cities and other States. Make no mistake; the kind of lobby that is pushing for unlimited trading hours is that of big business and the American-owned retailers which can afford to operate for long hours, in the process driving the smaller traders out of business. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I ask: Why on earth is the Australian Wool Testing Authority, an independent, impartial, highly efficient body, being sold to the private sector? I even listened to Senator Walsh, who normally emits a great deal of wisdom about these things, to find a reason. I have not been given a good reason by the Government. I do not think that Senator Walsh has found a good reason for the Government's action or can even imagine one. It is the most stupid decision. I think I have received more correspondence and protests about this decision than I have received about any other decision for some time. I notice at least a habit that I am happy to see is growing in the House of Representatives. Two more members of the Liberal Party-Messrs Bungey and Burr-crossed the floor to vote against the measure. This is one of a number of cases in which the Government is pursuing a wrong-headed and counter-productive approach. I wish to quote from a telegram received from the Livestock and Grain Producers Association of New South Wales. I would have thought that it was hardly a rampant group of socialists. </PARA>

<PARA> The Government's justification for the 'razor gang' cuts appears to be based on the premise that the user must pay. In the case of AWTA this premise is not valid as the user does pay. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, the Government does not provide one cent in direct cash handouts to AWTA. At the same time, AWTA has been able to make profits over the last five years of about $1m per annum and hold its charges at about the 1970 level. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason for disposing of AWTA had to change and Mr Nixon has said that 'there is no longer a requirement for the Authority to have a link with the Government'. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> This 'link' provides the very basis of the wool industry's marketing system. All sectors of the industry have very strongly opposed the Government's present proposal. These objections are best summarised by the International Wool Textile Organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> Members of IWTO are strongly of the view that in its unique function between sellers and buyers, AWTA must be, and be seen to be, an official, independent and impartial body. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Nixon has further stated 'that the fundamental aim is to ensure that AWTA continues in precisely the same way as it does already'. 'We will establish a foundation' says Mr Nixon 'which will be designed by the industry itself.'</PARA>
<PARA> One thinks that the industry has already designed its own 'foundation' and that it already exists-namely AWTA. </PARA>
<PARA> No real argument has been put up by the Government as to why it is necessary to dispose of AWTA. This is particularly disturbing when there is the slightest possibility of doing damage to Australia's wool marketing system. </PARA>
<PARA> As woolgrowers, we are extremely concerned with the Government's proposal to dispose of AWTA. This concern has been conveyed to the Prime Minister by a large number of our members, apparently to no avail. </PARA>
<PARA>I ask the question once more: Why is it necessary to sell this independent and efficient enterprise to the private sector? I know that the Senate is pushed for time, hence I am about to conclude my remarks 11 minutes earlier than I need. Notwithstanding that, I appeal to one Government senator to get up here for five minutes or three minutes and explain why he will put his bottom on a seat on that side of the chamber when the division bells ring and honourable senators will be asked to support the Government on this measure. I do not think that that is an unreasonable request for a senator to make of a colleague. I ask one Liberal senator: Why is he supporting the Government in the selling of the Australian Wool Testing Authority?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over a period of weeks now we have been through the saga-if I could call it that-of the razor gang report but the Commonwealth Functions (Statutes Review) Bill 1981 gives legislative effect to some of the decisions of that body. I refer to one or two matters arising from the legislation and from questions which I would like to raise in the Senate today and which I have pursued since the report of the razor gang. Any honourable senator speaking in this place can set out a list, as Senator Chipp did, of extraordinarily bizarre decisions which were made by that group referring to measures which will, in fact, cost more than they will save, measures which will reduce the amount of information available to the Australian community and measures which will obstruct the machinery of government. Of course the worst thing about the razor gang report is that it is not what it purports to be. It is not an examination of the functions of government. It is an examination conducted on the basis of a cost cutting exercise irrespective of the functions of government and the functions of particular government departments. In that sense it is something of a travesty of government accountability because nowhere are we given any detailed reasons for the decisions which have been made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Chipp referred to bodies such as the Curriculum Development Centre and the decisions in relation to student fees and so on. Many more examples of that kind have been given in the Senate. We are handed a total figure which we are told is the saving from the razor gang report. There are no sums in terms of arithmetic and no balance sheet in terms of the functions of government. It is a very marked contrast to the extensive volumes of the Coombs report which one suspects has not been dipped into by this government since then. Since the review was handed down I have tried to find the answer to a number of questions, apart from the ones that we have asked in the chamber, which ought to have been supplied when this statement was first made. Some answers have been informative. They have revealed serious doubts about the Government's fitness to run a corner shop in relation to some of these matters, let alone the affairs of the country. For example, I asked: How would the abolition of the Nature Conservation Advisory Committee save money? The answer I received from the Minister was:</PARA>
<PARA> There are no significant savings as fees were not paid to committee members. </PARA>
<PARA>That body was abolished as part of a cost saving exercise. It was a committee which gave its services free to the Government. This is all done in the name of cost cutting. Other answers which I received reveal the poverty of the Government's decision making and the fact that it has nothing whatsoever to do with efficiency. For example, I will quote a further answer which states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Council for Rural Research and Extension in its annual report for 1979-80 says that: 'In principle, public resources should be devoted to research and extension to a level where the expected benefit of the last project funded is equal to the opportunity cost, that is the return if used in alternative investment.'</PARA>
<PARA>Since we are talking about competing philosophies that is the sort of principle upon which we argue a government should base its decisions. A very pertinent question to ask rhetorically is whether the Minister who gave that answer has considered whether that principle has been applied in abolishing that body, the Council for Rural Research and Extension. The answer is clearly no. It was not acting on that principle of government. The most disgraceful answer that I have received, in answer to questions, comes from the Treasurer (Mr Howard) regarding the abolition of various statistical collections. What I wanted to be convinced about, as a member of this Parliament, was the reasons and evidence given for each of those decisions being correct, namely that they were responsible Government conduct. I did not receive any argument, any evidence or anything for which I had specifically asked in the question relating to the figures compiled by the Australian Bureau of Statistics and the discontinuance of those functions as a result of the Review of Commonwealth Functions, the so-called razor gang. What I sought was information about why a number of sets of statistics were being abolished and what assurances could be given that none of the groups which were affected by the abolition of those statistics would be disadvantaged by the lack of information. The question went to one and a half pages and the answer given by the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) to (10) The collections referred to are considered to be of low priority and are being discontinued in order to reduce the costs incurred by the Australian Bureau of Statistics and by those who supply the information to the Bureau. </PARA>
<PARA>I hazard a guess that it is only the Fraser Government, which purports to govern in what might euphemistically be called a modern democracy, which can arrive at decisions of importance relating to government without the benefit of statistics. I mention one case. One of the so-called big issues in this Parliament-insofar as there are big issues in this Parliament-is the question of how to handle the resources boom which was part of the pre-election advertising, if I can call it that, of the Government parties and which has since become a matter of relatively serious discussion in the Parliament. One of the essential tools, one would have thought, for handling the resources boom in the context of the current problems of Australian manufacturing industry and unemployment would be information about unemployment in regional areas of Australia. That information will no longer be available. I raise the matter again today because as a Victorian senator the fact that that information will no longer be available is of the utmost concern to people in the provincial cities of Victoria at Ballarat, Bendigo and Geelong. Those three cities can be duplicated across Australia in terms of the importance of the information on regional employment figures in those areas. </PARA>
<PARA> But one would have thought that any government, even the Fraser Government with the touch of magic which it seems to have of 'now you see it, now you don't' in terms of its stated philosophies and its actions, would have needed this sort of information and material if it intended to do anything about handling this matter in an appropriate way in terms of distribution of resources and job opportunities throughout Australia. The unemployment statistics for provincial regions in this country will simply no longer be available. From the answer which I received I would single out that matter as being of the utmost concern. I inform the Minister that I have a commitment to pursue this matter on behalf of the people in those provincial country towns who are represented through their councils and I will continue to do so because it is an absurd neglect of their long term interest that those figures will no longer be available. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter with which I want to deal relates to Part III of the legislation which deals with Australia Post. In the original razor gang report, there appeared this sentence: 'Australia Post Courier service to be abolished'. After a while it was clear from public pronouncements by Australia Post and by the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) that the announcement should have read 'Australia Post Courier vans to be repainted and to be forbidden to carry double beds, elephants and things of that kind'-large items of cargo, for want of a better word. That was the position as at a fortnight ago. Australia Post effectively was to be renamed and to be forbidden to carry large items of furniture and so on. That was done, let me hazard a calculated guess, at the instigation of companies like Thomas Nationwide Transport Ltd which have been diligent in their pursuit of government work. The whole of the TNT complex has been diligent in the pursuit of government work whether it be in relation to Telecom, the airlines, film production or whatever. But, in relation to the Australia Post Courier service, there is no doubt that heavy representations were made by companies such as that in connection with the work done by that service. </PARA>
<PARA> I just want to make the point that it now appears that a large number of drivers employed by this service are likely to lose their jobs. What happened was that the razor gang made that benign sort of statement which was interpreted as meaning that the name of the service was to be changed and there was to be a slight alteration to its functions. Australia Post then put out a circular stating that the courier services would be operating as usual subject to these slight changes. That seems to have annoyed the Government. It now appears that many more major changes will be made. I just remind the Senate that about one-quarter of the business of the Australia Post Courier service is for the Commonwealth Employment Service. The Courier service takes notices to the doors of unemployed persons-various documents for the CES such as claim forms and so on. All these tasks have upgraded the CES work. It is very interesting to note that it has been demonstrated by the CES as a result of seeking quotations from rivals that the Australia Post Courier service has been able to provide these services more efficiently and more cheaply than private enterprise would have been able to do. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australia Post Courier service operates profitably. Its sin is not one of loss making. It is an efficient organisation. Its offence is to have competed efficiently and successfully with private operators. I make the point again, again and again and I will continue to make it as other honourable senators on this side of the Parliament will continue to make it also that the Australia Post Courier service provides a provincial service, a country service, as well as an intra-city service. Very few private operators are interested in taking on country services or provincial services of one kind or another which have been handled by Australia Post. Australia Post provides a service to rural areas, combining mail deliveries with other courier services. The result of cutting Australia Post out of that courier market will inevitably be that those services will decline in quality. The private operators do not make profits out of country runs. </PARA>
<PARA> I again come to the question which we have debated here on several occasions in the last few weeks, that is, the simple question of what is the function of a public service. Let us look at instrumentalities such as Australia Post, Telecom, Trans-Australia Airlines and so on. Trans-Australia Airlines runs services to the north of Tasmania and the outback areas of Queensland which no private operator would take on. The first reaction of the chairman of TAA when he heard the airline was going to be sold was: 'Good, we will not have to run those unprofitable Fokker services to outback Queensland any more'. That remark drew a slow roar of pain from the members of the National Country Party who have all the qualities of the dinosaur; that is, if one sticks a pin in the tail the message takes a week to reach the brain. When this information in relation to TAA reached the brain of the National Country Party, there was a slow roar of pain and some of its members expressed concern about it. </PARA>
<PARA> The same thing happened in respect of Telecom. The proprietors of a number of large companies in Australia have been looking at the work of Telecom with greedy eyes. Why? The reason is that Telecom is a profitable government instrumentality and a very successful government instrumentality. It is the only organisation in Australia which, if I might say so, has not increased its prices since 1975. No corner-store or emporium in the private sector can make that claim. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In country areas, that is right. The only organisation which has not increased its prices since 1975 is attracting the attention of entrepeneurs who want to take over its most profitable work. They are not concerned about taking over the $214m, I think it was, which Telcom appropriated last year to subsidise the country telephone network. Exactly the same sort of remark can be made about many public instrumentalities which have received the benefits of the so-called razor gang attention-this committee of hard-headed businessmen, I do not think-which looked at these matters. The same, of course, can be said, as I mentioned, about the Australia Post Courier service. Precisely the same sort of argument applies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I just touch on those two matters which again are examples of the stupidity of this committee in terms of not looking at government functions from the point of view of efficiency, not looking at government functions from the point of view of the function of government in relation to the delivery of services to the Australian people, but looking at it in a totally ideological way as part of a political stunt which the razor gang is. For those reasons, the Opposition opposes this legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on this matter basically, I suggest, for one reason. My opinion is that the results of the efforts of the razor gang will hit hardest of all the third largest provincial city in Victoria, namely, Bendigo which has a population of some 64,000. Bendigo will possibly lose its ordnance factory and it will definitely lose its engineering faculty at the Bendigo College of Advanced Education. I believe that the Fraser Government will rue the day when it introduced that aspect of the report that relates to Bendigo because the Liberal Party--</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SO7">Senator PRIMMER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Particularly Mr Bourchier. Certainly the Labor Party is very much aware that Mr Bourchier holds the seat of Bendigo by a very slender thread-some 1 1/2 per cent. As a result of the report, some 650 jobs are in jeopardy at the ordnance factory. If one multiplies that by whatever the factor might be to estimate the voting strength of those people, I suggest that the Liberal Party can forget Bendigo as a winnable seat at the next election. This action is a shameful display of blatant politics by a Government that for years has pretended that it cares about country people, that it knows what goes on in the countryside, that it cares about students and is hell bent, in talk anyhow, on a resources boom.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer firstly to the Bendigo Ordnance Factory. Last week in this Parliament we were visited by a delegation of some 15 or 16 citizens from Bendigo and its environs. The delegation comprised representatives of the City Council itself and adjacent shire councils, people from the college and workers at the Bendigo Ordnance Factory-a variety of people who were concerned about their future and the future of the city of Bendigo. I have some sort of personal relationship with that city. It is 39 years since I formed that relationship with the city of Bendigo. It is an ongoing relationship and to me Bendigo is, I suppose, a second home. I know what makes the heart of Bendigo tick and one of those ticks is the Bendigo Ordnance Factory. It seems that the decision by the Government to do away with the Bendigo Ordnance Factory came about as a result of the Eltringham report. Yet when the delegates from Bendigo spoke to Sir Phillip Lynch some time back and sought a copy of the Eltringham report, they were told that it was confidential. So much for open government, Fraser style! To my mind, there is no reason why the Government should not have been prepared to produce the Eltringham report to show the people of Bendigo why the Government had made this decision; but the Government has not been prepared to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> We all realise that we are in the straight of this session and, as a result, the whips are out. I have been told that if I speak for more than 10 minutes some people will not buy me a beer tonight. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Evans" NAMEID="VD4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SO7">Senator PRIMMER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Someone said 'or ever'. That may be a godsend. I think it is pertinent to note some of the factors concerning the Bendigo Ordnance Factory. The factory was established in 1941 as a manufacturing support for the Armed Services during World War II. During that period it was engaged in the manufacture and reconditioning of six-inch and eight-inch naval guns, the manufacture of four-inch gun mountings for merchant ships, torpedo air vessels and a wide variety of equipment for the Army. In the post-war reconstruction period, the factory played a major role in the building of weapons such as propulsion machinery for the Australian built Battle and Daring class destroyers and Type 12 frigates. The manufacture of 4.5 twin RP.41 Mark 6 gun mountings and propulsion gearboxes for the vessels was a major contribution to the Royal Australian Navy's modernisation program. There is a list of the achievements of that establishment set out in this paper which I will seek leave to incorporate later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In order to get the message across without taking up too much time I will just say that, aside from the defence work this establishment has conducted since 1941, it has also been responsible for a large amount of work in private enterprise. Anybody who was privileged to go through that establishment can only be proud of the establishment itself and of the management, the workers and the staff generally. One should also point out that one of its other great contributions to engineering in Australia is the fact that at present the establishment has on staff some 120 apprentices. I suggest that if this establishment is passed over to private enterprise, many of those apprentices can forget that they ever belonged to the Bendigo Ordnance Factory. The ratio of apprentices to tradesmen will drop rather alarmingly. One is also concerned, if the establishment is passed over to private enterprise, about what will happen to some of the equipment in the factory. Only in recent years has there been installed in that factory one of the most modern lathes in Australia, perhaps in the southern hemisphere. What will happen if the private entrepreneur who purchases the place strips that away from the plant and takes it elsewhere? It must surely detract from the employment opportunities and the capabilities of that establishment. </PARA>
<PARA> Just to show the sorts of double standards of this Government and, in particular, one of its members that we are all immune to by now-but it does rankle some of us-I quote from the Bendigo Advertiser of 25 September 1980, which, one will recall, was just prior to the last federal election. An article in that newspaper states:</PARA>
<PARA> About $9 million was likely to be spent at the Bendigo Ordnance Factory between 1981 and 1985, according to the Federal Member for Bendigo, Mr John Bourchier. </PARA>
<PARA> Planning within the Department of Productivity would ensure that the Ordnance Factory would have an increasing role in Australia's overall defence preparedness, he said. </PARA>
<PARA>I will not go on to quote the rest of the article but, as I said, it just goes to show the double standards of this Government and at least one of its members-promising the world to the Ordnance Factory and to the citizens of Bendigo. They did so just two or three weeks prior to the last federal election, yet within six months, the same member, Mr Bourchier, was prepared to allow that establishment in Bendigo to be taken apart by private enterprise and any work that the Government may like to do will have to be sent to another defence establishment at Maribyrnong. That is another matter concerning which I would like to incorporate information later in my speech. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting to note, while this Government is doing this, the words of Sir Laurence Hartnett, one of the great Australians. I suppose there are a lot of great Australians but surely one of them would be Sir Laurence Hartnett. He is one of those men who were thrown into the breach in the dark days of the late 1930s and the early 1940s when this country was threatened. In the June 1981 edition of the Pacific Defence Reporter, Sir Laurence Hartnett makes one or two very pertinent points. Again, in the interests of time, I will not read the whole article, but he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Apparently we in Australia cannot learn a lesson-to which I refer our experience in the last war when our ability to produce a wide range of armaments and military equipment saved the day for us. </PARA>
<PARA>He goes on to point out:</PARA>
<PARA> Prior to Pearl Harbor, Australia had been at war for two years. The United States vigorous neutrality even prevented transmission of mail through the States if such mail dealt with armaments and, in particular, drawings of such armaments. </PARA>
<PARA> Ball and roller bearings nearly brought us to a halt, but we quietly set up manufacturers. </PARA>
<PARA>So he goes on. The portent of his letter is that we were caught once with our pants down and that as a result we established a perfectly viable defence establishment in a provincial city in Victoria. This Government is now prepared to do away with it. I note also that in this letter Sir Laurence Hartnett said:</PARA>
<PARA> I fully concur and fully support Sir Keith Shann in his article, 'Build Our Defences and Hang the Cost' in the April issue of Pacific Defence Reporter. </PARA>
<PARA>We have a Prime Minister who has talked continually about the threat to this country, about the alleged presence of Soviet vessels in the Indian Ocean and about the downward thrust of Chinese communism or some other form of communism. That man has preached that dogma ever since I have known him; yet he is prepared to get rid of one of the finest defence establishments in this country. It does not ring true. Like so much else of Malcolm Fraser's character, there is a hollow ring somewhere. He says one thing but he does another. </PARA>
<PARA> I now refer rather briefly to the loss in the same city of the engineering faculty at the Bendigo College of Advanced Education. Whilst the Government was doing this, I was very interested to read in the Melbourne Age of last Monday, under the heading 'Monday Job Market', an article entitled 'Plenty of jobs for graduates in engineering'. The article, which quotes the Dean of Engineering at Monash University, states:</PARA>
<PARA> More than 10,000 well paid positions will go to overseas job seekers unless Australians come forward, according to the Dean of Engineering at Monash University, Professor Lance Endersbee. </PARA>
<PARA> Professor Endersbee said there would be a great demand for engineers in Australia during the next few years, and if young people continued to ignore the profession local and overseas companies would recruit elsewhere for jobs that often started a graduate on about $25,000 a year. </PARA>
<PARA>That is another article that I will seek leave later to have incorporated in Hansard. This Government has always loudly proclaimed, particularly around election time, its great support for people in rural areas. I fail to understand why such a government, making that sort of proclamation, would want to do away with a perfectly viable engineering institute in a provincial city, an institute which is available to students of engineering from the whole of the north and the north-west of Victoria-from Shepparton, Echuca, Swan Hill, Mildura-all the Mallee. This faculty provides an opening for those students. What are Mr Lloyd and Mr Fisher thinking at the moment? By supporting this sort of legislation, they are denying the sons and I suggest one or two daughters in their own electorates-I do not know whether the female gender is involved in engineering these days; there is no reason why it could not be, in my view-engineering educational opportunities. They, being representatives of country areas, would well know the cost in fares and accommodation to which they would put the parents of any future engineering students in that region of Victoria. It seems to me that future students who might once have gone to the Bendigo institute will have to go to Melbourne. One can only hope that the supporters of the National Country Party and the Liberal Party in that region will do a little deep thinking about this and realise that by the deletion of these establishments in Bendigo the Government has done a great deal of harm not only to the present generation of workers and citizens in that fair city but also to future generations. </PARA>
<PARA> I have spoken longer than my Whip suggested I should. Finally, I shall quote a letter which I received from a man who served for many years as a faithful member of the National Country Party in western Victoria and who, because of some double dealing and chicanery in that party three or four years ago, opted out and is probably now voting Labor or, if not, is politically neutral. It is a letter dated 31 May that he wrote to the Prime Minister. Of course, living in that part of Victoria he knows the Prime Minister fairly well; so he addressed the letter 'Dear Malcolm'. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> As our Member for Wannon, your Government's decision to practise economies deserves some commendation, although its belated implementation and your Cabinet's confusion of priorities do not, when applied to the wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA> With other woolgrowers in your electorate, I object strongly to the proposed sale of the Australian Wool Testing Authority to private interests. Such a decision is stupid and foolish and is contrary to all sections of the wool industry and trade. e.g. </PARA>
<PARA> (1) It runs at a profit. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) Two commercial firms at wooltesting have failed during the past 15 years.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) At present, the AWTA has served the wool industry faithfully and well, and is a key part of a reputable marketing system accepted by overseas trade. </PARA>
<PARA> (4) It is funded by Australian woolgrowers, is commercially viable, and costs the Government nothing. </PARA>
<PARA>In view of these facts, you would be well advised to reverse the decision of the proposed sale of A.W.T.A. Forget the cosmetic face saving antics of the Ministers concerned, and make a statesmanlike decision to leave it as it is. I trust and pray that commonsense will prevail. </PARA>
<PARA>I am, Yours sincerely, LIN CAMERON</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, anyone who trusts the present Prime Minister would pray forever and it would not matter a continental damn. I will leave the matter at that. I believe, as I said originally, that the Government will not hold the seat of Bendigo after the next Federal election. That is patently clear. These cuts are a very regrettable move. They will do a great deal of damage to hundreds and perhaps thousands of people in that central northern area of Victoria. They are a crying shame. I guess any Australian who, from this day on, falls for any of the propaganda that the Liberal Party puts out about decentralisation and caring for country people is nothing more than a fool. Mr President, I seek leave to have those documents that I mentioned incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The documents read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>BRIEF HISTORY AND STATUS OF THE ORDNANCE FACTORY, BENDIGO</PARA>
<PARA>The Ordnance Factory, Bendigo, is part of the Commonwealth Department of Industry and Commerce, an Australian Government owned and operated manufacturing establishment, engaged in the manufacture of capital equipment for the Army, Navy, Air Force, and Commercial Industry, as and when required. </PARA>
<PARA> It may be regarded as a well equipped general engineering plant. </PARA>
<PARA> The Factory was established in 1941 as a manufacturing support for the Armed Services during World War II, and during that period was engaged in the manufacture and reconditioning of 6 inch and 8 inch Naval Guns, manufacture of 4 inch gun mountings for merchant ships, torpedo air vessels, and a wide variety of equipment for the Army. </PARA>
<PARA> In the post war reconstruction period, the Factory played a major role in the building of weapons and propulsion machinery for the Australian built Battle and Daring Class Destroyers and Type 12 Frigates. </PARA>
<PARA> The manufacture of 4.5 inch Twin RP.41 Mk 6 and 6* Gun Mountings and Propulsion Gearboxes for the vessels were major contributions to the Royal Australian Navy's modernisation program. </PARA>
<PARA> Other major service programs undertaken included the manufacture of 120mm Recoilless Anti-Tank Guns, overhaul of Tanks for the Army, refurbishment and modernisation of Anti-submarine Mortars, Torpedo Tube Mountings, Bofors Twin Gun Mountings, 4.5 inch Twin Gun Mountings, etc. for the Navy. </PARA>
<PARA> In-situ major overhaul of ships' propulsion machinery is also undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA> O.F.B. played a major role in the manufacture of the Ikara Missile Handling System. </PARA>
<PARA> Spares requirements for the Services are regularly produced, including the manufacture of a variety of medium calibre gun barrels. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent years, Service type work has included the manufacture of ships' propeller shafting, controllable pitch propeller hubs, 500 lb Bombs, 7.62mm Ammunition Links and Charger Clips, F.111 Aircraft Tooling, Trailers, etc. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1946, a large variety of Commercial and Government Instrumentality work has been undertaken covering the light, medium and heavy engineering fields. </PARA>
<PARA> Typical major achievements include: 500 ton Steelworks Ladle Cranes, Gearboxes for a variety of applications, Valves, Hoists and Gates for hydro-electrical schemes; Cement Kilns; Ball, Rod, and Autogenous Mills, Mine Winders; Bridge Girders; Pressure Vessels; Steel Tubes for Off-shore Oil Drilling Rigs; Carpet Making Machinery, equipments for the Oil Refining and Aluminium Industries, Motor Car Body Framing Gates for the Automobile Industry, Ships' Propeller Shafting, Marine Diesel Engine Components, Steel Rolling Mill Tables, Conveyors, Freight Containers, Hammer Mills, Tractor Components, Presses, Bucket Wheel Dredger Crawlers and Components, and a host of other things too numerous to mention. </PARA>
<PARA> O.F.B. has a separately managed Quality Assurance Department, independent of manufacturing, which is approved to Level 2, equivalent to Australian Standards 1821-1823-1975, Department of Defence (US) Mil Standard 1-45208A, and Ministry of Defence (U.K.) DEF-STAN-05-24. </PARA>
<PARA> Delegation of Inspection is granted to O.F. Bendigo by Defence (Army) and Defence (Navy). </PARA>
<PARA> Surveillance inspection is performed by resident Service Inspectorates. </PARA>
<PARA> The Quality Assurance Department offers excellent protection to non-service customers. </PARA>
<PARA> The integrity of measuring equipment is assured by the NATA approved Metrology Department. </PARA>
<PARA> Material control and welding process control is assured by a NATA approved Metallurgical and Chemical Laboratory, which is staffed by qualified professional officers. All methods on non-destructive testing are available. </PARA>
<PARA>General</PARA>
<PARA> Bendigo is a provincial city located approximately 100 miles from Melbourne in the State of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> The present population of Bendigo is 64,560. </PARA>
<PARA> During the historical days of the Bendigo Gold Rush, the place where the Factory now stands was the site of a Chinese community camp which in the late 1930s was substantially levelled off for the construction of a proposed aerodrome. The sole relic of the past is a Chinese Joss House near the main entrance to the Factory-the Joss House has been restored to much of its former splendour by the National Trust and now attracts a large number of tourists. </PARA>
<PARA> The Factory has a total area of 91 acres (30.4 Hectares) of land and, in all, the buildings which provide work-shop, store, and office space cover 12 acres (39,722 square metres). </PARA>
<PARA> The employment level is generally around the 650 mark. It will be appreciated that the Factory makes a substantial contribution towards the stability of the economy of the Bendigo District. </PARA>
<PARA> The workforce is particularly stable. </PARA>
<PARA> The Factory employs people in a wide variety of categories such as professional engineers, industrial chemists, metallurgists, draftsmen, technical officers and assistants, accountants, clerks, typists, accounting machinists, data processing operators, foremen, tradesmen, riggers, cooks, storemen, boiler attendants, gardeners, cleaners, crane drivers, truckdrivers and labourers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Factory has a continuing need for highly skilled tradesmen, and to satisfy this need relies mainly on training its own apprentices to the high standard of workmanship required. We take 20 to 30 apprentices each year, the majority of whom enter the trade of Fitting and Machining. </PARA>
<PARA> The trades of Fitting and Machining, Toolmaking, Boilermaking-Welding, Electrical Fitting, Electrical Mechanic, Carpentry and Joining, Signwriting, Heat Treatment, Patternmaking, and Sheet Metal Working are taught by experienced instructors under ideal workshop conditions. Initially, the training begins in the Apprentice Training Section and there lads are taught the basics of their trade, as well as safe working habits. As their training advances, the apprentices gain experience in each section of the production shops associated with their trade. </PARA>
<PARA> Opportunities exist for tradesmen with skill and ambition to progress to higher trade positions, such as inspectors who check the work of other tradesmen, and also to foremen and technical staff positions. Exceptional tradesmen can even advance to professional engineering positions by undertaking and completing diploma courses at the Bendigo Institute of Technology or other Institutes. </PARA>
<PARA> Whatever spare manufacturing capacity is available is devoted to making all kinds of products for commercial enterprises, and it is a matter of record that major equipments made at Ordnance Factory, Bendigo, are operating large industrial installations in nearly every state in Australia and overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> The principal material used in fabrication and machining work here is steel, almost all of which is Australian made, although in recent years more and more specialised non-ferrous materials are being used. Only minor quantities of special materials for which no Australian capacity exists are imported from overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> We consider that the Factory as equipped today is among the most modern engineering factories in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>ASSESSMENT OF THE ECONOMIC CONTRIBUTION OF THE BENDIGO ORDNANCE FACTORY TO THE BENDIGO COMMUNITY</PARA>
<PARA>The Present Status of the Factory</PARA>
<PARA> The factory, a part of the Commonwealth Department of Industry and Commerce, manufactures a wide range of capital equipment for Australia's defence forces whilst also providing a number of services to the private enterprise industrial sector. The plant is the largest individual engineering works in the region and plays a vital role in maintaining the economic well-being of the Bendigo community. The following analysis attempts to summarise the influence of the factory upon the local economy. </PARA>
<PARA>(i) Relative importance</PARA>
<PARA>Population of BendigoOrdnance factory employment64,560650</PARA>
<PARA> In a country community the continued well-being of an installation of this size represents a crucial factor in community confidence as applied to the economic future. Since the Ordnance workforce represents 2.8 per cent of the total district workforce of 23,144 persons, the maintenance of productive activity at the current level has a variety of implications upon the local economy. </PARA>
<PARA>(ii) Employment/the work force</PARA>
<PARA> The work force at the plant has, over a long period, gradually been forged into a large pool of skilled personnel, a situation which the present crisis threatens. Should the Federal Government proceed with its stated policy of selling the factory to private enterprise the interim period of negotiation has the potential to exert a detrimental influence upon the factory. </PARA>
<PARA> One reason why skilled personnel are attracted to an organisation like the Ordnance applies to the 'attractive' working conditions (especially in terms of continuity of employment) usually associated with government employment. Questions which require answers in this regard include:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) If the sale goes ahead now can the Government guarantee to a prospective purchaser(s) that one of the major resources, the skilled work force, will still be there when the takeover is complete? Surely the highly skilled, the experienced, the qualified staff members, in a period of uncertainty will react by seeking out, and moving into, employment opportunities elsewhere?</PARA>
<PARA> (b) What provision is to be made for accrued benefits relating to the existing work force? Will a private enterprise employer be allowed to register his employees with the Commonwealth Superannuation Scheme? If not, do all employees, regardless of age, stage of health, have to buy their way into some new scheme, if available?</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Will existing accrued long service leave, sick pay be transferrable into the private enterprise situations?</PARA>
<PARA>(iii) Wages and salaries</PARA>
<PARA> Currently, the wage and salary bill paid to Ordnance employees amounts to $8.9m per annum. On the basis of our own analysis and Victorian government research on this topic we believe that the net impact of such a wage bill is best explained by multiplier analysis. </PARA>
<PARA> Economic multipliers provide an approximate indication of the ultimate increase (or decrease) in income (or whatever is being analysed) as a result of a given input. In this instance we estimate that a multiplier of 1.5 is reasonable, that an extra 50c income is generated through the community as a result of the expenditure of $1 in income in wages paid to Ordnance workers. After deducting 20 per cent of the wage bill in taxes paid by Ordnance personnel the 1.5 multiplier would indicate that the factory creates an income flow within the region of at least $13.4m per year. </PARA>
<PARA>(iv) Supplies</PARA>
<PARA> Although accurate data is not available it is worth mentioning that an additional income flow arises out of the value of supplies purchased within the region by the Ordnance. It is estimated that $150,000 is spent annually in the local economy. To this extent every dollar spent on supplies should also be multiplied by 1.5 and added to the aforementioned estimate of the income flow representing $225,000 annually. </PARA>
<PARA>(v) Employment</PARA>
<PARA> Bendigo region is currently one of Australia's higher unemployment areas-any downturn in activity at the Ordnance has the potential to accentuate the problem (or alternatively, any increase, which is not an impossibility) will alleviate it. </PARA>
<PARA> Using multiplier analysis again, every job lost will have the influence, within the region, of reducing employment opportunities by an additional .5 of a job. </PARA>
<PARA>(vi) Population</PARA>
<PARA> Based upon a population multiplier of 3.2 times employment (i.e. if one worker is influenced by this decision, an additional 2.2 people, his dependants, will also be involved) the closure of a factory of this size has the potential to influence 2,080 people. Since the Ordnance Factory work force tends to be a relatively young one this multiplier figure (since it relates to the entire State) probably represents an understatement. </PARA>
<PARA> Other influences upon the surrounding community which relate to Ordnance Factory activity but which we have not been able to quantify relate to:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The effect upon those firms which have work done there if the service was not available-their costs would increase. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. If a large number of people were forced out of employment this would reduce government tax revenues while increasing welfare payments-an increase in government expenditures?</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Defence related work, if continued at the Ordnance Factory under private enterprise, would cost the taxpayer more than is currently charged and so would result in an increase in Australia's defence expenditures. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. The Ordnance Factory plays a decisive role in apprenticeship programs-would a private employer be as co-operative? A major point in a city with a severe youth unemployment problem. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. The factory also does work for State government instrumentalities-would private enterprise be prepared to do such work at similar costs? If not, would it increase State Government expenditures if the Ordnance Factory's current facilities were unavailable?</PARA>
<PARA>BRIEF HISTORY AND STATUS OF THE ENGINEERING FACULTY AT THE BENDIGO COLLEGE OF ADVANCED EDUCATION</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Engineering courses in Bendigo date back to the early days of the Bendigo School of Mines &amp; Industries, which was founded in 1873 and was one of the first institutions in Victoria to produce professional engineers. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. Professional engineering courses developed rapidly after the School of Mines and Industries became the Bendigo Institute of Technology in the late 60's and early 70's, reaching a peak of 174 students in 1973 with a first year intake of 69 students. Engineering was the strongest school in the Bendigo Institute of Technology and was the first to be accommodated in new buildings on the Edwards Road campus. There were absolutely no doubts about its economic viability at that time. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. Following the upsurge of unemployment in 1974-75, which had a significant effect on employment opportunities for engineers, there was a drop in engineering enrolments throughout Victoria in 1976. This drop was especially marked in Bendigo where it seemed to be combined with a statistical fluctuation to give a new intake of only 23 students. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. In 1977 the Victorian Government set up a Committee of Enquiry into Post-Secondary Education under the Chairmanship of Professor Partridge. The Partridge Committee in turn appointed a sub-committee to look specifically at engineering, under the Chairmanship of Mr S. F. Newman. This sub-committee became responsible for the production of Chapter 5 of the Partridge Committee's Report on Engineering Education and Training. Although the Engineering Sub-committee of the Partridge Committee claims in an appendix to Chapter 5 of the Report that 'the Chairman and other members' visited the Bendigo 'Institute' of Advanced Education, amongst other institutions, in carrying out its investigations, this claim is, to say the least, misleading. The only member of the Engineering Sub-committee to visit Bendigo was the Chairman, Mr S. F. Newman, who was a member of the main Committee proper, and who came to Bendigo in company with some other members of that Committee on 19 July 1977. This group spent no more than 2 1/2 hours in the Conference Room on the Osborne Street Campus, during which time they conducted five interview sessions with members of the College Council, senior academic and administrative staff, academic staff, teaching staff from the TAFE Division of the College (Bendigo Technical College) and students. The group declined an invitation to visit the Edwards Road campus (where the engineering facilities are established) and raised no questions about engineering, except concerning the interface between courses offered in the TAFE Division and those offered in the Advanced Education Division. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. The Partridge Committee's report was produced early in 1978 and Chapter 5 recommended the phasing out of professional engineering courses from the Bendigo College of Advanced Education from the beginning of 1979. This recommendation appeared to be based on three factors-</PARA>
<PARA> (i) an alleged surplus of engineering graduates-concluded from a survey of the employment records of Monash University graduates, but taking no account of the almost 100 per cent employment record of Bendigo graduates. </PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the small intake into Bendigo courses-based on the extremely low 1976 intake, but ignoring the recovery to 44 in 1977 and 49 in 1978. Incorrect figures were used in referring to the number of final year students at Bendigo between 1972 and 1977. </PARA>
<PARA> (iii) the low graduation rates at Bendigo-based on completely incorrect figures, e.g. 24 instead of 32 in 1975 and 20 instead of 45 in 1976. </PARA>
<PARA> 6. Inaccuracies and illogicalities in the Partridge Committee recommendations on engineering were pointed out to Education Minister Thompson and the Government agreed not to accept these recommendations, but asked the proposed Victorian Post-Secondary Education Commission to carry out a further study on engineering education in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> 7. As a result of the publicity generated by the recommendations of the Partridge Committee, there was a loss of public confidence in the stability of engineering courses at Bendigo and the intake in 1979 dropped to 27. </PARA>
<PARA> 8. During 1979 the Academic Committee on Engineering of the Victorian Institute of Colleges carried out the regular quinquennial review of our engineering courses and agreed to extend their accreditation only until the end of 1980 in view of the investigation then being undertaken by a working party set up by the Victorian Post-Secondary Education Commission. This did nothing to restore public confidence in engineering at Bendigo and the new intake for 1980 was only 26. </PARA>
<PARA> 9. Towards the end of 1980 the Victorian Post-Secondary Education Commission Working Party on Engineering Education produced its report, in which it noted that there had been a resurgence in employment opportunities for engineers and there was a prospective shortage of engineering graduates unless more were produced in the next few years. It expressed the view, however, that there was sufficient capacity in the large metropolitan institutions comprising Melbourne and Monash Universities, Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology, Swinburne Institute of Technology and Footscray Institute of Technology to meet these needs. It stated that spare capacity was available at the Caulfield Institute of Technology, the Ballarat College of Advanced Education, the Gippsland Institute of Advanced Education, Deakin University and Bendigo College of Advanced Education. It recommended that the Preston Institute of Technology should continue to phase out engineering courses as had already been planned. It also recommended that some attention should be given to engineering courses at Bendigo College of Advanced Education, Deakin University and Caulfield Institute of Technology. </PARA>
<PARA> 10. So far as Bendigo was concerned the Victorian Post-Secondary Education Commission Working Party noted that the facilities and staff were of high quality, but recent intakes had been too small for economic viability and it recommended that the College Council should give careful consideration to moving out of engineering into other course areas. This report again did nothing to restore confidence in engineering at Bendigo and, although there was a general upsurge in enrolments in engineering in 1981, new enrolments at Bendigo rose only to 29 students. </PARA>
<PARA> 11. It is acknowledged that present intakes are too small for economic viability, but it is clear that the reason for these small intakes can be traced back to the engineering recommendations of the Partridge Committee, based on inaccurate information, ignorance of the local situation, a distinct tendency to favour centralism in education and illogical conclusions on employment opportunities on the basis of a sample from Monash University without taking sufficient account of the employment records of graduates from other institutions. </PARA>
<PARA>ASSESSMENT OF THE ECONOMIC CONTRIBUTION OF THE ENGINEERING FACULTY OF THE BENDIGO COLLEGE OF ADVANCED EDUCATION TO THE BENDIGO COMMUNITY</PARA>
<PARA>Social benefits/costs</PARA>
<PARA> The closure of the three engineering departments within the Engineering School would result in the loss of at least eighteen jobs directly within the Bendigo community. Fourteen of these would be full-time academic positions and four would be support/technical positions. Also lost would be a significant number of the ninety-three students currently enrolled in the Engineering School. The average length of service of the non-fixed term staff (teaching and non-teaching) is well over ten years. It is a relatively stable staff with little turnover in recent years which itself is of importance when one considers that only one of the teaching staff originally came from Bendigo. As with any relatively insular community it is often the injection of new blood that contributes to shaping the direction and attitudes of the community as well as adding stimulus to its cultural affairs. This is aptly demonstrated by the variety of local community affairs actively participated in by a majority of staff members. Such activities include service clubs, scouting, education, local council affairs and professional organisations such as the Bendigo and Northern Group of the Institution of Engineers, Australia. It is perhaps not going too far to suggest that many of these people are even more involved in community affairs than the average citizen. </PARA>
<PARA>Economic benefits/costs</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The monetary contribution of the Engineering School to the local community is of particular significance. The current income generated into the district by the School in terms of spending power (comparing payments to wages, ancillary payments and materials expenditure) runs to the tune of approximately half a million dollars. The bulk of this spending would be withdrawn from the region, the result being lower retail sales, lower expenditure on insurance, less expenditure on entertainment, housing, debt charges, health and medical services and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> Even here the effect is not simply half a million dollars withdrawn but perhaps closer to three-quarters of a million when multiplier effects of the spending flow are taken into account. The effects don't stop there either, the withdrawal of spending from the community will also result in the loss of other jobs dependent upon the spending and impede the prospects of future job opportunities. Although it is difficult to predict where this job loss will occur, we might expect at the very least that other staff members of the College would be directly affected since service work provided by other departments to the School of Engineering occupies the time of approximately three other full-time staff members. Once again, the subsequent across the board multiplier effects need to be taken into account by the community. Should these people be forced to leave Bendigo in search of employment and consequently place their houses on the market, the effect could be quite serious upon a somewhat already depressed real-estate market. The prospects of recovery in this market in the near future would be postponed in the very least. Viewed as a transaction cost to the staff seeking alternative employment, the amount involved could be considerable, as an externality to the community the real cost would be even greater. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. A current service provided in association with the Engineering School involves industrial testing facilities, mostly in the area of concrete testing with however, some provision for soil testing. The facility is registered by the National Association of Testing Authorities (NATA) for concrete testing as such, provides the only facility for concrete testing in Bendigo. Some materials come from as far away as Swan Hill and Deniliquin and without the Bendigo service these and local materials would have to be sent to Melbourne. The fees for testing are slightly less than those charged by private operators in Melbourne and Bendigo firms using the facility to enjoy an additional advantage in that there is less time and lower transport costs involved. The actual gross income to the College in 1980 from industrial testing amounted to some $31,700. It would be difficult to imagine the industrial testing service continuing without the existence of the Engineering School, as without the backing of the engineering staff, testing couldn't continue with NATA recognition. The prospects of the testing service being taken up by a local private engineering consultant wouldn't be bright when one considers the capital investment required ($50,000), the fluctuating demand for materials to be tested (this reflects cyclical fluctuation in the building industry) and the rate of return on investment. At present the facility employs three staff on limited term contract and the closing of the School of Engineering would place their futures in grave doubt. Just a short time ago this area was seen to have ample scope for expansion and development in light of the proposed establishment of a Professional Community Services Body within the College. The closure of Engineering would provide a body blow to such developments and further reduce future potential income sources for the College as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. A further contribution by the School of Engineering to the local community is made via professional advice and assistance to local community groups, public authorities and councils. Both staff and students are involved in this area. Staff from the electrical, mechanical, and civil engineering departments frequently provide advice and consulting services to local industry. Where possible, staff may involve themselves and their students in practical applications of their subjects which is of assistance to local groups, for example, surveying the playing areas of school grounds where improvements and landscaping are proposed,or surveying the rinks of a local bowling club. About a dozen or so major projects are undertaken by students (mostly civil engineering students) each year in conjunction with local government bodies. The project might involve designing a water supply scheme, a drainage system or even a caravan park. Whilst only some of these projects are actually adopted and put into effect by local authorities, those that are provide an extremely valuable and very cheap service.Even if the projects are not directly used the authority may often be able to make use of a good deal of ancillary information and specifications. Since this contribution is provided free of charge, its value is difficult to estimate but clearly the community derives major benefits in the form of positive externalities. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. It is interesting to note that with only a couple of exceptions, local municipal councils employ engineers who have completed all, or at least part, of their academic qualifications with the Engineering School of the Bendigo College of Advanced Education. Not only is this the case in the immediate Bendigo region, but there are also numerous examples of Councils throughout Victoria and NSW who employ engineering graduates from Bendigo. Closure of the Engineering School would deprive the region of a service of technological skill and expertise at a time when a shortage of engineers is becoming apparent and when the projected shortage over the next decade will become acute. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. At the present time and using the best available estimates of revenue and costs, in terms of direct teaching expenditure, engineering students on average bring into the College approximately the same amount of revenue from funding sources as it costs to teach each student. In this sense, (i.e. the direct teaching costs) engineering is cost efficient with the present number of students and costs per head could be reduced with a greater intake of students. Without engineering the other Schools and Departments within the College would find indirect costs higher per student (computing services, library, Media services, administrative, buildings, etc.). Many of the services would not be reduced in size if engineering were to close, therefore raising costs per head in the remainder of the College. Thus we might view direct teaching costs as the pertinent figure in terms of efficiency. </PARA>
<PARA> Using January 1980 base figures updated for estimated cost increases to the present time, and incorporating a proportion of total College costs based on actual EFTS figures, engineering students cost the College approximately 39 per cent more in total per head than they bring in revenue. In terms of total costs it is estimated that the Engineering School would need to have an EFTS of 150 students to balance costs with revenue. Positive steps could be taken to ensure this increase in numbers. (The total cost figures probably represent an understatement if previous funding arrangements per department are taken into account). </PARA>

<PARA>26 May 1981 Sir Phillip Lynch MP,</PARA>
<PARA>Minister for Industry and Commerce,</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House,</PARA>
<PARA>Canberra, ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Sir Phillip,</PARA>
<PARA> This letter is intended as a follow-up to your meeting with a deputation of OFB employees on the 15/5/81. The purpose of this letter is to both gain written verification of statements you made during this meeting and to receive clarification in several areas related to the proposed OFB sale to private enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA> At the meeting you stated that if no satisfactory buyer could be found for the OFB, then it would continue as a government concern in its present form. Will you please verify this statement in your reply?</PARA>
<PARA> During the meeting you stated that the sale of the OFB was recommended in the Eltringham Report. When asked to make this report public, you stated it was 'Confidential'. This committee finds this viewpoint unacceptable and therefore calls for the release of the Eltringham Report and its terms of reference. The proposed sale of the OFB has very grave implications for the jobs of its 650 workers, the economic stability of the Bendigo area and the defence preparedness of the nation. With this in mind the Government needs to show on what basis it made the decision to sell the OFB. Clearly, if the Government believes its reasons for selling the OFB are sound and well founded, then it has nothing to fear. At the meeting with our deputation you spoke of the need for consultation and discussion. The release of the Eltringham Report and the terms of reference it was based upon, would be a very real way of showing the sincerity in your calls for consultation and discussion. </PARA>
<PARA> At the May 15 meeting you rejected the deputation's request for an open public inquiry into the OFB similar to that at the Williamstown Dockyard. You spoke of the fact that the proposed sale of the OFB had been thoroughly investigated by your department. Our committee, at this time, does not intend to question this statement but clearly justice not only needs to be done, it needs to be seen to be done. Therefore this committee reiterates its request for an open public inquiry into the OFB. If, as you say, the matter has been thoroughly investigated by your department, an open public inquiry could only help to justify and explain what is seen by the Bendigo community as a secretive, unjustifiable decision. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of what plant transfers the Government plans to undertake with the proposed sale of the OFB, is an area where urgent clarification is needed. Mr H. Ryan and you stated at the deputation's meeting that minimal plant transfers were envisaged. It was also stated by Mr Ryan and you that details of plant transfers had not been finalized. The Government stated, when it announced the sale decision, that it planned to sell the OFB as a ''Going Concern''. These three statements are contradictory. A factory such as the OFB is based upon several key pieces of machinery. The removal of any of these machines would leave a body without a heart and not a 'Going Concern'. With these facts in mind, this committee calls on the government to inform it immediately, of the specific items of plant it plans to transfer with the proposed OFB sale. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past the question of the rationalisation of Ordnance Factories has often been raised. Up until 30 April it had been stated Departmental policy that any such rationalisation would favour Bendigo. This policy had been reinforced by a statement made in 1978 by the minister then in charge of the OFB, Mr Ian McPhee. He stated that any rationalisation would favour Bendigo. At the deputation's meeting you stated that a Government has the right to change its mind. Our committee does not question this right but we do request further clarification. Since you acknowledged at our meeting that the Ordnance Factory is an important part of the Bendigo economy, upon what basis did your Government change its mind on the issue and decide to sell the OFB?</PARA>
<PARA> During the 15 May meeting you stated that the Government envisaged a private enterprise OFB having a continuing involvement in defence work. Does this mean that the Government would guarantee defence work at least at present levels, to a private enterprise owned OFB?</PARA>
<PARA> The government has stated that with the proposed sale it plans to transfer part of OFB's defence capabilities to Ordnance Factory, Maribynong. It is a well known fact that the OFB has a great deal of difficulty attracting tradesmen. In view of this, how does the Government plan to attract the skilled tradesmen necessary for such work?</PARA>
<PARA> The OFB is a strategically decentralised defence manufacturing facility. The Government cannot guarantee it will continue as a defence manufacturing facility under private enterprise. With these two facts in mind, how does the Government justify centralising its own defence manufacturing capabilities?</PARA>
<PARA> The OFB is currently training 102 of its own apprentices. Additionally, the OFB is currently training 24 first year apprentices on behalf of private employers in Northern and Central Victoria. Virtually all these apprentices are being trained in trades which are suffering from a shortage of skilled labour. Can the Government guarantee that this very high level of apprentice training would continue at the OFB, if the OFB was sold to private enterprise?</PARA>
<PARA> As has been previously stated, this letter is designed to gain written verification of statements you made during the 15 May meeting and to receive clarification concerning areas of doubt and importance in relation to your Government's proposal to sell the OFB to private enterprise. You have stated that consultation and discussion should occur between all parties involved in the proposed OFB sale. This committee also recognises the need for consultation and discussion. A comprehensive reply to all queries raised in this letter would be a very real way of illustrating the sincerity of your calls for consultation and discussion. </PARA>
<PARA> We look forward to an early reply. </PARA>

<PARA>EXTRACT FROM THE 'BENDIGO ADVERTISER' OF 25 SEPTEMBER 1980</PARA>
<PARA>Ordnance's $9m?</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> About $9m was likely to be spent at the Bendigo Ordnance Factory between 1981 and 1985, according to the Federal Member for Bendigo, Mr John Bourchier. </PARA>
<PARA> Planning within the Department of Productivity would ensure that the Ordnance Factory would have an increasing role in Australia's overall defence preparedness, he said. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government was considering a five-year capital works plan at Government factories. </PARA>
<PARA> This was in keeping with its policy of maintaining a viable defence industry within Australia, Mr Bourchier said. </PARA>
<PARA> This financial year's capital works program for the Ordnance Factory provided for tenders to be called next March for the construction of a new electroplating building at a cost of about $440,000. </PARA>
<PARA> Tenders would also be called that month for the construction of concrete foundations for lathes and other equipment at an estimated cost of $55,000. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed program for the factory in 1981-82 would cost close to $2m, he said. </PARA>
<PARA> Work to be done would include the renovation of transporter crane tracks ($100,000), a new quality assurance building comprising a number of equipment testing laboratories ($1.5m) and additional air-conditioning in the metrology (measuring) section ($40,000). </PARA>
<PARA> The metrology section would be extended at a cost of $200,000 and a pit furnace restored at a cost of $100,000 in 1981-82, he said. </PARA>
<PARA> In the 1982-83 financial year work would be done to strengthen steelwork for new cranes at a cost of $200,000. </PARA>
<PARA> A new administration building would be built at a cost of $1.5m and the gear shop would be extended at a cost of $80,000 in 1983-84. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1984-85, the final year of the program, a new toolroom-machine shop costing $5m would be built. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Bourchier said the program was designed to ensure that the Bendigo Ordnance Factory achieved its full capacity. </PARA>
<PARA>MAKE OUR MUNITIONS OR PERISH</PARA>
<PARA> Apparently we in Australia cannot learn a lesson-to which I refer our experience in the last war when our ability to produce a wide range of armaments and military equipment saved the day for us. </PARA>
<PARA> In the period of 22 months between Dunkirk and Pearl Harbor we had no outside source of supply for any defence requirements. Yet when our troops came from North Africa into New Guinea they lacked for nothing be it guns, mortars, Bren gun carriers, searchlights, refrigeration vehicles, hand grenades, rifles, Bren guns, engineering equipment and so on. There was virtually something of everything and enough. Three thousand field guns of four different calibres were delivered to the Army by the Australian motor industry. It was the engineering ability of the motor industry that proved so valuable. We had several shortages that nearly put us over the gun barrel. There was no nickel, the experts emphatically stating that there was no nickel in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The major shortage that could have left us virtually unarmed was the inability of the United Kingdom to send up optical munitions, in particular gun sights. We actually had some 150 guns made in Australia, but with no sights they were useless. Then virtually by a miracle, Australia produced four varieties of top grade and very special optical glass and made a full range of optics for cameras, tank sights, binoculars, range finders etc. and all in seven months at a cost of about 60 million pounds, and this despite a cable from the Australian High Commissioner in London to the Prime Minister advising that UK top authorities, including the Admiralty and manufacturers, that such optical work would take us four years and cost over 1 million pounds. Prior to Pearl Harbor, Australia had been at war for two years. The United States' vigorous neutrality even prevented transmission of mail through the States if such mail dealt with armaments and, in particular, drawings of such armaments.</PARA>
<PARA> Ball and roller bearings nearly brought us to a halt, but we quietly set up manufacturers. </PARA>
<PARA> The critical defence establishments that we set up have been allowed to close down and disappear. Imported defence equipment is at best a short term deterrent. It might hold off the enemy for a few weeks, but no country can depend on an ally in time of war. This especially applies to equipment and to essential spare parts, because the same requirement is needed for the ally, and quite naturally its needs come first. What is the use of a motor car if you have a broken crankshaft and cannot get a replacement? This applies equally to a gun, an aeroplane, or a tank. </PARA>
<PARA> The requirements for spare parts in time of war can never be adequately forecast, and the vulnerability of transport, both by air and sea, could cut us off from all imported supplies. This was well illustrated when much of the Israeli Air Force was grounded during the last Arab-Israeli War, and they could not get spare parts for their Mirage aircraft from France for several months. As a result, Israel now designs and makes much of its military aircraft and tanks. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been through two major wars both in the services and in munitions. I have no financial or other interest in war production. I fully concur and fully support Sir Keith Shann in his article, 'Build Our Defences and Hang the Cost' in the April issue of Pacific Defence Reporter. How can survival be measured in cost?</PARA>
<PARA> If economics can determine such an equation, then perhaps mundane money can be viewed through the words of a former president of the United States who, when much debate was current over the building of the Brooklyn Bridge, remarked:</PARA>
<PARA> 'Make it in the United States regardless of cost, so we will still have the dollars!'</PARA>
<PARA> Making of armaments in its many forms is a No. 1 industry in several countries, providing enormous employment, which is fairly viewed in such countries as better than payment for the dole. </PARA>
<PARA> Very fortunately, new high technology is available and makes manufacture much easier and quicker than it used to be. I refer to computer tape control of all machine tools. This almost eliminates the costly long time to making tooling and gauges. The process goes straight from the drawing into the automatic tape controlled machine tool and out comes the finished product. </PARA>
<PARA> We have a wide awake Ministry of Science and Technology. We should ensure that the Ministry comes to the fore. It is struggling hard to create improved awareness of the new high technology and can make a great contribution to our defence. </PARA>
<PARA> The government as a defence measure must release funds, and provide defence subsidies so that we can produce the required modern machine tools. Right now under defence we can create and put into use a wide range of new high technology that would be of immense value to the nation. </PARA>
<PARA> We must with urgency bring to the fore the valuable lessons of the last war in the making of munitions. We must bring back into production the items we had to produce to survive, such as the manufacture of ball and roller bearings, optical glass and optical munitions and to hell with the cost and the economists. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours faithfully, Sir LAURENCE HARTNETT</PARA>
<PARA> (As Director of Ordinance Production in the Munitions Department from 1940 to 1945, and chairman of the Army Inventions Directorate, Sir Laurence Hartnett performed the extraordinary task of building a defence industry from nothing in 1940 to the point two years later when the Australian Army was self-sufficient. He is the only Australian alive today who knows from first hand experience the dangers of dependence on others for critical equipment in time of war, and the problems of creating a defence industry. He was born in England in 1898, served his mechanical engineering apprenticeship with Vickers Ltd, was commissioned in the Royal Navy Air Service in 1917, and also served with the RAF. Still intensively active, he established Singapore's armament factory, the first ever built in the tropics. Editor.)</PARA>
<PARA>MONDAY JOB MARKET</PARA>
<PARA>Plenty of jobs for graduates in engineering</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> More than 10,000 well paid positions will go to overseas job seekers unless young Australians come forward, according to the Dean of Engineering at Monash University Professor Lance Endersbee. </PARA>
<PARA> Professor Endersbee said there would be a great demand for engineers in Australia during the next few years, and if young people continued to ignore the profession local and overseas companies would recruit elsewhere for jobs that often started a graduate on about $25,000 a year. </PARA>
<PARA> 'The number of Australian students doing engineering is declining and the demand for engineers is increasing. It's a terrible problem. We are not inspiring our young people to come forward. More than 40 per cent of my students are Asian, and 80 per cent of those doing their doctorates are Asian', he said. </PARA>
<PARA> He said not only large Australian development companies like BHP wanted engineers, many international companies, especially from Britain, recruited in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> 'Every year French oil exploration companies come to the university and interview graduates. Many are prepared to start the graduate on $25,000 a year. It's rather tough work out there but the graduates they take come back as fairly rich young people. </PARA>
<PARA> 'We also have a great demand for chemical engineers and our graduates usually start on about $18,000 a year. </PARA>
<PARA> 'Sometimes a firm will send the youngster abroad to work with the parent company. Often after about four or five years the engineer can come back and buy a house'. </PARA>
<PARA> He said that in the past Australian firms combatted the shortage by bringing in large numbers of workers from other countries. By doing this they were leaving all the senior positions open to overseas people. </PARA>
<PARA> He said the last thing Australia needed was for large slabs of its industry to be controlled by overseas interests and for Australian companies to resort to foreign manpower and technical facilities because they could not cope on their own. 'It's far better to develop our own capability to deal with this and just get on with the job, otherwise Australians will be standing by the fence watching others do the work for them'. </PARA>
<PARA> He said it was also preferable for Australian companies to train their own graduates rather than recruit from overseas because then they knew exactly what they were getting. </PARA>
<PARA> There were many opportunities for Australian engineers because the demand was also increasing all over the world. 'It is an international profession and there are prizes going to people who are highly developed in the field', he said. </PARA>
<PARA> Why are so few people training for such a rewarding profession? Professor Endersbee blames the education system in part. </PARA>
<PARA> 'School students are often not encouraged to study maths and science with the view of doing engineering, and as a result many students just don't have the qualifications needed to do the courses'. </PARA>
<PARA> There was another main reason, he said. 'In Australia we haven't developed a sophisticated modern technological society. We have been getting by on the export of coal or on primary produce while our industrial and manufacturing base is not highly developed. </PARA>
<PARA> 'Therefore for a generation we have not been attracting our brightest, most talented people to the profession. But that must change now, and schools must start encouraging students to do engineering as a career. We must take advantage of the possible shortfall in engineers'. </PARA>
<PARA> The chairman of the Institution of Engineers Australia, Victoria division, Mr Brian Lloyd agreed that while the present supply of graduates in Victoria balanced with demand, there probably would be a shortage of labor within the next few years. </PARA>
<PARA> He said about 800 graduates a year entered the Victorian workforce, but to meet future demand this number would have to be raised to about 1000. </PARA>
<PARA> There would probably be a high level of demand for engineers in the areas of electronics, computer and control systems and mining. Demand would strengthen in areas related to private investment such as chemical, mechanical, industrial and production engineering. The growth in electric power engineering would not be as great. </PARA>
<PARA> He said demand for civil engineers in the public sector might not grow but there could be an upturn in the private sector. </PARA>
<PARA> The number of graduates in Victoria had dropped 23 qualified engineers per 100,000 people compared with 34 engineers in 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> There were many opportunities for young engineers, he said, firstly because the Victorian Government was planning a thrust towards new development projects and secondly because companies had no choice but to take on graduates now. </PARA>
<PARA> Because large companies stopped taking on graduates in the late seventies there was a shortage of experienced engineers in the workforce. As there were shortages in many other countries it was unlikely that firms would continue to bring in a large number of workers. Therefore graduates would be employed. </PARA>
<PARA> 'I think every graduate would be able to get a job in engineering', he said. </PARA>
<PARA> The institution thought the Government could help combat the shortages by providing more funds for engineering colleges around Australia. First priority in Victoria had to be given to 'the big four'-Melbourne and Monash universities, RMIT and Swinburne Institute of Technology. </PARA>
<PARA> He said one major problem that was being overlooked was the great shortage of people who serviced or supported engineers such as draftsmen and technical officers. 'If there were more people skilled in these areas we would be able to use the engineers we do have more effectively'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to the Commonwealth Functions (Statutes Review) Bill 1981. This is a very strange sort of Bill covering many things by stealth. When we were in government we brought in a medical scheme whereby doctors could bulk bill patients. That was a great boon to the doctors and of great assistance to people in need of medical attention. This Government abolished Medibank and bulk billing and today we see before us in this legislation another form of bulk billing. A whole series of alterations has been brought into the Parliament. Every one of them should be debated independently. Because of the way in which the Government has introduced this Bill, known as an omnibus Bill, honourable senators on this side of the chamber do not have an opportunity to debate its contents. We would be the only people here who want to debate it. There has been only one Government speaker in the debate, Senator Reid who represents the Australian Capital Territory. Of course, her contribution was to the effect that she did not believe the Government should own any enterprise which shows a profit. It should all be handed over to private enterprise. That was all she spoke about-that one part of the Bill which deals with the disposal of places such as the Belconnen Mall, which is a great credit to the Australian Capital Territory, and handing it over to private enterprise.

For the information of people who are listening, so that they will have some understanding of what is embodied in this Bill, we find that the Australian Capital Territory is mentioned. Even rabbit destruction and sewerage rates are mentioned in the part of the Bill that deals with the Australian Capital Territory. Then we have the Australian Postal Commission; the Australian Wool Corporation; bankruptcy; Commonwealth Employees (Compensation); Commonwealth Employees (Payments of Remuneration and Allowances); Commonwealth Teaching Service; Director-General of Health; export expansion grants; export market development grants; foreign takeovers; Housing Loans Insurance Corporation; Industries Assistance Commission; lands acquisition; Legislative Drafting Institute and navigation. Then we have the Prices Justification Tribunal; the procurement of goods, works and services; remuneration in respect of dual appointments; transport planning and research; urban and public transport, miscellaneous items and three Schedules to the Bill. All that is included in one nicely wrapped up package-bulk billing as we call it. As Senator Chipp pointed out, this is the last time at least for the next three years that this type of thing will be allowed to happen in this chamber because the numbers will be against the Government. If the Government is foolish enough to bring in a measure like this, it just will not get it through the Senate because the numbers will be here to stop it. Government senators will then have to cast their minds back to 1972 to 1975 when they took certain measures to block certain legislation which was introduced by the properly elected Government of the day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> All the measures that I have mentioned are deserving of a full-scale debate but we are restricted to speaking to very few of them. I repeat, this provides conclusive proof that the Senate is not a House of review but rather a rubber stamp for the Liberal Party when it is in government and a House of frustration for the Labor Party when it happens to be in government. That is the way in which the Senate is used. It is not a States' House or a House of review. We found that out, to the chagrin of many people in Queensland and Western Australia just the other day when the airlines legislation was discussed. We then witnessed the paper tigers of whom I spoke this morning saying all sorts of things to the Press and making themselves out as little heroes for what they were going to do to force the Government to amend the legislation. But when the pressure came on too few of them were prepared to cross the floor and bring the Government to its senses. Certainly some Government supporters crossed the floor on some provisions and others on other provisions, so they got some publicity in that senator so-and-so crossed the floor and opposed the Government. But on the next piece of legislation such senators voted in support of the Government and someone else crossed the floor. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4L7">Senator McLAREN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is so. I am reminded of the activities of members of the Australian Democratic Labor Party in this place. They had all sorts of airy-fairy ideas about what they were going to do, but whenever the Government was in jeopardy they sat tight and supported the Liberal Government. They are only paper tigers. Government supporters will be judged on their merits when we come back for the Budget session. Time will permit me to refer to two matters only. Senator Primmer mentioned his opposition to the sale of the Australian Wool Testing Authority. My colleague, Senator Walsh, referred to it also. I spoke at some length on it when we were debating the Wool Industry Amendment Bill in this chamber last week. I made reference then to the fact that we had received a great deal of representation from people in primary industry, in South Australia especially, asking not only members of the Opposition but also members of the Government to oppose the sale of that authority. Once again we saw the wrath of those so-called champions of democracy who go out on the hustings at election time and tell people whose support they want: 'You can vote for members of the Liberal Party; we are free agents and will look after your interests in the Parliament; we are not bound by Party policy.' Of course they are. If anyone wanted proof of that he has only to see the legislation that has been rail-roaded through this House in the last couple of weeks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Opposition members are often chided as being bound by Party policy, but we make no secret of that fact. Our policy is arrived at by a majority decision. Every member of the Labor Party who seeks endorsement for election to a State or Federal Parliament signs a pledge to be bound by Party policy. We do not go out and fool people, when we are seeking election, that we will do certain things, that we are free agents. We are proud that we abide by Party policy. Not so the Liberal Party supporters or, to a lesser degree, Country Party supporters. They promise: 'When measures come before the House we will judge them on their merits and will vote according to our conscience'. They do not do so. They vote according to the way that Mal Fraser tells them to vote. That has been borne out all too often. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter of great concern to Senator Primmer and to myself is the proposed sale of the Bendigo Ordnance Factory. I agree with the honourable senator when he says that after the next elections the present honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Bourchier) will no longer be a member of this Parliament. Whether or not the Government changes its mind about selling the Bendigo Ordnance Factory, the people of that area have got the message that if Mr Bourchier is re-elected, and Fraser is returned, the factory will go; that the only thing that can save it is the return of a Labor Government and, once more, the election of a Labor member for Bendigo. The electorate was represented many years ago by a very good Labor member. That is what the people of Bendigo must consider. No doubt as Senator Primmer has said-he has a very close association with Bendigo-he will do his best to remind the people of that. I doubt whether they will need reminding. The writing is on the wall, that if the Fraser Government is returned to office 600 or 700 employees will be looking for jobs and small businesses will go to the wall because of loss of income generally. Also, as a result of recurring losses, service industries no longer will be able to remain in Bendigo. </PARA>
<PARA> I have mentioned the Australian Wool Testing Authority. Mr Kerin, when speaking on the matter in the other place, said that the Opposition opposed Part IV of the Bill, comprising clauses 114 to 121. Part IV relates to the Government's decision with respect to changing the status of the Wool Testing Authority and the necessary changes to the Wool Industry Act. As I said earlier, we have had reams of correspondence, telegrams and telexes from people in primary industry. Very few of the writers would come out and say publicly that they were members of the Labor Party or supported it. In the main, they are supporters of the Liberal Party or the National Country Party. They are pleading with members of the Opposition as well as Government supporters to oppose this measure, but not one member of the Liberal Party or the National Country Party has been prepared to stand up for those whom he represents. Not one is prepared to stand up in the Parliament and speak in support of what the Government is doing. They will vote for the legislation but are afraid to get up and criticise it. I wonder what they will say when they go back to the country areas that they represent and meet some of the people who have asked them to oppose this legislation in the full belief that they are free agents. What will they say? If they are honest they will say, 'Mal put the pressure on us and we have to do his bidding; it is his idea. He set up the razor gang and he is the person who has dictated to us that we must support its proposals, as incorporated in the omnibus Bill, and all of their ramifications! The wording of the measure is such that we see only the tip of the iceberg. One cannot get to the crux of it. We will not know, until it begins to operate what its ill-effects will be, especially on the rural areas of this great country. I repeat, Government supporters have claimed that they are free agents. That they are not has been proved and we will see a lot of new faces in this place when we come back. </PARA>
<PARA> When I spoke on the Wool Industry Amendment Bill, I referred at length to representations that had been made to me by Mr Bill Murdoch of Karoonda. I have sent him the record of what I said in his support in this Parliament and have mentioned that only the members of the Opposition have been prepared to put a case on behalf of the woolgrowers that he represents. I know that he approached Government members in Adelaide a few weeks ago because I happened to be in the Commonwealth office building when I ran into him. He told me that he was on his way to see certain members of the Liberal Party. They are not interested in the case that he put to them, and they have been very conspicuous by their absence in commenting on either that Bill or the legislation before us today. They have not said a word. To save the time of the Senate I seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard the first three pages of the Rural Digest, which is published by Mr John Kerin, the shadow Minister for Primary Industry. It deals at length with what the razor gang cuts mean to primary industry, especially woolgrowers. If I am refused leave I will have to read it, but otherwise I do not intend to quote from it. I seek leave to have those pages incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>THE RAZOR GANG</PARA>
<PARA> My first reading of the Ministerial Review Statement (MRS) suggested that the rural sector would pay a reasonably high price as a result of the recommendations of the Razor Gang. But obviously I don't have Mr Nixon's capacity to read between the lines. This remarkable talent of Mr Nixon's has become apparent in his responses to the presumably unexpectedly hostile producer reaction to some of the recommendations. (A cynic might even suggest that Mr Nixon has backtracked on some of the recommendations). </PARA>
<PARA> Let's have a look at two of Mr Nixon's interpretations:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) The MRS announced that the Australian Wool Testing Authority would be 'sold to (the) private sector'. Mr Nixon's interpretation of this is that the AWTA will be sold to a 'special foundation . . . set up by the wool industry-not what most people would call private enterprise! What would the difference be between this arrangement and the existing situation?</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Mr Nixon has interpreted a recommendation that the Wheat Board interest subsidy 'be reduced by one percentage point' as referring to a change in Reserve Bank interest rates announced in March. This change in fact increased the gap on which the subsidy is calculated by 0.55 percentage points!</PARA>
<PARA>Might I suggest that it would be a worthwhile exercise for Mr Nixon to apply his talent to some of the other Razor Gang recommendations which are also going to have an adverse impact on the rural sector. Perhaps he could interpret the 'abolition of the PJT'-an organisation which has saved primary producers some hundreds of millions of dollars-as referring merely to the abolition of changes in the legislation which have progressively weakened the PJT since 1975. What the recommendation could really mean is that a PJT in the form originally intended, is to be re-established. The savings to individual primary producers will amount to thousands of dollars each year. Hurrah for Mr Nixon!</PARA>
<PARA> We need similarly imaginative interpretations of other recommendations for example, those relating to quarantine, soil conservation and extension research. Without an effective quarantine policy, Australia should start now to prepare for the day when our livestock industries cease to be a major export earner. Without adequate attention to soil conservation, the future profitability of both our livestock and cropping industries could be in jeopardy. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a pity that Mr Nixon's capacity to read between the lines has not also been extended to some of the other recommendations which are just as important to rural people. For example, the recommendations relating to education. In particular, the reintroduction for university fees for second and higher degrees places a disproportionate burden on country people who must also find money for accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA>Who is Confused?-A Tale about Interest Rates</PARA>
<PARA> Let's examine the Razor Gang's recommendations to reduce the gap between the interest rate on commercial borrowings undertaken by the Australian Wheat Board and the cost of borrowing from the Reserve Bank by 1 percentage point for purposes of subsidy calculation, a little more closely. </PARA>
<PARA> The reaction of the wheat industry to this announcement was understandably hostile. The statement appeared to be a blatant breach of the 1979 Wheat Marketing Agreement. When the AWB was forced to start borrowing on the commercial market a few years ago to help the Government overcome some of its money supply problems, the growers received a guarantee that the Treasury would pick up the difference between the commercial rate of interest and the rate of interest charged by the Rural Credits Department. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement in the Razor Gang report appears to clearly indicate that the subsidy would be reduced by 1 percentage point. </PARA>
<PARA> Not so, the Minister for Primary Industry, and member of the Razor Gang, Mr Nixon, is reported as claiming. </PARA>
<PARA> According to Mr Nixon, the statement in the report merely refers to a natural fall in the interest rate subsidy occurring as a result of the general increase in RCD interest rates announced by the Government in March. </PARA>
<PARA> However, prior to the March increase in RCD interest rates, the gap was 3.85 percentage points. Taking increases in equivalent commercial rates into account, the March increase in the RCD rate increased the gap to 4.40 percentage points, an increase in the gap of .55 percentage points. Mr Nixon is claiming that the gap was reduced by 1 percentage point by the increase in the RCD rate. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Nixon's department-apparently working on the same interpretation of the Razor Gang recommendation as everyone except Mr Nixon himself-is currently preparing legislation to allow the commercial rate to be reduced by 1 percentage point for the purposes of the subsidy calculations. </PARA>
<PARA> Reducing the notional commercial rate would reduce the gap to 3.4 percentage points. On this basis, the change in the interest rate gap since the beginning of the year would be a decrease of 0.45 percentage points. </PARA>
<PARA> If Mr Nixon can convince the Treasurer that his is the correct interpretation, then the gap would have increased by .55 percentage points. </PARA>
<PARA> Now what was the original recommendation?-A reduction in the gap by 1 percentage point. </PARA>
<PARA>Who is confused?</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4L7">Senator McLAREN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The other matter to which I wish to address my remarks is one that has caused great concern to educationists in this country. At page 11 of the ministerial statement on the Review of Commonwealth Functions we have the beginning of the section on education. At page 13, under the heading 'Function', we have the heading 'Tertiary Tuition Fees' and the following comments:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Tuition fees to be introduced in universities and CAE's for students undertaking degrees and diplomas subject to an initial tertiary qualification . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The description goes on and on but I have found it impossible to see that spelt out in the legislation. That makes me suspicious. It must be spelt out in detail somewhere, but when it comes into effect it will have a great effect on the top educationists of this country. I have received reams of correspondence from people in South Australia. No doubt every South Australian member of this Parliament has received correspondence including, no doubt, you, Mr President. I will not read all the letters. I will just read the names of the people and some of their comments. I have received a letter dated 11 May from Professor J. R. Prescott, who is the Professor of Physics at the University of Adelaide. He enclosed a copy of a letter he has recently sent to the Federal Minister for Education (Mr Fife). The letter reads:</PARA>
<PARA> I trust that the argument will appeal to you too, and that you will lend what support you can to initiatives to reverse the decision. </PARA>
<PARA>In the opening stanza of his letter to Mr Fife, he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> I write on the matter of fees for postgraduate degrees. If implemented, the recent proposal to impose such fees would cripple my department within eighteen months, by removing from it all postgraduate students except those on CPRA's. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter is signed by J. R. Prescott, Professor of Physics at the University of Adelaide. </PARA>
<PARA> I have received another letter from the University of Adelaide written by Professor Bowie who is the Dean of the Faculty of Science. He also pointed out to me-and enclosed a copy of a letter sent to Mr Fife-all the problems that his Faculty will suffer if these razor gang recommendations are put into effect. In his letter to Mr Fife, under the heading 'Fees for Postgraduate Students' he says:</PARA>
<PARA> I wish to inform you that on 12 May 1981 the Faculty of Science of the University of Adelaide, passed the following motion unanimously. 'The Faculty of Science opposes the introduction of fees for students undertaking Degree and Diploma courses'. </PARA>
<PARA>Under the heading of 'The Financial Effect on Postgraduate Students' the letter reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The imposition of fees will cause many talented graduates not to undertake valuable postgraduate studies. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1981 statistics are as follows. There are 1,101 postgraduate students currently enrolled in the University, of whom only 324 are in receipt of Commonwealth or University awards. There are 235 postgraduate students in the Faculty of Science of whom 117 receive support. Over half of postgraduate students in the Faculty are thus not funded, and we must assume a high proportion of these would have been unable to continue their studies had fees been imposed at the time they commenced their courses. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The imposition of fees and the subsequent loss of postgraduate students will severely restrict the research output from Departments in the Faculty of Science. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>If Australia is to continue to develop its technology it needs more skilled scientists. The Government's decision on fees will inevitably result in a reduced production of scientists. </PARA>
<PARA>Under another heading 'The Effect on Undergraduate Teaching in the Faculty of Science' the letter reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Departments in the Faculty of Science often have large first and second year undergraduate classes. Some Departments teach up to 600 first year students. These students all undertake laboratory classes and although University staff supervise these classes, it is the postgraduate students who act as tutors and demonstrators to the undergraduates. It would be impossible to provide laboratory and tutorial instruction to undergraduates without the teaching contribution of postgraduate students. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter is signed by J. H. Bowie, Dean of the Faculty of Science of the University of Adelaide. </PARA>
<PARA> I have received further correspondence from the Australian Federation of University Women-South Australia, signed by Dr Jennifer M. Barker. She points out the same fears about what will happen. I will read only the last part of her letter which she sent to Mr Fife. Obviously no attention has been paid to all of this correspondence. Dr Barker states:</PARA>
<PARA> There is a fear that introduction of fees at the postgraduate level may be a preliminary to introduction of fees at the undergraduate level, to which we would be totally opposed, for reasons similar to those given above. Similarly, we are opposed to any reduction in TEAS allowances. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe strongly that it is in the national interest to have a populace which is as highly educated as possible and which has a respect for learning. The further development, rather than restriction, of that situation would be an act of enlightened government. We therefore request that you reconsider the proposals referred to and endeavour, in consultation with the appropriate bodies, to find more acceptable solutions to the problems of support of this important section of education in our country. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter is signed by Dr Jennifer M. Barker. Most of these letters point out to us that there has been no consultation at all with the deans and the professors in the universities by the razor gang. These people are completely in the dark. They are very worried, otherwise they would not be writing to members of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I have also received a copy of a letter sent to Mr Fife from the Roseworthy Agricultural College which is signed by M. B. Spurling who is the Acting Director. Under the heading 'Proposed Introduction of Student Fees for Post Graduate Courses', the letter reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Because of the possible ambiguity in interpretation of what postgraduate courses may or may not be considered for attracting fees, I would want to clarify the nature of the graduate diploma courses at Roseworthy Agricultural College and put on record our strong objection to the introduction of fees for such courses. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, you and I know that most of the students who go to Roseworthy are children of people who would normally vote for the Liberal Party and not for the Labor Party. I venture to say that 90 per cent of the students who go to Roseworthy would be the sons-I do not know whether there are any girls there-or the daughters of supporters of the Liberal Party. They would have been supporters in the past but will probably not be in the future because of this action of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> I have received a letter from the Adelaide University Graduates' Union which is signed by Dr R. C. Heddle. Dr Heddle points out the same problems that the union will experience if students are to be called upon to pay fees. I have received another letter from the Flinders University of South Australia which is signed by G. J. Fraenkel, the Chairman and Dean of the School of Medicine. His opening paragraph in his letter to me states:</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Australian Government has made a very unfortunate error in planning to introduce fees for second or higher qualifications in universities and that this plan should not be put into effect. </PARA>
<PARA>I have received another letter, again from the Flinders University, which is signed by Keith Hancock, the Vice-Chancellor. He used similar phrases to tell of the problems that will beset the Flinders University if these recommendations of the razor gang are put into effect. I have received another letter from the University of Adelaide which is signed by Graham Nerlich who is the Professor of Philosophy. He states:</PARA>
<PARA> I view with alarm the recent decision of Federal Cabinet to impose fees on higher degree students and those undertaking second degrees in our Universities. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> I urge you to seek urgent reversal of this decision. I should be grateful for an indication of what position you will adopt towards it. </PARA>
<PARA>I can assure all of those people who have written to me of my position. I oppose most vigorously what the razor gang is doing. </PARA>
<PARA> I have received a letter from the University of Adelaide Staff Association signed by C. R. Lawton, who is the President and G. Dunstan, who is the Honorary Secretary. The first paragraph of their letter states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government's proposal to introduce fees for most students undertaking second degrees is hardly credible as an act of a cabinet which includes a good number of university or CAE graduates. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, members of Cabinet have their diplomas or whatever they are. They are now in the Parliament and they have made a decision that no one else will come along with the same educational standards which they have been able to acquire. I have received a further letter from the University of Adelaide signed by Mr A. J. Butler. He writes:</PARA>
<PARA> I write as one of your constituents who is both a parent and a university staff-member, to express grave concern at certain decisions announced after the Review of Commonwealth Functions (the 'Razor Gang Report'). </PARA>
<PARA>I have received another letter from the University of Adelaide which is signed by R. F. Seamark who is a reader in endocrinology. He says:</PARA>
<PARA> As a University teacher involved with graduate students I wish to protest against the proposed budget cuts which would mean increased Fees for graduate students and 'tightening' of TEAS. </PARA>
<PARA>His letter went on. </PARA>
<PARA> Even people in Queensland have been writing to South Australian senators in the same vein. I have received a letter from the Chancellor of the Griffith University in Queensland, Theodor Bray, expressing the same concern. I have received a letter from the Association of Professional Engineers, Australia, stating:</PARA>
<PARA> The Review of Commonwealth Functions has recently recommended that a major review of the Defence Department organisation is to be conducted. You will be aware that two reviews have already been carried out early in 1980 into the Defence Science and Technology Organisation which were required to report to the Minister by June 1980. I understand these reviews are yet to be tabled in Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> This Association has a number of members employed at the Defence Research Centre, Salisbury, who are anxious to know the outcome of these prior reviews. This is particularly so now as these reviews are no doubt of relevance in implementing the RCF decisions. These decisions could impact directly on a number of highly skilled, dedicated professional people in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Would you enquire of the Minister of Defence when he intends to present these reports to Parliament and urge him to make them available to this Association at the earliest possible moment. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter is signed by J. R. Terry, the Honorary Vice President of the South Australian branch of the Association of Professional Engineers. Time does not permit me to read the full contents of those letters. I have read the pertinent parts. When honourable senators read those letters and when they have a think about them they will see that the old philosophy of Menzies has come back into this Government. The Government educates a few of the people who support it and it does all that it can to prevent the children of people from the working class of this country from getting any higher education. Immediately it educates the children of the working class of this country those children become a threat to the children of the wealthy section. Of course, as I and my colleagues have said on many occasions in this Parliament, this Government governs only for the benefit of those who have everything they require, and to give them more it takes away from those who have less. I have no hesitation in saying that I support the pleas made by all those people who wrote those letters to me. I have no hesitation in saying that I join my leader, Senator Button, in opposing this legislation. I express my disgust and regret that members of the Government who have also received copies of all the correspondence from the respective states do not have the intestinal fortitude to stand up in this chamber and put a case on behalf of those people who have written to them. </PARA>

Whilst he indicts the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), I am inclined to blame Sir Phillip Lynch. I think in his case there has been a travesty of birth. Phil Lynch's father was a very fine member of the Amalgamated Engineering Union at the Newport railway workshops at Chullora. I wonder what he thinks of his son who has virtually turned on the people he came from to go into public life. That is my first point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My second point concerns the complaints about demonstrators in the Parliament House galleries and outside. More demonstrations will occur because of the Government's arrogance, as exemplified by its bringing in this legislation. They are not my words. I refer honourable senators to a communication sent out by the Meat and Allied Trades Federation of Australia which states, among other things:</PARA>
<PARA> This Federation believes it is the responsibility of the Senate to ensure that important Bills of this nature are not rushed through the House-</PARA>
<PARA>I raise this point deliberately. At page 2181 of the Hansard report, the second reading speech of the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) refers to the repeal of the existing trading hours but gives no explanation of the form any dispute between employers and their permanent employees will take. Year after year we are lectured on how trade unions should behave. People argue that some unions take a Dick Turpin attitude. The officials of the union have been available for consultation. The industrial history of the retail and wholesale trade in New South Wales shows that protracted hearings were held before the State Industrial Commission in relation to certain rostering and penalty rates on Saturdays. The great danger that everyone fears now is connected with the open slather that may occur on Sundays. To more or less flesh out my argument I seek leave to have two documents incorporated in Hansard. The Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney), who is at the table, has seen both documents. The first one is from the National Secretary of the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association and is headed 'Deregulation of Trading Hours in the Australian Capital Territory'. The other document is from the Meat and Allied Trades Federation of Australia, which is an employer organisation and which is equally concerned at the repercussions which may occur. I seek leave for both documents to be incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA>Canberra, A.C.T.2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator,Re: Deregulation of Trading Hours in A.C.T. </PARA>
<PARA> This Association has been informed that the Fraser Government intends to push the deregulation of trading hours in the Australian Capital Territory through both Houses of Parliament before the end of the present period of sitting. </PARA>
<PARA> It is apparently being done as part of some omnibus legislation in a last-minute effort to avoid the proper consideration which such legislation would receive in the Senate after 1 July. </PARA>
<PARA> The drastic effect of such legislation on increasing unemployment cannot be under-estimated. </PARA>
<PARA> Already, the retail and wholesale industry has suffered a net loss of 39,400 full-time jobs in the period from 1972 to 1979. </PARA>
<PARA> Athough there was an increase in casual jobs in the industry over this period, a large proportion of these jobs went to full-time school-children. For example, in August, 1978, of 75,000 full-time school-children who held a job, 72 per cent were employed in the retail and wholesale industry and they averaged 7.2 hours of work each week. The participation rate of these school-children in the work force increased from 4 per cent in 1971, to 20 per cent in 1978. </PARA>
<PARA> These statistics clearly illustrate that massive numbers of school-students earning pocket money as casual employees are taking the jobs of full-time shop assistants who have a much greater economic need to work. </PARA>
<PARA> Because the retail and wholesale industry employs over 20 per cent of the workforce, these trends have undoubtedly swollen the ranks of persons registered as unemployed by a measurable degree. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, the expansion of part-time and casual employment in retailing at the expense of full-time jobs is quite insane when one realises that 81.5 per cent of the unemployed are seeking full-time work (April, 1981 figures). </PARA>
<PARA> Moreover, an increasing proportion of employees with part-time jobs are seeking more hours of work. For example, in February, 1980, there were 142,900 part-time employees seeking more hours of work. Of these, 52,400 were seeking a full-time job. </PARA>
<PARA> If trading hours in the Capital Territory are deregulated, full-time employment in the retail industry will largely disappear-as has happened in the United States where no restrictions on retail trading exist. </PARA>
<PARA> It should also be remembered that if trading hours are deregulated in Canberra, it would be difficult to resist the flow-on pressure which the giant retail chains would exert in Victoria and New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> Two case studies have been done by the Union on retail stores to show the effect on employment when Saturday afternoon trading is introduced. In one of these stores, full-time employment fell by 25 per cent, in the other it fell by 18 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> The consequent pattern of employment in these stores was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Number of employees</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>Full-time Casual Total</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>Store 1  25 75 100 Store 2  28 53 81</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> If such figures were repeated across the whole retail industry, the effect on employment would be disastrous. </PARA>
<PARA> After a full investigation on the effects of longer retail trading, the Standing Committee on Development of the A.C.T. House of Assembly recommended to the Minister 18 months ago that trading hours in the Capital Territory not be extended for at least five years. </PARA>
<PARA> We therefore urge that any legislation which is introduced in the Senate be amended so that trading hours in the Capital Territory remain unaltered. </PARA>

<PARA>Dear Senator Mulvihill,</PARA>
<PARA>Repeal of Trading Hours Ordinances ACT</PARA>
<PARA> This Federation represents 6,000 retail butchers throughout the Commonwealth and members view with concern the current Bill introduced by the Government seeking to repeal the Trading Hours Ordinance for the ACT. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the Bill is to completely abolish any regulated trading hours for the ACT and our concern is mainly directed to the repercussive effects of the introduction of unrestricted trading hours in the ACT and its consequential effects on other States with particular reference to New South Wales and Victoria. Already in the ACT, we have unrestricted trading hours for the sale of food and its effect on the Meat Industry in terms of small business has been of major concern to this organisation. </PARA>
<PARA> Small retail butchers are now required to trade at least 6 days per week and in some circumstances, on Sunday and the consequential labour cost has seen 20 retailers forced out of business in the past 3 years and other retailers are finding it difficult to continue trading with the employment of labour and competing with large supermarket chains who are not employing labour over the weekends or in the evenings and use only a checkout system. </PARA>
<PARA> This Federation believes it is the responsibility of the Senate to ensure that important Bills of this nature are not rushed through the House without proper consideration of the effects of such legislation. It is our belief that it is the responsibility of the Senate to be responsive to the interests of small independent business in Australia and we consider the Bill has been introduced with indecent haste and requires further consideration by those groups of businessmen affected by the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I would emphasise that there has been no consultation whatsoever with various Industry Groups in Canberra and it is important for the Senate to monitor the effects of any legislation before its adoption. </PARA>
<PARA> It is well-known that the Bill is supported by major retail groups who see the introduction of this Bill as an objective means of influencing State Governments, particularly in Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria, to extend trading hours to the detriment of small business. It is in this area that the Bill requires careful consideration by the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I would respectfully ask you, as a Senator, to seek the deferment of this Bill which would repeal the Trading Hours Ordinance for the ACT to enable further consultation and reports to be submitted on the overall effect of such repeal. </PARA>
<PARA> It is our belief that the repeal of this Ordinance has been linked with other Government expenditure and the monetary effect of this Ordinance cannot be measured against the economic effect it will have on consumers and the small business interest throughout Australia. For this reason, we seek the deferment of this Bill and ask your support in such action. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The crux of the matter is that there was a diminishment of 39,000 jobs in this industry between 1972 and 1979. Some people talk about feather bedding, but they must realise that for every redundancy created a taxpayer goes on to some form of unemployment benefit. I suppose the arch apostle of the economic theory that has been practised here has been the British Prime Minister. In January I was in Wales at the time that the British Prime Minister got the idea that the Welsh steel industry was overloaded. All she did by her actions was to boost up the number of unemployment benefit recipients. This is what will happen in the Capital Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say with all due respect to Senator Reid, the new senator for the Australian Capital Territory, that I was amazed and disgusted when I sat in my room and listened to her assessment. She had some sympathy for the small trader. I could tell by the verbiage she used that she had a little doubt about the matter, but she did not say one word about the rank and file members of the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association who visited this House. I say to her respectfully: 'Senator, if you want to go places you will have to try to have some of the warmth and compassion that Senator Ryan has. I wonder what will happen when Senator Reid goes out on the soapboxes prior to the next election and meets some of the young men and women who at an early stage of their life have no income other than that obtained in their employment. They would not be like the honourable senator who is a member of a rich profession. Those young men and women are not in a rich profession. </PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator had the temerity in the first question she asked in this chamber to defend a magistrate in a Canberra court. He came from a well-paid profession. But the honourable senator is not a bit interested in the rank and file members of the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association. I hope that at the next election members of that association heckle the honourable senator wherever she goes. She shows no milk of human kindness about what will happen to these people. There is no question about that. Some 80 per cent of people unemployed want permanent work, not casual work. The honourable senator, by her indifference, has stamped herself as being like the Prime Minister who wants to grind these people into the humiliations that are part and parcel of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> It is all very well to talk about the Australian Capital Territory and people earning reasonable and high salaries. If the honourable senator were to mingle with the masses outside she would be a better senator. I hope she takes that advice. If I did not give her this advice now I know that Senator Ryan would. Senator Reid deserves all that I have said. I think it is an utter disgrace that she represents the Australian Capital Territory. She is a woman, yet she does not have an atom of kindness for these people who will be dispossessed. I note that the Minister for Social Security is looking at me, but this is the place to give people what they ask for. If Senator Reid wants equality of sex by becoming a member of this chamber she will get it. I know that if Senator Ryan were here she would endorse to the hilt all that I have said, as would Senator Melzer. If we are kept here to the early hours of the morning every Minister and senator opposite will cop all the spleen that I can dish out. What I have said is nothing compared with what they will get tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA> I want honourable senators to know once and for all that a lot of tripe is spoken about democracy. We must look at what the Government has done in the last 48 hours and at the way it has put the boot in and rushed through legislation. There will be a multitude of disputes concerning the engagement of people and the conversion from permanent employment to casual employment. The Government will win this one, but nothing is contained in any parts of the legislation about the form of arbitration that will be adopted. Every master retailer will want to get even with somebody who spoke up for his fellow workers. The document that has been incorporated from the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association refers to the large supermarket chains and what effect the changes will have on small businessmen. Senator Reid said that she had some sympathy for the small businessmen. Senator Chipp sounded the tocsin. It may be that Senator Reid believes in small businessmen, but she does not care about trade unionists. I suppose it is not in her makeup to do so. She does not believe in unions at all. I wonder whether Senator Reid, in her legal career, ever appeared for them. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion I say that the way Senator Reid has raised the matter is a disgrace. I will be very surprised if Senator Chaney or any other Minister who replies to this debate will show some courtesy and tell Brian O'Neal, the Secretary of the New South Wales branch, or Mr de Bruyn, the National Secretary of the union, how they should handle the dispute. The dispute will not be like those connected with shunters in marshalling yards or employees in coal mines. In a lot of these cases the employee will not win. Members of the Government are not offering me any advice on how jobs will be protected. I say to Senator Reid and to other honourable senators that the chamber is a place in which you express your feelings. I have never been one not to do so. That is why I have never had ulcers or a bad heart. I get what I have to say out of my system. I make this statement quite definitely: Honourable senators opposite should not talk to me any more about industrial relations. I have said before that there may be occasions when rank and file unionists take a lead from their paid officials and say that others are not battling hard enough. In this case I know of the courtesy in dialogue that Mr O'Neal and other people always extend to employers. But this issue is not one of fighting the employers; it is one that has been aided and abetted by that man Sir Phillip Lynch, a man who came out of the working class and sold his soul to become a Minister and get a knighthood. Thank goodness I do not want a knighthood; I am never likely to get one. I am still part of where I was born and grew up. Little can be said about him. He knows my view on him only too well because I have given him a few letters. I conclude on this note: This is one of the worst situations I have ever witnessed. I differ with Senator McLaren in that I reckon that the Prime Minister is loyal to his class because he came out of the squattocracy; but Sir Phillip Lynch came out of the working class and he has ratted on it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had not intended to enter the debate on the Commonwealth Functions (Statutes Review) Bill at the second reading stage because I had understood that the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) had given some sort of an assurance that the clause to which Senator Mulvihill, who preceded me, addressed himself-namely, clause 90 of the Bill-would not be proclaimed until such time as the whole issue was referred to either a select committee or the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory for investigation and report, and subsequent legislative action by the Parliament. Senator Reid, in her remarks, stated that in principle she supported the decision on the deregulation of shop trading hours. She went on to make a number of other statements. Senator Reid is the Chairman of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory. She also suggested to the Minister that clause 90 of the Bill should not be proclaimed until such time as the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory was able to inquire into matters relevant to the implementation of the decision. That is not at all consistent with my understanding of the results of the discussions that have taken place over the last several days. I make it very clear to those honourable senators who are concerned about this matter that that sort of assurance is not worth the paper it is written on. The horse has bolted; the action has been taken. There is no remedy. The implementation will occur, but only after certain matters relevant to that implementation have proceeded. That is not good enough.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, in its November 1977 report, indicated its view on the question of legislation by Act or by ordinance. In Recommendation 116, which is to be found on pages 31 and 32 of the report, the Committee stated:</PARA>
<PARA> A review of events leading to the disallowance of the Evidence Ordinance 1971 and other Territory legislation indicates that neither the Legislature nor the Executive have formulated any clear guidelines for determing which Territory legislation ought to be made by Act and which ought to be made by Ordinance. </PARA>
<PARA>However, it went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Legislation for the Territories on matters of national importance, which, if enacted within geographical Australia, would be within the legislative powers of the Commonwealth Government, should be made by Act of Parliament. Legislation of this kind is of two classes:</PARA>
<PARA>It went into the first class. It defined the second class as:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . legislation on matters incidental to the exercise of the constitutional powers and which 'co-exists' with State legislation on similar matters. </PARA>
<PARA>The provision before us relating to the regulation of shop trading hours fits into that category. Therefore it ought to be the subject of a special Act of parliament, and certainly not part of an omnibus piece of legislation, such as the legislation which the Government has before the Senate today. Because of its nationwide ramifications, because a few Government Ministers want to lapse into Whitlamesque, make Canberra a social laboratory for the rest of Australia and deregulate shop trading hours at the behest of the giant interstate retailers, the Government is attempting to force this provision through as part of an omnibus piece of legislation and is not granting it the respect which it is due, namely, the introduction of a separate piece of legislation relating to this matter. In paragraph (d) of Recommendation 116 the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Legislation which, in Australian States, would actually be made by an Act of State Parliament should normally be made by Ordinance. </PARA>
<PARA>It appears that there is a conflict between those two recommendations, but even if we accept the last recommendation, why did the Government not proceed by way of an ordinance to amend the trading hours ordinance so that the matter could come before the Parliament and be subject to the scrutiny of the Parliament. The only reason for the Government proceeding in this way, I suggest, is that it is not game enough to have the matter properly under the scrutiny of the Senate after 1 July. Of course, had it proceeded by ordinance, it would of necessity have had to have that ordinance placed on the table of the Senate and any senator would have been able to move for its disallowance. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other explanation is that the Government is committed to what it feels to be market forces. I regard this as a very serious matter. I hope that the Government understands that now and will understand it later. I regard this move as an attempt by at least one interstate retail chain to impose its will-this is one of the suggestions-upon the governments in Australia. The Managing Director of G. J. Coles and Co. Ltd stated in February of last year that he expected that Saturday afternoon trading, and possibly Sunday trading as well, would be a fact of life within the 1980s. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will now prove to Senator MacGibbon that what I am saying is perfectly correct by pointing out that Lend Lease Corporation in this city manages a number of shopping complexes. As Senator Reid says, Canberra has a number of these shopping complexes. It manages the Boulevard, Cooleman Court, Monaro Mall and Woden Plaza. In 1980, when no shop trading legislation operated in Tasmania, Lend Lease also managed the Eastlands Shopping Centre. I have a letter addressed to Mr B. O'Connor, of O'Connor shoe stores, who leased a property in the Eastlands shopping complex which is managed by Lend Lease Corporation. Mr O'Connor did not wish to trade on Easter Saturday last year. I will quote to the Senate and for Senator MacGibbon's information what Lend Lease said to that retailer:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As an established tenant of this centre you are no doubt aware of the obligation to comply with trading hours as specified by the owners and managers and your failure to comply with those instructions is in effect a breach of that agreement. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> Any future advices on trading hours which are ignored will be treated in a very serious nature. You must realise that your tenancy could be at risk in any similar situation. </PARA>
<PARA>If that is freedom of choice for retailers, I do not know what the meaning of freedom of choice is. What the Government is really doing is giving giant interstate retailers and finance companies such as Lend Lease Corporation an open slather to dictate its terms and to crush the small retailers. I will quote from another letter which I have received from a Mr G. Andre of Canberra. Presumably every other honourable senator has received the letter as well. He says:</PARA>
<PARA> As owners of retail businesses we are most concerned at the proposal of the Federal Government to deregulate shopping hours in the Australian Capital Territory. Particular concern is expressed at the following clause in our leases reading as follows 'the lessee will at all times during the term of the lease keep the demised premises open to trade during the usual business hours of the centre and conduct the lessee's business therein at all times in good faith and in accordance with the best method and in a reputable manner and will not permit or suffer to be committed any illegal or unlawful act on the demised premises. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> This clause caused no concern whilst the hours of operation were subject to Government regulation as we were aware of our obligation. However, should your proposed legislation become law we would be at the mercy of the landlord who would dictate shopping hours. </PARA>
<PARA>I regard the action of the Government as a dereliction of duty. In fact, it is totally inconsistent with the attitude publicly expressed by the member for Denison in his capacity as Minister for the Australian Capital Territory. The shop assistants and small businesses in Tasmania tried to get the Government of that State to abandon the worst features of nineteenth century laissez-faire capitalism and to have regard to the wishes of others, not these sorts of companies I have mentioned-the Lend Lease Corporations of this world. Mr Hodgman said that his decisions were taken having regard to all aspects of the situation and that the principles of good government demanded that the interests of all sections of the community be taken into account-the employers that is, the retailers-shop assistants and the public. Deregulation denies and overrides the interests of the shopping public. It overrides the interests of the small lessee, the small businessman and certainly shop assistants. I would like Senator MacGibbon, if he is still of the same opinion, to deny what is here and now put in the record about the standover tactics that are being used by the firm which manages four of the shopping complexes in the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> To save time, I will refer to the letter which deals with the opposition by small businessmen who are represented by the Meat and Allied Trades Federation of Australia. If any honourable senator has run a butcher shop-I have not, but I know a few people who have-he will know that it is hard yakka. These men have made a great contribution for many years. The Meat and Allied Trades Federation of Australia stated:</PARA>
<PARA>I would emphasise that there has been no consultation whatsoever with various industry groups in Canberra before this decision was taken. </PARA>
<PARA>Furthermore, the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association said the same thing, that there was absolutely no consultation with it prior to this taking place. In fact it made submissions to the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly inquiry and had been given a firm undertaking by the Minister for the Capital Territory that the Government would do nothing about this, would not change the status quo until such time as there was proper consultation. The Government is changing the status quo now. It is no use having the consultations after the horse has bolted. That is not consultation about what ought or ought not occur. That is saying to the people concerned, to the small businessmen, to the shop assistants: 'There it is. It is going to come. How can you best cut your own throat?' That is what the Government is saying. 'You will have your throat cut. How best can we go about cutting it? Do you want it sliced quick smart or do you want a slow dying death?'</PARA>
<PARA> Lawyers draw up these leases which refer to 'demised premises'. I do not know what that means but certainly there will be a lot of demised premises around the place after deregulation occurs because, as every honourable senator ought to know, already there are too many shops in the Australian Capital Territory. When the giants take over and put on specials on Saturday afternoons, Sundays and whenever, what will occur? The shops will be empty. The Government will certainly have plenty of demised premises on its hands. </PARA>
<PARA> I am a supporter of the attitude of the Minister for the Capital Territory in respect of Anzac Day. I believe that Anzac Day is a day which should be properly observed. I understand that there might even be a move to disallow the Ordinance which the Minister for the Capital Territory proclaimed to ensure the proper observance of Anzac Day. However, what is the Government doing in respect of this matter? It is repealing the Trading Hours Ordinance which prevents shops being opened on Anzac Day because the Ordinance prevents shops being opened on any day specified in the Public Holidays Ordinance. On the one hand the Minister quite rightly is seeking the support of the people to ensure the observance of Anzac Day and on the other hand the Government is pressing through this legislation which will enable stores-big stores, small stores, any stores-to open all day every day, 365 days a year and 24 hours in each day if the shopkeepers so desire or if they are directed to open by the owners of the complex. It is in the interests of the owners of the complex if shops do open because, as Senator MacGibbon ought to know, if he saw Nationwide the other night in relation to the Indooroopilly shopping complex, the Westfield owned shopping complex-and I do not know whether this is a fact-some lessees appear to be frightened about their leases. The owners appear to be taking the cream off the top and, of course, for owners of a complex the longer a place is open the more hoot they get from the hardworking lessees. It is an extraordinary situation in which a government which calls itself a loyal Australian Government says to the shopkeepers, 'You can open on Anzac Day all day'. This Government which regards itself as being based on Christian principles is saying to the shopkeepers, 'You can open all day, Christmas Day, Easter Saturday, Good Friday and Easter Sunday'. This Government calls itself a loyal government of the Queen but shops can open on the Queen's Birthday, Canberra Day, Labour Day or any other day. </PARA>

After a great deal of convincing it introduced the shop trading legislation and it abandoned its attitude, which did not fit very well, of market forces prevailing because it knew what that point meant. That Government was told. Let me tell the Senate that this is a matter which is regarded as very important not only by me but also by the small business associations. I have a telegram from the Retail Traders Association of New South Wales asking me to firmly oppose this provision. The Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association, which has a large number of members, is also concerned about the effects which everyone knows will flow from this proposed change and that is the further casualisation of the retail trade, an increased rate of bankruptcies for small businessmen, the extra additional costs to the consumer but certainly not in the short term because the giants will see to that. When they have got a monopoly control of the market they will see that the costs will rise and then they will amortise the losses that they have made in the short term.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This is a government whose supporters talk about support for the family. What is this move going to do to those families of the workers involved in the retail trade, not only the families of the shop assistants but also the families of the small businessmen? Because of the restriction on the time for debate I will not canvass the other matters in this omnibus legislation with which I am concerned and not only things that are in it but also things that are not in it including some things that were mentioned such as the Bendigo Ordnance Factory and also the fact that the Government is not going to proceed with the operation of the Broadcasting Information Office. I refer honourable senators to the speech I made last night, at what time I know not, and in which I expressed my belief that successive governments have pushed into the background this whole question of the monitoring of the standards of quality and excellence and standards of common decency and good taste in broadcasting and television. They have done so by limiting the amount of money that is available to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal in respect of research. Maybe that decision has been taken by the Tribunal, but the Government has not told me who has taken that decision. The Government has now stated that it is not going to proceed with the Broadcasting Information Office. The issue of the monitoring of the standards of excellence and the quality of broadcasting and television is uppermost in the minds of the Australian viewing and listening public. I believe the Government's intention to abolish the very office to which an ordinary person could have registered a complaint and which was designed to investigate that complaint is reprehensible in respect of this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I am just sorry that the time of the Senate is so short that I am unable to expand on this issue. I believe the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney), who is in the chamber, should not get up and in a platitudinous way say: 'Yes, we will agree with Senator Reid.' Senator Reid has asked that the proposed section not be proclaimed until the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory has had an opportunity to inquire into the matters relevant to the implementation of the decision. In other words, does the Government intend to cut its throat or is it going to drown the people in coldcream. This suggestion has come from the chairman of the Joint Committee of the Australian Capital Territory, who said when she started that in principle she supported deregulation. I hope that what the Minister might say in the Committee stage is that the Government intends not to have that part of the legislation proclaimed until such time as the whole issue has been referred for investigation and report and until a substantive piece of legislation can be submitted to the Parliament and determined in a positive manner and until such time as that takes place clause 90 of the legislation, when enacted, will not be proclaimed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Harradine confessed that he had never run a butcher's shop, but he rather carefully butchered the logic of his argument with that rather distorted and convoluted exposition of the landlord and tenant agreement, relating that to the deregulation of trading hours. With the greatest of respect, I say to the honourable senator that that is a complete irrelevance. I do not doubt that there are some points that are grossly unfair in the relationship between some tenants and some landlords, but it is an absurd simplification of the situation to say that, because a tenant has to pay a percentage of his turnover to a landlord, the solution to that problem is to hold back the number of trading hours. That is a nonsense. With respect, that was what the honourable senator's argument was. I would have second thoughts about the commercial judgment of the tenant who entered into that agreement in the first place and I do not really believe that it is the business of the Government to come in and interfere with the market-place in that way, because one of the worst operators in the market-place, even worse than those tenants, is the Government itself. The Government simply does not have the discrimination and the judgment to get involved in those sorts of things. Surely the answer to Senator Harradine's problem is to build more shops and give an opportunity to those traders to hire other premises or to let them raise the money and build other premises themselves.</PARA></TALK.START>

Today we see the problems which have arisen from short-sighted, selfish union policy. We see a lack of skilled tradesmen for the great developmental projects in Australia today. We see a shortage of those skilled tradesmen because the unions have pushed for rises and they have eliminated the relativities for skill which formerly existed in the Australian market. They have pushed for penalty rates for people working on Saturday nights, on Sundays and on public holidays. Until we get away from those penalty rates and get back to paying a differential for skill, the Australian economy will be in trouble and we will have to import people to do those skilled jobs. The argument we have heard in this chamber is just a perversion supporting the vested interests of the unions. They have a cosy arrangement whereby they want to monopolise the supply of all labour in the country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I claim to have been misrepresented and I wish to make a personal explanation. Senator MacGibbon said that my argument against this deregulation proposal was that certain leases included provisions which required the lessee to pay certain amounts of money to the owner of the particular property as a percentage of the takings and that the best way to prevent that sort of exploitation was to have deregulation. I read from a letter from Lend Lease Corporation Pty Ltd, which manages five shopping centres in the Australian Capital Territory. I will table that letter if that is requested. The letter was sent by that Corporation to a lessee of one of its shopping complexes in Hobart, Tasmania, last year. In that letter, the Corporation threatened the lessee with a termination of his lease if the lessee did not obey the instructions of the owners and managers of the complex in regard to shop trading hours. The point simply is that deregulation means that the question of shop trading hours will be dictated, not by the retail industry, not by the consumer, not by the shop assistants union, not by the small businessman, but by people like these finance corporations who have control of these shopping complexes.</PARA></TALK.START>

The matters which are before the Senate in this Bill, together with the other matters dealt with in the Review of Commonwealth Functions, have been a matter of public knowledge now for some six weeks and have been the subject of considerable discussion. As was said in the second reading speech to this Bill, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) announced some 350 decisions aimed at transferring to the private sector and to the States functions more appropriately performed by them and rationalising functions which properly belong to the Commonwealth. The overall objective of the review is to establish conditions under which there can be increased opportunities for all and better care for those in need. As the Prime Minister said in his statement, the immediate aim of the review was to streamline and to fine down Commonwealth operations.</PARA></TALK.START>

With that end in view, the Government set out to reduce duplication to ensure that the functions which were properly performed by the States and by the private sector were performed by them. We believe that is in accord with the wishes of the people of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The debate has been fairly wide-ranging and it would be a matter of regret to Government senators that, because of the pressure of the program, not many have been able to take part in the debate. The debate has, of course, ranged well beyond the measures which are provided for in this Bill. For example, one honourable senator referred to the arrangements for education, with the proposal that there should be the reintroduction of tuition fees for students undertaking second degrees and diplomas. I mention to the Senate and to those people who may be listening to the broadcast of this debate that in fact that particular measure is one of many which are not the subject of this legislation. Those who were listening to that part of the debate would be hard-pressed to realise that what we were discussing was not a proposal to introduce universal fees, but to introduce fees only for those students who are undertaking a second degree. </PARA>
<PARA> I would think that many Australians would feel that, if those other Australians who have had the good fortune to obtain a degree or some form of tertiary or other qualification at public expense decided to pursue a change of career or to pursue studies of a different sort, they might be entitled to make some contribution towards the cost of that education. There is a limit to the extent to which any of us as individuals are entitled to demand from our fellow Australians perpetual subsidies. In that sort of area I think it is important that the line be drawn somewhere, and the Government has drawn it with respect to one's obtaining an initial degree qualification. I think that is a good example of how the debate on all these measures can get out of kilter. The fact is that, if 350 decisions are made aimed at reducing the scope of government, it is inevitable that some people will object. They will object in terms which are often strenuous and in terms which ignore the broader realities with which the Government has to deal. I believe that the legislation, which has its place as part of the Government's move to reduce the size of government in Australia, is legislation which will have the general approval of the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> A great deal of the debate has focused on one relatively small aspect of the legislation, and that is the question of trading hours in the Australian Capital Territory. I suppose that to many people around Australia a good deal of that debate might have been regarded as being focused on something which is of bare relevance to them because it affects only the Australian Capital Territory. Of course, it is a matter which is seen to be of great importance here. I stress that the decision with respect to shopping hours is one which was taken within a range of decisions which looked at the question of government regulation generally. It is not a matter of that area of regulation being singled out solely as being something warranting government attention. In fact, a good number of the Government's regulatory activities came under examination during the Review of Commonwealth Functions. We have endeavoured to reduce the degree of Commonwealth involvement as far as possible. The abolition of the Prices Justification Tribunal was one significant step. The rationalisation of industry assistance advisory functions in and between departments was another. The Government measures which have been signficantly debated in the Parliament and outside to move towards less regulation of the airline industry and to an exposing of the instruments of regulation of the airline industry to the public gaze are another very important step. </PARA>
<PARA> The Industries Assistance Commission is to investigate modifications and improvements to the customs by-law system. Those who have sought to examine that area of government activity and control might well say that that is an area which badly requires modification and improvement because of the complexity which has developed over the many years of its operation. It is in that sort of context that the decision was taken to abolish rent control in the Australian Capital Territory and to deregulate shopping hours. Nobody on this side of the chamber will be at all apologetic about the general principle of reducing the amount of government regulation with which we are faced in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> A good deal of representation has been made since that decision was announced. The Minister for the Capital Territory, Mr Hodgman, has received deputations from groups representing traders at two of the major shopping centres in Canberra, the Belconnen Mall and the Woden Plaza. In addition, he has spoken to groups from all areas of the retail industry and has asked his Department to consult with these and other groups on the implementation of the decision which was announced on 30 April. The groups which have been involved in discussions with the Minister or his Department or with both include the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association, the Australian Association of Independent Businesses, the Canberra Chamber of Commerce, the Confederation of ACT Industry, and the Trades and Labour Council of the Australian Capital Territory. It is true that these groups, in the main, have opposed the decision, although the Chamber of Commerce and the Confederation of Industry support the philosophy behind the decision taken by the Government. Following those consultations, the Minister has agreed to recommend that proclamation of the commencement of the relevant provisions of the Bill should be scheduled for three to four months' time to allow a smooth transition to deregulation. All groups certainly have supported the idea that there should be a delay in the implementation to permit that smooth transition. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has also agreed to establish a monitoring committee, which will be a widely representative committee that will monitor the effects of deregulation. That is important, I think, in the context of the sort of matters raised by Senator Harradine in the debate in which he expressed concern about the effects of deregulation. In fact, the monitoring committee will be a body which will be able to keep an eye on the possibility of the sort of developments suggested by Senator Harradine as certain to occur. What might follow from that is a matter for government decision at the time, but Senator Harradine has flagged certain fears and the Minister has put in place a committee which can monitor the effects of deregulation and report to him if the dangers of which Senator Harradine is concerned develop. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been support of deregulation, principally from large retailers. A degree of horror was expressed in this place at the prospect of Canberra shoppers being faced with the dreadful possibility of there being specials available to them on Saturday afternoons and Sundays. I suggest that plenty of shoppers in Canberra would quite welcome the idea that they will have shops available to them on the weekends and that those shops might be seeking to obtain their custom by offering specials. I think the shock and horror suggested in the debate in this place will not be very representative of the consumers of Canberra, who would like to have the benefit of that sort of activity on the part of retailers. The other matter raised was that of the position of families. I would have thought that many families would welcome the availability of shopping hours at different times of the day, on different days of the week and at hours which they can take advantage of as a family group, whether it is husband and wife or parent and children. The support, as I understand it, for late night shopping in Canberra and in other parts of Australia is evidence of the public demand for greater access to retail trade.</PARA>
<PARA> There is evidence from a recent Bureau of Industry Economics report that in fact flexible trading hours would increase total demand for retail services. This will have the effect of decreasing the increased costs which might be involved in having labour available at different times of the day. All in all, the Government is of the view that it is highly desirable that this sort of deregulation should occur. It is in the public interest. In the end it is the public interest which must determine these matters, not sectional interest. The public interest in this matter is principally the interest of those consumers who are entitled to access to a variety of stores at a variety of times that suit their convenience and not the convenience of proprietors or unionists. Rather, it is the convenience of those who wish to shop that ought to be the major determinant of when shops are open. One could not hope to get the sort of cosy agreement which sometimes occurs in this place in regard to legislation. Indeed, most members of the public are suprised to find that there is little or no disagreement on the great bulk of legislation that goes through the Parliament. But this Bill and many elements of its represent a difference in attitude between the Government and the Opposition. The Government is opting for less regulation and less interference. That is something which many honourable senators opposite find disagreeable. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Reid has been mentioned in dispatches during the course of the debate as well as making a contribution to the debate herself. She raised the question of the role of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory. Mr Hodgman has agreed that there should be a reference to the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory with respect to this matter. The Joint Committee would be required to report on the process of deregulation of trading hours and the steps for the implementation of the decision. That process is one which I think Senator Harradine indicated he would not find satisfactory; it did not go to the point he raised. But the important thing about that proposal which was put forward by Senator Reid and which has been accepted by the Minister is that it provides another avenue in addition to the monitoring committee established by the Minister to ensure that if there were to develop the sort of problems and abuses which some of those who are opposed to the legislation suggested would develop, they would be immediately brought to the attention of the Minister and the Government which could then consider what action was appropriate in the light of those abuses. </PARA>
<PARA> I make that statement not believing that abuses will occur but simply to calm the fears of those who with equal certainly believe that they will. I say to them that this legislation in no way puts it beyond the power of the Government to intervene in any situation in which it appears that intervention is required in the public interest. I commend this legislation to the Senate. I believe that in those areas where there is a common cause in this chamber on the need for government interevention, not least in many of the areas which are the concern of my own portfolio responsibilities in social security, we do in fact have a common interest in reducing the amount of government which is devoted to non-essential items. </PARA>
<PARA> If we are to make a better effort in areas of concern to senators such as Senator Cavanagh and Senator Peter Baume, in building more houses for Aboriginals and spending more on Aboriginal health services; if we are to be concerned about the situation of pensioners who require supplementary assistance to perhaps a greater extent than they receive it now-whatever our concerns in making a greater contribution to the public good-it is important that we minimise the Government's contribution in those areas where it is not necessary. It goes without saying that with 350 decisions being taken, there will be differences of opinion. There would not be one decision which would not be opposed somewhere in the Australian community but I believe that the broad line followed by the decisions is right in the national interest and will equip us as a government to do better those things which only we as a government can do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At this Committee stage I wish to place on record my opposition to the provision in this clause to deregulate shopping hours in the Australian Capital Territory. The case for opposition to this provision has been very ably put in the debate on the motion for the second reading by my colleague, Senator Mulvihill. Indeed, there is very little I can add to the case he made.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A man of the people indeed. Senator Harradine also argued very ably that deregulation of shopping hours in the Australian Capital Territory is bad news for the small business people, for the shop-assistants whose jobs are disappearing at a rapid rate anyway-the disappearance of those jobs will be accelerated by this proposal-and, of course, ultimately for the consumers, the ordinary shoppers in the Australian Capital Territory because they will lose the services offered by the small shopkeepers as they are forced out of business by this measure. They will lose the services of the permanent, properly trained shop-assistants who will be forced out of their jobs to be replaced by temporary casuals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I say too that this provision is just another example of the contempt with which the Fraser Government treats the Australian Capital Territory and of the incompetence of the Minister for the Capital Territory, Mr Michael Hodgman. This provision is opposed by most people living and working in the Australian Capital Territory and is supported, as far as I know, by nobody living and working in the Australian Capital Territory. I understand that Senator Reid supported the provision so I must exclude Senator Reid from my remarks. Certainly, I have received no submissions in support of deregulation. I understand that some interstate big business interests which run large chain stores believe it would be to their advantage to be able to stay open of a Saturday afternoon and force the small shopkeepers out of business, but they have not approached me. On the other hand, I have had hundreds of representations from people who work in the retailing business or who have invested their livelihoods into small shops and who rightly fear that this deregulation will be against their interests. </PARA>
<PARA> I can only urge honourable senators opposite to consider at this stage what we are asking them to do. We are asking them to vote against a provision which nobody in the Australian Capital Territory, with the exception of Senator Reid, wants. The provision was never the result of consultation with the elected representatives of the Australian Capital Territory. </PARA>

The interests that will be served by this measure are not local. The Minister, with his usual contempt, did not consult the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly and the elected representatives of this Parliament; nor did he consult the trade union movement or the shopkeepers' associations. There is no reason at all to support this provision. There is every reason, I suggest, to oppose it. I urge honourable senators sitting opposite to act in the interests of the Australian Capital Territory citizens and oppose this measure. They should do so as there is no Australian Capital Territory legislative body to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I recognise that the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) who was in the chamber earlier does not represent the Minister for the Australian Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) in this place and therefore may not have fully stated the situation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me refer to the several matters which were raised. I deal firstly with those raised by Senator Ryan. Without entering into the debate about the principle of regulation of shopping hours I point out that in regard to the question of consultation with groups within the Australian Capital Territory the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) received deputations from groups representing traders at two of the major shopping centres in Canberra, the Belconnen Mall and Woden Plaza. In addition, the Minister has spoken to groups from all areas of the retail industry and asked his Department to consult with those other groups on the implementation of the decision. The groups concerned are the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association, the Australian Association of Independent Businesses, the Canberra Chamber of Commerce, the Confederation of Australian Capital Territory Industry and the Trades and Labour Council of the Australian Capital Territory.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought these would have been interesting to Senator Harradine. All these groups have opposed the decision, although the Chamber of Commerce and the Confederation of Industry support the philosophy behind the decision. As a result of those consultations the Minister has agreed to recommend that proclamation of the commencement of the relevant provisions of this Bill be scheduled in three to four months time in order to allow a smooth transition to deregulation. All groups have supported that approach. In addition, the Minister, at the suggestion of members and of interested persons, will establish a widely representative committee to monitor the effects of deregulation. As to the specific question which Senator Harradine asked, the Government's decision is in line with its philosophy to stand away from the question of regulation of shopping hours in the Australian Capital Territory and has provided for the smooth implementation of that process in the way in which I have just outlined.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe that the question of the monitoring committee has been refined more closely. Following discussions with the Minister for the Capital Territory, Mr Hodgman, and others there will be a reference to the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Australian Capital Territory. The Joint Committee would be required to report on the process of deregulation of shopping hours and steps for implementation of that decision.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to try to analyse precisely what we have been told. As I see it we are being told nothing. We are being told that the deregulation will occur in any event. The groups will be brought together and they will have some say as to how they will cut their own throats. That is what it appears to me to be. Let me make it perfectly clear that there was no consultation whatsoever with the retailers, the shop assistants and the public about this question before the decision was made. There was none whatsoever. That is in contradistinction to the publicly stated attitude of the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) who stated that the principles of good government demand that the interests of the retailers, the shop assistants and, not less, the shopping public should be taken into account when the government determines these matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are being told by the Minister that there is now no movement at all by the Government. We are told that it will not backtrack on its headlong attitude on this matter. The Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) totally ignored the evidence that I produced to the Senate to the effect that deregulation will have the effect of ensuring that managers of shopping complexes will have the say in respect of shop trading hours. He ignored the document from which I read from the Lend Lease Corporation which stated quite bluntly what Lend Lease would do if a particular retailer, small businessman or lessee did not comply with trading hours as specified by the owners and managers. I repeat, for the information of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner)-he was not in the chamber, from memory-what Lend Lease said. It wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> Any future advices on trading hours which are ignored will be treated in a very serious nature. You must realise that your tenancy could be at risk in any similar situation. </PARA>
<PARA>This statement comes from the very company which manages the Boulevard, Cooleman Court, Monaro Mall and Woden Plaza. It is all very well for the Minister to say the monitoring committee will have a look at that matter. What a lot of nonsense! What will the monitoring committee do? Will an ordinance be introduced and regulations commenced when the Government is committed against regulations?</PARA>
<PARA> The second matter relates to the Minister's comment about having these monitoring committees to, as he says, report on the process of deregulation. This totally ignores what will happen to the jobs of shop assistants in the meantime and, more importantly, what will happen to the opportunities for full time jobs in the retail trade. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me refer to G. J. Coles and Co. Ltd, a company which is behind the push for open slather trading. Let me show what has happened in Coles in Queensland. There, the percentage of those employed full time in stores which open all day Saturday has dropped markedly. In regard to the employment of union members in Coles New World supermarkets in Queensland where six day trading, Monday to Saturday inclusive occurs, the full time percentage is 6.4 per cent, the part time percentage is 0.9 per cent, the casual percentage is 65.1 per cent and night fillers constitute 17.6 per cent. In those Coles supermarkets in Queensland which trade for five and a half days a week, the full time percentage is 21.5 per cent, part time 0.2 per cent, casual, 60.9 per cent, and night fillers, the same, 17.4 per cent. Those figures show the comparison. In the seven stores that trade all day on Saturday, there is a drop of more than 5 per cent in the number of full time employees compared with the stores that trade for five and a half days a week. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation is not only leading to the casualisation of the retail trade in closing off job opportunities for young unemployed looking for full time work but also providing for an increase in the participation rate of school children in the work force. It may come as a surprise to honourable senators that, whereas in 1972, the participation rate of full time school students in the paid work force was something like 4 per cent, the participation of full time students now in the paid work force is between 26 per cent and 35 per cent. It is extraordinary that we have a situation in which the Government, on top of this casualisation, is now attempting to deregulate shop trading hours in the Australian Capital Territory and worsen the situation for unemployed youth seeking full time work in this city. It is just not on. I regard this as a regrettable circumstance. As I said in my speech during the second reading debate, certain people are seeking to make Canberra a social laboratory for their commercial experiments. Certain major interstate retailers and international finance companies which own shopping complexes would like to see Canberra made the guinea pig for their commercial experiments. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Social Security in his reply to the second reading debate mentioned the Bureau of Industry Economics. He referred to a paper from the Bureau of Industry Economics which was 'designed to elicit constructive comment and debate'. A number of statements are made in the paper. The first question that has to be asked about this paper is: Who commissioned it and what was the Bureau of Industry Economics doing involving itself in a sphere which is the proper sphere of State governments, namely, the regulation of retail trading hours? If the Government does not believe me when I say that this is a proper matter for State governments, let me refer to the statement by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) on 22 April 1981. He made comments about foreign investment proposals for British Petroleum and Caltex 'convenience stores'. We should not forget that these so-called convenience neighbourhood stores, which are to be tied to the oil company outlets, are on the horizon. This is part of the operation that is taking place. The Treasurer, in the final paragraph of his statement, said:</PARA>
<PARA> In taking its decision on this matter the Government noted that a number of State governments were not in favour of oil companies extending the range of products sold by service stations. They were concerned because the range of services offered by convenience stores has traditionally been provided by and would be in direct competition with the small business sector. The Government, however, considers that the regulation of such developments was more appropriately a matter for the States. </PARA>
<PARA>What business is it of the Bureau of Industry Economics to go into the question of shop trading hours? Furthermore, I noticed in the report of Estimates Committee H that four of the research staff of the Bureau of Industry Economics are engaged in a study of the impact of technological change in the service sector, with particular reference to the finance and retailing industry. If the razor gang wanted to cut something off the fat, why did it not cut that off the fat? There are half a dozen such inquiries. There has already been the Committee of Inquiry into Technological Change in Australia. If such an inquiry were to be established, it ought to be a tripartite inquiry-in other words, representatives of the retailers, the shop assistants union and other unions involved and perhaps a representative of the public. What right has the Bureau of Industry Economics to do that? Four full time, fat cat, well paid public servants are sitting in their ivory towers telling the retail trade what to do. If Sir Phillip Lynch-this is a group in his Department-had any concern for the taxpayers' money he should have chopped out that section for a start. That brings me to my final question of the Minister. I ask: Just what is the Government saving in this particular exercise? Can he tell us what it will save? The Government is not saving anything. The effect of this measure will have ramifications throughout the length and breadth of Australia. I guarantee that all honourable senators and all members in the other place will feel it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a quick question to ask of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner). As a member of the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory, I am interested in the possibility that this matter will be referred to the Committee, of which Senator Reid is the chairperson.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7V4">Senator GEORGES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;She may be, but that is countered by the fact that I heartily disagree. I see this move as resulting in a harsh and unnecessary increase in competition across extended hours that will enslave not only small businesses but also the employees therein. Let us consider the experience of past years when there was no regulation of trading hours. It meant that concerns in competition with one another stayed open for extended hours-long hours-right across the day and sometimes into the early hours of the morning because their opposition was open. That is what I mean by enslavement. I think that that has been covered. The question I am asking is: Why was the matter not referred by the Minister for the Capital Territory to the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory for it to carry out a thorough investigation? It seems to me that this is a plan on the part of the Liberal Party to casualise and privatise Australian society. If honourable senators look at what has happened in undeveloped countries and other places in South East Asia they will see exactly this philosophy at work. It is planned; it is deliberate. It seems to me that the thin edge of the wedge is being thrust at the Australian Capital Territory.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to say a few words about clause 90. Both Senator Georges and Senator Harradine have sounded a very grave warning to every other State in Australia because the repeal of clause 90, which applies to the Australian Capital Territory, is, as my colleague Senator Georges said, just the thin end of the wedge. Senator MacGibbon let the cat out of the bag when he blamed payments to the trade unionists of penalty rates and holiday pay for the low profitability of big business. It is quite evident that this matter has been discussed in his party room. He has let the cat out of the bag by his remarks. We know what is already taking place in the supermarkets. In my State of South Australia there is very little permanent employment now. Married women are being employed for three hours a day and when their three hours are up another group of people is brought in for three hours, which takes those people up to the time when school comes out and then a group of school girls and boys are put on to do the work at lower rates of pay than casual adults get.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We must bear in mind that the people on casual rates do not get paid sick pay, holiday pay or long service leave. Nothing is built into their pay. The result is that things are not cheaper to the consumer but greater profits are being put into the pockets of big business. That is the whole crux of the matter. Senator MacGibbon conveniently let the cat out of the bag. That is the whole purpose of clause 90. It will be the thin end of the wedge. The Government will say to the people: 'It is operating in the Australian Capital Territory. Let us try it in the other States'. The trade union movement should heed the warning in this regard. Strength to its arm when it opposes it in the other States. It should not let itself be fooled by what the Government is doing here by usurping the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission by legislating in this fashion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will answer the points raised, in particular, by Senator Harradine and Senator Georges, who both touched on the same matter. Senator Georges sought information as to why the matter was not referred to the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory in the first place. Quite clearly-I think this answers substantially the points which Senator Harradine made-the Australian Capital Territory matter, along with all of those which are included in the total package of this legislation, as well as the report which was brought down on 30 April by the Review of Commonwealth Functions committee, was not made public. None of the matters included therein was made public for discussion in advance of the release of the report. That, of course, was an essential element of the report which was brought down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The matters which Senator Harradine raised during this discussion-I understand from what he said that he also brought those matters forward in his speech on the motion for the second reading of the Bill-clearly would be the subject of suitable submissions by him and others to the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory and to the monitoring bodies. Consequently, we would expect that to occur. The outcome of the inquiries made by those two committees-the monitoring committee and the Australian Capital Territory Committee-would be a matter for Government decision following receipt of that report and appropriate consideration. Senator Harradine asked what savings would transpire as a result of the implementation of this decision. Clearly, there will be no savings. This is a matter of the implementation of philosophy in terms of the Government's approach to the question of shopping hours generally and the question of deregulation. </PARA>

Does he not agree with me that the increased casualisation of an already deeply casualised industry is a bad thing for the future full time job opportunities for young people in the city of Canberra? If he does, and if it is proven after the implementation of the deregulation that stores on a percentage basis are employing fewer full timers and more casuals, will the Government introduce regulations to govern shop trading hours? If it is found that small businessmen in shopping complexes-those who are owner-operators and cannot afford staff-are forced into slavery because of extended trading hours either by virtue of the dictates of the owners or managers of those shopping complexes or by the economic circumstances generated by the Government's decision, will that result in the Government introducing another ordinance or placing legislation before this Parliament?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That does not answer the question I raised. What is the use of anybody raising a matter now when the Government has said that it intends to proceed with the deregulation? The only purpose of the monitoring committee and the reference to the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Australian Capital Territory, of which Senator Georges is a member, is to wield the axe in as gentle a way as possible. Their job is to cut the throats of the full time shop assistants and the small businessmen in as gentle a way as possible. That is precisely what the legislation means.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) an honest question. I want to know whether the Government will respond by an ordinance or by legislation if it is proved that this action will cause the casualisation of industry, as it has done in other places, and force a number of small businessmen out of business. Will the Government react if this happens? What will happen if stores open on Sundays or on public holidays? What will the Government do then? I do not know whether the Minister heard my speech in the second reading debate. However, I pointed out to the Minister who represents in this chamber the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) that I support in principle the Government's attitude that Anzac Day should be properly observed. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment we are discussing proposed deregulation under clause 90 of the Bill. This clause proposes the repeal of the trading hours ordinances. The Trading Hours Ordinance 1962, which this legislation seeks to repeal, states that the shops in question cannot open on a day that is a public holiday in the Territory or in part of the Territory in which the shop is situated. The Trading Hours Ordinance that we are asked under this clause to repeal defines 'public holiday' as meaning, in relation to the Territory, or part of the Territory, a day that is observed as a public holiday in the Territory, or in the part of the Territory, by virtue of the Holidays Ordinance 1958. The Holidays Ordinance 1958 stipulates the holidays as New Year's Day, Australia Day, Good Friday, the Saturday following Good Friday, the Monday following Good Friday, Anzac Day, Labor Day, Christmas Day and Boxing Day, as I see it, and certainly Anzac Day. </PARA>
<PARA> What I want to know from the Government is how it considers itself to be consistent in its attitude when on the one hand it seeks to repeal the trading hours ordinances and to allow open slather trading, including trading on Anzac Day and all other holidays whether of religious significance or not, and then turns around and asks the Committee to support a proposition in respect of the proper observance of Anzac Day which, of course, in principle I would support. But how can I support a government which completely ignores that principle and says to the big retailers, to any retailers 'No matter about Anzac Day; make your quid out of them. As they come back from the march, grab them'?</PARA>

If a decision takes into account the factors which Senator Harradine has outlined during his speech and does in fact bring down recommendations of the kind that he has mentioned, clearly the Government would have to take them into account in coming to a decision to implement a proposal. It is that which the Government has given an undertaking in connection with and, in terms of what the final decision will be, that is a matter for proper consideration by the Government at the appropriate time.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I apologise for having to take up the time of the Committee but this is an extremely important matter, as Government supporters will find out at a later stage from the people of Australia. What evidence was gained from the people of Canberra which indicated that they sought to have the repeal of the trading hours ordinances? In the second reading speech the Minister attempted to speak on behalf of the people of Canberra. I ask the Government: What survey was done by the Government in respect of this matter to find out the interests and the attitudes of the people of Canberra? I refer the Minister to a survey carried out in Tasmania in the division of Denison, the electorate of the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman). These are the official figures for the Tasmanian opinion poll. Of the people surveyed in the division of Denison, 22.5 per cent said they did not want any weekend trading at all. Only 58.6 per cent wanted Saturday morning only trading, and only 15.2 per cent wanted all day Saturday trading. Only 15.2 per cent of those surveyed by this professional survey in Denison, the electorate of the Minister for the Capital Territory, wanted all day Saturday trading, and only one per cent wanted all day Sunday trading.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind the Committee that it was the managing director of G. J. Coles Pty Ltd who said in February last year that it was his opinion that all day Saturday trading and probably all day Sunday trading as well would be a fact of life which would emerge during the 1980s. The Minister in his reply has ignored the other point that I have made, and I want him to address himself to it; that is, that all this Bill does is to encourage the use of casual school labour at the expense of full time jobs for young workers. Australian Bureau of Statistics figures indicate that as at January 1981 the participation rate of 16-year-olds attending school in the paid work force was 33.6 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I understand the argument that is running on the other side of the chamber, it is really an argument against any change at all in the Australian commercial world. Certainly there will be some change, but there has inevitably been change since time began. If we go around the cities, we will find very few lamplighters today in Sydney or Melbourne. It might come as a surprise to Senator Ryan, but there really are not people out with brushes over their shoulders. Those people have moved into other industries, and that is all that will happen here. Does the casualisation of labour that Senator Harradine has made such a thing out of really matter? Does anyone here really believe children are being exploited, that they are working for nothing? More importantly, are they being driven to work? They are not. They are doing it of their own volition, and I say good luck to them. They are displaying a bit of initiative to do something for themselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Since this matter has been raised, I should like to talk about it for a minute. Since the Government announced that it was looking at the idea of selling Trans-Australia Airlines-almost certainly it will go down that path, with great benefits to the Australian community-it is very interesting to look at the surveys which have been published and which show the support in the community for the selling of TAA. If honourable senators would look at the support as it is laid off against age groups, they would find the highest level of support in the under 45 years age group. The percentage increases as the group gets younger. It is rather bad news, I would suggest, for the Opposition because it shows very clearly that the old socialistic beliefs that the Government can do everything for people do not have the hold in the younger community that they had 20 to 30 years ago. I think that is a good thing. It shows that the Australian community is maturing. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things that Senator Georges in his wandering statement a little while ago said was that underdeveloped countries are the only countries which have unrestricted trading. I may be wrong, but I think Senator Georges said something about Asian countries. </PARA>

I remind the Committee that the Minister for the Capital Territory forthrightly and quite rightly made the statement that matters such as this must be dealt with and that good government requires that the interests of the retailers, the shop assistants and the buying public should be taken into consideration when decisions are made on this matter. That has not been done. There has been no consultation with the retailers or with the shop assistants. I asked the Minister-he has not replied-what sort of survey has been undertaken to ascertain how the people of the Australian Capital Territory feel about this.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank honourable senators. I hope the Minister will now be able to have a look at it. I hope we can have his comments on that document which indicates precisely what will occur if this takes place. I feel that Senator MacGibbon's intervention at this stage was unwarranted. The matter was dealt with by the preceding speaker. I point out to Senator MacGibbon that almost 40,000 jobs have been lost in the retail trade over the period as indicated in the document that was incorporated, I think, by Senator Mulvihill. If that is something to be praised by the Government, be it on its head. The loss of 40,000 full time jobs since the introduction of late night shopping has caused a massive loss of full time jobs in the retail industry. At the same time it has caused the big increase in the number of casuals. The Minister has not adequately responded to my pointing out the participation rate of school children in the work force, I hope that, during the suspension of the sitting, the Minister for the Capital Territory might well consider whether the investigations by the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory should take place before any decision is made in respect of the proclamation of the Act. Frankly, I would not have spoken at all at length had I believed that the Minister would have given a guarantee that, before any decision is made on the proclamation of this Act, the Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory and other committees involved would meet and a report would be made to the Parliament in accordance with the procedures laid down and suggested by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs so that positive legislation is introduced in the Parliament on this very important matter.</PARA></TALK.START>

He had been listening to the debate and he confirmed that, since late night trading began, prices in that area have increased by 6 per cent. Before the Minister replies, I point out that the replies to date have been totally inadequate. I suggest that there are four matters upon which the Government has not given adequate replies. One further matter which requires a reply is whether those particular inquiries are going to be undertaken before the clause is assented to and whether the Parliament will have the opportunity of debating and determining the issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Finally, does the Minister realise that the action now being proposed by the Government to deregulate shop trading hours is contrary to the recommendation of the experts at the International Labour Organisation meeting in Geneva, held between 4 May and 8 May of this year, on the relationship between the hours of work and shop and bank opening hours? This was a meeting about which the Government ought to know-it is not a matter for mirth-and on which it ought to have an answer. A concensus was reached at that meeting that the best interests of all concerned would be served by these matters being dealt with by legislation, regulation or collective bargaining where the participants had that power, and only after the fullest possible discussions have taken place with all those concerned. That is a vital matter. </PARA>
<PARA> Having asked those questions of the Minister, I remind all honourable senators that in voting against this clause they would not necessarily be voting against the Government's razor gang decision. A Government senator can vote against this proposition with a clear conscience, and that would not nullify the decision of the razor gang. It would simply throw back to the Minister for the Capital Territory the onus of bringing down an amendment to the trading hours ordinance, which of course would be subject to debate in the Parliament on this issue alone. I am only sorry that, because of the Government's intention to include this in an omnibus piece of legislation, time does not permit the Senate to go into this matter with the full consideration that it justly deserves. What happens here tonight will have ramifications throughout the length and breadth of Australia. I expect that the Minister and those behind him would understand that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Part IV of the Bill is concerned with the future of the Australian Wool Testing Authority which was mentioned earlier this afternoon by Senator Chipp. Very few of these razor gang decisions demonstrate more clearly the fortuity and futility of this exercise than the decision announced in its original form to sell the Australian Wool Testing Authority to the private sector. It is a testimony to the fundamental incompetence of the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) that this decision ever appeared in the razor gang report. I suspect that neither the Minister nor the razor gang committee, which of course includes Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, had any understanding at all of this matter. The matter was considered in the context of the sale of government assets, the liquidation of capital. Since the Wool Testing Authority's assets have a market value in the vicinity of $10m, it was assumed by Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle and by the other Ministers on the committee that the Government would gain $10m in revenue if the Wool Testing Authority were sold. One could excuse Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle for reaching that conclusion. One cannot be so charitable to the Minister for Primary Industry because the arrangements are such that the proceeds from the sale of the Wool Testing Authority would accrue, not to the Commonwealth Government but to the Wool Industry Trust Account.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, this decision was announced along with dozens, or perhaps even hundreds, of equally ill-considered decisions outlined in the razor gang report and the Government was stuck with the consequences. The decision does not provide any money for the Government; it does not save the Government any recurring expenditure and therefore the question arose of what was the point in making the decision. Somewhat predictably, that question was asked by the wool industry itself. By 'wool industry' I mean not only the farmers who produce wool but also the International Wool Textile Organisation which involves the wool buyers who are mostly domiciled outside Australia. Nobody could find any rational reason on any grounds for disposal of the authority. That problem caused the Minister for Primary Industry, when this legislation passed through the House of Representatives, and the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) who represents him in this place, to waffle on with statements such as that this legislation will facilitate the implementation of a decision, if a decision should subsequently be made to sell the Australian Wool Testing Authority. There were references to the establishment of a foundation to administer the Wool Testing Authority as well as, in typical National Country Party style, guarantees of consultation with the Australian Wool Corporation before the actual enactment of this decision or any action is taken to sell the Authority, the possible sale of which is facilitated by this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Wool Corporation, in keeping with the Australian Wool Council and various State based wool grower organisations, made its opinions very clear to the Government and to the Minister. It does not want any change. It wants the Australian Wool Testing Authority to continue to operate on its present basis. So, it is quite spurious to suggest that consultation with the Wool Corporation or any other organisation associated with the wool industry is necessary or has any relevance. The Australian Wool Corporation and all the other groups have made it perfectly clear that they want the Wool Testing Authority to continue to operate in precisely the way that it operates now. Because of the fundamental incompetence, ignorance and negligence of the Minister for Primary Industry, the Government is saddled with this embarrassing announcement contained in the razor gang report. I confess that I do not know where the Government intends to go from here. </PARA>
<PARA> The clause which is before the Committee facilitates, as the Minister says, the implementation of a decision to dispose of the Wool Testing Authority to the private sector. However, it does not make such a disposal obligatory or mandatory. I suspect either that the Government hopes that the present very strong objection to this proposal which has come from the Australian Wool Corporation and all the other wool industry bodies will gradually fade away and that the Government may then be able to sell the Authority as it has stated it intends to do. Alternatively-my colleague John Kerin said something similar in the House of Representatives-I suspect that this is in fact a face saving device and that the Government's real hope is that this issue will slowly fade away, that the Bill will be passed but that in six months' time nobody will be particularly conscious of the fact that the Government said some time in the past that it was going to proceed with some stupid decision to sell the Wool Testing Authority. I suspect that that is the case, that the Government hopes the issue will fade away and that the Wool Testing Authority will continue to operate as a segment of the Australian Wool Corporation, as it has done for many years. Of course, that assessment could be wrong. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, the Opposition is strongly committed to the maintenance of the Australian Wool Testing Authority in its present form as a de facto agency of the Government of Australia. Certificates of quality issued by that Testing Authority therefore carry the imprimatur, the guarantee and the prestige of the Government of Australia. We still have some prestige in spite of the present Government being what it is. Honourable senators should have the opportunity to ensure that the Wool Testing Authority continues to operate in the future in precisely the same way as it has done in the past. I observe in passing that the same attitude was taken by members of the Labor Party in the House of Representatives, as is normally the case, and that two members of the Liberal Party crossed the floor of the House and voted with the Labor Party in an attempt to ensure that the Wool Testing Authority would continue to operate on the same excellent basis as it has done in the past. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is undoubtedly correct. I am not in conflict with what Senator McLaren has said, but the fact remains that two members of the Liberal Party had the common sense and moral courage to stand up and be counted in the House of Representatives as supporters of the wool industry. No members of the Country Party had the common sense or the courage to do so. We are giving the Country Party an opportunity, in opposing Part IV of the Bill, to ensure that the Wool Testing Authority continues to operate 'in precisely the same way as it does now'. Those were the words of the Country Party's own Minister who said that the Government's intention was to ensure that the Wool Testing Authority continues to operate in precisely the same way as it does now. That is what Mr Nixon, the Country Party Minister, said.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Walsh has drawn attention to the main thrust, I think, of the concern in the community in regard to this matter. It has been publicised in some degree not only in the Parliament but also in the media in recent weeks. Certainly, the vociferous opposition to the proposed sale of the Australian Wool Testing Authority has caused concern to customers that there might be some change under the new ownership proposed by this legislation so as to cause some doubt as to the validity or otherwise of the certificates which may be offered by the Authority. That certainly is not the intention of the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that the Minister for Primary Industry, the Honourable Peter Nixon, made this perfectly clear in his media release on 15 May. He said that the fundamental aim was to ensure that the Australian Wool Testing Authority continued to operate in precisely the same way as it does today. We are talking about a continuation of the operations so as to ensure that the quality of certificates which are made available remains high. We are talking about the ownership of the organisation being in the general community. It is clear that the Government has the fullest possible intention of consulting with the Australian Wool Corporation as the various steps are undertaken towards the implementation of that goal. That remains the Government's position in this matter. It will ensure that the highest possible degree of concern is expressed in any stage of development of this process. The Government would like to assure the wool growers of Australia that in the event of the sale occurring, as it undoubtedly will because the organisation is, in fact, a profitable one, it will have regard to the maximum level of validity of the certificates of the Wool Testing Authority. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) claimed that the Government's objective is to ensure, as stated by the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) on 15 May, that the Australian Wool Testing Authority continues to operate in precisely the same way as it does now. The way to ensure that is to cross the floor and vote with the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats. Negativing this clause of the Bill will ensure that the Wool Testing Authority does just that and that it will continue to operate in precisely the same way as it does now. If the Minister really believed what he said on that day and if he knew what he was doing-quite clearly he does not on this issue among many others-he would have ensured that the stupid recommendation made by the razor gang had never come down. The Government cannot have it both ways. If it wants to ensure that the Wool Corporation continues to operate in the way that it does now it will drop this stupid provision from this Bill. On the other hand, if it does not want the Wool Testing Authority to operate in the same way as it does now, it would act upon the recommendation contained in the razor gang report, that is, to sell the Wool Testing Authority to the private sector-an action which is very vigorously opposed by the Opposition for a variety of reasons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government cannot have it both ways. If it is to go through the farcical, face saving exercise of setting up some sort of foundation, some pseudo, bogus or quasi statutory authority to control the Wool Testing Authority in a similar way to that in which it is now controlled by the Australian Wool Corporation, what it will in fact do, is establish two statutory authorities where one statutory authority previously existed, which is of course the antithesis of one of the major proclaimed objectives of the razor gang report. The plain fact is that the Government is highly embarrassed by this issue. It is on the hook over this issue because of the fundamental incompetence, stupidity and ignorance of the Minister for Primary Industry. Liberal senators who are sitting in the chamber now are embarrassed by this because of their alliance with the National Country Party. Serve them right for going into an alliance with the Country Party in the first place. But if Government senators really want to ensure that the Wool Testing Authority continues to operate in the way the wool industry at all levels has made it perfectly clear it wishes the Authority to continue to operate, and in the way that the Minister for Primary Industry claims the Government wants it to continue-that is, in precisely the same way it is doing now-those Government senators will cross the floor and vote with the Labor Party to knock out this part of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> If they decline to do so only two conclusions are possible, the most charitable of which is that Government senators, like the Minister, do not know what they are doing. In most cases I suspect that would be true. The less charitable conclusion is that they are hypocrites who are willing to pay lip-service to the stated objective of ensuring that the Wool Testing Authority operates in precisely the same way as it does now but they are not willing to record their votes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I find it very hard to believe the statement of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) that the Australian Wool Testing Authority will operate in exactly the same way as it has operated before. He expects the Senate to believe the assurance he has given on behalf of the Government when over 95 per cent of the assurances given in policy speeches by this Government since 1975 have been broken. The Government has not honoured its assurances to anybody-primary producers, ordinary citizens, or anyone else. Yet spelt out in this very document, with which this Bill is associated, that is, the Review of Commonwealth Functions report, in attachment A, under the heading 'Assets to be sold', we see that the Wool Testing Authority is named. Now we find the Minister saying, in answer to a question by Senator Walsh, that the Authority will operate in the same way as it operated before. Senator Walsh raised the matter of a statutory authority. If the Wool Testing Authority is put under a statutory authority we could well see another burden placed on the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations. In the Senate Notice Paper, nearly half a page is devoted to listing the statutory authorities that are being investigated by that Committee under the chairmanship of Senator Rae. It could well be that 18 months from now this will be another statutory body which will be referred to that Committee for investigation. The Authority has been operating satisfactorily. It has operated to the satisfaction of all Australian woolgrowers. Why should it be changed? As I understand the Minister to say that, prior to the razor gang making its decision to sell the Australian Wool Testing Authority, it had had consultations with people in the industry-that is, organisations representing woolgrowers-I ask the Minister for the names of those organisations with which the razor gang had consultations. I seek an answer to that question before I ask any more questions.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) for his answer. He has now made the record clear. There has been no consultation at all with the people who are vitally concerned with the proposed sale of the Australian Wool Testing Authority, that is, the woolgrowers of this country who have to depend on overseas markets to sell their wool. As I pointed out last week in debating another piece of legislation before this chamber, many representatives of woolgrowers organisations are fearful of the fact that the Government is to dispose of the Authority. They are concerned that the Authority will lack credibility in the eyes of overseas buyers if it operates in the same way as private enterprise operates.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is no guarantee that the Authority will be under the control of the Australian Wool Corporation. Part IV of the Bill contains certain provisions to be undertaken by the Corporation 'if directed' by the Minister for Primary Industry. The words 'shall if so directed' by the Minister appear throughout the Bill in relation to what may be done. Of course, knowing the policy of this Government, the present Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) could direct in any way he liked with the result that some of his wealthy mates in private enterprise might get hold of the Authority. This could sound the death knell of the wool industry. As Senator Walsh said, this is the testing point for those people from cocky's corner, as members of the National Country Party are often referred to. Are they going to support the people who have supported them over the years? Let them forget about the Liberal Party. We know that it is only a facade when the Liberal Party says that it is interested in country people. The people from cockies corner should come over to this side of the Chamber and support those who have supported country people in the past. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Temporary Chairman, I have been waiting about 4 1/2 hours to utter about four sentences which I shall now produce on the question of bankruptcy. It is important however, I think, to indicate the Opposition's hostility to this Part of the legislation along indeed with most of the others even though, pervaded as we are by a healthy sense of realism, we shall not pursue this opposition to the point of a division. What we object to here is the hiving off of a significant proportion of bankruptcy administrations to public accountants in private practice. This is another decision which clearly is the product of ideology rather than any rational argument, with no justification whatsover being offered for this move. Certainly, no consultation has been undertaken with either the accountancy or legal professions, this being in marked contrast with the United Kingdom Green Paper exercise of last year which, as might have been expected with a Thatcherite government of a similar ideological bent, brought forward proposals of this kind, but which proposals were followed by consultation with the accountancy and legal professions and resulted in a very trenchant battery of criticism being directed against proposals to hive off matters to the private sector without there being an articulate justification for the public sector administrations being reduced in this way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To come to my fifth and last sentence-I see that Senator Puplick has been keeping count-there has been no complaint, as I understand it, about the way in which bankruptcy administrations are being conducted within the Department at the moment. The only exception is complaint in terms of the delays that have arisen as a result of two phenomena, one being the staff ceilings, which here, as elsewhere, have made it very difficult for public administrators to keep up with the pressures upon them, and the other being the escalating number of bankruptcies operating in the community at large. Indeed, it can be said that about the only visible growth industry in the Australian economy at the moment is the industry of bankruptcy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very briefly, the Australian Democrats support the position of the Australian Labor Party on this proposal. We find this to be one of the most extraordinary recommendations of the razor gang. The thought of transferring this responsibility to the private sector is to us a philosophy of handing things to private enterprise gone absolutely mad. No good reason has been advanced for this switch, from what I have read from the Government, other than a vague philosophical reason. I raise two points in this regard. With bankruptcies at the present time running at an all time high, as Senator Evans just said, the opportunities for future corruption in this area when the responsibility is handed to private enterprise are mind boggling. Therefore, in the absence of any reasoned explanation from the Government as to why this responsibility is being transferred, the Democrats join with the Australian Labor Party in opposing this recommendation.</PARA></TALK.START>

The suggestion made by Senator Chipp-I think I quote him correctly-that the possibilities of future corruption are mind boggling really has no foundation. I put it to the honourable senator that that is not a new move. All that is being changed is the extent to which the private sector can be involved in this activity. The amendments are designed to make it possible for the private sector to take a greater role in relation to a greater number of estates. I appreciate the comments made by the Opposition. They reflect a genuine philosophical difference. To that extent, I think that is one way in which people can judge the difference between the parties. I put it to the honourable senator, in the best of good faith, that there is nothing in these amendments which of itself will lead to future corruption. I hope that the future administration will not lead to such an event.</PARA></TALK.START>

The first amendment proposes a change to Schedule 2 by the insertion of the proposed new section 54A in the Act that is the subject of Schedule 2 to set a limit on the time of 120 days within which the Commissioner for Employees' Compensation must make a determination. The second amendment endeavours to preserve that part of the existing Commonwealth employees' legislation which allows an option for litigants to go either by way of appeal to the compensation appeals tribunal or to prescribed courts. The third amendment which has been circulated seeks to establish by an amendment to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 a separate division within that body for the determination of Commonwealth compensation appeals. They are the three amendments which have been circulated and which I now seek leave to move together.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Now that we all know where we are, may I briefly describe to the Committee what the amendments are all about? The first of them, which is concerned with setting a time limit for the determination of original claims by the Commissioner, is advanced by the Opposition simply because there is a vacuum within the law here at the moment. There is no time limit on the Commissioner for Employees' Compensation within which determinations as to qualification for compensation must be made. That, of course, is a threshold consideration which must be satisfied before appeals of any kind can be launched.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been a concern of a number of people, not only litigants but also those acting for them, that there is no cut-off point of this kind. The situation in practice has been that it is only really simple traumas like broken legs that are dealt with quickly by the Commissioner for Employees' Compensation and that even the simplest of major injury claims-for example those involving loss of hearing-tend to take a minimum of six months with the average closer to 12 months. In the case of death claims-especially those based on strokes and heart conditions-the average has been closer to 18 months with many claims taking as long as two years or more to determine. The concern, as I say, is that some time limit ought to be set. The Administrative Review Council in paragraphs 16 to 21 of its report to the Attorney-General (Senator Durack), which was tabled recently in this Parliament, suggests 60 days as being an appropriate time limit to be inserted in the legislation. My own soundings suggest that that might in fact be too short as a matter of practice and that that may be the reason why in the Bill we have before us at the moment no time limit at all is set. That is why the Opposition is suggesting as a compromise amendment that a time limit of 120 days be here fixed. </PARA>
<PARA> The second amendment which is proposed to this collection of provisions relates to the retention of the appeal option to prescribed courts which is available under the present compensation legislation but which is proposed to be removed by the provisions with which we are now dealing. Part 5 of the Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Act allows appeals to prescribed courts which are, for example, the County Court in Victoria and the Workers Compensation Commission of New South Wales. The recommendation of the Administrative Review Council report which deals with this matter in paragraphs 35 to 40 and also paragraphs 74 to 78 is that this option be in fact removed. However, it is the view of the Opposition, based again on some fairly extensive discussions which do not appear to have been entered into by the Administrative Review Council with both individual parties concerned and more particularly members of the legal profession who are experienced in this area, that the alternative option ought to in fact be preserved. </PARA>
<PARA> I make it clear that here, as elsewhere, the Opposition's concern is not to reject the basic thrust of these amendments which is to remove the existing Commonwealth Employees Compensation Tribunal and to provide that appeals in future be directed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Perhaps with all the subtlety of these amendments that rather basic point has been overlooked. That is not our concern at all. Our concern rather is with a series of peripheral aspects of this proposed transfer of jurisdiction. We see the failure to consider these peripheral aspects as being one of the penalties we pay when we have this kind of compendious omnibus legislation which squeezes into a single statutory formula literally dozens of changes to existing arrangements and makes it very difficult for any reasoned consideration to be given to any of them. </PARA>
<PARA> But against that context, I am suggesting that there be several improvements to the Government's legislation in this area. The first of them was the setting of a time limit; the second one being to retain the alternative option of appeal not only to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal but also to the prescribed courts. Let me indicate very swiftly the reasons why it is thought that this alternative option ought to be preserved. The first reason is that it is after all an existing right which ought not be taken away from any potential litigant without there being strong affirmative justification for such removal. The point I am making here is essentially a threshold one that the onus is in a sense, because it is an existing right, upon those who would wish to remove that right to provide strong justification for the removal rather than it being on those who would wish to retain the right. </PARA>
<PARA> My second point, which is the more fundamental one, is that litigants should in our view be entitled in principle to go before a judge if they so desire. Large sums of money are usually involved in these compensation claims, and very often issues of considerable legal complexity are involved. It is our view that persons in these circumstances should be entitled to have confidence of a judicial resolution of their claim if they feel, for one reason or another, that the complexity of the case or the amount of money and so on involved is not such as to make it appropriate to be dealt with by a non-judicial arbitrator. </PARA>
<PARA> The third point-this is very much reinforced if there is no separate division of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal preserved or formed for the determination of these appeals-is that persons involved in this kind of litigation simply will not be able to guarantee that their appeals will be heard within the Administrative Appeals Tribunal by someone who is experienced in and familiar with this jurisdiction and the numerous complexities associated with it. The final point is that even if there is a separate division of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal carved out for this particular purpose there is, it must be said, a possibility of its being stacked, if that is not too strong a word, with inappropriate appointees, perhaps on a patronage basis, or more likely appointees who are chosen by a government of the day-certainly only a conservative government would do this-with a view to their having a fairly robust attitude towards compensation claims and a basic orientation towards preserving the Treasury from undue claims upon it. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, the situation might well arise where the only available tribunals are those within the Administrative Appeals Tribunal constituted by persons who have been appointed by the Government, with a very clear idea of what the Government wants to achieve in its manning of this particular jurisdiction. Under these circumstances the point is made that litigants ought to preserve the option which they presently enjoy of making a decision not to run that particular gauntlet but rather to go to the courts. They are the reasons behind this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> I readily acknowledge that as this amendment is framed it is perhaps somewhat technically inadequate fully to preserve all the relevant existing language of the present Act. Nonetheless a vote upon it will make sufficiently clear, if it is an affirmative vote, the Senate's desire that that option be preserved. </PARA>
<PARA> The final matter which is the subject matter of these amendments-I have moved them all together-concerns an amendment designed in fact to ensure that a separate division of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal will be maintained for the determination of compensation appeals of this kind. Paragraphs 56 to 58 of the Administra- tive Review Council report in fact recommended against such a division because it was argued that this would reduce the flexibility of the organisation of the Appeals Tribunal. I simply suggest, without going into the argument in any more detail than this, that the way in which that proposition was argued for by the ARC does not seem to be sufficiently persuasive in the event to make me abandon this proposition. I readily acknowledge that as a practical administrative matter there may well be advantage in combining the miscellany of existing compensation appeal jurisdictions which are already vested in the Tribunal into a single large compensation division rather than having just Commonwealth employee compensation matters dealt with by a separate small division. There may well be room for manoeuvre and compromise of this kind. There is a quite strong expression by the Opposition that if this particular change goes ahead-basically we acknowledge it to be a reform-it ought to be accompanied by at least this much by way of deference to the worries that I have expressed. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point I make is a quick one along these lines: I am personally sensitive to suggestions that these changes by and large are not those which have been recommended by the Administrative Review Council. I for one am always suggesting to the Government that it ought to take more notice of the independent advice that it receives from advisory bodies of this kind. I am suggesting that that advice ought to be second-guessed. The only point I offer in my own defence in this respect is that although I agree that the Administrative Review Council's recommendations which have been acted upon by the Government deserve to be taken very seriously and treated with great respect, nonetheless they have not been based on full consultation with the legal profession and with other interested parties as, for example, is always the case with Australian Law Reform Commission reports. For that reason, I do not think they should be regarded as having quite the same kind of biblical certitude or justification for respect that might be the case with other classes of advisory reports. That is the situation. We do not oppose these clauses as a whole but we do believe they could be improved by amendments of this kind. We hope that the amendments will be accepted by the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is quite clear from Senator Evans's very carefully reasoned argument that there is considerable agreement on the amendments proposed in this part of the Bill. Any disagreement is on marginal matters. Senator Evans has already adverted to many of the arguments which I would want to put. I will not be tedious in going over them again. His amendments are threefold. Firstly, he believes that jurisdiction of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in relation to matters under the Commonwealth Employees' Compensation Act 1971 should be exercised within a separate division of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Secondly, he believes that the right under the present Act to appeal from a decision of a Commissioner for Employees Compensation to certain prescribed State courts should be preserved. The two amendments which Senator Evans has proposed-as Senator Evans himself acknowledged-are not supported by the Administrative Review Council which reported to the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) on matters relating to this Tribunal. Senator Evans knows that. The report was tabled in the Parliament, I think, last week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Administrative Review Council considered that the creation of a separate division of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal would place a limitation on the Tribunal's current flexibility of operation. Senator Evans has already referred to that and has said that in his view he is not persuaded by that. But it comes down to what weight one puts on this and how one is persuaded on this and some of the other matters. That is not to say that his arguments do not have weight. It is a question of where one comes down on the particular argument in the light of the information available. In relation to the question of the prescribed State courts, the Council considered that what is now proposed in the Bill was consistent with the view that specialist tribunals should remain in evidence only if special circumstances warrant that course as opposed to providing for review by a general administrative tribunal. Again, that is a question involving the value or emphasis one wants to place on it. For what it is worth, the view that I am putting was expressed in the 1971 Commonwealth Administrative Review Council report. </PARA>
<PARA> It is thought that if the right of appeal to State courts were removed, there would be a much greater likelihood of maintaining consistency of decisions as well as achieving a high standard of review particularly since under the system that we are proposing-which we hope will come into effect-appeals to the Federal Court will be limited to questions of law. The Administrative Review Council considered that forum shopping in this area was undesirable and that the number of different bodies hearing appeals at present inevitably leads to some inconsistencies. Briefly, I emphasise a point that was made by Senator Evans concerning the Administrative Review Council recommendations, of which four have been adopted. They are: Firstly, that the jurisdiction currently excercised by the Commonwealth Employees Compensation Tribunal should be conferred on the Administrative Appeals Tribunal-we are all agreed on that point; secondly, that legislation should provide for the Commonwealth to be a party in proceedings for a review of decisions of the Commissioner for Employees Compensation-I do not think there is any argument on that; thirdly, that the Administrative Appeals Tribunal should have power to award costs in compensation matters-I do not think there is any argument on that; and, fourthly, the matter that we have been discussing-that is, the existing right to apply to a prescribed court for a review of a determination under the Compensation Act-should be abolished. We are, in fact, endorsing that recommendation. Senator Evans has presented argument which, in his view, would lead us to take the other course. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply observe in passing that the AAT includes some judicial members and a right of appeal does lie from the AAT to Federal courts on questions of law. The membership of the Administrative Review Council is fairly prestigious and representative. It includes the President of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Ombudsman, the Chairman of the Law Reform Commission, the First Parliamentary Counsel and the Secretary to the Attorney-General's Department. The Council is a fairly prestigious body. As my colleague has said in advancing his arguments, its recommendations have generally been ones that have been welcomed. </PARA>
<PARA> That then leaves me with the other matter raised by Senator Evans, the third of his amendments, that is, that the Commissioner be required to determine claims within, at most, 120 days of lodgment. There is no doubt that this third amendment is attractive in some respects. There are, however, problems with it. Those problems relate to the practicalities of making the system work. I am as concerned as the honourable senator was by some of the examples which he could adduce to support his case. I do not want to go through the details of some of the practical problems. The honourable senator knows that it is not a simple matter, whichever way one decides to go. It is a question where medical reports, especially from specialists, often take a long time to obtain. Yet the obtaining of these often works to the considerable advantage of a claimant. </PARA>
<PARA> Again it is questionable whether such an amendment is really necessary and whether we cannot by other administrative means achieve the very desirable ends that the honourable senator is seeking. Given that there will be a right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the Ombudsman may issue a certificate enabling a person to appeal to that Tribunal as though the Commissioner had decided not to award compensation to that claimant, if the Ombudsman is of the opinion that there has been unreasonable delay in determining the claim. That seems to give another way through to meet the kind of circumstance which Senator Evans adverts to. This is a section of the Bill which confers new benefits and which assists the people for whom it is designed. As I said, there is general agreement on the matters, but there is some disagreement on particular points. It is disagreement based on the interpretatin one puts on various review reports which are available. I say to my colleague, in the very best spirit, that we are not going to support his amendments but we recognise the arguments he has put. </PARA>

However, I would appreciate some indication from the Government-perhaps this is quite consistent with everything Senator Baume has said-that it will keep closely under review the particular matters to which I have adverted; that it will monitor very closely the operation of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal; and that it will monitor a little more closely than it has in the past the operations of the Commissioner himself, in particular insofar as the time the Tribunal has been taking for these determinations to be made, with a view, perhaps, in the spirit of improving this legislation, to having some fresh analysis in a year or so's time of the operation of this legislation with a view to its improvement.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>We have before us an omnibus Bill which has been described as bulk-billing. I am afraid that when the Budget Papers come down we will see another measure which can be termed bulk-billing but, because of the undertaking that the Australian Democrats gave during the election campaign that they would not reject a Budget measure, we can look forward to seeing most contentious issues embodied in a bulk-billing measure as part of the Budget. The Government will say to the Australian Democrats: 'That is a Budget measure. If you oppose it you will be breaking your undertaking'. I sound that note of warning. People ought to be aware of that possibility because, as I said in my speech at the second reading stage, the Government embodied all of these proposed changes in one Bill, in a very sneaky fashion. I am very much afraid that on Budget night we will find a huge document of that kind will be placed in front of us. That will not inhibit the Labor Party from protesting, but as far as defeating it is concerned, I am afraid that we will be caught up in the undertaking given by the Australian Democrats. I would not expect them to dishonour their promise, but no doubt the Government will take great advantage of it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition wishes to put very explicitly on record its opposition to this part of the omnibus razor gang Bill which has the effect of abolishing the Legislative Drafting Institute. That Institute has been in existence since the late 1960s or early 1970s as a training institution for draftsmen from Third World Commonwealth countries especially. As was explained, incidentally, in evidence given to Senate Estimates Committee B on 13 October 1978 and again on 4 September 1980, it was originally set up in response to suggestions which arose in the late 1960s from meetings of Commonwealth law Ministers with a view to there being in Australia, taking advantage of Australian experience, a legislative drafting institute of this kind. But since its establishment, and indeed from the very outset, it has been contemplated that the Institute should be capable of a very significant domestic role in training legislative draftsmen, namely, the people who write the statutes which we spend our time endeavouring to pass in this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Given the manifest continuing need for draftsmen of high quality to serve this country, quite apart from the larger international relations aspects of the matter, it seems very unfortunate indeed that this body will now suffer the fate proposed in this Bill. It has been operating as very much a shoestring concern with just one trained draftsman plus secretarial support. Nonetheless, it had the potential all along for playing a very significant training role. It is just a pity that the Office of Parliamentary Counsel and the Attorney-General's Department, which between them are the main users of qualified draftsmen, seem to have had something of a dog in the manger attitude about using formal training institutions of this kind to produce draftsmen, taking by contrast the rather old-fashioned view that drafting is a skill that could be learned only on the job. The result of that has been, I think, to create a situation where there is a number of evident things going wrong. It seems to me, and there is plenty of evidence of it in the quality of the drafting coming before us, particularly in the rushed circumstances this session, there is still a shortage of senior and capable draftsmen within the Office of Parliamentary Counsel capable of meeting the peak demands imposed by this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems even more evident that there is a shortage of qualified draftsmen within the Legislative Drafting Division of the Attorney-General's Department, which has the major responsibility for drafting regulations and ordinances. The preparation of these is notoriously lagging way behind any reasonable schedule and, in particular, the shortage of these is making impossible the production of properly consolidated volumes of territorial statutory law. It is also our concern that the shortage generally of trained draftsmen around the place results in a situation where there is little or no help for the Opposition in doing its job of generating alternative draft proposals, in statutory language, of the propositions that it wants to put forward. It is one thing to express our concern about matters in generalised second reading debate language; it is another thing again to be able to produce sophisticated technically competent drafts of the precise points that we want to make and the improvements we want to suggest in the Committee stage of debates. Were there more legislative draftsmen qualified and available to be used in this way the Opposition believes it would improve the quality of the parliamentary process. </PARA>
<PARA> We also believe there is a shortage of drafting resources available for such subsidiary perhaps, but nonetheless important, tasks as the servicing of bodies such as the Australian Law Reform Commission in its generation of reports and draft legislation and also in tackling the tasks of the preparation of uniform law reform legislation in this country which, regrettably, has been something which always has had low priority. By its very nature uniform legislation, the product of co-operative arrangements or agreements between the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General, is not legislation which is the sole province of any one of the participating governments. For that reason such legislative proposals invariably get shuffled to the end of the queue. That is one of the reasons that by contrast with the United States of America and Canada and other comparable federal countries Australia's progress in the development of uniform law has been appallingly slow. </PARA>
<PARA> That is a very brief statement of the problems that exist with legislative drafting in this country. I suggest that it is another demonstration of the short-sightedness of this Government in now removing completely the organisational framework within which a sensible and coherent ongoing program for the training of legislative draftsmen could take place. I will finish on the point that I do not think anyone would reasonably claim that legislative drafting is a skill or an art that can be learned entirely in an isolated surrounding such as a technical Legislative Drafting Institute. Clearly it is the kind of skill which needs some on-the-job training to supplement the formal skills that can perhaps be taught in an academic environment. </PARA>
<PARA> I make the point in this respect simply that that was always the argument of lawyers generally so far as the training of future generations of lawyers was concerned and it is an argument which has long since been acknowledged to be fallacious in that context, as the establishment of the College of Law in Sydney and the Leo Cussen Institute for Continuing Education in Victoria has shown, that practically competent lawyers in fact can be generated by training institutions of this kind with the formal training being supplemented from time to time by practical on-the-job experience. I think this is, although it perhaps sounds somewhat esoteric, an important matter that I raise. It is a matter for which the Opposition feels a deep concern. It is a matter that has ongoing implications for the quality of public administration in this country and, as such, I believe--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This has been a somewhat gruelling debate and we are now very close to the end of it. This is one of the most important Parts of the Bill because it involves the abolition of the Prices Justification Tribunal. It is an abolition which we oppose vehemently and completely for a variety of reasons which I will now endeavour to articulate. Ever since 1975 when the Fraser Government assumed office, it has been the case that the Prices Justification Tribunal, a creation of the Whitlam Government, has been subject to steady emasculation. Its staff has been slashed by 45 per cent in the years since 1976 and its funding has been cut to a level where nowadays it has had the resources to produce only one major report a year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Tribunal was established in 1973 to report on whether prices were justified. It was never established as a price control agency, although there is ample justification in principle for that being done. The barrier, the inhibition, felt was, of course, the constitutional one that the Commonwealth was simply thought to lack the sufficient constitutional power, with respect to at least all classes of price setters, to set in train a penally sanctioned operation of that kind. The creation of the Tribunal has undoubtedly been justified by its activities over the years since its initial establishment in that it has found in a great many instances that industries were fixing prices above those which a classical free market system would have produced. Even, indeed, with all the staffing constraints that have been systematically imposed upon the Tribunal since the advent of the Fraser Government, in the financial year 1979-80 the Tribunal, in fact, rejected 230 prices increase applications, in the process saving consumers an estimated $160m. So, the Tribunal, even in its declining years, as it were, has manifestly played a significant role. </PARA>
<PARA> Equally evident should be the need for some continuing price justification procedures of the kind that the Prices Justification Tribunal was supposed to be administering. There are plenty of ways of articulating the arguments in this respect. Perhaps the most basic argument is simply that price Justification procedures are an essential ingredient in any serious attempt to create a wages-prices package of anti-inflationary policies which have a chance of gaining acceptance by working people, by the trade union movement. Trade unions have to justify their increases before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. Similarly, companies should be subject to the same kind of discipline. Another way of putting the argument, or of putting another gloss upon it, is in terms of the increasing power of major corporations. Trade practices legislation, which is another crucial element in the regulatory armoury in this respect, necessarily will be inadequate to cover everything that needs to be covered. In a small market such as Australia is, monopoly and oligopoly situations to a considerable extent will be unavoidable. As a result the market, for all the Friedmanite huffing and puffing that this Government might go on with, simply will not achieve by its own discipline satisfactory controls on prices. </PARA>
<PARA> A third argument which perhaps links together the previous two can be articulated in terms of social cohesion. Justice must not only be done but also be seen to be done. Economic success cannot be achieved without public faith in the honesty of the system. People have to be aware not only that the system is working but also of how it is working. One of the greatest advantages of the Prices Justification Tribunal was that it laid out for public inspection the kinds of commercial processes in price setting that were at work within the corporate sector. So, bearing those sorts of arguments in mind, what the Government has to come to grips with, I suggest, is this: What do honourable senators opposite have to say to consumers when they ask them what the Government intends to do about rising prices? Do they simply say: 'Oh, it's only the free market'? The Australian public will not accept that. They know, because after all most of them work for the firms that produce the goods that they in turn buy as consumers, that not all firms operate in free markets. They know, as the Treasurer (Mr Howard) and his advisers apparently do not, that not all firms have the kind of competitive discipline of the market-place. They know that when a firm is making its pricing decisions it will charge what it can get away with. </PARA>
<PARA> How naive this Government must be if it really believes that prices in markets where a monopoly or an oligopoly naturally exists because of market size will be determined by free market forces. Where is the competition? Where are the unseen hands? Will they descend into the Australian market-place from above with some sort of grace and favour dispensation from the Almighty? That is the problem-that even free marketers themselves, perhaps more accurately described as free-booters like Milton Friedman, recognise, that private monopoly is not a virtue and it must not be given free rein to trample over the rights of consumers. We do need regulatory mechanisms of the kind that involve trade practices legislation and of the kind that involve PJT legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> This fact becomes very clear indeed when one looks at the situation in a number of present market environments. Look at the situation, for example, in the aluminium industry, which was ironically one of the areas which was going to be subject to the next major scrutiny by the PJT. On the London Metal Exchange aluminium prices have recently been running at around $1,140 per tonne. In Australia, Comalco Ltd and others in the Australian sellers market are getting close to $1,545 per tonne-35 per cent more for a product for which Australia should have a significant international comparative advantage. Another example put by my colleague Mr Hurford in the other place was in terms of a primary food commodity such as coffee. There has been a 40 per cent reduction in recent months in the price of raw coffee on world markets but that simply has not been transferred, passed on, to the pockets of the Australian consumer. Another example, which is perhaps even closer to home for most honourable senators, particularly as this session grinds towards its conclusion, is the price of beer. Honourable senators would have noted, to take a Victorian example, that it was reported over the last weekend that 44 per cent of Melbourne hotels were pocketing the 5c per bottle difference between light and standard beer that they were receiving as a result of a cut from 8 per cent to 2 per cent in the licence duties on light beer. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that Senator Puplick is a chauvinist in most respects. I thought that he was a little more civilised when it came to imbibing, but apparently the contrary is the case. The Liberal Minister of Consumer Affairs in Victoria, who after all is a tory and who as a result ought to have some creditibility with Senator Puplick, said that this was okay provided they were not selling below the minimum price. What an extraordinary comment that is upon the Liberal Party's commitment to free market forces and the discipline of the market-place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The extent of Liberal governments' concern for the consumer could scarcely be better illustrated than by that comment, other than by the even better illustration constituted by the abolition of the Prices Justification Tribunal in the legislation before us tonight. The PJT, in a whole series of recent inquiries, has gathered evidence in a number of different industrial contexts, that firms are now basing prices on cost estimates which incorporate their expectations of future inflation levels. They are building expectations into the present pricing cycle. Firms are also using what is often their monopoly or oligopoly situation to finance, by their pricing, rapid expansion into overseas markets. These are the sorts of things which do not have any justification by reference to the kinds of criteria the PJT was applying, which will lead to increased inflation, and which are evidence, if more is needed, of the failure of free market competition. Profits are up and the consumers are being taken down. </PARA>
<PARA> I suspect that, however plausible, however persuasive, however rigorous, however conclusive the arguments that are being advanced by the Opposition on this occasion, they will just be greeted by the kind of giggles that are emanating at the moment from Government back bench senators, in particular from Senator Puplick. There is no disposition on the part of Government members and senators to take seriously the interests of Australian consumers. That fact could not be better demonstrated than by this legislation. Perhaps with my parting breath in this respect, with the last ounce of disgust that I can muster about the Government's attitude--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be mustering some more disgust in relation to the Bills which are next to come before us, but in relation to the razor gang Bill the only remaining kind of disgust that I feel able to muster at the moment can perhaps best be articulated in terms of putting some questions to Government senators. I will leave the questions to burn into their consciousness, but no doubt to be unanswered unless Senator Baume's footwork is much more dexterous than that of other front benchers has been. In the first place, why is it that just as the PJT is about to conduct an inquiry into the aluminium industry-an inquiry which even the more vocal dullards opposite will realise is likely to provide findings which are extremely damaging to those who adopt an unthinking free market fetish-the PJT is to be abolished? Secondly, if the Minister and the Government believe that the PJT is ineffective, why was it not given greater resources? In particular, since 1979 why has the Minister not used his power more effectively under the amended Act-he has had the power to do it-to direct the PJT into areas of real concern to the community at large?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Thirdly, how can the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) say with one breath that he opposes sweetheart deals in the 35-hour-week campaign and, at the same time, support a measure which would abolish the one existing appropriate body for clamping down on such arrangements by having the capacity not to authorise any consequent price increases which will follow from them? If he is serious about having a mechanism for dealing with that, why does he not retain the body which enables that bit of huff and puff to be given flesh and blood? Finally, if the Government recognises the value of an institution such as the Prices Justification Tribunal in scrutinising, in particular, industries such as the petroleum industry-it does recognise that, as is demonstrated by the proposed passage in the next few minutes of the Petroleum Products Pricing Bill, which reincarnates the Prices Justification Tribunal in the context of that industry-and it is prepared to acknowledge the legitimacy of the Prices Justification Tribunal principles operating in that industrial context, why is it not willing to acknowledge it in other industrial contexts which are, equally, obviously deserving of this kind of intention? Once again, this part of the Bill demonstrates, just as everything else in the Bill does, that this is a government which has substituted a passion for ideology for any kind of common sense or detailed sensitive attention to what is in the interests of ordinary Australians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Committee is considering that part of the Bill which seeks to abolish the Prices Justification Tribunal. Senator Evans has put strongly the case of the Opposition. There is a philosophical difference between the two sides of the chamber on this matter. The abolition of the Prices Justification Tribunal is consistent with this Government's continuing process towards the removal of what it considers to be unnecessary regulation. I noticed that in the ministerial statement on the report of the Review of Commonwealth Functions committee this was adverted to directly. I will read a little of it. It stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Over the years there has evolved a great deal of legislation which involves regulation of industry. Although some of this legislation benefits the community as a whole, and some of it has been put in place at the request of the private sector, it nonetheless imposes substantial costs on the taxpayer and the consumer and particularly on individual business enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA>Many of us will know that individual businesses resent some of the ways in which they are involved in these regulatory activities. The statement continued:</PARA>
<PARA> It is evident that much of government regulation of private sector activity is neither necessary nor effective and is certainly more costly than is self-regulation. </PARA>
<PARA>Of the Price Justification Tribunal itself the statement read:</PARA>
<PARA> This body has outlived its usefulness as a regulatory mechanism and is placing an undue burden on industry; there is no evidence that it is having any signficant impact on the restraint of inflation. </PARA>
<PARA>As Senator Evans has already pointed out it stated:</PARA>
<PARA> An appropriate mechanism will be established for the maintenance of the Government's petroleum product pricing policy. </PARA>
<PARA>It is our belief that the PJT is no longer performing an essential function. The 1979 amendments to the PJT significantly reduced the regulatory burden imposed on the business sector by it. The experience of the two years since those changes has indicated that the market is capable of ensuring competitive pricing. This experience has led us to the conclusion that the effect on price regulation has not been adverse. We have noted particularly that during the last two years there has been a general recovery within the economy. In fact, over the past two or three years the PJT has concentrated its activities mainly in the area of petroleum product prices. It is because of this emphasis on its activities that the Government has decided that it should continue to do this with the proposed Petroleum Products Pricing Authority to which reference has already been made. </PARA>
<PARA> I will touch briefly on the aluminium industry as it was referred to by Senator Evans. The main matter which has been before the PJT concerns pre-inquiry consultations with the aluminium industry. The PJT had not made any recommendations that there should be a public inquiry. Had such a recommendion been made the Government would have determined whether it wished to go ahead with such an inquiry and, if it did, how it would go ahead. But no situation arose where the PJT made such a recommendation. I remind honourable senators that the State Governments have constitutional powers over prices. They have powers to examine the prices of particular goods, for example, the price of beer, as they think necessary. What we have here is a philosophical belief by this Government that we are moving in the right direction. We acknowledge that our political opponents have a different view. We put it no stronger than that. We are trying to put some of our philosophies into effect with these amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With all respect to the Minister, I do not find his comments in reply to Senator Evans very explicit. He said twice that there was a philosophical difference between the Australian Labor Party and the Liberal Party over this matter. I suggest that he has not met the point that Senator Evans made and which I found very telling. Why abolish the Prices Justification Tribunal and then introduce a petroleum products pricing organisation? Surely if the philosophy applies to one commodity, why should it not apply to another? I ask the Minister whether he could clear up that point. Unless he can give us an answer to that specific point I suggest that his credibility is very much suspect.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is reasonable to respond to the point that Senator Mason has made, I think, in a constructive manner. The fact is that petroleum product prices are of particular significance to energy policy in Australia. It is thought that special surveillance of these prices is therefore necessary. Prices of petroleum products are subject to external factors to a greater degree than are the prices of most other products in Australia. The honourable senator will be as aware as the rest of us as to why that is the case. The Petroleum Products Pricing Authority will maintain surveillance of petroleum products and of the industry with far fewer staff than the PJT presently requires. As I have said, it is a job which it has been doing for some time. A lot of its activities have already been concentrated in that area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The regulatory function required to carry out that job will be minimal, and that will be consistent with the need for the PPPA to function effectively. It will be no more involved in the industry than is the PJT and in some areas it will be less involved. I acknowledge that one could have gone down a different road and amended or adjusted the PJT to do this task. The Government has elected to take the other road, to abolish one body and to create a special body to do the particular job in the way I have just described. It is simply a decision to go that way to achieve our end, rather than to go the way that Senator Mason feels is preferable. I think we have made the choice by facing the situation that we have. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take it that the Minister is saying that it is perfectly all right to control prices in Australia if it suits and reinforces an area of Government policy, but for some reason it is not suitable to control prices in other ways. I would have thought that the whole question of price rises and the whole rationale of why things are the price that they are are of great interest and concern to most Australians. The Minister said earlier in his speech before last, that the PJT had not, in recent years, fulfilled the functions that it ought to have done. Is it then reasonable-I want to test this point because the whole question of prices is of great concern to the Australian public-to throw out the baby with the bath water? We do not necessarily throw away a motor car because it develops a fault. We do something about it. We repair and improve it. I would like the Minister's comments on why the Government has not taken that option? Could it not have looked at the PJT and said that this is an inadequate instrument and considered what it could do to improve it? I think this is a matter of deep concern to Australians and will increasingly become so in the next few years. If prices go on increasing people will want to know why. I think it is important to them to understand something which is of such basic concern to every household-why do things get more and more expensive? If indeed that has been investigated and a reason can be shown for it, that is great. I suggest that might have been a function of the PJT. But we as a parliament now say to the people: 'Right, there will be price increases and apart from petroleum price increases we will not give you any real indication of why it is happening. Our only reason for getting rid of the organisation was that we thought it was not doing the job properly'. I would like the Minister's comments on that whole area.</PARA></TALK.START>

I remind the Committee again that in 1979 the Government made a decision to alter the Prices Justification Tribunal in various ways in an attempt to do as Senator Mason has suggested, namely, to alter the structure and function of it and see what happened.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-On behalf of a large number of honourable senators, I pay tribute to you, Mr President, for the leadership you have shown on the matter of sitting hours. To my knowledge the subject of sitting hours has been under discussion by senators and members of the House of Representatives for two years in any sort of active way, but particularly this session. If I may very briefly state what some honourable senators but not all would know, at the beginning of this session I was approached by the then Government Whip, former Senator John Knight, who indicated to me that there was a wish abroad amongst Government and Opposition senators to have a change in the sitting hours. He asked me whether I would revive a proposal that I had put forward some time earlier. I said I would do so only if there was an assurance of strong support and a will to make it work. He assured me that conversations with Government and Opposition senators during my absence overseas indicated that that was so. That was on the Thursday night before John Knight died. One of the motivating factors for my proceeding, after a great amount of discussion I had with Opposition and Government senators, was the fact that John Knight had asked me to do it. We had reached a stage through many meetings and a great deal of work where it was necessary for somebody else to take the helm.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr President, I am enormously grateful that you and Mr Speaker agreed to undertake that task for the welfare of all senators and members. It was an arduous, a difficult and thankless task. Tonight I would like to say to you: Thank you for your help. </PARA>

If there is any area where the Parliament should divorce itself from the Executive and say its own piece it should be in connection with the hours we sit. I heard another sad comment from my good friend, Senator McAuliffe, that I should be realistic. Is he saying that there are enough gutless people or liverless people in this place who will tremble and crumble when the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) says 'This will not work', or when he says: 'We cannot bring in this reform', and say: 'Yes, Prime Minister, we will not now push for a change in hours'?

You must not be here at one minute past eight because you might miss a division. You cannot behave like a civilised human being while you are in Canberra. Here you must behave like a schoolboy and do as we say. You must react to the bells'? That is part of the whole syndrome of the Executive versus the Parliament.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would not be unusual if Senator Archer were. It would not be the first time in Senator Archer's life that he turned up at the wrong meeting and voted the wrong way. Many of us here, including Senator Martin, have battled for years to get some sanity into the hours in which this place sits. We are the laughing stock of the Press Gallery which says that no other bunch of individuals could more inefficiently use its time over a three-day week by spreading 22 hours in the way in which we now spread our hours.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I speak so strongly about this at the moment because I feel that because of the work you, Mr President, Mr Speaker, Senator Martin and other people have done, that this is the last chance. If we buckle under now we ought to think of what we are doing. We are committing ourselves in the future to this absurd sort of situation in which we sit these hours. I give notice and hope for the support of thinking honourable senators, so that no matter what the Executive demands or asks, at least we in the Senate, when we resume in August, might have the gumption to determine by vote our own sitting hours. We believe that these hours should suit the convenience of the Senate so that we can best serve the people of Australia by looking at legislation which comes here in the way in which we are supposed to. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I share the elation of those who have spoken in this brief matter this evening because most of us have considered that the hours in which Parliament operates have been rather onerous from the point of view both of front and back bench members of the Parliament. I think what is encouraging as the result of the straw poll that has been taken in both Houses of parliament is that the Parliament has expressed a view in a rather informal way, but nevertheless in an overwhelming way, and suggested that the hours of sitting should be changed. That is not because there will be fewer hours of sitting, because exactly the same number of hours are involved in the views that have been expressed by the House of Representatives as well as by the Senate, but because we will work in a fashion which will enable the other work of the Parliament to continue in perhaps a more congenial way. That is to say that the policy committees of the respective parties will now not be obliged to work through their meal times but rather will have an opportunity in a more peaceful and placid way to consider matters that are before the Parliament as well as to develop policies in respect of the parties to which they belong.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not think that many members of the public would be aware of the long hours that members of Parliament put in, not only in their attendance in the Parliament but in the important committee work that goes on both by the Parliament and by parties. As was indicated in the poll that was taken, no less time will be spent within the Parliament but we will have a much more rational use of time and a much more civilised time to spend within the Parliament. It seems to me that that is a very positive advance. I share Senator Chipp's concern about whether the views, so overwhelmingly expressed by these polls, will be put into effect. We would not want to see ourselves out of kilter with the House of Representatives. Therefore, we expect that the Cabinet will take this vote and will work out a system by which the function of Parliament, so far as hours are concerned, will be altered. </PARA>
<PARA> There will be problems, Mr President-there is no doubt. It will be an experimental matter and it will require a great deal of co-operation by all honourable senators to have the proposals working effectively and smoothly. I am sure there is enough good will among senators at least-and probably among members of the House of Representatives-to ensure that any bumpy roads we may encounter here will be overcome given the goodwill of the Executive. If that is not forthcoming we might find ourselves in conflict. Of course, that would be very difficult for us. Obviously we would require the assistance of the Joint House Department and other sections of the Parliament if the Senate were to take a view that was not accepted in the House of Representatives following a party political decision by the Executive. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I do not know what is the next step. I recognise that your term here is rather limited. I do not know whether your successor, Mr Speaker and the back bench members would be able to impose their will upon the Executive of the day. I have heard that point referred to from time to time by many senior Government members, some of whom have left this place. I recall Senator Magnus Cormack making that point before he retired. We have taken an important step forward. But it now behoves Government members to see that the next step of implementation is, in view of what Senator Chipp said, imposed upon the Executive. That is the point we are at. We have expressed our view. We have had the opportunity in two polls, firstly, to say whether we favoured a change-we overwhelmingly said that we did-and, secondly, vote on certain options. Surely that is enough indication to the Government that the Parliament itself, as distinct from the Government and Opposition, has been able to express itself in a way that the Government should take into consideration. </PARA>

I briefly stated on the ballot paper that I believed that this exercise ought to have been undertaken after a debate on this matter in the chamber and after a committee was established to examine all of the alternatives because I considered that another alternative could have been put forward. This in no way is meant to denigrate the work that has been done by those who are concerned, as I am, about late night sittings. It is certainly no reflection on you, Mr President. It should be regarded, as has been stated, as a straw vote. The result of the vote is not overwhelming. I was reminded by Senator McAuliffe that one of the most worthy of our departing senators voted in favour of the first proposition. If all of the departing senators voted in favour of the first proposition and all of the incoming senators vote in favour of the third proposition the result would be that the third proposition would get up by 29 votes to 25.

<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate the second reading speech in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to amendments to the Christmas Island Agreement concerning essentially the mining function on Christmas Island and future arrangements for stockpiles of phosphate rock. The amendments have been agreed to by the Australian and New Zealand governments. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will recall that on 5 March 1981 my colleague, the Minister for Administrative Services, Mr Kevin Newman, announced in the House a number of wide-ranging decisions concerning the future of phosphate mining on Christmas Island, and the purchasing and distribution of phosphate rock for Australia's requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> One of those decisions was that as far as mining on Christmas Island is concerned the British Phosphate Commissioners would be replaced on the Island as managing agents for the Christmas Island Phosphate Commission by an Australian Government owned and controlled company. This is to be an initial step pending the winding up of the Christmas Island Phosphate Commission. Article 1 of the Schedule to the Bill enables these arrangements to be made by removing the requirement on the CIPC to employ the BPC as managing agents, and permitting the CIPC to engage such managing agents as are jointly nominated by the two Governments. The intention is that as from 1 July 1981 or as soon as practicable thereafter the new company-the Christmas Island Phosphate Co. will be nominated as managing agents. A further decision given effect to by the Bill-Article 2 of the Schedule-is to enable the CIPC to transfer its stockpiles at manufacturers' plants in Australia and New Zealand to the respective governments. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, paragraph 2 of Article 1 of the Schedule reflects impending changes in purchasing and distribution arrangements for phosphate by removing the requirement on the CIPC to dispose of Christmas Island phosphate in conjunction with phosphate supplied from other sources by the British Phosphate Commissioners. </PARA>
<PARA> As Mr Newman indicated in his statement on 5 March, this responsibility will pass on 1 July from the BPC to the Australian Phosphate Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> I emphasise that these amendments are of an interim kind. A completely new Christmas Island Agreement is to be negotiated with New Zealand. </PARA>
<PARA> I take this opportunity to inform honourable senators of developments which have occurred since my colleague's statement of 5 March. Action has been put in train to establish the Christmas Island Phosphate Co. which will assume responsibility for mining on Christmas Island. Coopers and Lybrand has been retained to advise on the establishment of the company generally, and the question of responsibility for the provision of municipal and similar type functions on the island. The company will operate in a commercial way. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Phosphate Corporation has been incorporated and is moving to assume responsibility for the purchasing and distribution of Australia's phosphate requirements generally. I understand that following discussions with a number of shipping organisations, the superphosphate manufacturers are entering into an agreement with the Australian National Line to take over the three Australian-crewed ships currently under long-term charter to the BPC. </PARA>
<PARA> In response to my colleague's statement on 5 March, the honourable member for Werriwa (Mr Kerin) sought information on the stockpiles, in particular their value and the way they are financed. As at 31 March 1981, the stockpiles in Australia amounted to almost 1.2 million tonnes. Their market value at that date was nearly $79m. The stockpiles have been built up for two reasons: To ensure availability when production or delivery was disrupted, and to continue to achieve economies of scale in production when demand slackened. They have been financed over many years by way of surcharges placed on the price of rock to manufacturers, and in recent years, when prices of rock from various sources have been rising relatively quickly, by differences between the buying price and selling price. Rock is sold to manufacturers at current market price rather than historic cost. The honourable member also displayed a breadth of knowledge about the booby bird. The Government still has under consideration the appraisal of the bird made by Professors Ovington and Cullen and Dr Nelson. In the meantime the current moratorium on particular mining areas of the island inhabited by the bird has been extended. </PARA>
<PARA> I should not let this occasion pass, Mr President, without paying tribute to the Commissioners and staff of the British Phosphate Commissioners, as one effect of this legislation will be to remove that name from what might be called Australian phosphate legislation. The BPC was established by the Nauru Island Agreement of 2 July 1919, the Agreement being signed for Australia by the Right Honourable William Morris Hughes, for New Zealand by the Right Honourable William Ferguson Massey-both signing in the presence of R. R. Garran-and for the United Kingdom by the Right Honourable David Lloyd George, each of these Right Honourable Gentlemen being at the time his country's Prime Minister. Few bodies have started life with such distinguished godfathers. </PARA>
<PARA> The BPC's original charter was to extract phosphate from Nauru and dispose of it in the three countries. As time went by, it also became responsible for extracting phosphate from Ocean Island, Banaba, and Christmas Island, and for purchasing and shipping to Australia and New Zealand all the phosphate and sulphur requirements for manufacturers in both countries. That it has discharged these responsibilities most efficiently is indicated by the fact that Australia has in the past 60 years never been without phosphate rock. I pay tribute on behalf of the Government to the BPC staff who have achieved that record, and to the Commissioners, particularly the current Commissioner Mr Maurice Timbs. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA> I seek leave to incorporate the second reading speech in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to give effect to the Government's decision to pay a bounty on the printing in Australia of certain lightweight woven fabrics weighing less than 120 grams per square metre. The decision to adopt this form of assistance follows the Government's consideration of the recommendation by the Industries Assistance Commission contained in its report No. 240 of 30 April 1980 entitled 'Textiles, Clothing and Footwear'. This bounty proposal is part of the Government's broader program for the textiles, clothing and footwear industries intended to encourage the development of a more efficient industry structure. It is expected also to provide substantial benefits to user industries such as clothing manpfacturers. To this end, the proposal is in agreement with the broad objectives of the Industries Assistance Commission's recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for the bountry to be payable at the rate of 70 per cent of the additional value added to the fabric by the printer. The value added will be based on the factory cost of bountiable printed fabric less the costs of materials used in the printing process. The scheme is to operate for a period of seven years from 1 January 1982 and bounty payments for the first full year are estimated to be $2.5m. </PARA>
<PARA> The bounty assistance is designed to offset the effect on printers of another Government decision to grant import entry of certain fabrics at minimum rates of duty and free of quota-that is, those printed fabrics weighing less than 120 grams per square metre, and destined for garment use. Bounty is to be payable on fabrics printed at registered premises during the bounty period, if the fabric is used or is sold for use in making up into garments in a registered clothing factory. Clothing factories will be treated as being registered for the purposes of the bounty scheme is registered under a State law or, in the case of internal Territories which do not have laws suitable for these purposes, such places used for the production of garments and approved by the Comptroller-General of Customs. </PARA>
<PARA> This approach is consistent with exclusions from the proposed tariff concessions on certain lightweight woven fabrics which I mentioned earlier. The exclusions will protect the interests of manufacturers of other lightweight cloth, such as pocketings, linings and curtains. At the same time the Bill makes provision for an extension by regulation of the uses to which bountiable fabric may be put, if the Government decides that such an extension is desirable. The Government expects that the assistance proposed by this Bill will enable the local industry to compete adequately against printed fabrics of a similar nature which will be able to be imported at minimum rates of duty and free of quota after 1 January 1982. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> (A) because a tax indexation factor of only 3.8 per cent has been applied, all taxpayers whose incomes in 1981-82 will be more than 3.8 per cent above their 1980-81 incomes and whose circumstances do not otherwise alter, will be paying a higher proportion of that income in income tax in 1981-82 than in 1980-81,</PARA>
<PARA> (B) such an increase in the burden of income tax continues the pattern of an increasing income tax burden during the Fraser Government's term of office, and</PARA>
<PARA> (C) such developments are in stark contrast to the Government's continual attempts to portray itself as a low tax party,</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Petroleum Products Pricing Bill establishes a Petroleum Products Pricing Authority to monitor, as the name suggests, petroleum products pricing. Although we certainly believe that petroleum product prices should be monitored and for that reason do not oppose the basic concept of having this kind of regulatory agency; nonetheless, we are unhappy with a number of features of the way in which the Bill is put together and the circumstances in which it comes before the Parliament. The Bill contains a number of structural weaknesses to the extent, as we will make clear at the Committee stage, that it provides the Authority with virtually no independence from the Minister, with low status and with limited powers and resources.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The more general objection we have to the Bill is the one which I think was adequately canvassed and foreshadowed in the debate we had earlier this evening on the Prices Justification Tribunal, and that is that the very bringing forward of the legislation to establish a separate price monitoring authority for the petroleum industry illustrates beautifully the stupidity of the rationale for the abolition of the existing Prices Justification Tribunal. If we are on about deregulation, market forces and all the other spects of the private enterprise razor gang ideology that have permeated this Government's approach to this and associated legislation, why is the Government singling out petroleum products now for special attention? Why is this particular area of oligopolistic economic organisational activity being singled out for special regulatory activity? Why not let the free market forces do their best or their worst in this area as the Government seems to want to happen everywhere else?</PARA>
<PARA> Early this evening the Minister indicated, in answer to this sort of point made in the context of the Prices Justification Tribunal debate, that there was a need for special consideration to be given and special legislative attention paid to the petroleum pricing policy because it was intimately linked with the Government's energy policy which was of manifest interest and concern to the nation at large. Now that this is going to be a recurring theme in this relatively short debate on the Petroleum Products Pricing Bill I simply ask the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) about the public interest, in the nation and the community, not just in energy policy but in anti-inflationary policy. What about the role that the Prices Justification Tribunal was playing, or potentially had the capacity to play, in that particular across the board area of macro-economic policy? The Government cannot just single out and pretend that energy policy by itself is something separate and distinct from, or at least more important than, economic policy and in particular that part of the Government's economic policy which is supposedly directed to the control of inflation. They are all indispensable elements in any rational, effective and constructive economic policy and they all have their own justification. </PARA>
<PARA> What we have got with this legislation, which is re-creating the Prices Justification Tribunal for the petroleum industry alone-it is reincarnating the PJT in a new and limited guise-is simply a lame attempt to placate public concern about petroleum prices and, of course, concern among that very special interest group that this Government has been so anxious to nurture, the service station proprietors, with respect to the pricing practices of the major oil companies. There is not a shred of any principle which can be described as one of intelligible economic justification for what is being done. </PARA>
<PARA> The hypocrisy of this Government is something we have come to expect but not to love any more through its constant repetition. Once again it nauseously makes itself apparent in this particular context. In the establishment of this Authority we have a clear acknowledgment of the validity of the prices justification concept. What we have in the context of the petroleum industry is an industry which is heavily concentrated-even more so of course following the recent takeover of Golden Fleece by the Caltex company-and which is given, as we all know, to co-operative price setting through refinery exchange agreements and substantial integration of the different company operations and so on. We have an industry which is multinational and trans-national in a majority of cases. The multinational firms have something like 83 per cent of the Australian market. The industry is vertically integrated thus enabling, through transfer pricing, companies to make profits at any particular point on the scale--production, refining, wholesaling and retailing-that happens to suit their interest. For example in 1974 the PJT responded to that kind of situation by adjusting the proposed increase by the Shell company to take into account the doubts it had as to the reasonableness of the price charged by that company's overseas affiliates. It took very much into account the transfer pricing phenomenon and the necessity to compensate for it. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look at the way in which petroleum price setting has operated generally in Australia we find that in April 1976 the Collins Royal Commission on Petroleum reported, amongst other things, that motor spirit and petroleum products were over-priced and that both wholesale and retail margins were excessively high. We find that it reported that unfair competition and especially discriminatory pricing practices were rife. Yet we had a situation of the big oil companies going to their merry way. In 1979 they made profits of some $300m after tax. The increase in profits from 1978 ranged from 59 per cent in the case of British Petroleum right up to 194 per cent in the case of Mobil. </PARA>
<PARA> In that situation we had a Prices Justification Tribunal as it then existed making significant efforts to improve, remedy and redress that situation. We had a potentially very effective ongoing operation as was demonstrated as recently as 1 April this year when, in the report released by the PJT, we saw it allowing only a 0.25c per litre increase in motor spirit prices as contrasted with the increases that were actually sought by the oil companies which ranged from 0.9c to 3.25c per litre. We had a situation of the PJT removing an amount from the list price of motor spirit which was providing a return on investment in retail outlets. It said it had reviewed in the process the whole basis of petroleum prices and, as a maximum justified wholesale price, allowed 0.35c per litre less than would have been the case if the review of the basis for the prices had not been undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA> So as recently as April this year the PJT demonstrated itself to be a very effective regulatory organisation with respect to an industry which manifestly cries out in the public interest for that kind of control. So it cannot be said that this legislation was necessary to fill any regulatory vacuum that needed to be filled in the public interest. We had the PJT. As we have debated earlier tonight, the justification for its abolition simply does not add up. </PARA>
<PARA> That is the general context in which this Bill is being debated. That is the general combination of reasons why the Opposition takes the attitude it does towards it. In addition to those general reasons, as I foreshadowed at the outset, it is our view also that the Bill contains a number of specific individual defects in terms of its internal operation to the extent that it provides grossly excessive ministerial discretions. The way it is set up, the Minister may direct the Commissioner on how he is to conduct an inquiry and what he is to take into account. Again, the way it is set up, the Minister may appoint anyone to conduct inquiries with no requirement that such persons have no conflicting pecuniary interest. For example, there is no inhibition in the Bill as it is presently drawn on appointing even the head of the Shell company in Australia for that task. The discretions in the Bill are created in such a way that the Minister may refuse to allow the Authority to conduct an inquiry without his giving reasons for such refusal. As this legislation is set up, the Minister decides what is to be done, how it is to be done and who will do it. We suggest that the public can have little faith that political pressure in this respect will not be applied. </PARA>
<PARA> I have endeavoured to describe as briefly as possible, given the time constraints which we are all under, the basics of the Opposition's attitude on this matter. In essence I suppose our point can be summarised as follows: We oppose the abolition of the PJT because of the implications of that not only for the petroleum industry but also for pricing policy and industry generally. In the specific context of the petroleum industry we support the findings of the Collins Royal Commission on the need for an agency to deal with all aspects of distribution, marketing and pricing. The amendment to the motion for the second reading of this Bill makes those concerns of the Opposition clear. Accordingly, I move:</PARA>
<PARA> Leave out all words after 'That', insert 'The Senate is of the opinion that-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the Bill should be withdrawn and redrafted to extend the role of the Petroleum Products Pricing Authority to that of an independent regulatory agency for the petroleum and petroleum products industries as recommended by the 4th Report of the Royal Commission on Petroleum (the Collins Report), with functions to include:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) restructuring, monitoring and regulating the pricing system,</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) the rationalisation, where necessary, of retail outlets,</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) the regulation of dealer-company relationships, and</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) the development of a conservation program; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The Government should be condemned for its decision to abolish the Prices Justification Tribunal which was carrying out the functions of the proposed Petroleum Products Pricing Authority and calls upon it to retain a reformed Tribunal for such purposes as the provision of effective powers to monitor and inquire into the justification of prices in all oil products and other goods exempted by this Bill'. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now even more briefly to the other Bill in this odd package of Bills which we are debating cognately-the Australian Capital Territory Gaming and Liquor Authority Bill. The situation is that we have a Bill which is designed to amalgamate three existing Australian Capital Territory statutory authorities-the Australian Capital Territory Totalisator Agency Board, the Liquor Licensing Board and the Poker Machine Licensing Board of the Capital Territory. By that means it is claimed to rationalise the number of statutory authorities in the Territory, to bring together a range of like and interrelated functions, leading to a more effective and efficient co-ordination of gambling and liquor controls. It is claimed that administrative efficiencies will flow from this amalgamation. That is not a claim the Opposition is disposed to contest in any way. It seems reasonable; it seems plausible. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as that goes, we have no opposition whatsoever to the concept of this Bill. It seems to be one of the more legitimate ways in which perhaps a public administration conscious government could wield a razor. However, we are concerned with the fact that the Bill stops there. In our second reading amendment that we proposed to this Bill, it is made clear that we regard the Bill as deficient to the extent that it makes no explicit provision for the way in which the profits raised by these organisations, now to become a single organisation, will be distributed in the larger interests of the Australian Capital Territory community. It is the case at the moment that about $2m a year is being allocated within the Australian Capital Territory as a result of the activities of these gambling and other organisations. In our view, it is important that those funds be allocated in accordance with the wishes of the Australian Capital Territory people. Accordingly, we will be moving a second reading amendment to the Australian Capital Territory Gaming and Liquor Authority Bill. Because of the detailed drafting necessary to accomplish our purpose and because of the shortage of legislative draftsmen the amendment could not be completed in time for this evening's debate. However, it will read:</PARA>
<PARA> Leave out all words after 'that', insert 'the Bill be withdrawn and re-drafted to provide that the dispersal of funds raised by the Authority, other than those committed to the racing industry, will be in accordance with determinations of the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly but limited to purposes associated with sport, recreation, culture, welfare and community related activities in the Australian Capital Territory.''. </PARA>
<PARA>I have given the reason the Opposition takes the attitude it does toward these Bills. Although we feel quite strongly, particularly about the Petroleum Products Pricing Bill, because of time constraints we will not seek a division on this legislation at the second reading stage because we have some further points to make at the Committee stage. It might be desirable to conclude this matter before the Senate's scheduled rising time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I indicate that the Government will not accept either amendment to these Bills at the second reading stage. The amendment put forward by Senator Evans to the Petroleum Products Pricing Bill 1981 is against the general thrust of the Review of Commonwealth Functions, an object of which was to reduce the unnecessary regulation in business. Clearly what the Prices Justification Tribunal has done in the past-I speak of the time before the 1979 amendments-has been aimed clearly towards a very high level of regulating activity. Since then we have seen its role changed to that of a price surveillance body. In that sense it will be seeking certainly to maintain an overview of the Australian economy, making sure that it has that power to perceive price changes which are beyond the norm and to report thereon. Of course, this will be now defined in terms of the petroleum industry. This is something which I believe the community has learned to accept-indeed to demand-in today's climate of possible shortages and dislocations in the supply of petroleum products.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to other matters concerning dealerships and the retailing of petroleum products, the Government legislated last year in respect of this matter. We now know that that legislation has been accepted in the general community. The amendment also speaks of the development of a conservation program. It should be clear that an important aim of the Government's crude oil pricing policy is the conservation of scarce liquid fuel resources. The Government recognises the significance of petroleum products prices to the economy and its energy policy, and is therefore retaining surveillance of these prices through the new authority which is to be established in place of the activities of the former Prices Justification Tribunal. For those reasons the Government rejects the amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> I just mention in respect of Senator Evans's proposed amendment to the Australian Capital Territory Gaming and Liquor Authority Bill that he seeks to put the actual decision-making process in relation to the funds that may accumulate as a result of the activities of the Authority into the hands of the House of Assembly. Clearly, that is beyond its generally accepted powers in the community which are, of course, advisory only at this stage of the game. The Government rejects that proposed amendment. </PARA>

<PARA> (b) that unreasonably high profits are not being made at the expense of the consumers and that unnecessarily high costs, either as the result of inefficiency or other unjustified reasons, are not being passed into prices. </PARA>

<PARA> (7) Page 14, clause 20, sub-clause (1), Line 19, leave out '$10,000', insert '$100,000'. </PARA>
<PARA>I shall speak very briefly to the amendments. The first amendment would remove the discretionary power of the Minister to exempt any product from the process of price scrutiny for the purposes of the Act. The second amendment would extend the scope of the Authority's power to include a trading entity in which a company has a beneficial financial interest. The purpose of the Bill, as we see it drafted at the moment, could be hindered by the use of non-corporate entities such as trusts or partnerships. They could be used to get around the operation of the Act. We see it as being desirable at this stage to block off that loophole. We also see it as being almost certainly within the Commonwealth's constitutional power to do so, to the extent that although corporations themselves are not directly being regulated by this kind of provision, parent corporations in effect are the ultimate beneficiaries of it. That would seem to attract the necessary power. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendments (3) and (4) are designed to provide the same direct or indirect pecuniary interest provisions as exist in the Prices Justification Act. We disagree with the way in which-again, without going into detail to try to explain it-the Government's provisions are drawn to the extent that they seem to allow both members of the proposed new Commission to have and to hold interests which are incompatible with the particular purposes that the Bill is designed to serve provided those interests are disclosed. They also go further than that, to the extent that they enable particular commissioners to participate very directly in the performance of particular functions in which there is a manifest conflict of interest, provided that is disclosed. I do not like either of those provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendment (5) eliminates the requirement for a Minister to agree to an inquiry being conducted. Amendment (6), itself a very long amendment which I am now tempted to read into the record-I will not do so-provides guidelines to the Authority as to the definition of a justified price. Amendment (7) increases the penalty for increasing prices after notice has been served on a company from $10,000 to $100,000. That might sound a large amount but it is not when one considers that it has not been increased since 1973 and that the Trade Practices Act has equivalent penalties of $250,000. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I realise that the hour is late and that the Senate was sitting until the early hours of this morning; so I shall not keep it very long. Questions have been asked in this place about the Springbok tour of New Zealand and the effect that it will have on the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting and the Commonwealth Games. The Foreign Minister, the honourable Tony Street, said that he is very concerned about the tour. He has repeatedly expressed the Government's support for the efforts of the New Zealand Government to have this ill-timed and ill-considered tour called off.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The very crux of the situation is the autocratic attitude of the New Zealand Rugby Football Union Council to have the tour of New Zealand by South Africa continue in the face of international criticism. The Council, of course, defends its attitude by using the hackneyed and hypocritical phrase that politics has no place in sport. It refuses to cancel the Springbok tour. I ask honourable senators to recall the time when the Council exclued Maori players from the All Blacks touring side when requested to do so by the South African Government. I put it to you, Mr Deputy President, that the Council has double standards. How can it possibly draw any distinction? Did it regard blatant discrimination of this kind as a political act or a sporting act? I leave the question to honourable senators to decide and rightly condemn what I believe is an exercise in duplicity and deceit. </PARA>
<PARA> I sound a warning that if this tour proceeds it will result in violence and dissension in New Zealand and cause irreparable damage to New Zealand's already somewhat tarnished international reputation. It is a sad day when a sporting body can hold a nation to ransom. I condemn the Council for its stupidity and selfishness. Its high handed attitude will alienate African countries and force them to retaliate and strain, I believe, the very fabric of the Commonwealth severing ties which bind the nations which make up this powerful body. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, this is not the first instance when the unity of the Commonwealth has been threatened by the singularly bloody-minded attitude of the Council to maintain its links with South Africa-the very home of apartheid. This determination to proceed against the weight of public opinion and the wishes of the New Zealand Government has resulted in the Gleneagles agreement. In a nutshell, the New Zealand Rugby Council does not, I believe, give a damn about the views of the Commonwealth. This is not surprising as it also rejects the views of the New Zealand Government and the majority of the many fair-minded New Zealanders. The Council also rejects the weight of public opinion as expressed by newspaper editorials and polls and rejects the views of municipal authorities, trade unions and church leaders alike. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the attention of honourable senators to two important points that the Council has lost sight of in its determination to keep its eye on the ball; as a result it is completely offside in its dogmatic attitude. The first is that whether the Council's actions have political implications is not a matter it can control. I make that assertion in a world where playing sport against South Africa can be interpreted only as an act of comfort for and acceptance of a universally condemned system of government. Therefore the New Zealand Council cannot expect its Simon Pure interpretation of its actions to attract any reaction other than derision and anger. The other point that the Council has conveniently overlooked is that, in continuing to carry on with this tour against all criticism and the weight of public and international opinion, it is committing what can be seen only as a political act and not a mere sporting act. I cannot be convinced-I know that honourable senators will be likewise unconvinced-that for this pious body to persevere in the face of all political considerations raised is, and can be termed only, a political act. It is a political act and, to me, a dangerous political act, one which seeks to elevate sporting interests to an unparalleled and unreal position of importance above and beyond every other aspect of national policy. It is a selfish act and one which affects not only New Zealand but also all other nations within the fragile framework of the Commonwealth. The New Zealand Council, with its insular and self-serving attitude, demonstrates its complete and utter disregard for the very future of this great institution of the Commonwealth of Nations. The Council certainly is not its brother's keeper. I am also at a complete loss to understand and interpret the New Zealand Commonwealth Games Association's attitude to this ill-conceived tour. It appears to me to be adopting a rather ostrich-like attitude. This Pontius Pilate attitude is, thank heavens, in complete contrast to that of the New Zealand athletes union which recently passed a motion calling on the Council to withdraw its invitation to the South African rugby team. It is indeed heartening to see that there are still many nationally minded men in sporting administrations in our sister country who have their values and priorities clearly determined as to what constitutes acts of a sporting or political nature. I congratulate this body for its forthright stand on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> I also point out that the President of the Australian Commonwealth Games Association, Mr Les Martyn, has recently made a statement about the possible-or should I more correctly say, the probable-effects of this tour on the future of the Commonwealth Games. Yet in spite of all this public and private weight of criticism, the President of the New Zealand Commonwealth Games Association remains silent. His silence alone, I believe, condemns him and can only be construed as a tacit approval of this tour. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, I make the following points: Firstly, the New Zealand Rugby Union Football Council has made up its mind in what can only be described as a highly selfish, reckless and badly informed manner that the tour will proceed and is resolute in this determination; and, secondly, to his credit, the New Zealand Foreign Minister, Mr Talboys, has waged an almost single-handed campaign to stop the tour. I have raised these matters in the belief that our Foreign Minister, Mr Tony Street, was correct when he said that plain speaking is called for from time to time in relations between two nations, even between two nations as close as Australia and New Zealand. Mr Street has not pussyfooted around. He has laid the serious consequences directly on the line even at the risk of offending our sister nation. </PARA>
<PARA> I charge the New Zealand Rugby Union Football Council with utter selfishness, stupidity and a complete and utter disregard for the rights and interests of the majority. I also sound a warning that, if racial issues and sporting contacts feature prominently at the forthcoming Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting at the expense of other issues, that situation will be and can only be attributed to the Springbok tour of New Zealand, a tour by a nation whose apartheid policies are not acceptable to the world as a whole or to the Commonwealth in particular. I reject and openly condemn and deride the New Zealand Rugby Union Football Council. I trust that its administration will be able to live with the consequences of this exercise in what I can only term stupidity. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-Tonight, Senator Bonner has addressed himself to one of the great issues of the world. This matter lies very close to our own doorstep. It is a matter of the greatest consequences and certainly of the greatest concern to this Government in relation to its position with regard to the forthcoming Springbok tour of New Zealand. As Senator Bonner pointed out, certainly very considerable concern has been expressed by this Government to the Government of New Zealand in relation to this matter. I think that the statements made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) certainly clearly demonstrate this Government's position. Unfortunately, I was not aware that this matter was coming forward tonight. I was unable to alert the Minister representing the Minister of Foreign Affairs in this place to the import of Senator Bonner's remarks in greater detail.

<PARA> (3) ERDC performed its functions in an entirely adequate manner. As a result of its work, both Commonwealth and State authorities have a sound basis on which to plan future research programs.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) and (5) National research into education will in future be decided as part of a Commonwelth annual review of overall research undertakings. While Commonwealth involvement in fostering and co-ordinating education research will be reduced, the States are expected to take a more active role in education research, determining their own priorities.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) and (7) Reports from ERDC provided information to educators and educational administrators which influenced, directly or indirectly, decisions being made about education in Australia. The ongoing Commonwealth commitment to educational research into issues of national significance, as a complement to the effects of the States, will ensure that relevant findings continue to be available to educators. Co-ordination of the educational research effort will continue, both through the Australian Education Council and through informal channels.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) ERDC operated on an annual budget, the level of which varied from year to year. Its budget for 1980-81 was $1.173m and this will be fully expended. Savings will ultimately be of this order, once commitments have been met. There will also be staff savings of the order of $207,630.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) ERDC made a valuable contribution to Australian educational research. Its programs and activities will influence Australian education for many years. Ongoing Commonwealth and State programs will in the short term complement the work already done.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 9 April 1981 (Hansard, page 1280) Senator Robertson asked me a question, without notice, concerning superannuation arrangements for permanent part time employees in the Northern Territory Public Service. The following further information is provided on the matters raised by Senator Robertson:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> By way of background, employees of the Northern Territory are not, of course, Commonwealth employees but, as a means of providing them with superannuation cover, the Northern Territory was prescribed as an 'approved authority' for the purposes of the Superannuation Act 1976.</PARA>
<PARA> The superannuation scheme provided under the Act was designed for Commonwealth employees and in particular for those in full time employment. Permanent part time employment is not a feature of Commonwealth sector employment at this stage.</PARA>
<PARA> It would be inappropriate for the Commonwealth Government to consider extending the Superannuation Act to part time employees of the Northern Territory before permanent part time employment has been introduced in the Commonwealth sector and before the Government has decided whether to extend superannuation cover to any part time Commonwealth employees. I am not in a position to indicate the timing of any Government consideration of superannuation for Commonwealth part time employees because this will depend, in the first instance, on decisions by Commonwealth employing authorities, such as the Public Service Board, regarding the introduction of permanent part time employment.</PARA>
<PARA> My Department has examined the arrangements made by the South Australian Government for providing its permanent part time public servants with superannuation cover. I am informed that they might be of some assistance if, in the event of the introduction of permanent part time employment in the Commonwealth sector, the Government were to consider providing superannuation cover for part time employees.</PARA>
<PARA> I have suggested to the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory that, in view of the priority the Northern Territory attaches to permanent part time employment, the Northern Territory Government may prefer to introduce its own separate superannuation arrangements for permanent part time employees in the Territory.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 28 April 1981 (Hansard, page 1381) Senator Wheeldon asked me a question, without notice, in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in the Senate. The question concerned press reports alleging recent immigrants from the United Kingdom are members of the National Front. The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have seen reports of a disturbance at the Perth Concert Hall on 22 April, during a performance by a British musical group, 'Madness', and noted that some of the press reports allege that youths known as 'skinheads' were involved in the disturbance; that many were members or supporters of the National Front organisation; and that some were recent immigrants from Britain.</PARA>
<PARA> I have no information which supports the contention that many of the youths who adopt the so called 'skinhead' mode of dress and behaviour are immigrants from Britain or are linked with the National Front. It is understood, however, that, as a result of the disturbance on 22 April, two youths were arrested. One was Australian born, and the other, a 14 year old boy, was born in Britain.</PARA>
<PARA> While applicants for entry to Australia are not normally asked whether they are associated with the National Front such association is likely to come to light as a result of overseas screening procedures and would be given appropriate weight in the decision to approve or refuse an application for entry to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> The National Front organisation has been active in promoting racial intolerance in Britain and has support from a small minority in Australia. The objectives of the National Front are in opposition to the Government's aim of the development and community acceptance of the multicultural nature of Australian society and the preservation of social harmony and cohesion. Its activities are condemned by the Government and by all who believe in equal treatment for all members of the community.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 27 May 1981 (Hansard, page 2151) Senator Sibraa asked me a question, without notice, in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in the Senate. The question concerned Lebanese refugees. The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government is following events in the Lebanon with concern. We continue to be hopeful that a satisfactory solution will be found to the present tensions.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia responded generously to the tragic events that occurred in the Lebanon in 1976-77. 16,000 migrants arrived in that period, and there has been a continuing inflow since then. We have taken steps to provide most practicable facilities for visitor and migrant applicants since then through the Chancery in Beirut, the Immigration Office in Damascus and nearby posts. While the service necessarily cannot be ideal, it has been maintained with the greatest possible convenience to applicants in extremely difficult circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA> In referring to the Lebanese in Lebanon as refugees the question misinterprets the situation in Lebanon and the likely status of Lebanese presently displaced in that country. The United Nations Convention on the Status of Refugees requires that people seeking refugee status be outside their country and be unwilling or unable to return for fear of persecution. People displaced by civil strife and fighting are not necessarily refugees within the meaning of the Convention definition. It is also unlikely that those persons who have left Lebanon recently because of civil conflict could meet the Convention requirements for status.</PARA>
