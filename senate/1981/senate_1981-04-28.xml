<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Transport: Is it a fact that the Government is considering increases rumoured to range from 300 to 500 per cent in the landing fees and other charges levied upon the general aviation industry by the Department of Transport? Is the Minister aware that rumours of increased charges of such severity have led to consternation in the industry as such action would almost certainly lead to the financial failure of many businesses and organisations already hard hit by previous increases in departmental charges and steep fuel price rises? Is the Minister aware that many of the businesses and organisations threatened in this way provide the only regular and reliable transport links to many isolated communities throughout Australia, especially when roads are closed, sometimes for weeks, following heavy rains and when shortages of essential food items and medicines can be overcome only through the use of aircraft? Will the Minister assure the Senate that before the imposition of such crushing increases in fees is further contemplated he will consult with the official representatives of the general aviation industry?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am advised by the Minister for Transport, who has provided some information on this matter, that a report on the general aviation industry has been prepared by the Department but has not yet been considered. The report recommends increases in air navigation charges of 25 per cent in real terms, as well as the elimination of some types of remissions of part of these charges available to certain operators. In addition, it is recommended that movement charges ranging from $4 to $20 a movement be introduced at selected major Commonwealth airports. The net effect of these proposals on charges payable would, of course, depend on the use of the major airports made by particular general aircraft.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report does not recommend any variations to existing rates of fuel excise and airport rents and leases. The report makes an assessment of the likely impact those proposed charges would have on the industry and specifically takes into account the operators' ability to pay those new recommended charging levels. The report does not identify any adverse effects arising from the proposed charging arrangements on the provision of transport links to isolated communities. The Government will, of course, give that particular aspect detailed attention when it is considering the report's recommendations. There has been detailed consultation with the industry on the general aviation study since its initiation in 1978. Since then the matter has been discussed by the Minister with representatives of the industry in what is known as the Aviation Industry Advisory Council. The Minister has made it clear in that forum that the Government has no commitment to any of the recommendations at this stage and has invited the general aviation industry representatives to provide comments on the report so that they may be taken into account when the Government is considering the report's various recommendations.</PARA>

Is there any scrutiny by immigration officials in Great Britain of those who wish to become immigrants to this country as to whether they are associated with the National Front?

But I was not aware of the suggestion contained in Senator Wheeldon's question, that the disturbances may have been provoked by recent migrants from the United Kingdom who were possibly members of the National Front. As to the detailed question concerning that matter, namely, the screening of migrants in relation to membership of that organisation and so on, I will refer that question to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and ask him to provide an early answer.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I preface my question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Health, by referring to the contents of a Press statement made by that Minister on 16 April in relation to vitamin and mineral supplements. How does the Minister explain the contradiction between the first part of that statement, in which the Minister for Health goes to great lengths to imply that the status quo will prevail, and its latter stages, and here I refer to the first paragraph on page 2, in which he uses the words, 'dangers associated with excessive intake', et cetera? I challenge the Minister to document the veracity of the statement that latent dangers do exist. Can the Minister provide statistical data to prove this assertion?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1382" SPEAKER="Baume Sen The Hon P.E." NAMEID="ME4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I became a member of the Senate I practised as a doctor. Occasionally I had to treat people suffering from poisoning due to certain vitamin overdoses. I refer particularly to overdoses of vitamin D and suggest to the honourable senator that there can be no question about the danger of that vitamin, taken inappropriately. Vitamin A can also cause problems. Currently, preparations of vitamin A which contain in excess of 10,000 international units per daily dose and preparations of vitamin D which contain in excess of 25 micrograms per daily dose are listed in schedule 4 of the uniform poisons standard. That means that these high dose preparations are available only on prescription.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What I must point out is that these restraints on the sale of vitamin A and vitamin D are long standing; they are not new. They were first recommended by the National Health and Medical Research Council in November 1974 and were subsequently adopted in State and Territory legislation. These restraints are similar to those employed in other Western countries, including, for example, the United States of America. It was these vitamins and these strengths to which the Minister for Health was referring in the section of the statement which read: 'There were, however, dangers associated with excessive intake of some preparations and some high dose preparations were already available only on a doctor's prescription'. Of course, that is a point on which there could be genuine misunderstanding on the part of people reading the material. The Minister had stated previously, and reiterated: 'It is essential that these safeguards be maintained'.</PARA>
<PARA> The toxicity data on vitamins A and D is well documented. For example, I refer Senator Mulvihill to the United States National Research Council publication 'Recommended Daily Allowances' of 1980; the United States Federal Register, Volume 38, No. 142, 2 August 1973, entitled, 'Status of Vitamin A and Vitamin D'; and the United States Federal Register, Volume 44, No. 53, 16 March 1979, entitled, 'Vitamin and Mineral Drug Products for Over-the-Counter Human Use'. In view of this kind of information and the long-standing knowledge about the dangers of particular kinds of vitamin overdose, the problem raised by the honourable senator can be understood and the apparent difficulties overcome. The Minister does not believe that there was any real contradiction in his statement.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Deputy President, I ask a supplementary question. If one accepts the broad timetable given by the Minister, which seeks in two years time the reaching of some understanding on regulations, are we to assume that it will be possible in the interim for the States to go it alone with punitive or curbing legislation or regulations, or is there an understanding that they will work in tandem with the Federal Minister for Health in the long term discussions?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;From memory, I understand that the Minister for Health emphasised in his Press statement that the intention was that there should be the widest possible discussion following the information which he has released. I take it that the honourable senator would endorse that course of action. The States, as sovereign States, are free to take whatever action they like, but I believe that it is the intention of all health administrations, both State and Federal, to seek co-operative action. Although they are their own masters, I would hope that the kind of co-operative action which has been visible and evident so far could be followed in this case.</PARA></TALK.START>

At the same time, will the Attorney-General also call for a report of remarks supporting the family which were made by Judge Heenan, also of Western Australia, I think within the last fortnight?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have read something about statements made by Mr Justice Barblett, the Chairman of Judges of the Family Court of Western Australia. I am not aware of the remarks of Judge Heenan to which Senator Martyr referred. The position is that under the Constitution the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth Parliament and the Commonwealth Government does not extend into de facto relationships as it does in relation to marriage relationships. Of course, a great deal of legislation of this Parliament recognises de facto relationships for other purposes, but we are talking at the moment, I take it, about regulating those relationships in family matters such as the custody of children, the maintenance of children, property arrangements and so on. I think that was what the question referred to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The position is that the Family Court of Western Australia has not been inhibited by those constitutional restraints. Indeed, one of the justifications of the State Family Court of Western Australia is that it has been invested with powers emanating from both this Parliament and the Western Australian Parliament. Judges of the Family Court of Australia operating under the Family Law Act have found that there are difficulties in situations which arise before them because of their limited jurisdiction, and the Family Law Council, of which Mr Justice Barblett is the Chairman, is examining the whole question of de facto relationships in relation to these problems. I have not actually seen the details of what Mr Justice Barblett said, but I imagine that it related to that type of issue. I will certainly seek to obtain a report of what he said and give it consideration.</PARA>
<PARA> The deficiencies I have referred to in relation to the powers of this Parliament in these matters are the subject of discussion with four States. I anticipate that there will be a reference of powers from those States to the Commonwealth Parliament to enable wider jurisdiction to be conferred on the Family Court of Australia, similar to the powers that are able to be exercised by the Family Court of Western Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Colston has raised a number of matters with me with respect to this matter. I understood his earlier questions related to initial applications for invalid pensions in regard to which I advised him in a prepared answer that there was some delay which was caused by delays within the Department of Health and that work was being undertaken by the Department to remove those delays. There is a quite separate problem relating to those applications which actually have been dealt with and which have not been dealt with to the satisfaction of applicants because, as Senator Colston indicated in his question, there has not been a medical appointment to the Social Security Appeals Tribunal in Queensland, and that appointment is necessary before appeals can be dealt with. The number of appeals, incidentally, as I understand it, is not very large. It is a much smaller number than the number of those being delayed at the point of initial application. However, the matter has been receiving close attention from my Department and, indeed, from me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are some difficulties with respect to the remuneration of people on the Social Security Appeals Tribunal. The level of remuneration currently paid is not as high as that paid with respect to some other tribunals of a similar nature. That is a matter which I have taken up with the Minister for Finance and with the Minister for Administrative Services. I think the matter is at the point at which it has been made an urgent reference to the Remuneration Tribunal. So the matter is getting close attention. I am quite dissatisfied with it. I do not think there is an alternative way in which I can deal with the appeals but I will examine the honourable senator's suggestion and if there is a way of obviating the difficulty I will do so. I indicate here, as I have indicated before, that my instruction to the Department is that no person is to suffer due to these delays. There is usually an alternative form of benefit available-that is, either sickness or unemployment benefit-and every effort is being made to ensure that people are not put in a disadvantaged position because of real administrative problems.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen a Press release from the Northern Territory-I am not sure whether it came from the Minister for Health or from Mr Tuxworth-stating that Aboriginal infant mortality rates do continue to decline and that the latest recorded rates are the lowest ever recorded. I pick up the interjection from Senator Keeffe and reply that I think all honourable senators would agree that the infant mortality rates are still too high and I would want it clearly understood that that is the Government's view as well as the view of every Australian. I think Senator Kilgariff, who asked the question, would be the first to acknowledge that. The improvements are said to be due in part to improved environmental conditions in the Northern Territory. I think that was included in the Press release. In particular, mention was made of improvements in water supply and sewage disposal. I am glad that the Northern Territory can point to some improvement in the provision of these services.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The figures released this morning by the Northern Territory, I think from its Department of Health, show something like 36 deaths per 1,000 live births compared with 45 in 1979 and a rate of 142 deaths per 1,000 live births in 1971. Those are not the details for the years which the honourable senator requested but I think they give a picture of what has been happening. At the same time, the infant mortality rate in the non-Aboriginal population is somewhere below 10 deaths per 1,000 live births. So there is still a considerable difference. Further improvements in environmental conditions clearly are required if we are to bring that rate down and to continue to bring it down.</PARA>
<PARA> I agree with the honourable senator's praise for the dedication and work of health workers in the Northern Territory, including Aboriginal health workers. The only other thing I should say is that one has to look at all these figures with some degree of caution. Over the years we have had debates in this place when it looked as though the rates had gone up. Now we have a situation where the rates have come down. I point out that with a total number of births which might be 400, 500 or 600 in a year, a single death less may affect the rates. We simply have to be a little cautious in placing too much emphasis on a particular result in a particular year. We have to look at the trends.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Resources. I remind him that, following the Soviet incursion into Afghanistan, this Government stated that in line with the United States Government's position it would seriously consider economic and trade sanctions against the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. I ask the Minister: Is it a fact that United States trade with the Soviet Union had decreased by approximately 50 per cent? Is it also true that, prior to the statement made by the Minister a few days ago about withdrawing the sanctions, Australia's trade with the USSR had increased during that period by 400 per cent? If so, does the Minister agree that the talk of economic sanctions was never intended to be for anything more than internal political expediency and consumption?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not aware whether the figures are correct. I will seek the information and let the honourable senator know. As to the sanctions, they were meant to convey a real message. I think a substantial number of countries of the free world, with Australia playing a significant part, expressed to the USSR a viewpoint on Afghanistan that had a clear, a significant, and, I believe, a salutary message. Indeed, the countries of the free world have been looking with the greatest anxiety at Poland and at the danger of Soviet incursion. That message, we hope, has been conveyed to the Soviet. In any case, I cannot understand why any thinking Australian would oppose the use of such a message. All Australians would want aggression such as that in Afghanistan to be stopped and the withdrawal of foreign troops to take place. All Australians would want Poland to be free and not behind an Iron Curtain. This is one of the ways in which a useful message has been expressed not only by Australia but also by many other countries.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Education, relates to an article in Computer World, Volume III, No. 39 of 3 April 1981. That article states that Australia is producing far fewer systems analysts and computer programmers than are needed in this country and that many people are being allowed into Australia from overseas to satisfy this need. Will the Government give support to encouraging more people at tertiary education institutions to work for degrees in these areas and ease the present Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme restrictions so that people who have one degree can go on to obtain a further degree in this area? Could the Minister also liaise with his counterpart, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, because there is some evidence that under the present policies people whose qualifications are somewhat suspect are entering Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Inevitably, with the new expansionary trends in Australia there will be shortages in some skilled areas. Computer programming is just one of those areas. It is desirable that as far as possible we should seek to meet our requirements from among our indigenous people. Therefore, within the education system the Tertiary Education Commission has a responsibility, as do the States, to ensure that a stimulus is given in this regard. I am advised that that is happening. As to whether any stimulus through the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme allowance would be useful, that is a matter for consideration by my colleague in another place. I am assured that there is liaison between the various departments, including the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, but I will bring the honourable senator's question to the attention of the Minister for Education and seek his consideration of it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister for National Development and Energy whether he remembers saying at his 2 February 1981 Press conference, in reply to a question regarding a cost estimate of $52 a barrel for the production of synthetic oil from shale: 'The fact is that there is some $10 billion of co-partnership of the Australian partners and Exxon to say that they are going to produce shale oil in Australia at import parity prices'. Does he still believe that the co-partners have $10 billion to say that they are going to produce oil at import parity prices? Also, does he believe that Rundle shares would have been talked up by such claims as he made on 2 February?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1389" SPEAKER="Carrick Sen The Hon J.L." NAMEID="2U4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I recall at a Press conference being asked about a particular price per barrel which was higher than that represented by the ordinary import parity trends. I do not know whether it was the particular figure that Senator Walsh has mentioned. I recall giving a general answer which indicated that the investment by the co-partners of very large amounts of money expressed their confidence that they would be capable of producing shale oil at a price that would be competitive under import parity pricing arrangements. The fact of the matter is that no other guarantees were given to them. The entry of people into shale oil extraction, and the committal of their energies and finances, could only result from their belief that they could do that. Therefore it was, I believe, a sensible reply.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the second matter raised by the honourable senator, I reject entirely any suggestion of talking up the shares. I draw the attention of Senator Walsh to a number of occasions, including occasions well recorded and documented in Hansard and the Press, when I have stated that, by its very nature, shale oil extraction is a frontier- type endeavour involving high technology and a great outlay of skills and finances, and involving also a technology which is still to be determined. That is on record. Indeed, publications such as the Australian Financial Review have featured my putting abroad those kinds of cautionary messages. There was no talking up of the Rundle shares as such.</PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that, when it came to my attention and the attention of the Government that the particular circumstances of Rundle might be somewhat different from the public belief, it was our considered judgment that the partners should refine their decision as quickly as possible and reveal it to the public. So it has been our intention at all times, demonstrated very accurately in recent months, to ensure that the most available and up to date knowledge should be known by the public as quickly as possible.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This piece of legislation relates to the proposed Joint Sitting of the Parliament to deal with matters arising from the untimely and unfortunate premature death of Senator Knight, and is consequential to the Senate (Representation of Territories) Bill which was passed by both Houses of Parliament in 1980. One can only say that it shows how sloppy and inadequate was the original legislation, in that we find the need to bring for the consideration of the Senate, and subsequently of the House of Representatives, a further piece of legislation which will regularise the holding of a Joint Sitting which, I understand, it is proposed will take place in the next week or so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The three Acts that need to be amended as a result of this legislation flow purely from the original Bill which was placed before the Parliament and which at that time should have taken into consideration, in the view of the Opposition, the need to amend the other three Acts. The first one, of course, is the Evidence Act. We are now being asked to approve of an amendment to that Act which will enable the Presiding Officer at a Joint Sitting to sign the necessary documents to be presented to the Governor-General. That is a fairly non-controversial matter and one which should have been provided for in the original legislation. One cannot quarrel with this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill also proposes to amend the Parliamentary Proceedings Broadcasting Act to provide that the Joint Sitting shall be broadcast in accordance with the established principles by which the proceedings in the House of Representatives are broadcast on Tuesdays and Thursdays and the proceedings of the Senate are broadcast on Wednesdays. The broadcast of the proceedings of the Joint Sitting will take place on whichever day the Executive decides it will be held. It stands to reason that the proceedings should be broadcast on that day, or those days should there be some point of contention which one cannot canvass at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> It is necessary also to amend the Parliamentary Papers Act to provide authority for the publication of the proceedings of the Joint Sitting and for protection to be given to the Government Printer in respect of any legal proceedings arising out of the publication of the proceedings of such a Joint Sitting. This view was expressed last year by the Opposition when we were discussing the substantive legislation. The Opposition took the view that a Joint Sitting of the Parliament should not be necessary to deal with a by-election situation or the filling of a Senate vacancy. At that time we did not know that within a year we would be placed in the position in which we are now placed. We took the view that the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly, the body which is responsible to the electors of the Australian Capital Territory, should select a person to fill a Senate vacancy for the Australian Capital Territory in the same way as applies to Senate vacancies for State representation, subject to that overriding change that was agreed to by referendum, that is, that in the event of a resignation or a vacancy occurring on the death of an elected senator, that senator's place should be filled by the nominee of the party to which the late member belonged. The Opposition argued that point in both the House of Representatives and the Senate when the substantive legislation was debated just a year ago. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Government had made a decision that such a matter should be determined by a Joint Sitting of the Parliament. That decision flowed from the experience of the double dissolution that took place in 1974 when for the first time for a considerable number of years it was established that the Parliament had the ability to hold a Joint Sitting-that is, a sitting of both the House of Representatives and the Senate-for the purpose of passing legislation as a result of the deadlock position which caused the double dissolution in that year. The Government took the view that the principle having been established, that should be the process by which Territory vacancies for the Senate would be filled in the event of a death or resignation of a sitting member. The amendments that the Opposition moved on the earlier occasion were not agreed to by the Government. It was decided that the filling of such a vacancy should be decided by a Joint Sitting of the Parliament. Consequently, these three relatively minor amendments to this legislation have become necessary. They are machinery amendments and do not strike at any basic principle. They flow, naturally, from the passage of the original legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill was introduced on the last day of sitting before the Parliament rose for its two-week recess. We are debating it today. It is the intention of the Government to have the matter dealt with in the House of Representatives tomorrow so that the Joint Sitting can take place. The views of the Senate or of the Opposition on these minor amendments matter not; the principle has been established in the legislation that there shall be a Joint Sitting. The Bill tidies up the defects that were in the original legislation and in fact establishes the procedures for the Joint Sitting to take place and to become an effective legal process by which a vacancy shall be filled. Whilst the Opposition has not had the opportunity in the party room to debate this matter at any great length, the Executive of my party met this morning and decided to offer no opposition to the amendments to the three Acts concerning the Joint Sitting of the Parliament. In those circumstances the Opposition will not oppose the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a couple of questions. The first seeks some clarification. Do the amendments contained in the Bill cover also the event of a casual vacancy occurring in the Northern Territory? The second reading speech of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) mentions only the Australian Capital Territory. There is no mention at all of the Northern Territory. I am concerned that if a casual vacancy occurs in the Northern Territory by whatever means at some future time we might have to go through the same exercise again. No mention was made in the second reading speech or in the reply to the second reading debate by the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) as to where the Joint Sitting will take place. I think I read in the Canberra Times of Saturday last that the Joint Sitting will take place in the Senate. I agree with that. I would like to have that aspect clarified.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It appears that the debate on the motion that the Bill be now read a second time and on the amendment moved to that motion has concluded. It only remains for me to say a few words in answer to the debate that took place in the Senate several weeks ago. Of course, that debate was wide ranging and a number of honourable senators took part in it. I had anticipated that at least one honourable senator wished to add his views, but apparently that is not the case. The debate on this first important step of the Freedom of Information Bill is now drawing to a close. That debate has taken place not only in this chamber but also in the community and in the Press. Apparently there has been a great deal of public interest in the Bill and in the debate that started in this Parliament. I received yesterday, and I think all honourable senators will now have received, a copy of about 80 amendments which are to be moved to the Bill in the Committee stage by a number of honourable senators, so it does not appear that the debate will conclude within a reasonable time.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Undoubtedly there will be quite a bit of debate about a number of these amendments. Senator Cavanagh has suggested that the way out of that may be to accept them all. I can assure the Senate that the Government is not prepared to accept them all. As I have said in other places, I will give consideration to them. I hope that there will be some room for compromise. When I talk about compromise I do not mean simply that the Government will give in. Some of the honourable senators who move amendments also will have to give in. The essence of a compromise is that each side gives something in order to achieve something. So let it not be thought that when I use the word 'compromise' I mean that the Government will be conceding all. I think I read something to this effect somewhere. That is not what I mean by compromise. As I have said, I hope that there will be a true spirit of compromise in relation to this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The important matter that we have to decide at this stage is whether to accept the amendment which has been moved by Senator Evans to the question that the Bill be now read a second time. That amendment has four limbs. The Government could really agree with only the fourth limb of that amendment, which states that the Senate:</PARA>
<PARA>reaffirms its continuing commitment to the principle of effective freedom of information legislation, in the belief that such legislation is indispensible to both administrative justice and sound and effective public sector decision-making in the national interest. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that is really saying that the Bill should be read a second time because it is an important principle. I think it is in many respects a quite unnecessary amendment to the motion that the Bill be now read a second time. We would not give the Bill a second reading unless we thought that it indicated a commitment to the principle of freedom of information. The Government cannot accept the other limbs of the amendment moved by Senator Evans. Therefore, in the Government's view, the amendment moved by Senator Evans should be opposed and defeated. The Bill would then be examined in detail in the Committee stage. As I have said, we certainly have plenty of material to consider in the Committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall deal now with the paragraphs of the amendment to which the Government takes exception. The first paragraph reads:</PARA>
<PARA>expresses its concern at the failure of the Executive to explain adequately its rejection of most of the arguments . . . of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs;</PARA>
<PARA>I put down a very lengthy reply to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs last September. We annexed to that a detailed response to all the recommendations contained in that report. It may be that Senator Evans and some other honourable senators do not agree with or like the response that the Government put down but it is quite wrong to say that there was a failure by the Executive to explain its objections to parts of the Senate Committee's report. Therefore, that limb of the amendment is certainly not acceptable to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The second limb reads:</PARA>
<PARA>regrets the excessive deference--</PARA>
<PARA>As it is called-</PARA>
<PARA>to bureaucratic influence that appears to have been involved in the rejection of . . . Senate committee recommendations . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This Bill is a result of the Government's decision. As is the case with all decisions of the Government, a great deal of discussion has taken place with and a great deal of advice has been received from the Public Service. The Senate has to bear in mind that legislation of this kind has a very great bearing upon the day to day administration of government and the provision of resources. Therefore, every Minister, naturally, has concerns for a Bill of this kind, the impact that it will have on the administration of his or her department and the strain it may place upon the resources of the department. The Senate Committee also had the great advantage in its deliberations of hearing from some of the most senior members of the Public Service about the Bill, which was introduced into this Parliament in 1978 and which was considered by the Committee in great detail. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As it did. To use the mildest term, I think there is an unfortunate tone to the second limb. Certain senior public servants may have expressed concern about aspects of the Bill, its ramifications and so on. Their views are relied upon by the Government and, I think, the Parliament. Certainly, with the greater development of parliamentary committees, more frequently the Parliament itself will have the advantage of hearing direct the views of public servants of this calibre. We rely very much on the views and experience of these people. Therefore, I think it is most unfortunate, to say the least, that when they provide advice it should be stigmatised as being a bureaucratic influence or something of that sort.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have said, the Government has naturally had to discuss this legislation in great depth and detail with the Public Service. It has been most necessary for us to ascertain the ramifications of legislation of this sort. But the responsibility for government in this country is on the Government itself and indeed, in the end, on this Parliament. Therefore, it is quite contrary to the Westminster system of government about which we have heard a great deal in this debate that public servants should be blamed in any way for giving their views or should be stigmatised as having some sort of baleful influence. Should there be any substance to such charges, the matter is the responsibility of the Government. The fact is that in this case this Bill is the Government's decision. It is my responsibility on behalf of the Government and if any criticisms are to be levelled by members of this chamber or another place, they should be levelled at the Government or at me. Therefore, it is the tone of the suggestions and the insinuations of paragraph (b) which the Government finds, as I said, at the very least unfortunate, if not offensive. We reject that particular limb of the motion. The third limb of the motion reads:</PARA>
<PARA>expresses its hope that the Executive will in the course of the Committee stage debate give close and sympathetic consideration to the need for substantial amendment of the Bill if it is to be worthy of its name;</PARA>
<PARA>The fact is, as I have indicated already, that the Government will give close consideration to amendments that are proposed. We are doing that already despite the fact that the amendments were presented to me yesterday. I am not criticising that. I can well imagine that they would have taken some time to prepare. I have had them for only a little over 24 hours and certainly I have already given some consideration to them. But the fact is that I am certainly not in a position at this stage to indicate what attitude the Government will be adopting to them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I propose to listen to the debate. I have no doubt that I will be listening to the debate for a very long time. What we have principal objection to in paragraph (c) is the suggestion that the Bill needs to be amended substantially if it is to be worthy of its name. The Government completely rejects that suggestion. Even on that point alone the Government would hope that the Senate would reject this amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I come back to the fundamental issues that we face with this legislation. A point which seems to have been overlooked throughout the public debate on this Bill-when I say public debate I mean what I have read in the Press; I am not referring so much to the debate in this chamber-is the unique feature of this Bill. That feature is that for the first time this Bill gives a right to every member of the public and indeed to those outside Australia to obtain information. It is a right. They do not have to satisfy any particular criteria or any need or purpose for obtaining information. They have a right to information. This Bill gives that right, a right to information in the hands of government which never existed under our law. At the moment, the provision of information in the hands of government is made available, as has always been the case, at the discretion of government, of Ministers or of officials who have authority. Some times, of course, by decision of the Parliament itself information can be obtained but there is no right in law and this is what this Bill achieves. That is a very major difference as far as the rights of the citizen are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> But probably even more important is the new attitude of mind which a Bill of this kind will undoubtedly create in government and government officials. In future, instead of government officials approaching the problem from the point of view of whether the information should be made available and why it should be made available, and so on, the attitude, the approach will have to be: Why should this information not be made available. This really is a very fundamental difference in attitude which I do not say will be created simply by the passage of this legislation but by the experience that will be gained by giving effect to it in the day by day administration of it and in the administration of government. So, there is a very fundamental issue at stake. This legislation is a very fundamental breakthrough. </PARA>
<PARA> In the course of the debate in the Senate as in other places there have been criticisms of the provisions of the legislation. As far as I can see, all such criticisms are raised in the 80 amendments that have been indicated already so I do not propose to argue those cases again here in winding up this debate. In my response to the Senate committee last year and in my second reading speech introducing this Bill I dealt with most of those major questions. I would like to conclude this debate on this note. I have referred already to the very new feature of government administration which will be introduced by this Bill when it becomes law. I believe and the Government believes that undoubtedly there will be major problems with the administration of such a major change as this Bill will introduce. Experience needs to be obtained in how to administer it. Experience needs to be obtained regarding what resources will be required to administer it. Experience has to be obtained as to the nature of requests that will be made under it, the ambit of them, the frequency of them and the width of interest in obtaining information under this Bill and so on. It may be that it will all go off very smoothly and the concerns that the Government has will not be justified. Of course we hope that will be the case. On the other hand, we cannot foresee at this stage just what the size of the demands on government will be and what resources will have to be committed to the administration of this legislation. We are introducing it really as the last step in a major package which this Government has been concerned to introduce over a period of more than five years in an effort to improve the rights of the citizen against the government. I instance the establishment of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, the office of Commonwealth Ombudsman and the proclamation on 1 October last year of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fact is that the same considerations had to apply to that measure as have had to apply to the Freedom of Information Bill. There are many areas of government in respect of which exemptions are required, just as is the case in the legislation before us. Again, such measures carry with them resource implications but already, under the legislation which was introduced last year, some 40 applications for judicial remedy have been made. The improvement in regard to judicial remedies, apart altogether from reasons being required for decisions given, represents a major advance in itself. As the figure indicates, the legislation has been most effective. I venture to suggest that in the long run, as far as the rights of the citizen against government are concerned, the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act, in requiring that reasons be given for decisions made, will prove just as effective as, if not more effective than, the freedom of information legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point I was making before I was diverted somewhat was that the Freedom of Information Bill should be considered as part of a total package which has created a major change in the relationship between the citizen and the Government, one that has been for the better as far as the ordinary citizen is concerned. However, it has undoubtedly raised problems for the Administration, especially in regard to the resources that are required to deal with, and give effect to, the new rights. The legislation has been in process of implementation at a time when the resources available to government have been necessarily strained and at a time when the Government has been seeking to restrain the level of public expenditure and activity. Nevertheless, we have been able to achieve improvements in this area. Such improvements cannot be achieved without creating problems, strains and some additional costs. Therefore, I hope that honourable senators, in approaching the Freedom of Information Bill, will bear those matters in mind and not expect to be able to achieve perfection overnight. I hope that they will realise that steps such as these are best taken cautiously and steadily and that progress is much more likely if we proceed in this way rather than when there is a demand that every problem be solved by one piece of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat that the Government's approach has been to proceed as quickly as possible to get in place a Freedom of Information Act. The Government believes that great benefits are to be obtained from such legislation, that experience will quickly be gained from its administration and that there is no reason to believe that this will be the last attempt by Parliament to provide solutions to problems connected with freedom of information. The Government believes that it would be best advised to wait to see how the measure works in practice and then seek to make further amendments to it. No doubt over the years ahead such amendments would expand the rights of the citizen. When experience has been gained in administering the legislation, we will be in a better position to understand what amendments should be made, rather than making now all of the amendments that might be suggested, thus introducing a measure which, because of the demands that it would create, may well produce further problems and perhaps lead to an unsatisfactory view of freedom of information as a principle. That is the approach that the Government will adopt in the consideration of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government certainly hopes that there will be evident in the Parliament a desire to achieve a Freedom of Information Act without any great delay. I repeat that it is almost three years since the Bill was first introduced and we still do not have an Act. I believe that that goal will be achieved if a reasonable spirit of compromise is present, particularly in the Senate, during the debate that lies ahead. As I have indicated, the Government believes that the Bill already contains great benefits for the citizen and that the sooner he or she can enjoy them, the better. I trust that Senator Evans's motion will be defeated and the Bill read a second time so that we may proceed as quickly as possible with its detailed consideration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Archives Bill, though not for the first time, and I say at the outset that the Government's handling of the legislation which we are currently debating has been most unsatisfactory. When the Archives Bill was first introduced into this place two years ago there were major criticisms of its inadequacies from all sorts of sources-from the general public, from specialist users such as historians and other scholars, from persons interested in the freedom of information issue and, of course, from members of parliament and senators. Following those criticisms, the Government took quite a constructive course of action in referring the Bill for consideration to two Senate committees, the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts and the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. Each of those committees conducted a thorough investigation into various provisions of the Bill, took public evidence, and evidence from specialist sources, and brought down reports which were constructive and which, to use the words that have just been used by the Attorney-General (Senator Durack), had something of the spirit of compromise about them. However, the Government, having the experience and the work of those committees presented to it, has decided not to accept the major recommendations of either of those committees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I proceed to a more detailed discussion of the Archives Bill and the improvements the Opposition wishes to see made in the legislation, I would like to raise again some fundamental questions about the legislation. Why do we want archives legislation? What is the national Archives? How should it be set up? How should it be administrated? I think it is pertinent to consider at this stage those sorts of basic questions. What is the purpose of the legislation before us? Who owns the archival material? Of course, the archival material is owned fundamentally by the public, but it is owned by the public through the agency of the Federal Government. The material which is to go into the Archives is all Commonwealth records covering all activities of the Commonwealth Government. It is to go into the Archives to be available for the public, for the Public Service, and for any other specialist users, after a period of 30 years. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is very important to remind ourselves when we get into the more detailed discussion about the faults and inadequacies in the legislation before us that we are in fact dealing with material which is 30 years old. For that reason, of course, many of the timid exclusions and exemptions the Government has seen fit to try to impose on access to this material are particularly unjustified. They might have some justification if we were dealing with contemporary material. When we are dealing with material that is 30 years old, the timidity of the Government is totally unjustified. There are other questions we should ask. Who should have access to archival material and on what terms and conditions? We need to ask ourselves what is the best system of setting up and administering a Commonwealth archives to ensure what I consider to be the two main functions of the Archives, namely, that Commonwealth material is conserved, and that there is proper public access to that material. We should also ask what the relevance of this legislation is to the Government's commitment to provide freedom of information in this country.</PARA>
<PARA> When we consider the legislation before us in terms of those basic questions, we can see how basically unsatisfactory it is. There will be no proper public access to a great deal of material. There will be exemption of a great deal of material which ought to find its way into the Archives, and of course there will be total secrecy about some aspects of Commonwealth records which will be excluded from the Archives but about which exclusion the public and even the Parliament will know nothing. I will deal with those matters in some detail. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts, after considering the Archives legislation in the form in which it was first presented to the Parliament, made five major recommendations. The first two recommendations concerned the composition and the responsibilities of the Advisory Council of the Archives. Those first two have been adopted by the Government, so I do not wish to make any more comment on them at this stage. But the secondary recommendations of the Senate Committee were of much greater significance in terms of the fundamental question about why we have an archives anyway, and they have been rejected by the Government. Because of the Government's refusal to accept recommendations from the bipartisan Senate Committee, at a later stage of the debate I will move on behalf of the Opposition an amendment to the motion for the second reading which will express the Senate's concern at the failure of the Executive to ensure that the Bill accords with all the recommendations of the reports on the Archives Bill 1978 by the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts and the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. I foreshadow at this stage the intention of the Opposition in the Committee stage of the debate to move amendments which will have the effect of including those recommendations in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw the attention of the Senate to the recommendations which have been rejected by the Government at this stage and which we hope to have included in the legislation in the Committee stage of the debate. In discussing those recommendations I will be referring to the report of the Senate Standing Committee, in particular to pages 18 to 22, because the arguments put forward there are still the arguments that I hold and they are still arguments which have not been satisfactorily rejected by the Government. The first matter of concern was the provision to allow the exemption of Cabinet and Executive Council records from the Archives. In the report of the Senate Standing Committee it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . in the case of Cabinet and Executive Council records no official explanation has been given for their exclusion from the provisions of Division 2. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the Attorney-General, when commenting on the Senate Committee's report, made a response with regard to our objections to the exemption of Cabinet and Executive Council records. The Minister, on 11 September 1980, made a response but we regarded his response as unsatisfactory. I repeat here the view of the Senate Committee:</PARA>
<PARA> It seems difficult to escape the conclusion that Cabinet and Executive Council records are, after all, records of the executive arm of government, very much akin to records of Commonwealth departments and therefore should be treated like any other Commonwealth records under the provisions of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> We conclude that while the exclusion of vice-regal, parliamentary and court records is acceptable on the grounds of preserving the traditional independence of these arms of government from the executive, we could find no good reason why this same exemption should apply to records of the Cabinet and Executive Council. </PARA>
<PARA>We therefore recommended that the Bill be amended so as to remove the exemption provisions relating to the records of the Cabinet and Executive Council. This is a very timely objection for those honourable senators or members of the public who were able just today to hear the complaints of the former Minister for Industrial Relations, Andrew Peacock, in another place. Many of the reasons he gave for his resignation from the Government and for his total dissaffection with the leadership of the Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, focused on the role of the Executive and of the Cabinet. The Cabinet and the Executive Council are part of the Government. They are not separate from it and their deeds and actions ought not to be excluded from any public consideration of the performance of the Government. That was the tenor of many of the remarks of Andrew Peacock, and I think he has made a very important criticism of the conduct of this Government. I make a similar criticism here of the Government's refusal to include Cabinet and Executive Council records within the normal provisions of the Archives legislation. There is no justification in my view, in the view of the Opposition, and indeed in the view of all the members of the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts, for the exemption of these records from the Archives. I stress again that we are dealing not with contemporary material, with which there may be problems with regard to international relations, security and so on, but with material which is 30 years old. Why should this material, which after all belongs to the people of Australia, be excluded from the provisions of the Archives legislation? The Attorney-General has given no satisfactory explanation to date. I hope that in the absence of a satisfactory explanation he will be prepared to accept our proposed amendment that the exemption of Cabinet and Executive Council records be deleted from the provisions of the Archives legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The second major objection of the Senate Standing Committee and of the Opposition concerns the exemption of material from transfer to the Archives at the discretion of a Minister. Again, I should like to draw the attention of the Senate to the reasons given by the Senate Standing Committee for its objection to that provision. In paragraph 5.18 and the following paragraphs of our report we stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It has been alleged by some critics of the Bill that certain elements of clause 28--</PARA>
<PARA>I point out that that is now clause 30 of the Bill currently under consideration-</PARA>
<PARA>provide too much latitude for institutions to frustrate the work of the Archives. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 26 of the Bill provides that all Commonwealth records shall be transferred to the Archives when they are no longer required and, in any case, when they are 25 years old. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 27--</PARA>
<PARA>Now Clause 29-</PARA>
<PARA>provides for the staff of the Archives to have reasonable access to records in the custody of Commonwealth institutions in order to survey and document records and arrange for their disposal. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of clause 28--</PARA>
<PARA>Now clause 30-</PARA>
<PARA>is that certain records can be exempted from the provisions of these clauses. </PARA>
<PARA> Sub-clause 28 (1)--</PARA>
<PARA>Now sub-clause 30 (1)-</PARA>
<PARA>enables a Commonwealth institution, with the consent of the Archives, to exempt some or all of its records from transfer to the Archives or from access by the Archives' staff. If the Archives refuses to agree with a Commonwealth institution that a record should be exempted from transfer . . . the responsible minister may, under sub-clause 30 (2), exempt a record without the consent of the Archives, provided the Archives is notified of such a ruling. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, paragraph 28 (2) (a)--</PARA>
<PARA>Now paragraph 30 (2) (a)-</PARA>
<PARA>allows the responsible minister to determine that a record is not required to be transferred to the Archives under the requirement of clause 26. </PARA>
<PARA>The Senate Committee further stated:</PARA>
<PARA> We believe that the powers conferred on the responsible minister under paragraph 28 (2) (a)--</PARA>
<PARA>Now paragraph 30 (2) (a)-</PARA>
<PARA>of the Bill are unnecessary and tend to frustrate the basic purpose of the legislation. The sole purpose of setting up the Archives is for the impartial management, safe custody and preservation of the archival resources of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>I repeat that principle:</PARA>
<PARA>The sole purpose of setting up the Archives is for the impartial management, safe custody and preservation of the archival resources of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>The decision by the Government to allow a Minister, at his own discretion, to refuse to allow material to be transferred to the Archives is, I believe, a fundamental contradiction of the basic purpose which has been set out. Again, the decision was not justified in any way by the Attorney-General when he responded to the Committee's report. So the Opposition will persist with its view that the provision which gives the Minister power to refuse to transfer material from his Department to the Archives, even when that decision has been opposed by the Archives, ought to be deleted. </PARA>
<PARA> Our third major objection to the legislation concerned the exemption for the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. What has happened since the Senate Committee reported is that the total exclusion and exemption made available for ASIO has now been extended to the other security organisations. We now find that clause 30 (8) of the Bill states:</PARA>
<PARA> The concurrence of the Director-General is not required for the making of a determination under sub-section (1) by, or by a person having authority to act on behalf of, any of the following Commonwealth institutions, namely:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the Australian Security Intelligence Organization;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The Australian Secret Intelligence Service;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the Defence Signals Directorate;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) the Joint Intelligence Organization; and</PARA>
<PARA> (e) the Office of National Assessments. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact the Bill is even more restrictive in its present form than it was in the form in which it was considered by the Senate Committee. Contrary to our recommendations that there should be some amelioration of this total exemption of ASIO records from any obligations to be moved into Archives, we now have that exemption included to cover all our intelligence organisations. Our view is that the sub-clause exempting all the intelligence organisations should be redrafted to ensure that the Director-General of each of these organisations cannot make a determination under clause 30 (8) without the approval of the Minister. This, of course, is a crucial issue as far as the Opposition is concerned. We do not believe that security organisations ought to behave unilaterally with no accountability at all to the elected parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> We believe that proposition in all circumstances and we most certainly believe it when we are dealing with records which are 30 years old. Of course, the consequence of the legislation in its present form-this absolute exemption of all the documents of the intelligence organisations-is that no one will ever know what those organisations have been doing. No one will ever know about any improprieties committed by any of their staff members nor about any inaccurate but damaging records which have been held and used against members of the public, the Public Service and the defence forces. </PARA>
<PARA> We know from the information made available to us in the Hope report that there has been a good deal of bungling by intelligence forces in this country. We know that there will continue to be bungling. We know that there has been impropriety. We know that powers in regard to phone tapping and so forth will be improperly used from time to time. In fact, in the view of some of us, they are always improperly used. We know that, because of the calibre of people who go into some of these services, there will be an abuse of the secrecy and of the power. We know that damaging records are kept on Australian citizens, including members of parliament, and yet all of this bungling and impropriety will be a secret for ever. Those organisations will never be made accountable in any sense, so the mistakes they are making now will still be a secret in 30 years from now and will be a secret for ever. That is totally unacceptable to the Opposition. I would be very surprised if it is acceptable to many Government senators. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition will move accordingly in the Committee stage to implement the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee in those three major areas. But there are some other matters which I wish to raise in regard to the Government's performance in setting up archives legislation and a national archives institution. My criticism of the Government in respect of this matter goes beyond the inadequacies of the legislation before us. Not only does the legislation provide for unnecessary, undemocratic and unjustified exclusions and exemptions, and not only does it reinforce the Fraser Government's policy that ASIO and other secret organisations must be responsible to no one but their own directors-general and accountable to no one in their allocation of resources, but also the Government, in its general approach to resource allocations to the Archives, has adopted a penny pinching approach which ensures that the Archives will not and cannot function properly. </PARA>
<PARA> I am gratified that while I am making these remarks the Director-General of the Archives, Professor Neale, is with us and is listening to my remarks because for some years now I have been using the opportunity presented to me by the Senate Estimates committee meetings to pursue with Professor Neale the question of staff and funding for the Archives. Every time I have raised this question I have received a similar disappointing answer. Only last night the matter was raised again. Professor Neale again had to confirm the fact that the Archives staff allocation, the level of trained staff available to the Archives and the facilities for the Archives are totally inadequate for the task which the Government has given it. This is not just a matter of budgetary priorities or of budgetary constraints. I attribute a more sinister motive to the Government in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government knows that in order for the Archives to function properly, even after the present legislation, it will require a great deal of trained staff, a great deal of senior staff-people who are able to make the very sensitive and important decisions that need to be made about the preservation and destruction of material and so on. The Government knows that archival material will not last for ever if it is not properly housed and conserved; it will rot away. The upshot of the present situation is that an enormous amount of archival material which belongs to the Australian public and which ought to be available to scholars, members of the public, journalists and other people to peruse is rotting away. The situation in respect of much of the material is by now, I imagine, irrecoverable. With regard to other very large amounts of material, it will soon be irrecoverable if the Archives, as an institution, is not given adequate staff and resources. One of the problems is not only a general shortage of staff but also a shortage of appropriately trained staff. The Government has made very little attempt to assure appropriate training for archival staff. It has deliberately reduced the staff available to the Archives at a time when the demand on its resources is rapidly increasing. </PARA>
<PARA> I will take the liberty to repeat a point made to a Senate Estimates committee last night by Professor Neale, that whatever the Government does with the public sector, whatever cuts it makes in the activities of the public sector, however it reduces the functions of the Public Service and the numbers of public servants employed, the work of the Archives will continue to grow. The material is there and there will now be a statutory responsibility for material to be passed into the Archives. So whatever happens, if the Public Service were to be cut in half tomorrow, the work of the Archives will not be reduced in any way. The work of the Archives will grow. At a time of this rapidly increasing demand on the resources of the Archives, the Government has actually reduced the staffing level available. So we have a situation where an undefined amount of archival material is rotting away and will continue to rot away and thus be unavailable to the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make a couple of points with regard to the copyright legislation which we are debating cognately with the Archives Bill, and which is subsequent upon the Archives Bill. The Opposition does not wish to amend the Copyright Amendment Bill, which simply has the purpose of providing for the Archives to be the repository of certain material under the Archives Act. The Bill will enable broadcasting and television organisations to deposit with the Australian Archives so-called ephemeral recordings which the Director-General of the Australian Archives certifies as being of exceptional documentary character. This material may include videotape, cinematographic film or sound recording. So far, so good. But I would simply make this point. I have received a number of what seems to me to be very well founded representations expressing concern that there is in Australia no effectively functioning national film archives at this stage. The National Library performs some national film archive functions. The national Archives fulfils others. But at present a great deal of our national film history is being lost through neglect, poor storage facilities and inadequate administration. At this point in the debate I do not want to raise the issue as to whether there should be a separate national film archives, although of course many people interested in preserving Australian film are now lobbying for such an institution. I would simply urge the Government to investigate immediately the matter of ensuring the safety and permanent conservation of film, video and sound material of national historical and social interest. I do not believe that the Copyright Amendment Bill currently before us is wide-ranging enough to do that. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear from my remarks that the Opposition has a number of very serious reservations about the Bill before us, and we will wish to move amendments in the Committee stage of the debate. I should point out that my colleague, Senator Tate, who is a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, will follow me in this debate and will describe in some detail the response of the Opposition to the Government's refusal to accept most of the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs concerning the Archives Bill. At this point of the debate I wish to move an amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Bill. On behalf of the Opposition I move:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add:</PARA>
<PARA> ', but the Senate expresses its concern at the failure of the Executive to ensure that the Bill accords with all the recommendations of the reports on the Archives Bill 1978 by the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts and the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support the second reading of the Archives Bill 1981 and the Copyright Amendment Bill 1981 and to make some general remarks about the Bills before us. The Archives Bill has, in the last few years, to a certain extent been somewhat overshadowed by the debate and controversy about the Freedom of Information Bill. I will speak mainly in connection with its association with freedom of information, recognising that the major part of the consideration for it was given to the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts which has of course reported on the Archives Bill. In 1978 the Bill was also referred to my Committee, the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, for inquiry and report as soon as possible. We looked at the Bill as it related to issues common to or related to the inquiry into the Freedom of Information Bill 1978. Consequently, my remarks will relate primarily to that aspect of the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I note that the Opposition's attitude to the Bill is a critical one, and as a member of the Senate Committee which unanimously reported in connection with the Bill I, too, am critical of provisions in the Bill and regret the failure of the Government to this stage to have accepted the substantial parts of my Senate Committee's report. I do not propose to vote for the Opposition amendment. Although I think it expresses the concern which I certainly share in relation to the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, I do not think it adds very much to the situation. We will, after the second reading of this Bill, pass to the Committee stage. I hope that in the course of the consideration amendments will be moved which will substantially improve in particular the Archives Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is important to realise that the Archives Bill achieves an important purpose, that is, it sets in legislative framework the development of the National Archives. It creates a department which of course has already, in a de facto way, been operating for some time. The Bill will set out legislatively the way in which the department is to operate. I think it will provide much greater protection for the records of this community. These records need to be collected and proper provision needs to be made for their preservation. The records need to be collated properly and there needs to be provisions for proper access to them by members of the public, by historians and by the many people who are concerned not only with keeping the history of government and the history of this country, but also of expanding knowledge of it and doing research, and proceeding from research to useful publication. </PARA>
<PARA> It is worth remembering that this whole development springs largely from a report given by an overseas expert, Dr W. Kaye Lamb. His report of September 1973 was made to the Parliament of this country. It set out a framework which very basically is now followed by the legislation for the Archives organisation. It is perhaps worth repeating what was said by Dr Lamb at page 5 of his report. Under the heading 'Functions of the Archives' Dr Lamb says:</PARA>
<PARA> These may be summarised in a single sentence:</PARA>
<PARA> To watch over the care, handling and disposition of the records of the Government from the time they are created until they are destroyed or selected for permanent preservation, and to provide or arrange for access to records that can be made available to members of the public for research. </PARA>
<PARA>He proceeds therefore in that report to suggest provisions which are now to be found substantially in this legislation. The important decision that was made in the Bill, namely, to have the continued period of open access after 30 years, is one which was certainly canvassed before the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. In fact I think the time is too long. There is no fixed period of open access from one country to another. The period varies in different countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The evidence which was given to the Senate Committee did not indicate any particular desire or strong support for a reduction of that period and the Committee did not recommend a change. It is important, in the period before the expiry of that time limit, for proper arrangements to be made and that we have an adequate organisation to collect government records. I do not mean that archives should retain all the records that may be in existence, many of which probably have no historical significance and would only clutter storage facilities and cost the taxpayers a great deal. On the other hand, it is terribly important that if there is to be any erring, it should be on the side of preservation and not on the side of destruction of records. Therefore, there must be in the legislation proper arrangements to ensure that incorrect decisions are not made, decisions which in respect of records of this nature cannot be corrected because the records will be gone. We know that, in this country, all too few records have been preserved, that we have not always had a proper historic sense, that a great deal of our early records which, after all, are only about 150 years old have gone and that we have not, until recent years, developed a proper appreciation of their value. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to the actual provisions in this legislation relating to access, which provisions are in a number of respects inadequate. The examples which I will give have arisen in many ways. One finds that, so far as the records are concerned, the problems which we face in respect of the freedom of information legislation are faced also in this area. Logically, a common policy and common provisions ought to apply in one area just as in another area. In fact, the case for limiting access to older records is even weaker than is the case in respect of freedom of information to current or reasonably recent documents. The level of danger does not attach to documents which are older than 30 years if they are made available. The arguments against the release of documents in the areas of national defence, international relations and so forth, become weaker and weaker as time goes on. Yet one finds from the inquiries which I have made and from the people who have written to me that a very timid attitude still prevails in this community in respect of records. I have here a copy of a record which relates to the Coinage Act and which goes back to the year 1920. The documents are from the Prime Minister of the day and are in relation to the British Government's decision on coinage. These documents are still not available to the community. I do not say that they are necessarily of any great importance. I would not think that they are now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I will come to that. These documents are now 60 years old. As I understand it, we are still waiting on the Cabinet to release them. I think the Cabinet has been asked to release these 60 years old documents, but they have not been released to the public. I think we should be concerned not only that this legislation should not over-emphasise the restrictions but also that there should be not too timid an observance and use of the powers to retain documents in that sort of situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am informed also that parliamentary records-records which the Australian Archives has-are denied to researchers because the Archives has to have the permission of the Speaker of the House of Representatives or the President of the Senate before they are made available. These records are quite ancient and do not appear to be ones which would hurt anybody if they were made available to researchers. The Archives officers are not even able to disclose the existence of some of these records. I would like to read from a minute paper of last year from the Australian Archives which refers to an occasion on which a departmental staff member wanted to release knowledge of the existence of the records but was told that the Archives office was the unofficial custodian but the condition of transfer was that we must not reveal their existence to researchers. The person further said: 'I, as reference officer, could not inspect what is held in order to advise the researcher whether the material she requires does exist'. Without going into great detail about that, it would appear to me that it is a very extraordinary situation in this country when the existence of ancient records cannot be revealed and the people who are searching for them cannot even get to first base. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently Senator Puplick and I went to the Australian Archives to see the very interesting new building and the operations there. The Archives is in the course of moving to new premises. I think it ought to be an effective operation and I believe that in general it is. While we were there we were shown some files. One of those files related to the 1934 Victorian centenary celebrations and the relations between the Commonwealth Government and Victorian Government in connection with those celebrations-that is, 46 years ago when those celebrations took place. We saw in this file a number of documents which are bagged, I think the expression is-they are covered so that they cannot be read. That is, these documents are not to be released; they were hidden. Because Cabinet has not so far given permission to release these records, records in relation to co-operation between the Commonwealth Government and Victorian Government in regard to the Victorian centenary celebrations in 1934 are still not available to members of the public but are elaborately bagged and kept hidden. I cite these sorts of examples to illustrate that, whatever is done about this legislation, we must be sure that there is not excessive power not to disclose the existence of records. One needs to go further and say that one hopes that, in the actual operation of the provisions of this legislation, there will be a greater willingness to make available documents in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA> When the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs considered the matter it was concerned with the fact that the provisions in the legislation provided for a number of organisations and bodies to be exempt from the terms of the legislation. When the Committee considered this matter it examined, and had evidence before it about, the nature of these exemptions. The Committee in paragraph 33.24 of its report stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Very strong objection was expressed by archivists, historians and others to the exclusion of Cabinet records from the access provisions. No one, it seems, was content with the assurance that these records would probably be made available for public access in the same fashion as other records. We clearly detected a residual fear among critics that these records would in fact be exempt from public access, and in any case it was felt that these records are so central to any examination of Australian history that their availability should be assured. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee went on to refer to this view which was held by witnesses in respect of Cabinet records. I think they are very important documents on the history of this country. If after 30 years there is a retention of Cabinet records-other matters could be put in the same category-I am afraid we will find a great deal of restriction on the ability of historians to find out what has happened in this country and to record it well. As a result of this, the Committee made recommendation 33.29 of its report, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> Part V, Division 1 of the Archives Bill should be amended so that no category of records is excluded from the open access provisions of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe it is important that that recommendation should be implemented and we should be very careful to make the necessary amendments accordingly. In addition, one finds that the grounds of exemption from access in the Bill are very extensive. I fail to see the purpose of some of them as they relate to documents that are more than 30 years old. Clause 33 of the Bill contains a number of exemptions which mirror very much the exemptions proposed by the Government in the Freedom of Information Bill. For example, clause 33 refers to:</PARA>
<PARA>information or matter the disclosure of which under this Division . . . could reasonably be expected to, have a substantial adverse effect on the interests of the Commonwealth or of a Commonwealth institution in or in relation to pending or likely legal proceedings;</PARA>
<PARA>This is 30 years after the document came into existence. One fails to see the likelihood of legal proceedings breaking out after that period. The same applies to information on the conduct of an investigation of an offence. The idea that legal offences will be pursued after 30 years seems to me to be highly unlikely. Of course, the same exemptions arise in regard to matters of defence and foreign affairs. One always has the fear, and we also have it in relation to freedom of information, that these exemptions will be used to restrain public knowledge of these matters. In recommendation 96 of the Committee's report we have recommended that exemptions protecting information obtained from other governments in confidence should be deleted and those protecting Commonwealth-State relations should also be deleted, and similarly in a number of other circumstances set out in that recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that it will be important in the examination of this Bill in the Committee stage to look very carefully and strongly at the proposed exemptions and reduce them to the lowest possible minimum. Generally, as a government, we have undertaken that we will make available as much material as possible. That statement was made by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in 1976. He assured people that the desire for freedom of information generally would be met in that way, with as much information as possible being made available. I think that in this area more could be made available. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the provisions in regard to access, my Committee considered very closely the provisions in this Bill relating to the procedures that will be adopted. Without going into a great deal of detail at this stage, the Committee made a recommendation on the use of the Commonwealth Ombudsman and the increased power for the Ombudsman to facilitate access in this area. It is regrettable that the Government has not accepted that recommendation 104. The Attorney-General (Senator Durack) stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It is the view of the Government that the Ombudsman's existing powers are sufficient for him to play a substantial role in relation to matters arising under Freedom of Information and Archives legislation. Therefore no change will be made to the Ombudsman's powers other than to make it clear that the Ombudsman is not precluded from investigating a matter which is also subject to review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA>In the debate on the Freedom of Information Bill a number of amendments will be moved which I hope will bring about what the Canadians are doing in regard to their Information Commissioner and provide a facility whereby the person who can act quickly and most inexpensively-the Ombudsman in our case; the Information Commissioner in the case of Canada-will have greater power to make practical use of this legislation in both the archives area and the freedom of information area. In addition, the Committee recommended that there should be a 3-year review of this legislation, similar to the review provided in the Freedom of Information Bill. That recommendation, I regret, also has not been accepted. I think it would be unwise for us not to have regular reviews of the operation of this legislation. Likewise, the recommendation for the restriction to 60 days for reply when an application is made under this Act has not been accepted. Generally speaking, in a number of areas I think the procedures are in considerable need of tightening up if this is to be an effective Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I refer to the destruction of records. I have already said that in this area records destroyed have gone forever. It is important that we err not on the side of destruction but on the side of preservation. The Committee considered this matter very closely, and at paragraph 34.28 made this recommendation:</PARA>
<PARA> The Archives Bill should be amended to provide that the Australian Archives shall not permit or approve the destruction of a Commonwealth record until the proposal to destroy the record has first been notified to a meeting of the Advisory Council on Australian Archives. </PARA>
<PARA>The Advisory Council on Australian Archives is set up under this legislation. It is true that it is not an executive body. However, surely it is a suitable body to be notified of intentions to destroy fresh areas of documentary archival material. If it is given that opportunity and it is advised then there can be protests and complaints. I am sorry that to this stage that recommendation has not been accepted by the Government. I believe that it is important for those people, who serve on the Advisory Council and who have the special knowledge and skills, to be in a position to be advised of proposed destructions. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a Bill which will achieve a valuable aim because it is setting up the organisation of the Archives on a proper basis. However, the proper basis must be one that is not only effective but also gives the greatest possible access to material to those who are concerned with it. The legislation is not concerned with the great wide field which freedom of information covers, which has immediacy, a purpose, and a need for people in practical, operating life. I am not suggesting that historians are not practical people, but in the area of archives I think it is important, as a corollary to freedom of information, that we should make this an excellent Bill. I hope we will in the Committee stage of this Bill, increase the opportunities for Australian people to obtain and to use the records of this country. I support the motion for the second reading of the Bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with pleasure that I follow a man of the standing, knowledge and integrity of Senator Alan Missen in the debate on the second reading of the Archives Bill. His concern and efforts on behalf of the Australian community to obtain information of both current and archival interest in order to enable our community to function that much better are well known. I really follow as an apprentice to him. However, I say on behalf of the Opposition that we welcome the Bill in principle because it gives a statutory format and a legislative base to the arrangements under which our Australian community can have access to its history insofar as that history is contained and documented in the official records of the administration of the affairs of this nation. It is a matter for commendation of the Attorney-General, Senator Durack, and of the Government that at last we are out of the realm of Cabinet directives made from time to time, perhaps overlapping from time to time, under which I understand the Australian Archives has operated, and are now in the realm of a publicly available statutory framework for the operation of the Archives. In that respect, as I have said, the Bill and the efforts of the Government are certainly to be welcomed. The core of the Bill insofar as I wish to comment on it lies in paragraphs (h) and (j) of clauses 5 (2). The functions of the Australian Archives are stated to be, among other things, to encourage, facilitate, publicise and sponsor the use of archival material, and to make Commonwealth records available for public access in accordance with this legislation, and to take part in arrangements for other access to Commonwealth records. It is the ability of the Archives to achieve those objects that I wish to examine this evening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that the objectives set out there are ones which would commend themselves to everyone in this chamber. It is very important not only that there be a power within the Archives to make available such records for public access but also that the Archives have within its charter an encouragement actually to sponsor and itself encourage the use of those archival materials. In other words, it is to have something of an initiatory or encouraging role, and not merely respond to the requests made by historians and other members of the community for materials. As I have said, those functions are the basic ones upon which the structure of the Bill is of interest to me. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 32 is a very important provision. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Archives shall cause all Commonwealth records in the open access period that are in the custody of the Archives or of a Commonwealth institution, other than exempt records, to be made available for public access. </PARA>
<PARA>The importance here is that no interest or reason needs to be proffered or put forward by the person seeking access to such documents. There is to be no assessment or judgment by the Archives or any person concerning the claim by an applicant for a record for his or her perusal. In that way a very important right is established. Admittedly, the terms are not the same as those of the Freedom of Information Bill, which speaks of a legally enforceable right, but the cumulative effect of having documents in this public access period, together with certain rights of appeal, is to confer a statutory right, if not in such terms, and is certainly to be welcomed. In that respect the Government and Senator Durack are to be commended for creating this right for the first time within the Australian community. But the question, of course, is: To which documents will this right, which is absolute in its terms, apply? It will apply to those documents in the open access period. One can see from clause 3 (7) that the open access period is defined in such a way that a record falls within it if a period of 30 years has elapsed since the end of the year ending on 31 December in which the record came into existence. </PARA>
<PARA> There was some discussion before the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs as to whether a 30-year period was appropriate. It was argued by some, but surprisingly by very few and not by the historians themselves, that a shorter period might be preferable. On the whole, considering a range of matters including the need, as it was put to us, to preserve the anonymity and integrity of public servants who may have given advice which is contained in such documents-not that that argument weighed very heavily in light of the Freedom of Information principles which have been well expounded in this chamber in the recent past-and in light of a series of arguments which are available for perusal in the Senate Committee's report, the Committee accepted that that 30-year period should obtain. It did so in order that documents more than 30 years old should be available as of right to an applicant who wanted access in order to peruse and make use of them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There was some obscurity in the evidence given but I do not believe that we are in advance of those countries. The point I am making is that the Senate Committee decided not to shorten the period because it may be that as one shortens the period more and more documents will fall into sensitive categories where international relations may be adversely affected or where the commercial value of a particular record may still be current. It was hoped that by keeping the period of 30 years almost every document in the possession of the Archives would be available because the time for the sensitivity of the documentation would have passed. It was really on that basis that the 30-year period was accepted by the Senate Committee. In other words, we wanted the open access period to operate as such. Instead, we find, I regret to say, an array of exclusions and exceptions which is quite vast, perhaps not in the actual shelf kilometres of archival material that might be involved but certainly inasmuch as the exclusions and exemptions go to the very documents which are of primary interest in trying to come to grips with our history as a nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, excluded by this Bill are records of the Governor-General, the Houses of Parliament, Federal courts and Cabinet. It might be worth while pausing for a moment to see what is involved in excluding Cabinet records from the operation of the Act insofar as the Act confers a right to obtain access to these documents which, as I keep on emphasising, are by definition at least 30 years old. One finds, for example, that the definition of what comes within a Cabinet record in clause 19 embraces not only a record that has been submitted to Cabinet for its consideration or is or was proposed by a Minister to be so submitted-in other words, it does not even have to go before the Cabinet-but also an official record of the Cabinet; a copy of, or a part of, a record referred to in either of the preceding categories, or a record the disclosure of which would involve the disclosure of any deliberation or decision of the Cabinet, other than a record by which a decision of the Cabinet was officially published. </PARA>
<PARA> One can see from that range of matters that documents which are absolutely essential to the understanding of Australia's history-documents from the Cabinet itself; documents submitted to the Cabinet or even proposed to be submitted to the Cabinet-will not be available as of right in a public access way under the new Bill. This also applies, of course, to Executive Council documents. I recall one of the witnesses saying that it is as though one were trying to come to grips with the history of a company or a corporation without having access to the minutes of the meetings of the board of directors. It is true to say that under clause 21 regulations may be made by the Governor-General allowing access to the documents which I have just outlined. But, as the Senate can see, this takes the matter from the realm of right to the realm of dependence on Cabinet discretion. So access to all the documents which I have mentioned will be available only if-dependent on political criteria, no doubt-the Cabinet decides that they should be made available. It is this movement of those documents from the situation of access as of right to a discretionary dependence on the Cabinet which is of concern and which is not welcomed at all by the Opposition or, indeed, by the Senate Committee. It explains in part the moving of the amendment to the question that the Bill be now read a second time which is before the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA>Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> (Quorum formed). </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Walsh for ensuring an audience on this most gripping topic of the Archives Bill. Before the suspension of the sitting for dinner I was saying that the presentation of the Bill by the Government is to be commended in that it does provide a statutory basis, a legislative framework, for access by the Australian community to those documents which embody so much of Australia's history insofar as it is contained in documents within the possession of the Commonwealth. I also commended the Government in that the Archives Bill, for the first time, establishes the right of an applicant to such material which is at least 30 years old. In other words, no interest or special reason has to be put forward for assessment by the Archives or any other person in order to obtain a document which is in the open access period.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But the question then arises: Which documents fall within that period? I pointed out that there is a category of very important documents which are excluded from the open access period. That category includes documents of the Governor-General, of the Houses of Parliament, of the Federal courts, of the Cabinet, of the Executive Council and so on-in other words, documents which are absolutely essential and central to coming to grips with the history of this nation. I pointed out that there is some amelioration of this exclusion but only insofar as a discretion is exercisable by the Government to permit access to such excluded or otherwise excluded records and documents. So what one has in relation to these documents which are at the heart of the public administration of this country is a discretionary power on behalf of the Government-in other words, exercisable by reference to criteria which can only be guessed at-rather than the exercise by an applicant within the Australian community to have the record or document for perusal as of right. While dealing with this Division of the Bill I record a pleasing feature of it, namely, that in relation to documents and records of royal commissions, such documents are to be made available despite a direction by the royal commissioner that public access was not to be given. In that respect one can only say that the Bill is to be commended. </PARA>
<PARA> We move from the exclusions contained in the Bill to what are known as the exemptions. The right extends only to those documents in the open access period which are not exempt from the operation of the Bill. There may be a case for some exemptions so long as these are closely defined and subject to safeguards regarding the exercise of the power to declare or identify a record as exempt. But in the Bill we find some 11 categories of such exemptions contained, for the interest of honourable senators, in clause 33. I have to say, in a preliminary way, that most of these categories were found by the Senate Committee which examined some nine categories as they then were presented in the original Bill, to be unnecessary or at least insufficiently argued for. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say, if one is to have exemptions closely defined one also has to have a means of checking on the exercise of that power of declaring, recognising or identifying a document to be exempt. There is a very great difference between identifying a document as falling within one of the exempt categories-in other words, bringing the declared statutory criteria to bear in relation to the document concerned-and identifying the two in a way which is then subject to appeal, in a way which then requires a judgment by the Archives that the category is appropriate to be checked, either by way of internal review as we shall see or by way of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. That, of course, is the preferred way of the Senate Committee. But what one has within the scheme of the Bill is a system whereby in relation to three of the categories there can be a simple declaration that documents fall within three categories. In other words, there is a simple declaration by the Minister or an authorised officer that a document falls within categories outlined in clause 33 (1) (a), (b) or (c). These relate to documents or records containing information or matter the disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to cause damage to the security, defence or international relations of the Commonwealth; information or matter communicated in confidence between internal Australian governments to the Commonwealth, of information or matter the disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to cause damage to relations between the Commonwealth and some other government and any State or the Northern Territory. In these three instances conclusive certificates can be issued by the Minister. Here one has a repetition of the defect which has been commented upon in relation to the Freedom of Information Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I reiterate and re-emphasise that we are dealing with documents which are at least 30 years old. We are not dealing with documents currently created. Nevertheless, in relation to them, why not take the matter to an independent tribunal, composed of people of integrity, which could verify that indeed the document contained information or matter which could reasonably be expected to cause damage to the security, defence or international relations of the Commonwealth? If a document were so verified no one in this chamber would assert that the document should nevertheless be made available except perhaps under very special and stringent conditions. Why not have such a system-this is the argument of the Senate committee-rather than the conclusive certificates which, as I say, may be issued by the Minister. In other words, what we have here is a situation whereby, in relation to the first three sub-clauses of clause 33 (1), the Government may determine on criteria which are perhaps never really revealed, certainly in a way which is controllable in the sense that they cannot be reviewed, to withhold these documents sought by an applicant though they be 30 years or more in age. </PARA>
<PARA> It is rather strange that in relation to these three categories first-mentioned in clause 33 (1) a parallel power resides in the Archives to make its own judgment that documents fall within those categories. Of course, such assessment can be appealed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal; so it is not really the nature of the document or the category which are so important that the Minister himself, or his authorised officer, need issue conclusive certificates. The suspicion must linger in instances in which the Minister is notconvinced that an independent tribunal would reach the same conclusion as the Archives in determining that the documents contained information or matter of the type described. For example if he were persuaded that the Archives had made a proper determination and that the category was indeed applicable, on appeal the exempt status of the document would survive and it would not be available to the applicant in a way which may reasonably be expected to cause damage to the interests set out in clause 33 (1) (a). So the ministerial power to issue conclusive certificates exists concurrently with the ordinary power of the Archives, but the decisions taken in ministerial conclusive certificates are non-appealable. The Senate Committee found, particularly in relation to documents more than 30 years old, that that system of conclusive certificates could not be justified. It is to be said in favour of the wording of clause 33 (1) (a) that there is a harmonising of the language to bring it closer to that of the Protective Security Handbook than was the wording of the original Bill. That change is to be welcomed. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to five of the categories, namely, those referred to in clause 33 (1) (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f), at the Committee stage the Opposition will go into greater detail. It is enough to say that all five categories were considered by the Senate Committee. In respect of none of them was there enough substance or conviction in the arguments put forward by the Minister initially, or by witnesses, to enable the Committee to agree to their presence in the Bill. So, the Senate Committee recommended against five of the 11 categories being included in the Bill. Honourable senators would find that noteworthy. Taken with the other matters I have mentioned, this should enable honourable senators to support the amendment to the second reading motion. The position amounts to the Government's persisting in its determination that these categories should stand, even though the Committee, which took exhaustive evidence, could find no good reason for their being continued. </PARA>
<PARA> We then have a series of redrafted categories which deal with the protection of law enforcement procedures. Once again, I would imagine that no one in this chamber would object greatly to measures being taken to ensure that no information or matter which could reasonably be expected to prejudice the enforcement or proper administration of the law in a particular instance became available under the provisions of the Archives Bill. But although there can be agreement in principle in relation to that matter, there can be some dispute as to the wording that might be used in regard to these categories. No doubt that will be spelt out at the Committee stage. It is enough to say that in this new Bill some new categories have been introduced. For example, a document will be exempt from the operation of the Bill when it contains information or matter which could reasonably be expected to prejudice the conduct of an investigation of an offence, or possible offence, against the law or a failure, or possible failure, to comply with the law relating to taxation. That is a completely new provision when compared with the previous Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that another new provision is to be found in clause 33 (1) (h) (i) which exempts a record if it contains information or matter, the disclosure of which could reasonably be expected to prejudice the carrying on generally of investigations concerning breaches or evasions of the law. It will be necessary at the Committee stage to look closely at the new extensions of those categories which are concerned to protect procedures dealing with the investigation of suspected breaches of the law and the enforcement of the law. As to the category dealing with the unreasonable disclosure of information relating to the personal affairs of any person, including a deceased person, of course, the Senate Committee agrees with it. There is no question that such a privacy provision ought to be included and is welcome. </PARA>
<PARA> The final categories of exemptions deal with records, the disclosure of which would allegedly harm a commercial enterprise or undertaking, or a person in his or her conduct of lawful business activity. What was a single category in the previous Bill has been divided into two categories. Once again, at the committee stage the wording will need to be the subject of close scrutiny. </PARA>
<PARA> Another new category is found in clause 33 (2), which provides that a Commonwealth record is an exempt record if it is of such a nature that it would be privileged from production in legal proceedings on the ground of legal professional privilege. I believe that that accords with the Senate Committee's recommendation, although it was meant to supersede other categories and not be additional to them. That, too, will warrant examination at the Committee stage. </PARA>
<PARA> I have dealt rather exhaustively with the categories of exemptions in order to alert the Senate to the fact that, depending upon the number of records which might fall within these categories of exemption, we may very well have a major portion of Australia's history not made available to historians and others who have an interest in putting before the community a considered examination of our history insofar as it is contained in documents within the possession of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> Some 12 categories, including the new category concerning legal professional privilege, are contained in the new Bill, compared with nine in the old Bill. Some five of the 12 were categories that the Committee recommended not be included in the Bill at all. However, whether conclusively determined by the Minister, or merely determined in an ordinary way by the Archives, such decisions being upheld on appeal, quite a range of documents will be exempt from the operation of the Act. Thus, although more than 30 years old, they will not be available. There is, nevertheless, on top of all this, an ability within the Government to make available documents which are exempt. I refer to the special access provisions. In other words, there can be not only accelerated access, whereby an applicant may obtain access to archival documents even though 30 years have not elapsed, but also a special access provision exists in clause 46, whereby the Minister may exercise a discretion to give a particular person access to documents which are otherwise exempt or which at least do not fall within the open access or public access description. At the end of the day, then, yet another discretion is held by the Government whereby the 11 categories can be ignored and the document made available. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee heard evidence which suggested that the community of historians in particular would feel happier if special access were not related to a particular person making an application for such special access. In other words, once the decision is made that special access can be given, there ought to be an immediate attempt on the part of Archives to make such documents available to a wider range of persons than the immediate applicant. There is a residual concern-I would not say anything as strong as 'mistrust'-that one historian, one applicant or one institute, perhaps a university, may be favoured over another in relation to this special access provision. In that respect there is much evidence-I think it is a recommendation of the Senate Committee-that where a special access case is made out the document ought to be made available to a wider range of persons than the immediate applicant. That is contained in chapter 34, paragraphs 6 to 11, of the Senate Committee's report. In particular, evidence was given by Dr Radi, who thought it was discriminatory to grant access to some and not to others. In her opinion, emphasis should be placed upon granting special access to particular documents, not conferring the right upon specific applicants. That led to the recommendation of the Senate Committee that I have outlined. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the review and appeal procedures which are contained in clause 40 and subsequent clauses. These have been redrafted in large measure in a way which is to be commended and which harmonises with the Senate Committee's recommendation. For example, where the Archives notifies an applicant that the application has been unsuccessful, the Archives has to make the applicant aware of the internal review provisions which are available to such a disappointed applicant. In particular, there has to be an indication to the applicant of the rights of further internal review and appeal available to him. Further, and in accordance with the spirit of the Senate Committee's report, the Archives has to respond to that initial application within 90 days. That is the maximum limit set by the Bill for a response to an application for access to a document. That period of 90 days can be shortened by way of regulation, and it will be recalled that the Senate Committee thought that the Archives could make an adequate examination of the case of the applicant within 60 days. I take this further provision for a regulation enabling a shortening of the maximum period to be an indication of good faith on the part of the Archives that, once its work routines are established in relation to perhaps a new work load under the statutory structure here being created, regulations will progressively shorten the maximum period within which a response to the application must be made by the Archives. That is to be commended. </PARA>
<PARA> Under clause 41 there is an opportunity for a disappointed applicant to seek an internal review of the decision of the Archives. Once again, that is well set out. The provision is not as vague as it appears to be when it says that the Archives has to make the internal review as expeditiously as possible, because under later provisions of the Bill it has to act under constraints which mean it really has to make this review within 14 days of the request for an internal review. If the internal review is still of the same disappointing character to the applicant, namely, that the document is excluded from the purview of the Bill or is an exempt document, the Archives has to state the findings of fact and the reasons for coming to the decision it has come to. On that basis, an appeal may be made to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 43 (2) is the key to the Tribunal's powers. That clause makes it clear, as it ought to, that the onus is on the Archives to establish that the document contain information or matter which brings it within the categories of exempt documents. It is for the Archives to discharge the onus of showing why the decision should be adverse to the applicant. The Tribunal makes a decision completely freshly; it is not bound by any prior determination by the Archives. The Senate Committee found that the Bill had been drawn in a way which made it unclear whether the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, having found that a document was properly categorised as exempt, could nevertheless exercise some sort of discretion and make it available to the applicant. That is not to be the case. The Committee thought it ought not to be the case. Clause 43 (4), a new clause, makes it clear that the Tribunal does not have the power to decide that access be given to a record otherwise determined to be properly categorised as exempt. Nevertheless, even if that discretion is not exercisable by the Tribunal, it is exercisable by the Minister under the special access provisions. The Senate should welcome to some extent new clause 45, which makes it clear, insofar as it was necessary, that the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman to pursue a grievance raised by an applicant is in no way affected or diminished, much less taken away, by the various procedures here legislatively provided for. Some extended activity on behalf of the Ombudsman might be in order, as outlined by Senator Missen in his remarks before dinner.</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, may I comment on the role of the Advisory Council. This was lightly touched on by Senator Missen. The functions of the Advisory Council are set out briefly in clause 11. In that clause it is made clear that the Council is envisaged as having a merely advisory role. There will be times when it can take the initiative or can respond to a request by the Minister or the Director-General to give advice, but it is perceived, as I see it, as an advisory body. Indeed, 'advisory' is part of its title. I express my disappointment, which I am sure is shared by other members of the Senate Committee, that the Government has not taken up the Senate Committee's recommendation that this Council, composed of a member of this chamber, a member of the House of Representatives, and 11 other distinguished members of the community, should have an extended, supervisory and monitoring role. </PARA>
<PARA> Many functions could very properly be given to such a council. For example, under clause 37 the Director-General may withhold a record otherwise within the open access period because he has judged that to make it available would make its care or its preservation impossible. I think Professor Neale, in evidence, gave an example of some immigration records which, when opened, could fall apart and disintegrate. He did not have the photographic equipment to take photographs of the curved surface of such volumes. In these cases the Senate Committee recommended that a list of the documents, otherwise available in the open access period but for the judgment by the Director-General that they could not be made available for reasons of their care and preservation, should be tabled before the Advisory Council in order for it to monitor and to be aware of this very exceptional and unfortunate circumstance. </PARA>
<PARA> Again, the arrangements for determining which documents should be in the open access period-arrangements are to be made between the Director-General and the Minister responsible as to how this determination is to take place-should be in writing and should be tabled before the Council so that as little as possible is not in the public arena as to these arrangements which are of such importance to historians and to others. Likewise, the arrangements for accelerated and special access which are entered into under clause 46 should be in writing and tabled before the Council. </PARA>
<PARA> The Director-General, in evidence before the Committee, promised, I think, to make available guidelines under which the Archives operates or hopes to operate in relation to special access and which he thought might form the basis of the regulations which are proposed. Those guidelines never materialised before the Committee. It is that type of guideline which the Committee believes ought to be made known and available to the Advisory Council. Of course, there should be laid regularly before the Council a list of the nature and numbers of documents declared or determined to be exempt. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, we thought, as Senator Missen outlined, that there could be a consultative role and not merely an informed after the event role in relation to the destruction of documents. The destruction of records and documents is so central by way of antithesis to the function of an archival institution that it was thought that lists of documents proposed to be destroyed could well be laid before the Advisory Council to enable it to have some sort of consultative role in the all-important decision to remove such records for ever from the perusal of those who might be interested in our history at some future date. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the Opposition welcomes the Bill, providing as it does a statutory basis for the operation of the Australian Archives. I have expressed concern that in very many important respects the Bill is defective in the same way and along the same lines as so many of the provisions and omissions of the Freedom of Information Bill which have been brought to the attention of this chamber. Some further ones peculiar to Archives have been noted by me and, prior to me, by Senator Ryan. Therefore, it is only natural that I should support and call upon other senators to support the amendment moved by the Opposition to the motion that the Bill be now read a second time so that at the end of that motion this chamber can add:</PARA>
<PARA>, but the Senate expresses its concern at the failure of the Executive to ensure that the Bill accords with all the recommendations of the reports on the Archives Bill 1978 by the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts and the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>Those committees gave a great service to this chamber during, I believe, the most exhaustive taking of evidence on Bills of this nature in the history of this Parliament and probably that of many parliaments around the world. It is a matter for concern and regret that so many defects and omissions still remain in respect of a Bill whose introduction in principle by Senator Durack is to be commended. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Archives Bill. The administration of archives in Australia has been a development of increasing importance, particularly since World War II. For 30 years the Australian Archives, which used to be known as the Commonwealth Archives Office, has operated in a general pattern in relation to arrangements for records dealing with government business as well as with preserving government records of historical or national value and of significance. Provision is also made for scholars and the public under approved circumstances to engage in research and for the obtaining of information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Archives Bill now before the Senate seeks to preserve the Archives with a statutory basis for its operations. It places the Archives within a department and under a ministerial administration and confers on an officer-in this case a Director-General-certain powers and functions which relate to his statutory authority. As honourable senators understand and appreciate, archives and the disciplines connected with archives are part of an ancient process. When the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts was conducting its inquiry into those sections of the Archives Bill which were referred to it, I, as Chairman of that Committee, opened the hearing with a statement, during which I made this observation:</PARA>
<PARA> Archives and archival institutions have existed for a long time and probably have their origins in the ancient Greek civilisation. In the fifth and fourth centuries B.C. the Athenians kept their valuable records in the Temple of the Mother of the Gods in the public square of Athens. These records included treaties, laws and accounts of their assembly. The Middle Ages saw a new influence on the character of archival establishments--</PARA>
<PARA>I then made this point-</PARA>
<PARA>but we are concerned with the development of modern institutions. In France, the United Kingdom and the United States inquiry and legislative action has led to the setting up of archival establishments. </PARA>
<PARA>I went on to quote an historian, Professor Charles Andrews, who, in his statement some 40 years ago, said:</PARA>
<PARA> No people can be deemed masters of their own history until their public records gathered, cared for and rendered accessible to the investigator have been systematically studied and the importance of their contents determined. </PARA>
<PARA>Professor Andrews went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> Among public records and monuments of the past and holding first place in value and importance are public archives. </PARA>
<PARA>At the conclusion of my speech on that occasion I said:</PARA>
<PARA> Archives therefore become the basis for information and communication services and the importance of an efficient archives infrastructure is emphasised. </PARA>
<PARA>Here in Australia several institutions engage in maintaining records and material which are of interest and significance to the Australian community. They include the Australian National Gallery, the Australian War Memorial, the National Museum and the National Library of Australia. The Australian Archives comes into this picture now with its new-found statutory status which will enable it to preserve for this country those records and that material which are of significance and of value to the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the Bill which is before us now I refer to June 1978 when the first Bill in relation to archives was introduced. In the course of a composite speech relating to a number of matters the relevant Minister, referring particularly to the Archives Bill 1978, said that the Bill provided the machinery which would improve the management of the Commonwealth's own records. He pointed out that the proposed legislation replaced existing ad hoc arrangements as well as certain conventions but more importantly it established, he said, firm procedures governing the custody, destruction, retention, storage, conservation and, I think he said this with some emphasis, public accessibility to the vast mass of record material. In the discussion at that time it was recognised that a need for reform was long overdue. Examination of the problems had been undertaken over the years and, as the Minister said at the time, had resulted in a Bill which he thought would commend itself not only to the Parliament but also to the Australian community. In undertaking a process of reform in this regard the Government was concerned in the first instance with the need for efficient administration and availability of the nation's records, documentation and material which might fall, one way or another, within the description of archives. </PARA>
<PARA> With the passage of time a greater accumulation of information material had been built up. It had also opened up a wealth of research material of vital interest in almost every profession and discipline that was of some significance to the development of the recorded history of Australia. The Government was concerned that consistent with the claims of national security on the one hand and individual privacy on the other this great national resource of records and of material should be put, to quote the Minister, at the disposal of the public through a network of archival facilities and reference services. Accordingly, the legislation provided for a comprehensive provision for the administration of the records of departments and other agencies in this country. It required, for example, that records be transferred to archival repositories as quickly as possible and furthermore that retrieval services should be provided. </PARA>
<PARA> Speaking at the time the Minister said that the provisions of the Bill would be to provide that the function of the Australian Archives should be the custody and management of all Commonwealth records which were not required to be readily available for the ongoing needs of government administration. He defined a Commonwealth record as any record which is the property of the Commonwealth and went on to say that the term did not extend to material in a collection maintained by the Australian War Memorial, the National Library of Australia or the Australian National Gallery. He said that together all of these materials would constitute the archival resources of the Commonwealth and it would be the special responsibility and function of the Archives to care for and maintain those resources. He said that the Archives would also have the function, where appropriate, of encouraging and fostering the preservation and collection of all other archival resources which related to Australian development, property, interests and matters of cultural value. The most significant single function of the Australian Archives, as the Minister said at the time, will be the care and management of Commonwealth records no longer required for Commonwealth use. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me explain how my involvement in this matter came about. In September 1978 the Senate sent to the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts certain parts of the Archives Bill which were more particularly related to its work. A great quantity of the Archives Bill was referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. When the report was put to the Senate the Government took note of it and the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) made his response in due course to the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee. The Government accepted, I think, 3 1/2 of the five recommendations which we put down. Three and a half is probably more a phrase of use than it is of accurate description. The Government accepted a number of the recommendations but declined to go on with some others. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government accepted our first two recommendations which were quite straightforward and on which we had strong views. They related to the administration of archives, the role of the Director-General and the relationship of the Australian Archives to the efficient working of the Advisory Council. The Committee's fourth recommendation was that clause 28 (2) (a) of the Bill be deleted, but the Government decided that it would not accept that recommendation. During our inquiry we found that some critics of the Bill said that certain elements of clause 28 provided too much latitude for institutions to frustrate the working of the Archives. The effect of clause 28 in our view was that certain records could be exempted from the provisions of the paragraph attached to it. We found that the responsible Minister could determine that a record would not be required and could be transferred to the Archives. In paragraph 5.24 of our report we said:</PARA>
<PARA> We believe that the powers conferred on the responsible minister under paragraph 28 (2) (a) of the Bill are unnecessary and tend to frustrate the basic purpose of the legislation. The sole purpose of setting up the Archives is for the impartial management, safe custody and preservation of the archival resources of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise this aspect because earlier in my remarks I drew extracts from speeches and references made on behalf of the Government which supported my argument that the Archives should be available for use, for research, for study and for the whole benefit of the Australian community. It seemed to us then, as it does to me now, that this general theme was cut across by the decision of the Government and that our recommendation was designed with a view to establishing and promoting this theme. I note with regret that the Government has not accepted that particular recommendation. We made our views very clear in recommendation No. 3-we did this in concert with recommendation No. 95 of the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs-which dealt with the matter of the provisions of the Bill relating to the papers for example, of the Governor-General, the Parliament, the courts, the Cabinet and the Executive Council. In response, as I recall it, the Government undertook to make regulations which, it was felt, would meet our situation insofar as Cabinet and Executive Council records were concerned. I refer now to some paragraphs within our report which concern this particular aspect of the Bill. Paragraph 5.11 of the Senate Standing Committee's report stated:</PARA>
<PARA> However, in the case of Cabinet and Executive Council records no official explanation has been given for their exclusion from the provisions of Division 2. </PARA>
<PARA>We went on to assert that the reasons for their exclusion have been largely left to speculation. Some critics seemed to assume that these records had been included on the grounds of preserving what was described to us as the collective responsibility of Cabinet, as the need to retain the principle that the records of one government should not be made available to its successor, particularly if it were of a different political persuasion, in accordance with the Westminster convention and as not disclosing the deliberations and decisions of Cabinet other than by an official publication. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee in its report said that it may very well be argued that these records were being withheld from the custody of the Archives on the grounds that such records tend to be too sensitive and to be subject to procedures of custody, management and access as provided in the Bill. The Committee in paragraph 5.14 of its report went on to counter the argument in these words:</PARA>
<PARA> This argument could be countered on the grounds that it is hard to imagine that any records covered by clauses 19 and 20 would be any more sensitive than those referred to in clause 31, . . . which are considered to be adequately protected by the safeguard measures built into the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>In paragraph 5.15 we said this:</PARA>
<PARA> It seems difficult to escape the conclusion that Cabinet and Executive Council records are, after all, records of the executive arm of government, very much akin to records of Commonwealth departments and therefore should be treated like any other Commonwealth records under the provisions of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA>In paragraph 5.16 we conclude:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that while the exclusion of vice-regal, parliamentary and court records is acceptable on the grounds of preserving the traditional independence of these arms of government from the executive, we could find no good reason why this same exemption should apply to the records of the Cabinet and Executive Council. </PARA>
<PARA>We went on to recommend that the Bill be amended so as to remove those exemption provisions. I take the opportunity of making those observations insofar as these recommendations were put down as a result of material which had been presented to us and which we of the Senate Committee felt it was important to state to the Senate. In recent times, since our report has been put down, there have been some observations on that section of our report which dealt with the matter of film archives and the role of the National Library as far as film archives are concerned. As honourable senators very well know, I have more than a passing interest in the work of the National Library. I have a very great deal of pride in its film collection and the vast quantity of material which it has in its film collection. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Library has organised a large and very valuable collection of Australian and overseas film, and it goes along with some other institutions in this community which have large film archives, one of which of course is the Australian War Memorial. Furthermore, I think it is important to point out that the Australian Archives has been taking films into its custody in repositories throughout this country for very many years now. Each State government, for example, maintains a film collection which is of some considerable archival significance, and the holdings of these many institutions between them make up the film heritage of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I make the point that there is nothing in the Bill, as I see it, to suggest that this well established position will be altered. The Bill does not prevent other institutions such as the National Library from continuing to acquire, hold and maintain valuable film collections. The Bill has no provisions for the compulsory deposit of such material in the Archives and the collections of the National Library are in any case specifically exempt. A reference to clause 3 of the Bill will point this fact up. </PARA>
<PARA> Australian Archives serves as the archives repository for film records of the Administration just as it is the repository, as I have said earlier tonight, for other kinds of government records. The Archives does not accept deposits of film from non-government sources, and what is more, it directs offers of deposit from such sources to appropriate authorities such as the National Library and the State film libraries. The Archives takes custody of films as part of its normal repository services provided for Commonwealth records. In doing this, of course, it is consistent with the practices adopted in other countries. The national archives of the United States, Canada and West Germany all have this function, and it has been carried out in Australia by the Australian Archives for many years. </PARA>
<PARA> It is very interesting to point out that the National Library collects published material which is defined in the Copyright Amendment Bill as material offered for sale or hire to the public and beyond this acquires copies of unpublished printed matter, films and sound recording. The role of the Archives as outlined in this Bill is rather different. Archives, unlike a library collection, is the result of the administrative process whereby certain materials accumulate in the course of public business and they are kept to serve either the purpose of the administration which produced them or the public interest in the material insofar as it is valuable from an historic point of view, or interesting, or indeed falls into both categories. In this context it is the duty of the Australian Archives to provide archival services for Commonwealth agencies in a whole range of recorded materials, some of which I have referred to tonight, and of course including the matter of films.</PARA>
<PARA> The matter of the Archives Bill is of some significance and the details relating to its implementation are of course of particular importance. I think it is significant that matters related to the Archives Bill have been referred to two important Senate committees, and they have produced a number of recommendations. The inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, of course, was a much wider, greater and detailed inquiry than the inquiry carried out by the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts. Nevertheless, together they have provided a very valuable gathering of opinion and of response from the Australian community and they have made recommendations to the Senate. It is to be regretted that not all of the recommendations have been accepted by the Government because they have been put forward by honourable senators in this place, sitting in Committee and reflecting what the community has told them in response to the invitation so to do. </PARA>
<PARA> I am reminded of the quotation of Professor Charles Andrews that I gave right at the beginning of my speech. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> No people can be deemed masters of their history until their public records gathered, cared for and rendered accessible to the investigator . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Among public records and monuments of the past and holding first place in value and importance are public archives. </PARA>
<PARA>It is the area of public archives with which we are concerned tonight. I give my support to the second reading of the Bill. </PARA>

It is pleasing that that will be taking place when this measure, it is hoped, becomes law in the not too distant future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition has moved an amendment to the motion that the Bill be read a second time in terms that the Senate should express its concern at the failure of the Executive to ensure that the Bill accords with all the recommendations on the Bill that were made by the two Senate committees that have examined it. Honourable senators who have spoken on it, I think, have all been members of those committees. The last speaker, Senator Davidson, was certainly speaking on behalf of the Senate Standing Committee on Education and the Arts. I thought that 3 1/2 out of five was not a bad sort of result to receive from that Committee. Perhaps it is better than the result obtained from the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> The real point is that the matters that have been raised are matters for consideration at the Committee stage rather than during the debate at the second reading stage. The Government has given close consideration to the reports of both committees, as was demonstrated in the response made by me on behalf of the Government in September last year. The terms and tone of the amendment that has been moved by Senator Ryan seem to assume that because a Senate committee recommends a particular change to a Bill, that recommendation must be accepted by all concerned-the Government as well as the rest of the Senate.

I hope that the Senate will reject the amendment because it is expressing a completely false conception of Senate committees and their role. Senate committees perform a most useful purpose. They examine these matters; they put forward their views and it is then for those views to be examined in the Committee of the Whole. There is no reason why the Senate should rubber stamp the views of Senate committees any more than it rubber stamps views put forward by the Government. That is why this amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Bill should be rejected by the Senate. I hope that it will do so and that the Senate will then move into the Committee of the Whole to examine the proposed amendments on their merits.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did not say I did not believe in them. I said there is no reason why recommendations of committees should be rubber stamped. Standing Order 68 provides that no new business shall be commenced after 10.30 p.m. This Standing Order has become somewhat obsolete because the Senate now invariably adopts sessional orders which provide that the question for the adjournment of the Senate is put from the Chair at 11 p.m. on broadcast days and 10.30 p.m. on other days. It has been practice to regard the Standing Order as having effect at 11 p.m. on broadcast days. The Standing Orders Committee has recommended that the Standing Order be revised so as to refer to the time at which the adjournment of the Senate is first proposed on any sitting day. The effect of this will be that once the question for the adjournment has been put from the Chair, if that question is negatived and the Senate continues to sit no new business can be introduced after that time unless Standing Order 68 has previously been suspended. The Standing Order will thereby, as the Standing Orders Committee indicates, still provide a safeguard against the introduction of new business when senators may not be expecting new business to be commenced.It is important to remember that apart from the sessional order the only way in which the question for the adjournment of the Senate can be proposed from the Chair is after a motion by or on behalf of a Minister has been moved.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I feel that I must oppose the amendment. How tyrannical can we get? When someone commits an indiscretion and says something which justifies his being named, we suspend him. At present, the Standing Order states in relation to suspension:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . on the first occasion shall be for the remainder of that day's sitting; on the second occasion for one week; and on the third or any subsequent occasion for fourteen days, such suspension occurring within the same session.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not think what is meant by a session of the Parliament has ever been clearly defined. The explanation seems to be that a session is the period from the inauguration of a parliament until its suspension; it is suggested that sessions may be for three years. I do not think a suspension has ever been interpreted as covering a three-year period. It has been thought that it is meant to end after a period or after a session has ended. However, this amendment reads:</PARA>
<PARA> If any Senator be suspended, his suspension on the first occasion shall be for the remainder of that day's sitting; on the second occasion for seven consecutive days; and on the third or any subsequent occasion for fourteen consecutive days, such suspensions occurring within the same calendar year. </PARA>
<PARA>If someone commits an indiscretion and warrants naming and suspension, I am not sure of the advisability of depriving the Senate of the suspended senator's capabilities for a period of fourteen consecutive days because for the third time he has found himself in breach of Standing Orders when perhaps there is no justification for such a long sentence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to understand the point you are making about the consecutive days. Are the words '14 consecutive days' different from the existing Standing Order, in your view? Does the word 'consecutive' make a difference?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="757">Senator CAVANAGH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I think it may make a difference. As Senator Button is trained in the art of interpretation, I thought he could tell me what it meant rather than my telling him. I note the difference. On the second occasion a member is suspended for one week. I do not know what that implies when one considers that the Senate sits for three days in one week. If a senator is suspended on the last sitting day of the week I do not know whether the one week's suspension would carry over into the next week. It has not been applied in the Senate in that way. The words 'consecutive days' seem to control the member even when Parliament is not sitting. If a senator is to be suspended for a number of consecutive days, it seems meaningless if Parliament is not sitting. The point I want to make is that the suspension penalty should be based upon the gravity of the accusation or the offence of the member rather than being made mandatory for the occasion especially if there is not going to be a repetition. If someone repetitively offends against the Parliament, obviously we do not have much protection on 14 consecutive days.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There should be varying degrees of suspension. I do not think that on any occasion we should set a suspension period of 14 consecutive days if someone is concerned sufficiently to offend against the Chair. We are not the sole judges of the conduct of members. Surely the electors are the judges. It does not seem right that the electors of a State of the Commonwealth should be deprived of a representative for 14 days because of his behaviour, although we may think there is some justification for his suspension. Therefore, I oppose the amendment. I do not understand what the present rule is, as Senator Button has pointed out. The present rule states that, on the second occasion, a senator shall be suspended for one week. It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . and on the third or any subsequent occasion for fourteen days, such suspension occurring within the same session. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know what the definition of a session is, but the Committee has accepted a session as being from the commencement of a parliament until the finalisation of a Parliament. Perhaps the Attorney-General (Senator Durack), who is in charge of the matter, could give me some information on what is meant by the word 'session' under the present Standing Orders and what is the difference between the proposed amendment and the present Standing Order. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have now had time to consider this matter. Currently, on the first occasion the suspension is for the remainder of the day's sitting. That is clear enough. The recommended Standing Order provides for the same provision. On the second occasion the suspension is for one week. I take it from your reply to Senator Chipp, Mr Temporary Chairman, that one week could mean one minute. I thought you told Senator Chipp that if his second suspension occcurred tonight it would be until the end of this week but that if it occurred on the last day of a session it would be until the end of that day. A week, then, is a sitting week. A sitting week terminates on the Thursday evening when the Senate rises. The proposal is that on the second occasion the suspension should be for seven consecutive days. If a second suspension occurred on a Thursday, a suspension of seven consecutive days could carry through into the following week and the suspension would operate during that time. I am concerned about that part of the Standing Order which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . or any subsequent occasion for 14 days, such suspension occurring within the same session. </PARA>
<PARA>My main concern is: What is a session? The report of the Standing Orders Committee states:</PARA>
<PARA> This Standing Orders has remained unchanged since the time when sessions of the Parliament seldom lasted more than a year. </PARA>
<PARA>Obviously, at one time sessions lasted a year. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Now that sessions are apt to extend for up to three years . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, I take it that a session is the period of a Parliament. Under the proposed new Standing Order, on the third or any subsequent occasion the suspension is for 14 days. If after committing three offences a senator breaches the rules of conduct and commits an indiscretion at any time in the three years, if I am making a correct interpretation, he will be out for 14 days. We are now altering that provision to apply to suspensions occurring within the same calendar year. If in the autumn session I commit an offence against the Chair and am named and suspended on two occasions and in the Budget session in August I commit another indiscretion which justifies suspension, I will be out for 14 days under this interpretation of the period. The offences would occur in the same calendar year. The explanation in the report states that the present rule seems harsh. I have never known the present Standing Order to be interpreted to mean that the session was the life of the Parliament, but it seems that the Standing Orders Committee was of the opinion that the session was the life of the Parliament. I take it that the autumn and spring sessions of this Parliament are the periods to which the Standing Order applies. I would seek some enlightenment on that matter. If an offender's first and second suspension occurred in the autumn session and his third suspension occurred in the spring session, would he be suspended for 14 days during the spring session?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I will endeavour to enlighten Senator Cavanagh. As I understand the situation, in the olden days Parliament was prorogued every 12 months and there was subsequently a re-opening of Parliament. Consequently, these rules applied for the 12-month period. But in recent times, of course, a session of Parliament has lasted a full three years. The object of this exercise is to return to the old situation in which the Standing Order applied to a 12-month period.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Temporary Chairman, might I add something to what has been said by Senator Maunsell? As a member of the Senate Standing Orders Committee and following what was said in response to the remarks of Senator Cavanagh I point to the statement on page 619 of the fifth edition of Odgers's Australian Senate Practice, which statement was drawn to the attention of the Standing Orders Committee when the Committee was considering this matter. It states that a session of parliament begins with an official opening by the Governor-General and ends either by prorogation or by dissolution of the House of Representatives. So in fact the whole life of the Parliament is the session of the Parliament. The periods about which Senator Cavanagh has spoken-the autumn session and the Budget session-are really sessional periods but the session is deemed to be, as I understand it, the whole period of the Parliament. Under the existing Standing Order, a person could be suspended on the first occasion for the remainder of that day's sitting, on the second occasion for one week and on the third or any subsequent occasion for 14 days, over a period of three years. Certainly, I think one of our colleagues has been suspended for at least one week in the time that I have been here. It was felt that that action was a bit hard on the State that he represented and that the period should be brought back to a calendar year. The purpose of writing in the words 'consecutive days' is to differentiate between non-sitting days and sitting days. For instance, if a person were to be suspended today for seven consecutive days, today being the first day of his suspension, he would be entitled to take his place again in the chamber next Tuesday.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the matter raised by Senator Cavanagh querying what constitutes a session has opened up a Pandora's box. I am thinking now of the employment of Senate attendants who are employed as sessional attendants. An interpretation was given by Senator Maunsell that in the old days a session was for 12 months but that in recent times it has been for three years. Perhaps the Senate attendants who have been employed as sessionals will have a case against the Parliament for payment for the whole of the three years, even though they have not worked for the whole of that time. That is something which might be taken up unless we clarify the word 'sessions'. Perhaps to get over that problem we ought to call sessions the autumn period and the Budget period rather than the autumn session and the Budget session if we are to use double standards so far as sessions go. I do not want to build up the hopes of some of the Senate attendants who have been paid as sessionals just for the autumn period and the Budget period and have them think that they might have some claim for retrospective payment for the whole of the time which is termed to be a session, that is, from the opening of Parliament until the prorogation of Parliament. That is something that needs to be looked at.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But I am quite happy with and support the re- commendation of the Committee because on most occasions when a senator is suspended his actions are not premeditated. If they were, I suppose he could use these new recommendations to his advantage. If he wanted to be suspended to incur the wrath of a Minister he could do as Senator Maunsell pointed out a while ago, that is, at the end of a week's session on a Thursday night, he could be suspended for one minute. That would constitute a day's suspension. On the next occasion, say, when the Senate is about to rise for a week's recess, he could be suspended again on a Thursday night. He would serve his week's penalty when the House was not sitting. If he wanted to be suspended again he could do so when the House rises for a fortnight just as we have had a fortnight's recess for Easter. </PARA>

But on most occasions it does not happen that way. Usually when a person is suspended it happens because something that he has not thought of arises and tempers become frayed and then he is ordered out of the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to see something recommended by the Senate Standing Orders Committee on another matter. There have been occasions in the other place-I am not aware of any in this place-where a member has refused to leave the chamber. Of course there are no arms in that place with which to eject such members so the sitting of the House has to be suspended. But of course in this place the Usher of the Black Rod is armed with a weapon of war. As I have said, I have always been afraid of what will be the outcome if a senator sits tight after the Usher of the Black Rod has been asked to escort him from the chamber. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="757">Senator CAVANAGH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, Mr Temporary Chairman. I am not opposed to the period of sentence for the offence. I think the justification, the reason for the Speaker's naming or the President's naming a member is a statement made in an emotional outburst in discussion. I think on only a few occasions does the situation occur whereby a person feels justified in using harsh words against some people against whom he should not be using harsh words and under parliamentary Standing Orders is not prepared to withdraw and must suffer the penalty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have always accepted the view that a session comprised the period of the spring sitting or the autumn sitting. The previous Clerk, Jimmy Odgers, is the authority on what 'a session' means and unless we can contradict his words, a session is the whole period of the Parliament. I suggest that, while the suggested altered Standing Orders make it easier on a member or less severe on a member, the penalty imposed is too long a period. If a member offends on two occasions in the autumn session, goes home in May and comes back in August and offends a second time, to subject him then to 14 days' suspension, I think, is too harsh. He may be in a stage of rehabilitation in that he did not want to offend but something just slipped through and he did so. But there will be the loss to the Senate of his capabilities for 14 days. After that long a period the penalty seems to me to be too harsh. I agree with the proposed penalty. If we want to alter it, using the words Senator Douglas McClelland has used in accepting Odgers's interpretation of what is a session, then we make it for a sessional period. I think Senator Douglas McClelland said that a spring session comprised a sessional period. I think we should be using those words. If a member offends during that period of the sitting on the third occasion he should be out for a week. But I think on each occasion when we reassemble there should be a reappraisal of the situation, there should be a fresh start in that the member starts to incur penalties again, but not because of things he has said. I think to say that a member should be penalised for 14 days in February, say, of this year because of something he said in October of last year is too harsh a penalty for any member to have to pay for a trivial offence. It is not a question of his committing a crime. It is possibly just a question of his indiscretion in the language he has used. I ask the Committee to have another look at these words 'sessional period' or the 12 calendar months, a calendar year, to see whether we should not use the term 'sessional period'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I propose an amendment to item 12 which would have the effect of recommending to the Committee that motions need not be seconded. Standing Order 123 and Standing Order 140 are the apposite Standing Orders. Standing Order 123 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A Motion not seconded shall not be further debated. </PARA>
<PARA>That Standing Order falls within Chapter XIV-Motions and Questions. Standing Order 140, which is part of Chapter XV-Amendments, states:</PARA>
<PARA> An Amendment proposed but not seconded shall not be further debated. </PARA>
<PARA>Two other Standing Orders relate to this question. Standing Order 266, which is part of Chapter XX-Committees of the Whole Senate, states:</PARA>
<PARA> A Motion made in Committee need not be seconded. </PARA>
<PARA>Standing Order 409, which is part of Chapter XXXIV-Conduct of Senators and Rules of Debate, states:</PARA>
<PARA> It shall be competent to a Senator, when he seconds a Motion or Amendment or moves an Order of the Day, without speaking to it, to address the Senate on the subject of such Motion, Amendment, or Order of the Day, at any subsequent period of the Debate. </PARA>
<PARA>It appears that Standing Order 123 has been in existence since the year dot. It is obviously preferable that any motion placed before a meeting have a seconder. It is important that the proposer have his argument supported by another person or other persons. Obviously, the Standing Orders recognise this because Standing Order 409 enables the seconder of the motion to defer speaking to it, presumably until after other senators have spoken in opposition to the motion. Then the seconder may address himself to the motion, giving due consideration to the points raised in opposition to it. That helps the debate along and assists the consideration of the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it seems eminently unfair that the Standing Orders should not have regard to the current situation in the Senate. Standing Order 123-in this I am subject to correction-was a part of the Standing Orders when the Senate was not the party chamber that it is at present. Naturally, a number of senators of independent mind were present in the early days after Federation. Under those circumstances it would have been necessary for the debates in the Senate to proceed normally in accordance with the procedures set out in the standing orders for any meeting. However, at present the Standing Orders enable any honourable senator except me to place a matter before the chamber and have it deliberated upon. I do not think that that is fair. I specifically point out to the Government that there ought not to be a situation in which those who have voted for me cannot have taken to the floor of the chamber a matter which is of significance to them. That is particularly so in regard to giving notice of a motion on matters which may be very important to those electors. I can certainly place a notice of motion before the Senate. If it is called 'not formal' it goes to the bottom of the Notice Paper. When the matter comes up for debate under General Business, it cannot proceed unless I am assured of a seconder to my motion. I do not think it is fair that an honourable senator should not be able to have a matter of substantial importance considered and deliberated upon to a conclusion. Therefore I propose an addendum to Item 12:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I second the amendment and strongly support what Senator Harradine has said. I feel sure that in light of the generosity of the Committee tonight and the great number of honourable senators who are in the chamber listening to the debate, someone would have seconded the amendment had I not done so. However, the chances are that it may well not have been seconded. I speak as the leader of a small party in this Senate. After 30 June it will not be a small party; it will consist of five senators. I agree with everything that Senator Harradine has said, but I would like him to know that the situation does not apply only to independent senators. It could easily apply to a small party such as the Australian Democrats. For example, Senator Mason and I have on the Notice Paper what we believe to be fairly important notices of motion, as has Senator Harradine. We have been here on Thursday nights but sometimes, as you know, Mr Temporary Chairman, the business takes an interminable time to get through this place and on other occasions it goes through very quickly. It way well be that one of those notices of motion in my name will be called on when Senator Mason is not in the chamber, and it could lapse for want of a seconder if the rest of the Senate wanted to play it hard. I know that does not happen often, but it could happen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we roll notices of motion off the tongue they might not sound important, but here again I support Senator Harradine. A random look at the Notice Paper shows that Senator Mason, Senator Harradine and I have placed on the Notice Paper issues which are not unimportant. For example, Notice of Motion No. 3 in my name concerns the inadequacy of the existing insurance and/or compensation arrangements in the event of a natural disaster. Senator Harradine has one which states, in part:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Senate is of the opinion that 1981, being the International Year of Disabled Persons, would be an appropriate occasion for the Federal Government to monitor very carefully the way in which its $1,000 million contribution to Australian hospitals is expended in the care and treatment of disabled persons. </PARA>
<PARA>No one could say that that is not of fundamental importance. I have a notice of motion which states that the Senate is of the opinion that no legislation for plant breeders' rights should be introduced until there has been full public discussion. Senator Mason has a most important one which states, in part:</PARA>
<PARA> That a Select Committee of the Senate be appointed to inquire into and report upon all aspects of the civil defence program against nuclear attack . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Mason also has one on the question of 2,4,5-T and its related problems. He also has an extraordinary important one concerning the agreement to allow the United States to land its B52 aircraft in Darwin. I have another one concerning the setting up of a select committee of the Senate to inquire into animal welfare in Australia. All of those are important matters. Standing Orders 123 and 140 have been supported by the Standing Orders Committee and, as they now read, those matters could not be debated in the Senate unless all three of us could get seconders. I say through the Chair to Senator Douglas McClelland, an eminently fair-minded person, that I cannot understand how the Standing Orders Committee could allow to prevail a situation whereby for want of a seconder those important matters might not be debated by the Senate. We could well have a recurrence of the Senator Negus phenomenon. He was elected to the Senate on virtually a single issue-the abolition of death duties. Whether one liked him or agreed with the issue upon which he had been elected was irrelevant; he became a democratically elected senator. Are we to have a Standing Order which would prevent another Senator Negus from speaking in the Senate and from putting the views of a number of electors simply because he could not get a seconder? For those reasons the Australian Democrats strongly support the motion moved by Senator Harradine. </PARA>

Senator Harradine said that he is the one who would be disfranchised because the Australian Democrats have two senators at present and after 30 June will have more and because the Government parties and the Australian Labor Party have enough senators to support a worthwhile motion. If Senator Harradine brings forward a motion which is worth while and which one other senator thinks is worth while and worthy of debate, he will get a seconder.

I do not seem to get on the speakers' list on Wednesdays and I suppose that that will remain the case, having regard to arrangements between the Whips. There are ways of overcoming that which may have to be considered, but this is certainly not the way to do it. Senator McLaren also made the point that senators have plenty of opportunity to speak, but that does not get to the point that I made. Of course we have plenty of opportunities to speak. But to what purpose? I know through many a long year of experience in the trade union movement that one does things by motion and amendment; one does not talk for the sake of talking. I am suggesting that if one wants something done one moves a substantive motion. In my case, that cannot be done if the parties decide that there will be no seconder if Senator Harradine moves a motion. Then this chamber could not deliberate in a substantive way on an issue which I wished to bring before the Senate. As I said, that would disfranchise the people who elected me.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Harradine said that if his amendment is not carried he will be prevented from moving a motion and having it deliberated upon. If he could not get a seconder to his motion he would know what would be the fate of his motion; if it were put to the vote he would not get enough people to support him. On the other hand, he has mentioned his many long years of experience in the trade union movement. I am of the opinion that, in the trade union movement in which he has been involved, if he moved a motion at any meeting and could not get a seconder his motion would lapse. I think the same thing would happen at branch meetings of Senator Chipp's party. If some member moved a motion and could not get a seconder the chairman would immediately say that the motion lapsed for the want of a seconder. That is what happens in this place. If we were to amend this Standing Order to allow a motion to be debated even if it were not seconded we would be operating in about the only public forum in the community in which one is able to do that. I think it is wrong. If the motion is not worthy of a seconder it is not worthy of debate.</PARA></TALK.START>

There is a lot of wisdom in having these matters further considered. Senator Harradine's proposal is not, as I understand it, that we make the decision now but that it be referred to the Standing Orders Committee for it to consider the matters which have been raised. Maybe these matters were considered-I do not know-but in any event very strong views have been expressed by two senators who have had the experience of being in a special position in the Senate in regard to this Standing Order.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take advantage of the motion for the first reading of the Excise Tariff Amendment Bill to raise the matter of the Government's immigration program and its consequences for Australia. The Government's stated policy on immigration is to increase the number of migrants to a considerable extent past the point of necessity for purely humane reasons. If I may quote, it has been said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With Great Britain and the Republic of Ireland as the main source of migrants, Australia's migrant intake this year is likely to reach one million for the first time since 1973-74. In the September quarter alone inflow of skilled tradesmen was up 40 per cent, arrivals of skilled metal and electrical tradesmen were up 46.5 per cent. Total arrivals in the quarter rose from 17,701 to 23,614. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government is talking about bringing one million extra people into this country, with Australia suffering the highest unemployment it has ever known, with the Government doing precious little about training or retraining the unemployed people who already live in Australia, with the Federal Government providing less money for education so that youngsters go into the work force with even lower qualifications than they had previously, with less money for housing, even though in some areas of Australia, such as the area around Melbourne in Victoria, housing is at a premium because the costs have become so high. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia used to go shopping in Europe for its needs as far as skilled tradesmen are concerned. We have taken that lazy attitude year after year from the end of the Second World War. It was easy to go over there and shop for the sort of skills we needed for the sort of industries we had. But now it is obvious when Australia goes shopping that people in Europe are not all that keen about coming to Australia. Why should they come to Australia, uproot their families, come halfway across the world, leave behind the families and the friends they have grown up with and loved when wages out here are no better than they are in Europe? Social services are much better in Europe than they are here. Chances of improvement and chances for their children are much better in Europe than they are here. We find that we cannot buy what we need in Europe, and we go to other parts of the world where people are perhaps less qualified. We bring them out here and in my opinion we treat them as less than human because they are less qualified. In many instances they have had less education than the migrants we may have had in other years. They are at a greater disadvantage when we bring them half way across the world and do precious little for them except to use them as a threat to the work force that already exists in Australia, forcing it to accept worse conditions and worse pay because there is a longer line of unemployed outside the factory gates. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment we have a Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) who goes overseas and makes spurious statements about human rights and about how people should be treated. Yet he allows us to take in people from less fortunate parts of the world and then do very little to provide them with a better way of life than they had in the country from which they came. These people who come into Australia with little skill and little background and very little by way of backup are forced to live close to the cities in Australia because they do not have any money for transport. They cannot pay the extraordinary price that we now have to pay for petrol. There is no public transport and so they are forced to live in the inner areas of our cities. I shall speak about Melbourne, which is an area which I know well. In the inner Melbourne area, for instance, at one high school, in the enrolment, 75 per cent of the children come from non-English speaking backgrounds. They get no support in that area. They need a good education if they are to hold their own in the work force and in the community today. They have extraordinary problems in these inner suburban schools in Melbourne. For instance, the 1979 enrolment figures of one school show that of the numbers of students in the school, 29 per cent came from single parent families; 6 per cent came from families where the males were unemployed; 28 per cent came from families which live on pensions; 21 per cent came from families which were on maintenance of some sort; 67 per cent were migrant children; 33 per cent lived in flats, and in those areas they would be housing commission flats-enormous, high, grey cold areas in which to live; 43 per cent came from families where both parents worked; and 39 per cent had lived in their present home for less than three years, so they were mobile. The numbers were continually turning over. </PARA>
<PARA> If we have people who do not speak the language, who live in a less than well equipped area, who are very dependent on finding a job to keep themselves, and their families in many instances, then we need to put them into areas where they can get some sort of background and education and some sort of skills with which to go out into the community. They come from economically disadvantaged areas in the first place; yet the schools, the only area they have to rely on, do less than well by them to the point where in this particular school I am talking about, Collingwood high school, in 1980, due to staff shortages, there were 64 students in science classes and over 60 students in mathematics classes. The science classes were conducted in a laboratory which was designed to accommodate 20 students, although over 60 students had to fit into it. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the massive increase of Indo-Chinese students over the past 18 months in that school, there was only one additional migrant English teacher appointed. That made a total of four migrant English teachers in a school where 75 per cent of the children came from a non-English speaking background. In order to provide the intensive instruction for students requiring remedial work they needed an additional five English teachers for years seven to nine and they needed an additional English teacher for each of the years 10 and 11 where no additional assistance could be given. None of those additional special migrant teachers were made available in that area. What sort of future is there for those children in that area? Their parents find it difficult to find work, and will find it increasingly difficult to find work. Their children will find it difficult to get the qualifications that they will need to find work. </PARA>
<PARA> In another school not very far from the Collingwood high school, Spensley Street primary school, 43 per cent of the children are from a non-English speaking background. At the Fitzroy high school, again less than a mile away from the other two schools I have mentioned, 80 per cent of the children come from non-English speaking backgrounds. But the story in all of those schools is always the same. There is no staff to deal with their special problems; there is no staff to deal with the fact that they do not speak the language; and there is no staff to deal with the special problems that migrant children have of fitting into our community. There is no staff because there is no funding and there is no funding because this Federal Government, although it brings these migrants into Australia, does not take its responsibilities down to that level and provide the funding that is needed. Subjects such as science and mathematics are reduced in these schools. The number of children who can take those subjects is reduced by anything up to 63 per cent. Yet we know that in the work force that we have today, if children are to find a secure future they need to study science and mathematics. Australia is going out shopping for skilled tradesmen because while we have this extraordinarily high unemployment, we also have an extraordinary lack of skilled tradesmen. It would appear that we cannot train our own children in those areas because they have not got sufficient educational background to allow them to be trained in the specialist areas. So we are going round and round in circles. Why are we bringing people to Australia when we do not provide them with the wherewithal to look after themselves and to be independent. We have a government which likes to stand up and talk long and lovingly about people being independent, about people taking up their own battles, and about people fighting for themselves. But we tie people's hands behind their backs because in these instances we do not give them the sort of help and backing that they need. These children in these schools are mainly migrant children. They are never going to be able to get jobs that increasingly need the sorts of skills that they are not being taught, let alone being taught to speak English which, after all, in an English speaking country, is quite necessary. Because they have not got the skills, because they cannot obtain the jobs, they are reduced to a position where they have to take welfare. </PARA>
<PARA> We have various bodies and government members in Australia complaining bitterly about the amount of money that is spent on welfare in this country today, but we do precious little to get people out of the position where they have to take welfare. In other areas, Australia has postured as caring about people who in so many parts of the world today are forced to take the status of refugee. May I cite to the Senate the story of a man who, in the days of the last war in the Lebanon area, when Australia at one stage declared that Lebanese people could be declared refugees, obtained permission to come to Australia as a refugee. He was married and he had two children. In order to get permission to be accepted as a refugee he had to go from Lebanon to Cyprus to get the necessary papers. While he was away in Cyprus getting those papers, his wife was killed. He found that out when he returned to Lebanon. He decided nonetheless to take his children to a new land and start afresh. He had some relatives in Australia, so he came out with his two small boys, planning to live with his sister. When he got here he found that because of her family situation that was not very practical, so he set up house on his own with his two little boys. Of course he had to go to work to earn his living. Because he was away so much of the time, his two boys got into trouble and became hard to control, to the point where a kind and benevolent government took his two boys away from him and put them into a home. This upset him. It would not be putting too fine a point on it to say that this broke his heart because these were his only children; he had hoped to make a new life for them and he now felt he had failed. </PARA>
<PARA> After some little time he felt he could no longer bear to have his children away from him because they were lonely, afraid and unable to understand why they should be locked up in a strange place away from their father. So he decided to take his two boys home, get a part time job and try to manage. For a little time he did manage but honourable senators can imagine the sort of money that he was able to earn these days in part time work. It does not pay the sorts of rents that people have to pay and does not pay for the food, clothing and transport for members of a family. To make things worse, he found that he was going blind. That made it even harder for him to find jobs that he could do. </PARA>
<PARA> This man is now in a position in which he has to keep two growing boys. He has to put up with the fact that he is going blind and that he cannot find work. The only offer this Federal Government makes to him is to put him on the special benefit. Those of us who have unfortunate people coming through our offices every week know how small the special benefit is these days and how hard it is for those on this benefit to manage. I have spoken to the social workers in the area who are at their wits end to know what to do with this man. Up to this point in time, he has not been in this country long enough to qualify for a pension. The only thing a generous Australian government will give him is the special benefit. Social workers have told me that they spend three days of every fortnight begging for food vouchers for him, begging for special payments from this group or that group to keep this man and his two boys going. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have thought that a country that was big enough to offer people refuge and say 'we will accept that you need refuge from the country in which you were born and in which you have grown up; come to our country', might at least offer a little more than that and might at least say: 'You are here; you have started a new life; your two children at least are entitled to a good start'. But we do not. We hide behind the Act that states that unless a person has been here for five years unfortunately we cannot do anything for him. So that man has to put up with watching his two boys grow up in those terrible circumstances. I think it is appalling that Australia postures around the world as a humane country. We say that we care and that we are offering refuge but we then leave people in these insidious positions. </PARA>
<PARA> I wonder where this Government thinks these million people it intends bringing out here in the next 12 months will live. All of us, not just those who live in the cities, should be aware that the cost of housing in city areas is climbing at astronomical rates. Houses cost extraordinary prices, the sort of price that puts them outside the reach of the ordinary working man and certainly outside the reach of the family with children. Public housing to which one might think these people may go is becoming harder and harder to find. There is less public housing because less money is being made available for it and in this respect the Federal Government is responsible. The Federal Government has cut and is proposing to cut even further the amount of money it makes available for public housing. Of course, private enterprise, which always prides itself on its enterprise, does not enter into the field of providing housing for people who do not have high incomes. It is only interested in building extraordinarily luxurious houses for people who can pay rents that look like telephone numbers. What housing is left, generally is of an old dilapidated, run-down variety. By now, because of the housing shortage, the rents have been pushed up to extraordinarily high levels. </PARA>
<PARA> The Victorian Government is proposing to put the money it gets for housing from the Federal Government into rehabilitating boarding houses because it sees that there is a need for single people and especially young single people to find some sort of housing. Of course there is, but when that money goes into that sort of housing, who is going to provide the housing for families, young families, migrant families and people who are desperately trying to find a place to live and to start their lives anew? When a million of them will be pouring into Australia, it makes one shudder at the sorts of pressure this will put on the housing situation in some of the bigger cities of Australia. In Victoria we are in the ludicrous position of having to pay more in interest on the money we receive from the Federal Government for housing to this point than we will receive from the Federal Government for housing in the next 12 months. I think it is time that some rational view was brought to bear on housing by the Federal Government. Are we going to bring people into Australia and expect them to set up tents? Are we going to get into a situation in which we will have humpies on the river bank again? Up to this point in time we have forced Aboriginal people all over Australia into that sort of housing. We have never taken a realistic attitude about that although we do say in forums around the world that we understand that one of the necessities for good health and for any sort of proper living conditions is that people should be provided with clean water and decent shelter. All I can say is that unless the Government provides a lot more money for housing, many people will have very indecent forms of shelter and they will be very lucky if they have access to clean water. Of course, the people who will suffer are the people who are ill-prepared to go into the work force, the people who will be unemployed and who have little money. In many areas, this will be the migrant population. </PARA>
<PARA> In this ill-considered application of a migrant policy, it is not just the young who are not getting an education. It is not just the people of employable age who are not going to have the skills or the jobs to keep themselves and their families. There is a group of elderly migrant women who are treated very much less than as equals and humans by a very inhuman Federal Government. When one applies for citizenship there is a rule that the applicant or the spouse must be able to speak English. If the husband is alive and speaks English, the wife can apply for and be granted citizenship. But, as has been said so often in many places, women tend to live longer than men and there is a large number of elderly migrant women in Australia whose husbands have died who have not learnt to speak or write English and who are in fact illiterate in both their home country language and the English language. These migrant widows are illiterate in both languages. Some of them have been here a lot longer than, say, 10 years but as they have never learnt to speak the language they are not eligible for citizenship. They do apply to become citizens because they want the comfort of being an Australian citizen, they want the comfort of an Australian passport and they feel more secure when they confront the Department of Social Security if they can show that they are indeed Australian citizens. Quite a number of these people have applied for citizenship. The problem is that there does not really seem to be a pattern of acceptance. Some women apply, apply again and apply again but they are knocked back by the Department and told that they are not eligible. In other instances some apply and do get accepted as citizens. Throughout the migrant community there is an unease about whether one can be accepted as a citizen and about the standards that are applied in this circumstance when one applies to become an Australian citizen. Many of these people have applied to come to Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight, for the sake of the public record, I wish to correct some very serious misrepresentations which have been put forth in the media and, I am very distressed to say, by a Minister of the Government concerning events that took place in Canberra on Anzac Day. Honourable senators will no doubt be aware of the coverage that has been given in the national media through both the Australian Broadcasting Commission and commercial television of the Anzac Day march in Canberra. The impression has been given to viewers and readers all over Australia that the Anzac Day march in Canberra was disrupted by a group of women who, it was claimed, were protesting against the Anzac Day ceremony, their protests centering around women who were the victims of rape in war.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am very distressed by these reports, firstly because they are wrong, and secondly because they have come about partly as a result of statements made in public by a Government Minister. I am referring to the Minister for the Capital Territory, Mr Hodgman. I say at the outset-I think any objective record of the events on Saturday will support what I am saying, and, of course, such objective records do exist-that there was never at any stage any intention by a group of women organised loosely under the title 'Women Against Rape in War' to disrupt the Anzac Day ceremonies. That was never at any stage the intention and, indeed, there was no disruption of the Anzac Day march in Canberra. I notice that honourable senators are looking surprised. There was no disruption of the Anzac Day march. Any person participating in that march, any person viewing that march-I understand the honourable senator who is occupying the chair this evening viewed the march because he was present in a representational capacity-will be able to confirm what I am saying. </PARA>
<PARA> The Anzac Day march in Canberra was not disrupted. What happened was quite different, and I shall give a very brief account of what actually happened. A group of women in Canberra last year sought to join the Anzac Day march in order to draw attention to women who were the victims of rape in war. They were not allowed to do this. A number of them were arrested under existing local legislation. Charges were subsequently dropped. This year a group of women decided that as the charges had been dropped there was no legal obstacle to them participating in the Anzac Day ceremony in what they, as citizens living in a democratic society, considered to be an appropriate and special way for them to do so. They decided to form a group and join in the march with other organisations such as the various returned soldiers groups, Boy Scouts, the Girl Guides and so on. They decided that they would march for a specific reason very much in tune with the spirit of the Anzac Day ceremonies. They decided to march specifically in honour of the memory of those women who were victims of war in that they were raped, and they started to plan this march. </PARA>
<PARA> As news of their intentions spread, some alarm was expressed by the spokespeople for the Returned Services League. Without any proper investigation of the issue, without any consultation with the locally elected representatives of the Australian Capital Territory-I include here representatives in the House of Assembly and the elected representatives in the House of Representatives and the Senate-the Minister for the Capital Territory decided to introduce hurriedly, overnight, and with no consultation, a new piece of legislation. It was a piece of legislation of the most serious character in that it placed a very serious restriction on civil liberties and introduced a new series of criminal offences. My colleague Senator Evans will make some comment this evening on that legislative action. When news of the Minister's action became known publicly in Canberra a very large number of women were very distressed and outraged by this action, which they felt was discriminatory, a gross over-reaction and, indeed, a grossly inappropriate reaction to the intentions of the women. So the group wishing to participate in the Anzac Day ceremony in the entirely appropriate way I have described grew larger. </PARA>
<PARA> On the morning of the march about 300 women assembled, not on Anzac Parade where the march is held but in a side street, Geerilong Gardens, which led on to Anzac Parade. The women assembled and discussed how they were to proceed in order to carry out their intention of participating in the march in a dignified and peaceful fashion. They were briefed by spokespeople for the group as to the method of marching, which was to be in silence and in two rows. After a short ceremony, during which they maintained a minute's silence and a poem was read, the women formed up behind banners. About 300 women were present. Some men had joined the gathering. They were asked not to join the march but rather just to express their support for it. </PARA>
<PARA> The women started to move forward to the street where the march was to be held but they were told by the spokespeople that if they felt that pushing forward would cause arrest they ought to fall back quietly and wait until matters settled down. There was never any intention to act in a confrontationist or disruptive way. The women moved on through Geerilong Gardens, and as soon as they entered Cooyong Street, which is still not the main street where the parade is held, they were prevented from moving forward by a police blockade extending across footpaths and roads with a backup force further down Cooyong Street. Bystanders have observed that about 70 police were blocking the way. The policeman read the ordinance and said that if the women attempted to move forward they would risk arrest. Organisers responded to this by asking the women to sit down and discuss a plan of campaign. During this time the women were quiet and their actions were restrained. Nothing happened to encourage the police to think that the women would be in any way offensive in their actions. </PARA>
<PARA> After the reading of the ordinance by the sergeant in charge, different alternatives were discussed. Finally, it was decided that the group would break up and that the women would attempt to proceed as individuals and re-form when they reached Anzac Parade, but again they were prevented from doing that. I say at this point that I believe the Australian Federal Police, the police who serve the electorate I represent, were put in an impossible position by the ordinance. For reasons that Senator Evans will spell out, the ordinance is very difficult for the police to interpret and there was a great deal of indecision on their part as to how they should proceed to maintain law and order when the law was, indeed, a very difficult one. They were required by the law not to prevent something that was actually happening but to prevent something which perhaps was intended to happen. Of course, the police had to be mind-readers in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> My criticisms are not of the Federal Police, who were given a very difficult and, indeed, impossible task to do, but of the legislation and the three Ministers who put their names to this outrageous piece of subordinate legislation. When the time came for some of the women to decide to join the parade, of course there was a confrontation with the police and a number of them-I am told about 60-were arrested. However, not all of the women were arrested. Some of them were able to pass through. They re-formed at the head of the parade. When the rest of the march was over they marched quietly to the Remembrance Stone and placed their wreath. They were quiet and reverent during the whole episode. So where are we? As I said, there was no confrontation with marchers and no disruption of the march. The confrontation was with the police, who had been forced by the ordinance to prevent the women who were seeking to join the march from taking part. That confrontation took place in a side street and, as the record will support, did not disrupt the march. It certainly did not disrupt the ceremonies involving the laying of the wreaths. </PARA>
<PARA> I have gone through that account in some detail because the truth in this case is so very different from the wild impressions that were created by some of the media reports as to what happened. I am particularly critical of the national ABC report, which I saw, and the Channel 7 national report, which I also saw. Both of them used film clips showing the arrests and presented them to the viewer in such a way as to give the viewer the impression that the arrests were actually occurring in the body of the march. I discovered to my distress and horror that some of my own colleagues had formed this impression from watching the ABC and Channel 7 national news. I cannot say what other television news coverage presented such reports because I did not see any others. I think a proper examination of what took place will reveal the facts to be as I have presented them. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to proceed now to the matter of the way in which Mr Hodgman has behaved. I wish to make it quite clear that my criticism is not of the Returned Services League. I disagree entirely with the view adopted by the RSL over this matter and I am very disappointed that a man such as Sir William Keys should have expressed the views that he expressed and that the local RSL organisation should have adopted the view that it adopted. But this is a democracy and if they have a view they are entitled to put it. They are entitled to put it to a Minister. They are entitled to ask a Minister to act in a certain way. My criticism fundamentally is not of them. They are entitled to have their view and to ask for what they asked for. But the Minister for the Capital Territory is not entitled to bring in an entirely repressive piece of legislation overnight with no consultation. He had no consultation with his Liberal Party colleagues in the Australian Capital Territory-with Elizabeth Grant of the House of Assembly or with Senator-elect Margaret Reid. Not only is he not entitled to do that but also he is to be criticised in the strongest possible terms for his garbled, untruthful version of the events and for the attempted justification of his own behaviour that he gave on AM yesterday morning. I have never heard such a concoction of untruths, distortions and exaggerations brought forward in what obviously amounted to an hysterical attempt to justify in retrospect his own outrageous and unjustifiable action. I shall draw attention to some of the more outrageous comments made by the Minister. Mr Hodgman said on AM yesterday:</PARA>
<PARA> The law was introduced for two reasons. Firstly, the existing law was felt not to be adequate-</PARA>
<PARA>Let me ask the Minister: By whom was it felt not to be adequate? The national capital has had marches, demonstrations, rallies and meetings of a vast variety of character, motive, organisational structure and so forth and yet the existing laws have been adequate to maintain law and order and the peaceful operation of these activities, so why was the law suddenly inadequate? If there was to be any improper attempt to disrupt a public event the existing laws clearly were adequate. That was the first outrageous untruth that the Minister delivered himself of over national radio. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA>but more importantly we received very detailed reports that a group was planning to disrupt the Anzac Day observance in the National Capital. </PARA>
<PARA>He said that the reports were frightening because they indicated that a number of extreme feminists, particularly from the Sydney area, would be coming to Canberra. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . representatives of both the Marxist and Lesbian groups within the Feminist Movement which is a front . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . in reality it was an attempt to sabotage the solemn remembrance of Anzac Day . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He said that he had information. He said that he could not respond personally to a particular question, but said:</PARA>
<PARA> Our information was, and has been confirmed independently by a phone call from, in fact, a member of the group, that they have met over the last three weekends planning this, that a number were planning to lie down in front of the soldiers and the ex-servicemen and women . . . the use of spray guns filled with paint . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The ABC reporter properly asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Where did the report come from?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hodgman replied:</PARA>
<PARA> The report is both an official police report and secondly information which was provided to us by a person who actually infiltrated the group . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I do not believe that claim by the Minister. I believe that it is an hysterical fabrication by somebody trying to cover his own tracks. I think it is the lowest form of political activity for a Minister to go on national radio and say: 'We did this outrageous thing, we introduced this outrageous legislation, because we were informed that certain outrageous things were going to take place'. Where is the evidence? If Mr Hodgman has been so informed, if he does have an official report, let him make that report public in the Parliament. If he does not, he is condemned permanently-I think he deserves it-as a person who tells outrageous untruths. I believe it is detrimental to the functioning of democracry and to the credibility of the Parliament for a Minister to use an an excuse for outrageous action that he had a secret informant, that he had seen a secret report, and to make such crazy assertions about the character of the women who participated. </PARA>
<PARA> It would not come as a surprise to honourable senators that I know many-probably most-of the women who participated in this action. I can assure honourable senators that the fantastic characterisation of the women as presented in Mr Hodgman's remarks could not be further from the truth. I know returned servicewomen who wished to join the march this year in that way. I know women who have been long-standing members of community organisations, parents and citizens organisations and conservative women's organisations who wished to join the march in this way. For Mr Hodgman to try to justify his own action by such grossly untruthful and insulting characterisation of these women is, I believe, a total debasement of parliamentary standards in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other point I wish to make is about the constant harping by the Minister on the claim that the feminists wanted to disrupt the march for political purposes. I cannot understand what that means. What would be the political purpose? Is he suggesting that they are members of a political organisation which is opposed to Anzac Day? I know of no political party which expresses opposition to Anzac Day. Certainly my own political party has no opposition to Anzac Day. Indeed, representatives of the Labor Party participate and are honoured to participate in the observance of Anzac Day. Several times I have had the honour to represent the Leader of the Opposition in this matter and I have been honoured to do so. Where is the political party, where is the political cause, which is supposed to be hostile to the spirit of Anzac Day? There is no such political cause. I claim that Mr Hodgman, the Minister for the Capital Territory, was seeking to score a cheap political point, seeking to exploit the kind of prejudices that exist in the community about the women's movement, seeking to curry favour with a very strong and articulate lobby group, the RSL, and that in seeking to do all those rather contemptible things he has acted in a way which is detrimental not only to his own party and to the Government but also to the Parliament in general. I recognise that that matter will not end here, but that is what I have to say. I hope that those sections of the media which were so quick to misrepresent what actually occurred will pay some attention to my words tonight and make some attempt to set the record straight. </PARA>

<PARA> The Attorney-General, Senator Peter Durack, the Minister for Administrative Services, Mr Kevin Newman, and the Minister for the Capital Territory, Mr Michael Hodgman, today annuonced amendments to the A.C.T. Traffic Ordinance which have the objective of preventing Anzac Day Parades in Canberra and Anzac Day observances at the Australian War Memorial being disrupted by protesters. The Ministers said the amendments were designed to ensure that next Saturday's Anzac Day Parade would be able to proceed in a peaceful and dignified manner. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments, which were notified in the Gazette today, make it an offence for persons to disrupt an Anzac Day Parade or an observance or ceremony at or near the Australian War Memorial. In addition, a member of the Australian Federal Police of or above the rank of sergeant will be able to direct a person not to take part in the Anzac Day Parade where there are reasonable grounds for believing that the person is likely to disturb the parade. It will be an offence for a person to contravene such a direction. </PARA>
<PARA> The Ministers said the amendments were designed to preserve the dignity of Anzac Day. They added that this year's parade would again include a contingent of youth who had first participated in 1979, the International Year of the Child. This year approximately 500 young people from Canberra were expected to march. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Ordinance was made, like all others for the Australian Capital Territory, by Executive decree, by the Governor-General, that is, acting on the advice of the Federal Executive Council. It was gazetted last Thursday and it was enforced last Saturday, merely two days later without any opportunity for its being considered by any legislative body and certainly not by the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly because, of course, that has no legislative powers at all with respect to ordinances or anything else and not by this Parliament which does, of course, have some powers with respect to ordinances of this kind, namely, the power to disallow them. The Ordinance was enforced in the circumstances which have just been outlined by Senator Ryan and which have been very elaborately retailed by the written media and by some television reports, in particular, that of Channel 10.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In those circumstances 64 people, mostly women, were arrested last Saturday for breaches of various provisions of the Ordinance, overwhelmingly, I understand, for breach of those provisions relating to a failure to obey a police direction given under the terms of the Ordinance. I do not want to say anything about the way in which those arrests were conducted. It may in fact be that the police, or at least some of them, did behave rather badly and certainly there is evidence of a failure by some or perhaps even all relevant police officers to wear appropriate identification marks, in particular, their police numbers. But that is a matter which can be left to another occasion to explore. It may be, on the other hand, as Senator Ryan has indicated in what she said that the police were in fact put in an intolerable position by the terms of this Ordinance and the way in which they acted was no more than the way in which they were required to act given the all embracing character of the conduct prohibited by the Ordinance in question. I simply want to focus on the terms of the Ordinance itself, not on the surrounding circumstances and to express quite succinctly three basic objections which I believe the Regulations and Ordinances Committee should consider very closely when it is dealing in the first instance with this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The first objection to this Ordinance is the fact that it has been enforced by arrest, by charges and presumably it will follow, by fines before the legislature of this national Parliament has had an opportunity to consider it in any way through its normal processes of consideration with a view to possible disallowance. It is a classical exercise of criminal law making by the Executive and as such is at odds, I believe, with fundamental democratic principles. That, of course, is a fundamental flaw in our whole system of delegated legislation making and in particular has been a long running flaw so far as the Ordinances of the Australian Capital Territory are concerned which have all the character of fully fledged legislation in their own right rather than minor order, rules and regulations. This whole issue does raise the larger question of whether or not an appropriate legislative body, namely, the Australian Capital Territory House of Assembly, ought not to be exercising some proper legislative function with respect to laws of this kind. But there is even in the absence of any such domestic law-making process of a representative parliamentary kind within the Australian Capital Territory an opportunity for legislative input into the Ordinance making or approving process and that is, of course, via the disallowance procedures of this Parliament. I regard it as absolutely intolerable that this Ordinance was enforced in the way in which it was, in the far-reaching, criminal sanction way in which it was without there having been an opportunity for prior consideration by the legislature. I do not know of any precedent of this kind of action by way of enforcement of an Executive decree before there has been an opportunity for parliamentary consideration. There may have been one in respect of the notorious events in 1972 surrounding the removal of the Aboriginal embassy on which occasion I seem to recall reading about Senator Cavanagh's raising this very same question about an Executive decree in fact being enforced through criminal sanction before the Parliament itself had had an opportunity to consider the matter. Certainly, the Attorney-General when I asked him a question during Question Time today could not produce any precedents for Executive laws of this kind and character and gravity being enforced in this way. He said that he would investigate whether there had been any such precedents and I will await with some interest the products of that investigation. I do note, however, that he was not quick in Question Time today to respond to my invitation to justify in principle this practice which has eventuated in respect of this Ordinance of enforcing through police processes a severe set of criminal sanctions without there having previously been an opportunity for legislative consideration of those sanctions. That is the first objection. </PARA>
<PARA> The second objection is that the Ordinance is completely unnecessary on any view, given the vast array of existing public order legislative provisions which govern marches, assemblies and demonstrations of all kinds in the Australian Capital Territory. Senator Ryan indicated in broad terms the inadequacy of the grasp of Mr Hodgman, as the responsible Minister, of the existing law in this respect in his claim that there were no appropriate sanctions. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me fill in the record perhaps in just a little more detail by listing and seeking the incorporation in Hansard of the terms of a series of legislative provisions which do bear directly on the kinds of circumstances that, we are told, were understood to be threatened in the run-up to last Saturday's Anzac Day parade. So far as marches themselves are concerned, I refer to section 23 of the Australian Capital Territory Traffic Ordinance. So far as the question of offensive or insulting behavious is concerned, I refer to section 17 of the Australian Capital Territory Police Offences Ordinance. So far as unlawful assemblies are concerned involving violence or the apprehension of violence, I refer to sections 6 and 8 of the Public Order (Protection of Persons and Property) Act 1971-73. So far as the question of obstruction of police in the execution of their lawful duty in these kinds of situation is concerned, I refer again to the Public Order (Protection of Persons and Property) Act 1971-73, section 9. I refer also to section 73 of the Police Offences Ordinance of the Australian Capital Territory. I refer to section 25 of the Police Ordinance of the Australian Capital Territory. Finally, I refer to section 64 of the Australian Federal Police Act which indeed, I understand, was used to prosecute 14 women in the 1980 Anzac Day Women Against Rape protest which unquestionably did involve some degree of physical disruption. So we had a precedent in exactly the sort of circumstances that apparently were contemplated, whether justifiably or not, by the Minister. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard for convenient reference, the text of all those provisions to which I have just referred. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> 23. (1) Any person who, without the written permission of the Minister, organizes a procession or parade of any kind upon a public street shall be guilty of an offence. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) Any person who joins or takes part in any procession or parade for which the permission of the Minister has not been obtained shall, if the procession or parade causes any obstruction to traffic upon a public street, be guilty of an offence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. May I make it clear that in referring to those provisions I say absolutely nothing about their merits, because undoubtedly a number of them are over-broad in their actual and potential operation and a number unquestionably ought to be the subject of some review. I refer to them only in order to note their existence in the context of the claims that have been made about there being a vacuum in the present law of public order in the Australian Capital Territory, and accordingly the necessity for specific further legislative provision to be made to deal with threatened breaches of the peace or disruptions of this kind. It is an absolutely unfounded claim, as even the most cursory scrutiny of the terms of those legislative provisions that I have outlined will demonstrate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The third and final objection that must be made to the terms of this Ordinance is that it is manifestly over-broad and far too vague and far-reaching in its terms and potential application. Let me remind the Senate of those terms. There are only three provisions. The first two concern the police powers of direction. Sub-section (1) of section 23A provides:</PARA>
<PARA> Where-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) a person is taking part, or attempts to take part, in an Anzac Day parade; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) there are reasonable grounds for believing that the person is likely to commit an offence against sub-section (3),</PARA>
<PARA>a member of the Australian Federal Police of or above the rank of Sergeant may direct the person not to take part in the parade. </PARA>
<PARA>That is followed by sub-section (2), which provides:</PARA>
<PARA>A person who contravenes a direction given under sub-section (1) is guilty of an offence and punishable, on conviction, by a fine not exceeding $100. </PARA>
<PARA>So far so good. That is a simple and familiar power for police to give directions in situations in which they believe that there is reasonable ground to assume that an offence-later defined-will be committed. So far it is not especially offensive-it is quite a familiar provision-but this all assumes meaning and content when one gets to sub-section (3), which actually lists what the offences are. It provides:</PARA>
<PARA> (3) A person who-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) disturbs or disrupts-</PARA>
<PARA> (i) an Anzac Day parade; or</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) an observance or ceremony conducted at the building known as the Australian War Memorial on 25 April in any year--</PARA>
<PARA>I express no objection to the reference to disturbance or disruption because, clearly, the solemnity of the Anzac Day occasion is such that it ought not to be subject to disturbance or disruption, as those words are properly defined. Again, perhaps so far so good, except to the extent that there are other legislative provisions which would secure exactly the same end. Paragraph (b) goes on to put in the next component:</PARA>
<PARA>acts in a manner likely to disturb or disrupt such a parade, observance or ceremony;</PARA>
<PARA>That is a little more questionable because it is a little more vague, but nonetheless is probably acceptable in principle. The real problem starts with paragraph (c), which states:</PARA>
<PARA> (c) engages in conduct offensive or insulting, or likely to give offence or cause insult, to persons taking part in such a parade, observance or ceremony, is guilty--</PARA>
<PARA>This is the penalty provision which applies to all three of those situations-</PARA>
<PARA>of an offence punishable, on conviction, by a fine not exceeding $100. </PARA>
<PARA> The first of these substantive offences is causing a disturbance or disruption. The second is acting in a manner likely to cause a disturbance or disruption-which is one removed from what the person is actually doing and depends on the response of the person who is reacting to the behaviour in question. For that reason it is a little more questionable. </PARA>
<PARA> The third is really quite an extraordinary provision in that it prohibits the person from engaging in conduct offensive or insulting, or likely to give offence or cause insult, to persons taking part in such a parade. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be fairly obvious that what we have here is a situation of subjective impression, subjective responsibility, which determines the application of criminal sanctions, applicability of arrest, the applicability of charges and the applicability of convictions and fines of up to $100. What we have is a situation which by itself is bad enough because it means that someone who is engaging in the kind of conduct which is likely to cause offence or insult to any person taking part in an Anzac Day parade-be he the most reactionary RSL person with the most far-reaching views as to the intolerability of any person wanting to register a different kind of solemn expression of commemoration on Anzac Day; anyone who offends subjectively the most extraordinarily susceptible person of that kind of view-is capable of bringing into force the operation of this provision. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to get into a long argument about this, but there are many offensive behaviour provisions in existing legislation which are cast in terms of a person who engages in behaviour which is offensive or insulting. The courts have tended to construe those sorts of provisions as meaning that the behaviour in question has to be of a character which not just subjectively causes an offended response from the person witnessing such behaviour but is reasonably likely to cause offence to a reasonably robust member of the community. In other words, there has to be some kind of objective test satisfied. Some court cases go further and establish, I think properly, a criterion of the likelihood of the behaviour in question actually causing a breach of the peace or causing a disturbance of some kind. I think it is appropriate that public order legislation, particularly when it is built around the causing of offence or insult have an objective component of that kind and one relating to questions of physical order. To the extent that the law does not clearly so provide then I think the law is deficient and ought to be subject to review.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am making the point-it is a fairly obvious one really-that this legislation, on the face of it, is capable of operating to cause someone to be arrested and fined if he simply does something which, whatever its intrinsic dignity so far as one kind of spectator is concerned, is by its very character a form of action which is likely to cause indignation to some other participant in the parade. It was clear that the mere act of the women here in wishing to lay a wreath in remembrance of women raped in war was such as act. If it is an act capable of causing indignation or an offended response to some participant in the parade the full force of this provision applies. One can show how bizarre this all is by turning the application of the section on its head and pointing out that it is equally capable of referring to someone who is offended by, let us say, someone of left wing inclinations who is nonetheless an old Digger who participates in the parade and who listens to the jingoistic utterances of an extreme and florid character advanced by some spokesman for the RSL or other organisation speaking from the rostrum. </PARA>
<PARA> On the face of this legislation, it is broad enough to encompass reactions of that kind. I think that demonstrates simply just how bizarre and far-reaching, over-broad and vague that provision is. It becomes even more so-it becomes totally indefensible-when one reads that provision in conjunction with the preliminary provision in sub-sections (1) and (2) about the disobedience of a direction given by a police officer. In other words if a police officer believes it likely that a person will commit the offence of being likely to engage in conduct which is likely to cause offence or insult to some person participating in a parade, we could have a situation of a direction being given which, if disobeyed, will result in a charge. So we have three subjective discretions piled one on top of the other, three subjective tests about states of mind-the policeman's state of mind about what he believes the person is likely to do by way of conduct, which in turn relates to the state of mind which a third person is likely to have on witnessing the conduct of the second person. </PARA>
<PARA> This is all very well if we are talking about some utterly innocuous regulatory provision which does not have any kind of criminal sanction attached to it. But when we have a piece of legislation which is capable, as was amply demonstrated last Saturday, of being enforced by the full might and fury of the police it is intolerable and indefensible to have provisions of this breadth. I make it clear that I think some of the provisions, much as those relating to causing actual disruption or disturbance, looked at entirely in isolation are perfectly defensible. No one on this side of the chamber or anywhere else would imagine that it is inappropriate for the law to prevent physical disruptions or disturbances at Anzac Day parades. However, I make the point that those provisions are unnecessary because they exist elsewhere. What is intolerable about this legislation is the way in which it creates that further category of offence, creates the right, or indeed almost the obligation, of the police to give directions to persons not to engage in conduct which is likely to cause offence in that third way. That was the particular head of this Ordinance on which the overwhelming majority of the people were arrested. </PARA>
<PARA> The only other point I want to make is that I think it is obvious enough from what I have said that the Ordinance, on its very face, does offend the criterion of trespassing unduly on personal rights and liberties which it is the obligation of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances to apply. The offensiveness to that criterion becomes even more obvious when one looks at this Ordinance in the context of the provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and in particular Article 21, which refers to the right of peaceable assembly being recognised and not interfered with, which covenant, of course, Australia has now not only ratified but also given legislative force to a limited extent in the recently enacted Human Rights Commission Bill. The terms of that covenant are set out and discussed in a manner that is extremely relevant to the present circumstances in a very recently published article in the Legal Service Bulletin for April 1981 headed 'Assembly laws and the Civil Rights Covenant' by Robin Handley. Again I seek leave to incorporate the text of the article in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The article read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>ASSEMBLY LAWS &amp; THE CIVIL RIGHTS COVENANT</PARA>
<PARA>by Robin Handley</PARA>
<PARA> Australia ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on 13 August 1980; under Article 49, the Covenant came into force three months later, on 13 November 1980. Article 21 of the Covenant provides:</PARA>
<PARA> The right of peaceful assembly shall be recognised. No restrictions may be placed on the exercise of this right other than those imposed in conformity with the law and which are necessary in a democratic society in the interests of national security or public safety, public order (ordre public), the protection of public health or morals or the protection of the rights and freedoms of others. </PARA>
<PARA> By Article 2 (1) Australia has undertaken 'to respect and to ensure to all individuals within its territory and subject to its jurisdiction the rights recognised in the present Covenant'. By Article 2 (3) Australia has undertaken 'to ensure that any person whose rights or freedoms as herein recognised are violated shall have an effective remedy'. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia lodged certain 'Reservations and Declarations' with its Instrument of Ratification; with respect to Article 2, attention was drawn to Australia's constitution as a federal commonwealth, and to the division of powers between States and Federal legislative, executive, and judicial authorities. The implementation of the provisions of the Covenant will be divided (and shared) between the Commonwealth and the States. However, the making of laws for the Australian Capital Territory falls within the Federal sphere of authority,1 and the Federal Government must therefore accept responsibility for the implementation of all the provisions of the Covenant in that Territory. </PARA>
<PARA>ASSEMBLY IN THE ACT</PARA>
<PARA> As in other Australian jurisdictions, there is in the ACT no right of peaceful assembly, statutory or common law, enforceable in the courts. Any right of peaceful assembly that does exist is residual only; that is, whatever is left after taking account of all the legal restrictions on assembly. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from a wide range of statutory and common law offences which may be committed during an assembly in the ACT,2 there is one overriding restriction on assembly: if the assembly involves 'a procession or parade of any kind upon a public street' then the Motor Traffic Ordinance, s.23 makes it an offence to organize such a procession or parade without the written permission of the Minister.3 This is similar to the position in Queensland, where a permit from the District Superintendent of Traffic is required for any meeting or procession on any road,4 and Western Australia, where the prior permission of the Commissioner of Police is required 'for any procession, meeting or assembly in any street, thoroughfare or public place'.5</PARA>
<PARA>THE GOVERNMENT'S OBLIGATION</PARA>
<PARA> Given its obligations under the International Covenant discussed above the Federal Government should now initiate a reform of the law of assembly in the ACT, so that the right of assembly expressed in Article 21 is given legal recognition, and an effective remedy for violation of that right is provided in accordance with Article 2, para. 3.6 Until the Federal Government takes steps to initiate such reform, it is in no position to put pressure on State Governments to amend their law. Justice R. M. Hope, speaking at a seminar on the teaching of human rights in June 1980, expressed the view that only in NSW and South Australia did the law recognize the right of peaceful assembly expressed in the International Covenant. </PARA>
<PARA> Time is short. Article 40 requires that, within one year of the Covenant taking effect, Australia should submit a report on the measures adopted which give effect to the rights recognized by the Covenant, and on progress made in the enjoyment of those rights. </PARA>
<PARA>REFORM</PARA>
<PARA> The most pressing need in the ACT is for the repeal of s.23 of the Motor Traffic Ordinance, and for a review of applicable statutory and common law provisions.7 Before proposing a replacement for s.23, I should mention briefly the comparable NSW and South Australian statutes. </PARA>
<PARA> The Public Assemblies Act 1979, s.4 (NSW), which came into effect on 1 August 1979, requires the organizers of an intended assembly to give written notice to the Commissioner of Police of the date of the proposed assembly, the location or route, the purpose, and the expected number of participants. At least seven days notice must be given, unless application is made to the court for authorization. Where the required notice is given, the Commissioner may apply to the Supreme Court, under s.6, for an order prohibiting the assembly-but he must first invite and consider representations from the organizers of the assembly. The hearing will be before a single judge, usually of the Administrative Law Division of the Supreme Court, whose decision is final and not subject to appeal. </PARA>
<PARA> The Public Assemblies Act 1972 (SA) provides a similar notification system8-although, by s.4(4), only four days' notice is required. The Chief Secretary, the Commissioner of Police, and the local council may each lodge objections with the person who served notice, at least two days before the date of the proposed assembly; objections must also be published in a newspaper in the State, or in such a way that they come to the notice of those intending to participate in the assembly. Objections must specify the grounds upon which the proposed assembly would 'unduly prejudice any public interest': s.4(6). When an objection has been made, any intending participant may apply to a judge for a determination, and the judge may, under s.5(2):</PARA>
<PARA> (a) if he is not satisfied that proper ground for any objection made to the proposal exists, quash the objection and approve the proposal; or (b) may approve any other proposals submitted to him before, or at the hearing of, the application. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 23 of the Motor Traffic Ordinance (ACT) should be replaced by new provisions, similar to those contained in the Public Assemblies Act 1979 (NSW) requiring the organizers of a demonstration expected to take place on a public street, to give seven days written notice (specifying the proposed time, date, route and expected numbers) to the Commissioner of Police. Within two days of receipt of this notice, the Commissioner might serve notice of an objection on the Supreme Court, and in the following two days there would be a hearing, when the onus would be on the Commissioner to satisfy the Court that he has reasonable grounds to fear serious public disorder.9 The Court would have power to make an order prohibiting the proposed demonstration or imposing such conditions as the Court thinks fit. Provision would also be made for the organizers of a demonstration to apply to the Court to waive the seven day notification requirement. </PARA>
<PARA>THE POSITION IN THE UNITED KINGDOM</PARA>
<PARA> The law of assembly is presently under review in the UK-the Government published a Green Paper in April 1980, reviewing the Public Order Act 1936 and related legislation.10 The Public Order Act, s.3(1), empowers a chief officer of police who 'has reasonable grounds for apprehending that the procession may occasion serious public disorder' to 'give directions imposing upon the persons organizing or taking part in the procession such conditions as appear to him necessary for the preservation of public order, including conditions prescribing the route to be taken and prohibiting the procession from entering any public place specified in the directions'. Where he is of the opinion that such measures are inadequate, s.3(2) empowers him to apply to the local council for an order prohibiting the holding of all or any class of public procession in a particular area for a period not exceeding three months. The local council may make such an order with the Home Secretary's approval. (In London, the Commissioner of Police may make such an order subject only to the Home Secretary's approval.)</PARA>
<PARA> This review of the legislation, and that undertaken by the English Law Commission of associated common law offences,11 were prompted by the anti-National Front demonstration in Southall, London in April 1979-when Blair Peach, the New Zealand teacher, was killed12-and by earlier violent demonstrations in Lewisham, Birmingham and Leicester. Concern has been voiced over the preventive considerations incorporated in the Public Order Act 1936, s.3. For example, is the 'serious public disorder' test too stringent? Should the test be relaxed so that a chief officer of police can exercise his powers where the risk is merely that of 'disruption to the local community'? How are the rights of those who wish to march to be weighted against the rights of the members of the local community to go about their everyday business?13 Another question is whether a ban imposed under s. 3 (2) should be the subject of judicial review; judicial review is unlikely at present because the courts would be reluctant to interfere with the judgment of a chief officer of police where he is 'of the opinion' that s. 3 (1) measures would be inadequate in preventing serious public disorder.14 These and other questions raised by this review, are relevant to Australia, and the Federal Government should give them careful consideration before formulating its proposals for reform of the law of assembly in the ACT. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The importance of this article is that it not only demonstrates how the text of the Covenant is relevant to assembly laws generally but also that it focuses quite specifically on the present laws governing assembly in the Australian Capital Territory. I believe that as such it is a very useful reference document for honourable senators and, in particular, for members of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not underestimate the difficulty of drafting and enforcing public order legislation generally. I am really picking up some of the points I was endeavouring to make in answer to Senator Puplick. This is a notoriously sensitive and difficult area of the law where there is undoubtedly a legitimate community interest on the one hand in avoiding public disorder, both generally and certainly in specific situations of a solemn and dignified kind such as Anzac Day marches, but where equally clearly there is an interest not only of individuals but also of the community as a whole in preserving so far as is humanly possible the rights of free speech and expression of members of the community. Of course, the difficulty is in ensuring that those rights can be exercised in a way that will not create intolerable situations of disturbance and disorder. I believe that in this sort of conflict situation the law should bend over backwards not to penalise for its own sake behaviour which is potentially offensive to some classes of persons within the community. It is just too easy for too much behaviour to satisfy that description, whether it is inherently disruptive, remotely violent or physically disturbance-creating in its character. I believe that far too many of our offensive behaviour and public order laws are cast in over-broad terms, although there has been some attempt in the recent development of common law to limit the operation of those laws in the way I was endeavouring earlier to describe to Senator Puplick. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to labour any of these points now because I believe that the whole question of the appropriateness of this ordinance is, in the first instance, properly a matter for the Regulations and Ordinances Committee to deal with. I believe that the Committee should, as I have said, look very carefully at this Ordinance. It is difficult to believe that when it does, applying the criteria that it is obliged to, it will be able to do otherwise than recommend its disallowance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will not keep my colleagues more than a few minutes. I would like to comment mainly on what Senator Ryan said. Senator Evans ended his very flowery description of the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman) by saying: 'He is loud'. Having listened to half an hour of Senator Evans, I suggest that the honourable senator might be the pot calling the kettle black. Senator Ryan indulged in a very personal attack on the Minister for the Capital Territory. Obviously she does not know him very well. As a close colleague of his, I can assure her that he very thoroughly researches any statements he makes. Senator Ryan went to great lengths to tell the Senate that the women protesters at the Anzac Day parade in Canberra had no intention at any stage of confronting the marchers and that, indeed, they did not. Of course they did not because when they attempted to do that, the police stopped them. She assured us that originally it was to be a very peaceful protest by the women and that there would be no confrontation, that the organisers had gone to great lengths to tell everyone to be calm and peaceful. As a throw-away line she said, however, that 60-odd people were arrested by the police. It is hardly very peaceful when 64 women are arrested by the police. I hardly think it was the sort of thing that Senator Ryan was trying to tell us it was.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Ryan did not say where the 300 women came from. I would be most interested to know the addresses of those who were arrested. The Minister indicated that many of the women had come from Sydney to join the march. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UJ4">Senator WALTERS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Melzer asks: 'What has that to do with it?' We have heard about these political demonstrations before. We talk of 'pay-a-demo'. There is no doubt that we have had another pay-a-demo in this attempted demonstration on Anzac Day in the Australian Capital Territory. It will be interesting to see where the women came from. I do not doubt that some of the women who Senator Ryan knows intended to be peaceful, but how often have we had demonstrations in this country when the organisers have said: 'but we had so many infiltrators from outside who disrupted it; we had no intention of it going this far'? It really does get out of hand. The Minister had information which I am quite sure that Senator Ryan would not have been privy to. But the Minister took steps to make sure that the disruption did not eventuate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe Anzac Day is a very special occasion. Senator Tate may not consider it as special an occasion as I do, but I believe most Australians think Anzac Day has very special meanings for the majority of us. It is a day of reverence and of remembrance when every Australian who cares to do so can set aside some time just to say a simple thank you to those who gave their lives to preserve freedom, the right to demonstrate and the right to march. But we in this country must not allow demonstrations to interfere with that day. I back the Minister very much in that regard. The horrors of war, not only of Anzac Day itself but of every war that has occurred since Gallipoli, are understood. If the women were to look at those who have suffered in war and if they were at all legitimate they would have wanted to march on behalf of the children, who I believe are the greatest sufferers in any war. They are orphaned, abused and killed along with the soldiers and the women. </PARA>
<PARA> If every section of the community were to march in favour of its pet hobby-horse of the moment, a conglomeration of people on Anzac Day would try to tie their hobby-horse in with the horrors of war. We do not want Anzac Day desecrated in any way, and I am fully behind the Minister and the Ordinance. In Tasmania we saw an example of the types of women who tried to disrupt Anzac Day. They were exactly the same types of women and they did it for exactly the same purpose. They disrupted the Anzac Day march in Hobart and created a tremendous scene. They also were arrested, of course. The media picked them up instead of photographing the old soldiers and the young soldiers who were marching down the street outside the town hall. The full account of these women trying to barge into the middle of the march with their placards and their screaming and yelling was something I would not like to see again in Canberra or in any other city of Australia. The Minister has my full support. No doubt I will have an opportunity to debate the Ordinance if it should ever come on for disallowance in this chamber. </PARA>

Fortunately those who know Senator Walters as well as we do know that she is not a reliable witness because of her prejudice against those who support freedom. I have been a member of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee for some considerable time, and I think the whole point of this question is that it is a sorry state of affairs that one man has the ability to make legislation. It is one of the things we have to face up to in the near future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Ryan said she did not think it right that the Minister could legislate in this way. But he is entitled to do so. The Parliament gives him that right. A conference of delegated legislation committees of Commonwealth Parliaments was held in Canberra last year. In a brilliant address Professor Reid pointed out that it is wrong to refer to subordinate legislation, which immediately suggests that there are two kinds of legislation in Australia. In fact, we have delegated legislation. There are not two kinds of legislation. The enactment of an ordinance in the Australian Capital Territory is as enforceable as any law the Parliament may make. We have given the Minister the power to make a law under which someone can be fined $100 without referral to the Parliament. As Professor Reid pointed out, Parliament has only one power under the Constitution, that is the power to make laws. We have given that power to someone else. The only power we have as a parliament is to make laws.</PARA>
<PARA> We recognise the necessity of delegated legislation because it is impossible for parliament to decide every matter. Therefore, we have established a regulations and ordinances committee to examine laws made in this way, report to Parliament and, if necessary, recommend their disallowance. But we have not altered the Acts Interpretation Act or the procedure by which a regulation is enforced so that it shall not apply until the Parliament approves it. An ordinance applies as soon as it is gazetted. One man decides whether it will be an offence to do anything in the Australian Capital Territory. When the Regulations and Ordinances Committee has submitted a report and one House disallows an ordinance it no longer applies. But between sessions of Parliament it can be law for three months. It could gaol half the people in Canberra in that period. Those are the things we have to face. We have to face up to the fact that ordinances should not become operative until the Senate has at least had an opportunity to review them. In England a regulation or ordinance has to receive an affirmative vote in the House of Commons before it passes into law. In Australia we give the Minister the right to make a law. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not one who upholds the sanctity of Anzac Day. Having studied the landing at Gallipoli, whilst I know of the sacrifice made, it has always been to me a commemoration of the mistake of a politician and a military leader. But I recognise that many people in Australia regard the day as sacred. On no account would I interfere with their right to respect that day. Senator Ryan said that there was no intention to disrupt the Anzac Day march. She knows most of the women involved. They did not tell her that they intended to cause a disruption. But we heard the contrary view of Senator Walters that there was an intention to disrupt because 60 women were arrested, some of whom came from Sydney. What a basis for an allegation! Senator Ryan knew that there was no intention. Yet a visitor to Canberra, speaking in support of her Minister, stated that the women are guilty before they go to court because there was once a confrontation in Hobart. Canberra women do not act in the same way as Hobart women act, as we have seen from the remarks of the honourable senator. We must therefore condemn the Minister for his action in this dispute. The arrest, as Senator Evans has pointed out, of anyone performing an action which would cause a disruption, and it being a breach to do anything which, apparently in the opinion of a constable, may create a breach, would not stand up to parliamentary scrutiny. I do not think that Parliament, as the law-making body of the Commonwealth would let such a law, which would infringe on human rights, go unchallenged. </PARA>
<PARA> Apparently 60 women have to face prosecution and may be convicted in accordance with a law which may not have the sanction of Parliament. It could be rejected when it comes before Parliament. It is a law which Parliament has no time for. It is an enforceable law because a Minister, out of touch with the feelings of Parliament, the elected representatives of the people, decided that he should do this. The decision is not right. There should be no enforcement of the law until such time as Parliament has had a look at it and either endorses it or gives a decision on the matter. </PARA>

I wish to place on record that I understand and reverence the significance of Anzac Day insofar as it is a remembrance of the dead.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not intend to comment either on the actual incident which is alleged to have taken place here in Canberra, or on whether the Ordinance is compatible with the ordinary civil liberties of persons in the Australian Capital Territory. Once again I place on record that it was due to my initiative and insistence that the legal counsel to the Senate Regulations and Ordinances Committee is providing as expeditiously as possible, by the Thursday morning meeting time, his legal opinion on whether in fact in his view the Ordinance transgresses the criteria set out by the Committee as guidelines to whether it should recommend to this chamber the disallowance of such an ordinance. It will be for that Committee and then for this chamber to make its judgment. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it would be much better if this matter were discussed in a calm atmosphere-whether it be in the committees of the Senate or in this chamber-rather than in the manner in which Senator Walters has put forward her case. During the course of her remarks she said that some of the women of the same type were arrested in Hobart. If I may say so, she in fact gave support to Senator Evans's case that there was an adequate array of laws available to deal with a disturbance or with a breach of the peace if in fact it occurred. On that score alone, this Ordinance was possibly unnecessary. But further, and more importantly, I think Senator Walters should recognise that in the 1950s an Australian government, in the cold war atmosphere, tried to bring forward an Act which was to be called the Communist Party Dissolution Act, in order to do the very same thing which Senator Walters wants to do, namely, condemn people because they can be recognised as belonging to a type. Not only did the High Court of Australia reject that approach as being beyond the Australian Constitution and the rule of law derived from Britain on which it is based, but also the Australian people, by referendum, rejected that approach. I commend that thought to Senator Walters. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have had five speakers on this matter that arose on Anzac Day of this year. I think what has been said by Senator Tate ought to be taken into account by all of us at this time-a discussion is to be held by the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. I assume from the interest in this matter that it is highly likely that there will be a Senate debate on the Ordinance. Senator Cavanagh drew our attention to the difficulties that are experienced through delegated legislation. He reminded us of the activities of that Committee of the Senate which over a number of years and during his membership of it has brought to our attention from time to time matters which are subjected to disallowance by this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I comment on what Senator Ryan brought before us only to the degree that I heard a broadcast on the Australian Broadcasting Commission yesterday. I think her comment with regard to media misrepresentation is one that again would relate to her knowledge of the situation and perhaps not be able to be accepted without further information by others who had only the information that came from the media. It was interesting that Senator Walters also brought forward the same thought-a highlight was given to this aspect on Anzac Day this year not only in the Australian Capital Territory but also in her State of Tasmania. It seems that incidents of this kind can be given prominence over and above what is the objective of the march, the observance or the particular matter that perhaps ought to have wider attention. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Evans brought forward to us a number of objections that he had to the Ordinance and even with regard to the incident. Again, I would not want to make a comment on those who have been subjected to arrest and who are to be dealt with before a court. I do not think it is encumbent on this place to transgress in any way what ought to be the proper discussion of these matters through the court. The precedents that were sought by Senator Evans from the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) today at Question Time on the issue of enforcement before consideration by Parliament I am sure are in the hands of the Attorney-General. He said that he would investigate this. I am sure that if further information is to be brought forward that will be done in time for consideration by the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Evans also listed a vast array of public order legislation which could be applicable. He incorporated a number of excerpts from Acts that he referred to. They will have the consideration of those who are interested in this matter. He also stressed his concern about the vagueness of the Ordinance and the fact that there may be some trespass on the civil liberties of people. Again I think that that is a matter that will be well covered by the consideration of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. The interest in the subject has raised the whole question of the women who are victims of rape in war. I believe that there are many aspects of war that need to be recalled and remembered on occasions. I heard a comment from the leader of the Returned Services League on this matter. He also said that he believed that all Australians found the question of rape totally abhorrent, whether it is in war or in other circumstances. Perhaps if we are to consider what was the objective of the people who did assemble on this occasion, we would need to consider that question as being an important one, at the same time understanding that Anzac Day in this country is a day of commemoration and is observed with a serious attitude by many thousands of people throughout the country. </PARA>
<PARA> I can only say that I am sure that all the speeches that have been made on this subject will be considered by those who have direct responsibility relating to the matter. I will ensure that the comments which have been made are brought to the attention of the Minister for the Capital Territory (Mr Hodgman), the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) and the Attorney-General. I feel sure that the Senate will have an opportunity for further consideration of this matter, if not in the Senate as a whole, certainly as is scheduled for the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. With those comments, I think that we should await now the outcome of that consideration to see whether further action is contemplated by the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Home Affairs and Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's questions:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The International Referral System (INFOTERRA) of the United Nations Environment Program began operations in 1975 to facilitate international co-operation in environmental information exchange. It is a system through which organisations and individuals requiring environmental information can obtain the names and addresses of appropriate sources.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Home Affairs and Environment (and antecedent Commonwealth departments with responsibility for the environment) have been active in the development of INFOTERRA and in operating the Australian National Focal Point. The work of the Australian National Focal Point has included the following:</PARA>
<PARA> developing the Australian computer system during 1975 and 1976;</PARA>
<PARA> hosting, in 1976, an INFOTERRA Regional Workshop which was attended by representatives from Australian State Government authorities and from New Zealand, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Papua New Guinea;</PARA>
<PARA> incorporating into the system Australian experts as sources of environmental information;</PARA>
<PARA> providing publicity about INFOTERRA to potential users and sources;</PARA>
<PARA> providing information in response to referral requests;</PARA>
<PARA> monitoring and evaluating the practical effectiveness of the system; and</PARA>
<PARA> exchanging development information with INFOTERRA headquarters and other National Focal Points.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Over 500 Australian sources are registered in the INFOTERRA System. Most are from State Government authorities, tertiary education institutions and major research organisations (particularly CSIRO).</PARA>
<PARA> (3) As at September 1980, 111 countries have designated National Focal Points. Seventy two of these countries, together with 13 United Nations agencies, have contributed over 8,200 registered sources, covering a wide range of environmental information.</PARA>
<PARA> The participating countries include the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, most other EEC countries, Japan, Russia, China and other countries in all regions of the world.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister for National Development and Energy, upon notice, on 25 February 1981:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Is the Minister aware of the Canadian Energy Program's Blended Domestic Oil Price Regime established under their Petroleum Administration Act.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Carrick</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The objective of the Canadian National Energy Program with regard to pricing is that effectively domestic refiners will be paying a blended price which is the weighted-average cost of imported oil and the various streams of domestic oil.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The introduction of the policy of import parity pricing for indigenous crude oil was considered very carefully by the Government. It is the only realistic course and will be maintained. Acknowledgment of the true scarcity value of this finite resource will lead to its conservation; substitution of more abundant energy forms; greater exploration and development of conventional crude oil; and the development of synfuels.</PARA>
<PARA> This policy is clearly working in Australia. Consumption of the ten major petroleum products during the twelve months to 31 December 1981 was down 4.4 per cent. This was in sharp contrast to the previous history of growth in consumption. A move to lower price levels would put at risk the significant energy gains already achieved and would put further gains at risk.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator Peter Baume</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The only general concession funded by Telecom Australia is one provided to charitable institutions that have as their main objective the provision of assistance to poor or afflicted persons. This concession, the value of which amounts to about $1.5 million annually, was introduced some fifty years ago; when Telecom was established in 1975 it was considered appropriate that the concession be continued.</PARA>
<PARA> Both the Government and Telecom receive frequent approaches from many worthy community organisations seeking reduced telephone charges. Clearly, difficulties would arise if decisions were made to support some of these and not others. Also, if Telecom were to grant concessions of this nature, the cost of these would, in effect, have to be met by telecommunications users generally. As a matter of principle, it is not reasonable that telephone subscribers should bear the costs of such concessions rather than the general community.</PARA>

<PARA> (iii) More recently arrived groups such as the Turkish and Vietnamese appeared to show a higher degree of dependence upon ethnic radio than did the more established groups such as the Italians and the German speaking community.</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) The survey showed that 75 per cent of the sample had listened to 3EA in the previous seven days, while 69 per cent had listened to 2EA. In Melbourne and Sydney 86 and 88 per cent respectively had favourable comments to make about ethnic radio while 34 and 56 per cent respectively had critical comments.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Supporting parent's benefit is not transferable from one person to another. In order to qualify for supporting parent's benefit a sole parent must have the custody, care and control of a child of whom he or she is the natural parent, or must be a person living apart from his or her spouse or defacto spouse, in which case the child must have been in the person's custody, care and control at the time sole parenthood occurred.</PARA>
<PARA> A grandparent who assumes the custody, care and control of a grandchild would not normally meet the eligibility criteria for supporting parent's benefit. However, he or she may be eligible for some other form of financial assistance.</PARA>
<PARA> Where the grandparent is already in receipt of a social security pension or benefit, an additional payment of up to $10 a week may be made in respect of each child in his or her custody, care and control. If the grandparent is a single, widowed or divorced pensioner, a guardian's allowance of up to $6 a week may also be payable (up to $8 a week if the child is under six or an invalid). In these situations the maximum rate of pension is the same as for a supporting parent's benefit.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Foreign Minister has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The World Bank's 'World Development Report, 1980' states that there are 800 million people living in absolute poverty. Whilst the Report does not compare the effectiveness of the programs of governmental and non-governmental agencies it does recognise that non-governmental organisations (NGOs) can play an important role.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government also recognises the valuable contribution which NGOs can make to the alleviation of world poverty and in recent years has greatly increased its support for Australian NGOs.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1980-81 the Government's program of assistance to NGOs received a 32.5 per cent increase to $2.969 million. In addition the Government decided in September 1980 to grant tax deductibility for donations to 22 of Australia's major NGOs. This concession is a substantial extra Government contribution to the work of NGOs.</PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge that NGOs have a capacity to disburse increased funds and that generally speaking their programs do assist the poorer groups in developing countries. However, the percentage of the foreign aid budget disbursed through NGOs depends very much upon the total aid budget and the competing priorities within the aid program. In 1978 my predecessor Mr Peacock indicated to the Australian Council for Overseas Aid that 1 per cent of Official Development Assistance (ODA) disbursed through NGOs was a useful benchmark at which to aim. I support this view and agree that the disbursement, which is currently at 0.54 per cent of ODA, should move towards this 1 per cent figure as budgetary circumstances permit.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 12 March 1981 (Hansard, page 566) Senator Sibraa asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Does the Australian Government provide food aid to Ethiopia? If so, how is it distributed when it arrives there? Can the Minister assure the Parliament that this aid is reaching the genuinely needy Ethiopian people rather than helping to feed Ethiopian and foreign troops fighting the Eritreans, as is happening with food aid from the European Economic Community.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> In 1979-80 Australia gave 6000 tonnes of wheat to Ethiopia and in 1980-81 Australia will give:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) 10,000 tonnes of wheat from Australia's bilateral contribution to the International Emergency Food Reserve (IEFR) through the World Food Program (WFP);</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) 5,000 tonnes of wheat from Australia's multilateral contribution to the IEFR through WFP;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) 2,200 tonnes of wheat from Australia's bilateral Food Aid Convention contribution through WFP to replace maize given by Ethiopia to Uganda;</PARA>
<PARA> (iv) 10,000 tonnes of wheat from Australia's bilateral Food Aid Convention allocation to the Ethiopian Government. Total 27,200 tonnes.</PARA>
<PARA> Consignments (i)-(iii) will be distributed by the World Food Program for emergency feeding of drought and war-affected persons throughout Ethiopia. WFP also provides food aid in support of government programs to improve agricultural productivity. Consignment (iv) will be consigned to the Ethiopian Relief and Rehabilitation Commission (RRC) which will exchange it for equivalent quantities of maize and distribute it in the regions of Wello, Eritrea, Tigrai, Haraghe, Bale Sidamo and Gamma Goffa to alleviate the shortage of food in drought-affected areas. As a condition of acceptance of the wheat the Ethiopian Government undertakes to provide a full accounting of the gift detailing regions, groups and numbers of recipients.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Development Assistance Bureau has endeavoured to establish that Australian aid is helping the genuinely needy Ethiopian people. The High Commission in Nairobi regularly sends officers to Ethiopia to report on the situation there.</PARA>
<PARA> In the most recent contact, the World Food Program (WFP) representative in Addis Ababa said that the primary responsibility for establishing who would receive the food aid in Ethiopia lay with the Ethiopian Relief and Rehabilitation Commission (RRC) which worked in close conjunction with international relief agencies, voluntary agencies and bilateral donors. In the case of the WFP, it was normal practice for the RRC, in consultation with WFP to nominate intended recipients of assistance and for RRC proposal to be referred to WFP headquarters for authorisation prior to distribution. The actual physical task of distribution was undertaken under the auspices of RRC and they exercised firm control over the process.</PARA>
<PARA> The WFP had encountered only minor difficulties with the Ethiopians over their handling of food aid principally in relation to the lack of transport available for distribution. The Ethiopian Relief and Rehabilitation Commission was scrupulous about keeping proper account of even the smallest amount of food aid. The RRC was quite prepared to have donors peruse their books.</PARA>
<PARA> WFP was asked about allegations that some food aid had been diverted to the Ethiopian Army or to Soviet or Cuban forces. WFP was not aware of any such instances. However, it was added that the allegations were probably based on a misunderstanding of wheat-maize exchange procedures. As wheat was a grain used by city dwellers rather than those in rural areas, donors including WFP, authorised the exchange of wheat received from donors for equal quantities of maize. The wheat was then freely available on the market. As the required exchange had already taken place the WFP did not follow through to investigate who the final purchasers might be but it was indeed possible that on occasions this could be the Ethiopian Army.</PARA>
<PARA> WFP also mentioned that to defray some of their costs WFP and probably other international agencies, sold empty bags, oil tins etc to market merchants. It did not cross out the WFP label as this would be a costly process and would negate the funds gained on sale of these items. However, it was possible that in the course of their use, some of these marked tins might find their way into use by the Army, which would lead to the conclusion that food aid had been deliberately diverted to the Army. During a recent trip to Eritrea, a High Commission officer saw a numer of 'EEC aid' butter oil containers being sold in the Asmara markets. The Army in the region frequently purchases supplies from market merchants and it is quite likely, given the shortage of containers of any variety, that EEC marked bags and tins would have found their way into military establishments and be the source of reports that European Economic Community aid is being used to feed Ethiopian and foreign troops.</PARA>
