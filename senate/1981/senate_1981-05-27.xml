<PARA> To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> Many Australians will be financially disadvantaged by the health changes proposed by the Federal Government, especially the withdrawal of Commonwealth medical benefits for the uninsured, and the introduction of a means test for free public hospital care:</PARA>

<PARA> 1. Note that legislation establishing plant breeders' rights in other countries has had serious adverse effects, namely:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Virtual monopoly control of seed production has passed into the hands of a few large international corporations seeking to profit from the exclusive rights over plant genetic materials created by such legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The varieties of seeds available have been restricted mainly to hybrids which will not reproduce truly and will not grow without the aid of artificial fertilizers and pesticides, thus maximising corporate profits without regard for the interests of growers and consumers.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The genetic diversity of crops has been eroded, rendering them vulnerable to disease and other environmental threats.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Recognise that maintenance of the genetic diversity of plant varieties is crucial to the continued well-being of the Australian nation, and takes all necessary steps to preserve and promote such genetic diversity as a public resource and to prevent exclusive control over plant genetic materials from falling into private hands.</PARA>

Has the number of rural properties involved, particularly in the States of Queensland and Western Australia, risen over the same period from 60 to more than 700?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, but it also relates to the Minister for Social Security and the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs. I note that Senator Young and I visited the Pitjantjatjara communities last week, from which visit strong urgings towards this question came to us. When will the review of the Community Development Employment Program, CDEP, be completed? When will modifications to improve the program be implemented? Given the general success of the CDEP scheme in Aboriginal communities such as Ernabella and Fregon, is the Minister now able to confirm the extension of CDEP to all of the Pitjantjatjara communities, such as Mimili and Amata, and so overcome the anomalies arising from some communities having the scheme whilst neighbouring communities, to the disadvantage of the whole, have remained without it?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2143" SPEAKER="Baume Sen The Hon P.E." NAMEID="ME4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators will be aware that the Community Development Employment Program is a scheme whereby money is made available in bulk to Aboriginal communities as a form of income maintenance, and it is made in lieu of other kinds of welfare payments, for example, unemployment benefit. It can be made only with the agreement of communities involved and it requires them to forgo individual claims for unemployment benefit or other kinds of welfare payments. The scheme is a pilot scheme, as Senator Teague indicated in his question, and it is for this reason that some communities have access to CDEP money and some communities do not. We are not in a position to be able to fund all remote area communities on this basis, and it is, of course, remote area communities for whom it has been basically designed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Because the scheme was a pilot scheme, a review was commenced in 1980. That review has concluded. It revealed some unsatisfactory features of the scheme in terms of its operation. I hope to be able to announce soon measures to overcome many of the problems of income maintenance in remote Aboriginal communities. An expansion of the scheme has been suspended pending the outcome of the review. I understand the urgency which the honourable senator as a senator from South Australia attaches to this. I understand the problems of which he has reminded us in the north western areas of his State. These are problems which are common to, say, the central reserves and to remote communities. I must say that CDEPs have been very well received in some parts of Australia, for example in the Torres Strait. I hope to complete this re-examination as soon as possible.</PARA>

Does the Minister acknowledge that these steps would leave Queensland Aboriginals without any rights to the land that they have been occupying for generations? What steps has the Federal Government taken to ensure the bringing down of legislation that will provide for secure, permanent tenure to Queensland's reserves by Aboriginals who are currently living on them? Will the Government take steps to ensure that such legislation is prepared concurrently with the expected action of the Queensland Government?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not sure that Senator Ryan does Aboriginals in Queensland a service by assuming that certain events will occur. I have been following, as has she and other honourable senators, the Press comment on what might be happening in relation to Queensland's Aboriginal reserves. She will be aware, as I was, of the statement made by the Premier of Queensland during the last election campaign. She will also be aware of his promise to consult widely. Unlike Senator Ryan, I have been able to make contact with the new Minister for Water Resources and Aboriginal and Island Affairs in Queensland, Mr Tomkins. I have been able, in fact, to visit some communities with him and to discuss some of these problems. I was very heartened by a Press release, dated 15 May, by Mr Tomkins, who after all is the responsible Minister in the Queensland Government, in which he gave assurances that no one would be evicted from his home or from a reserve as a result of any move to repeal the Aborigines Act and Torres Strait Islanders Act. The Press release also stated that no matter what happened to the relevant Acts, the reserves would retain their status under the Queensland Lands Act. I would hope that Senator Ryan would welcome that statement as much as would anybody else. She may indicate by interjection that she welcomes it.</PARA></TALK.START>

I am sure that we are all delighted by that particular assurance. Mr Tomkins also stated in his Press release that moves to repeal the Acts were being carried out in a spirit of full co-operation with the elected representatives of the Aboriginal people. I am sure that all honourable senators would want to know that the Queensland Government is acting in co-operation with the Aboriginal people and is taking into account their views. Mr Tomkins said that Aboriginal views would be taken into full account when decisions were made about the relevant legislation. I have with me a copy of the Press statement and it might suit the convenience of the Senate if I now table it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have some particular information which may be of interest to Senator Archer. On 15 August 1980 the Government introduced a new program of assistance for the textile, clothing and footwear industry to operate from 1 January. The new program is not an extension of current interim arrangements determined by the Government in mid-1977. It incorporates many changes to that. The administrative package to give effect to these changes was expected to be finalised before the end of the autumn session. In fact the legislation was passed in this place last week. The Government has established an advisory committee covering this industry to assess the prospective market growth for quota adjustment purposes, to consider the administrative changes which may be necessary to achieve the Government's objective and to monitor and report on the industry situation during the program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The committee recently concluded hearings in Sydney and Melbourne and all interested parties were afforded the opportunity to discuss current developments in the industry sectors.

I also understand that some representations were made to various Ministers concerning this problem. However, I can assure the honourable senator that the Government has it in mind to monitor the new arrangements as closely as possible. The establishment of and the recent round of hearings by the advisory committee are evidence of that determination.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier today in Question Time Senator Teague asked me a question concerning the Community Employment Development Project. The Bamyili problem relates to a Community Development Employment Project. I think the Senate would want to know the facts. They are that the Bamyili council has expended in 11 months the funds which were made available to it for 12 months. The funds were given to it to cover the period to 30 June. This means, as Senator Robertson has said, that until the beginning of July no income is left for the 63 people who were previously entitled to receive income under the scheme. The funds were made available to the appropriate council for management and disbursement. It was due to a failure of proper disbursement that this occurred.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bamyili council has repeatedly been advised that its allocation of funds under the scheme would run out in late May if it continued to spend the funds in excess of the amount provided for each fortnight's salaries. The council was told that it was pursuing a road that would lead to that result. The Council ignored this advice. It continued to make fortnightly payments well in excess of the agreed entitlements under the scheme. The simple facts of the matter are that the yearly allocations have been expended in 11 months. Equally clearly, this concerns the Government. Officers from the Department of Social Security and from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs are examining the problem to see what can be done. We are hoping that something can be done, but the responsibility for the present crisis clearly rests with the council, which chose not to accept the warning about overexpenditure which my officers have been giving it for a considerable period.</PARA>

However, assuming that what he has said is correct and that such a survey was undertaken or is being undertaken, I can give an unequivocal guarantee that this Government would not contemplate a survey of this nature in Australia. Perhaps in this context I ought to remind the Senate that under the Census and Statistics Act the Australian Statistician is required to table in both Houses each new proposal for the collection of information for statistical purposes by the Australian Bureau of Statistics before its implementation, unless the proposal for the collection of information is on a voluntary basis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Perhaps this may be an appropriate opportunity, in view of the other comments of Senator Mason, to clarify some aspects of the recent amendments to the Census and Statistics Act. The major purposes of the recent amendments were to tighten up the secrecy provisions of the Census and Statistics Act and to upgrade the penalties under that Act. The particular provision to which Senator Mason alludes relates to the offence of knowingly providing false information to the ABS. A reading of the Act will show that the penalty will apply only where there is a deliberate attempt to mislead by providing false information. The provision relates to all statistical collections conducted by the ABS. This means that the penalty is designed to cover not only returns by individuals by also those by businesses and organisations in this country. It should be clearly understood that the new penalty is a maximum one, and in the event of a successful prosecution a magistrate would decide on the appropriate penalty having regard to the circumstances of the case.

The media-I refer in particular to last night's Nationwide program on the Australian Broadcasting Commission and articles in the Sydney Sun and Sydney Morning Herald-have been asserting that a large segment of the pensioner population will face greatly increased costs as a result of the new health insurance arrangements. As a result of this publicity, there is no doubt that there are many worried pensioners in Australia. Will the Minister give the facts on this situation particularly those relating to pensioners and also to other low income people who do not have the pensioner health benefit card?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night I saw a little of the television coverage which was given to an interview with elderly people who expressed concern about the changes. I have little doubt that some of the reports of changes will cause concern to people who are nervous of change and concerned about their position. All pensioner health benefit card holders will remain in exactly the same position as they were. Their position will not be altered, so they have nothing to be concerned about. The only concern that pensioners need have is that there is a change to the hospitals system and that change involves fees being charged to those people who do not qualify under an income test or who are not holders of a pensioner health benefit card. There will be several hundred thousand pensioners who fit into that category. In other words, those pensioners who do not have a pensioner health benefit card will be outside the income limits for being treated as disadvantaged under the new health scheme and will have the responsibility for their own hospital and medical costs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Among those pensioners, of which there are several hundred thousand, there is of course a fair range of incomes. All of the people about whom we are talking have incomes well in excess of the pension. A single pensioner would need an income of $40 above the pension and a married pensioner would need an income of $68 above the pension before being in this situation. So it is only people in that group who will have to look to insurance if they wish to get coverage for their hospital costs. A very significant proportion of those pensioners are already carrying health insurance and a good number are people who qualify for a pension only because there is no income test for people over the age of 70 and who are in receipt of substantial incomes. So all of those pensioners who have chosen to insure to date under the existing arrangements are people who now will be financially better off under the health arrangements because they are also taxpayers. Therefore they will be entitled, wholly or in part, to a tax rebate on the insurance payments that they are already making. Recently the Opposition spokesman on social security matters mentioned in a statement that a very large group of pensioners still carry health insurance. That significant group of pensioners will, in the main, be financially better off under these new arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA> It is very easy to forget that until a few weeks ago there were frequent complaints about the existing disadvantaged status medical scheme. I received representations which suggested that a situation in which it was left to the judgment of doctors as to whether a person was to be regarded as disadvantaged was one which left disadvantaged people in a position in which the judgments would vary from doctor to doctor, there could be no certainty and indeed there would be cases of injustice. The Government has therefore moved away from that situation of uncertainty. It has provided not only for the pensioners but also for other people in the community on low incomes and it has provided a system by which people will be able to establish with certainty their entitlement to free hospital and medical care.</PARA>
<PARA> I have a table prepared by my Department which may be of assistance. Subject to the practicality of its incorporation, I seek leave to incorporate it in Hansard. It sets out the various levels of pensioners and others who are entitled to medical treatment under the new system. I seek leave to incorporate the table in Hansard.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question to the Attorney-General concerns recent changes to the copyright law which are causing a great deal of confusion in educational and other circles at the moment. In view of the fact that when the current amending legislation, the Copyright Amendment Act 1980, takes effect, apparently in July, there will be as many as five alternative statutory procedures applicable to photocopying in schools and libraries, does the Attorney propose to issue an explanatory brochure to enable teachers and librarians to understand and comply with this legislation? Is it true that the only attempt so far to inform those affected has been the printing-at a cost the Attorney might care to tell us about at some stage-of 15,000 extra copies of the Copyright Amendment Act itself, which is a 37-page document comprehensible only to someone with considerable experience in reading statutes and, as such, of course quite incomprehensible to the vast majority of teachers and librarians? On the same subject, I further ask the Attorney: Is it the case that the existing Copyright Act, quite independently of the new amendments to it, does prohibit the videotaping of television programs, whether educational or otherwise, unless the permission of the copyright owner has been obtained? If so, and since the practice of taping educational television programs is now so widespread and has prompted schools and libraries all over the country to purchase videotape equipment at large cost, why was the opportunity provided by the Copyright Amendment Act not used to remove this anomaly in the law? Are there any plans to legislate for its removal?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Evans has asked two quite distinct questions. The first one concerns the amendments to the Copyright Act which were passed by this Parliament in September last year and are to come into force on 1 July this year. Certainly the provisions are rather detailed with a lot of technical aspects to them. They deal with photocopying in educational institutions. The Senate no doubt will be familiar with the long consideration that was given to this question both outside the Parliament and in the long process of the legislation through Parliament. It started with the report of the Franki committee which made the recommendations some years ago. The general principles here were very well known to the educational institutions concerned. Indeed, I am sure all honourable senators will have had voluminous correspondence from both sides-the copyright owners on the one hand and the educational institutions on the other hand-about this compromise. In 1979 I introduced a package which one might say was a rather fragile consensus between these two opposing interests. It lay on the table of the Parliament for nearly 12 months, I think. As I said, it was finally passed in September last year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Because of the technical nature of the legislation we decided not to bring it into operation until 1 July this year, another period of nine months. I do not say that every librarian and every school teacher would understand it-I would not expect them to-but I would have thought that the educational institutions which are getting a real benefit out of this would have made some effort to explain it to their librarians and to their teachers.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Evans" NAMEID="VD4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;You know perfectly well that it is incomprehensible legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not incomprehensible to the people who can get advice about it, who undoubtedly have got advice about it and who have written voluminous correspondence to members of parliament, including senators, about it. They make it quite clear in that correspondence that they understand a great deal about it. That is the background to the present situation. I have no doubt that when it comes into operation people will have difficulties in learning to operate the system, but I do not think those difficulties will be insuperable. These people will be able, surely, to get some help from the educational institutions which, as I said, must understand it. If they do not understand it, they could get legal advice about it. I am sure that they would have done so. I certainly am concerned about a situation in which numbers of people are required to give effect to laws which are technical and complicated and which they themselves cannot be expected to understand. They may need help and direction, but I question why the Government should be expected to go to a great deal of expense to provide that sort of detail when the educational institutions for which these people work could well take on that responsibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the second part of the question which Senator Evans raised, it is a very difficult and very sensitive issue indeed, that is, the question of copyright in audio and visual material. It is not confined to this one educational area that Senator Evans mentioned. It is a very wide and difficult subject. It involves the question of whether people should be able to copy and what is to be done. It constitutes a breach of copyright in most cases when people tape music on the radio or from tapes, and so on. It is a very sensitive and difficult subject which Senator Evans raised. It cannot be dealt with just in the one simple way in which he suggested. That is the reason nothing was done about it in the legislation which already has had a very long period of gestation in the Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA> I understand that educational institutions are compiling reports on these problems and that they will be submitted to the Government in due course. In addition, a non-government specialist review committee was established in 1978 to consider this question. That report was submitted only in February of this year. So there is already one report by a non-government committee in relation to this issue. The educational institutions are themselves still in the process of reporting on the matter. Certainly, the officers of my Department have been studying the problem for some time. I hope that some way of resolving this issue will be found. Probably amendments to the Copyright Act will be brought down, but I can assure all honourable senators who have any enthusiasm about the matter that it presents the same conflict as does photocopying. There are two diametrically opposed views and some method of reconciling them in a way which reflects a wide consensus must be found. It is of no use sloughing this off as a joke; it is a very difficult and serious subject. I hope that honourable senators opposite will take a more serious attitude to it than they have evinced in the last few minutes.</PARA>

Having in mind the Government's expressed concern over the continuing low levels of Aboriginal health in Australia, despite heavy funding over the years and the improvement in infant mortality rates such as that being experienced in the Northern Territory, is it the intention of the Government to liaise with State and Territory governments at the grass-roots level in order to emphasise training of Aboriginal health workers by increasing staff levels and funding, to fund only those health organisations that have proven their worth and transfer funding from those with poor track records, increase the availability of specialists to provide continuous field service in such areas as ophthalmology, pediatrics and other specialised fields, and ensure recognition of the principle that improved environmental conditions, such as increased housing and sanitation provision, are essential to improved Aboriginal health?</PARA></TALK.START>

We will follow up the trachoma program effectively. We will develop programs in respect of other endemic diseases among Aboriginals. Most importantly-and this relates to the honourable senator's question-we will require significant Aboriginal involvement in the planning, design, control, management and evaluation of health programs for Aboriginals at all levels.

The Primary Industry Bank of Australia has a shareholding divided equally among the six major trading banks, a consortium of four State banks and the Commonwealth of Australia. As an incorporated enterprise with majority private sector ownership, it is not subject to the Loan Council.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The committee for the Review of Commonwealth Functions looked at a number of matters. Information was given to us on this aspect. I do not recall that statistical evidence concerning the degree of casualisation of work that was mentioned by Senator Harradine was put before us, nor do I recall that we considered that what was mentioned by Senator Harradine would be the outcome of the deregulation of shop trading hours. A number of other factors were considered. One further point made in the question by Senator Harradine concerned the International Labour Organisation's conclusions on some of these matters. As far as I am concerned this matter was not brought before the committee that was looking at this question, and I do not recall any great discussion on the ILO. I can fairly say that the matter of some contravention of an ILO decision or position on this matter was not taken into account or discussed by the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some matters raised in the question by Senator Harradine require information. I undertake to provide to him whatever information on the subject I am able to provide. A number of factors were taken into account by the committee when it looked at the question of deregulation of shopping hours. It appeared to be a decision that would be in line with the deregulation that we were trying to invoke in many areas of government activity. However, I have noted the matters raised in the question and I will see what further comments can be provided.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Harradine states in his supplementary question that employment was not taken into account. I do not wish it to be inferred that that was what I said. The original question related to the extent of the casualisation of work and other specifics with regard to International Labour Organisation decisions and conclusions. The factors that were taken into account were, in general, the freeing of shop trading hours in the Australian Capital Territory and a number of decisions that had as the basis of their conclusion the deregulation by government of commercial activity. The employment patterns in the Capital Territory and throughout Australia are always taken into account when we make decisions that would affect them. Perhaps it ought to be said that in this most recent month we were very pleased to see an increase in full time employment from the figures that related to March this year. There was a further improvement in April. There is an increase in full time employment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank members of the Australia Labor Party for supporting the Australian Democrats in submitting this matter of public importance to the Senate today. Philosophically, it stems from a stance recently underlined by the Liberal and National Country parties that they would transfer activities in this country to private enterprise at any cost. I wish to query today whether it is wise to transfer health care to private enterprise to the extent the present Government is allowing. At what cost will that transfer be done? The Democrats are most concerned about the whole question of the financial involvement of practising doctors in private hospitals. It raises the obvious question of a conflict of interest. Is it ethical for doctors to own private hospitals? One could equally well ask: Is it ethical for doctors to own shares in undertaking businesses or mortuaries, is it ethical for doctors to own a pharmacy, is it ethical for an eye doctor to have shares in spectacle manufacturing companies? In all these areas a conflict of interest is obvious, yet we as a society allow doctors to have an increasing interest in private hospitals. We would have thought doctors should always declare their pecuniary interest before arranging to admit any patient to a private hospital.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are extremely concerned about the increasing level of American and multinational ownership of Australian private hospitals. I find it rather sickening-I do not mean to make a pun-that we have multinationals making money out of the sick, dying and frail members of our community. It is an insidious and sinister development which, I must say, I was disappointed to see was not even mentioned in the recent Jamison Report. The fact is that a great number of these hospitals are in Australia now. The four largest investor-owned hospital companies listed on the United States stock exchanges are now established in Australia. They are: Hospital Affiliates International Incorporated, Hospital Corporation of America Incorporated-HCA-Humana Incorporated and American Medical International Incorporated. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall deal with each of the four companies very briefly. Humana has been registered in New South Wales since April 1976 but as yet does not appear to have bought or built hospitals here. At a health conference in Dallas, Texas, in 1975 a group of Australian doctors and investors approached representatives of the giant Hospital Corporation of America Incorporated about coming to Australia. In September 1977 a company with the innocuous title Comserv (No. 409) Pty Ltd was incorporated in New South Wales. Six months later it changed its name to Hospital Corporation of Australia Pty Ltd and by August 1978 it was registered in all Australian States. By June 1978 only one of the company's directors was an Australian, the other four being executive officers and or directors of the parent American company, the giant Hospital Corporation of America Incorporated. </PARA>
<PARA> One asks: Why would such a giant multinational come to Australia and have itself registered with the innocuous title of Comserv? I questioned senior officials of HCA as to why they entered Australia under the name of Comserv (No. 409). The feeble answers that I got were 'solicitors advice' or 'to establish a presence in the country'. Of course the true answer is that they wanted to enter Australia by stealth so that their presence would not be noticed and they could disguise the true nature of its interests. If Hospital Corporation of America had nothing to hide why did it not come to Australia with a clean deck and say: 'We are Hospital Corporation Australia. We will register as Hospital Corporation Australia Pty Ltd.' But it did not do this; it registered as Comserv. I will give other examples in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA> In July 1978 HCA took over the Baulkham Hills Private Hospital Ltd of Sydney for $5m. This purchase had the ever willing consent of the Foreign Investment Review Board, a group whose activities I daily question more and more. The company now owns at least five hospitals in New South Wales, two in South Australia, two in Victoria and one in Queensland. Another multinational business which owns several Australian hospitals is Hospital Affiliates International Inc.-HAI-which is a subsidiary of the giant insurance company of North America INA Corporation. Hospital Affiliates of Australia Pty Ltd was incorporated in New South Wales in February 1979. In March 1979 HAA, again with ready FIRB approval, acquired a 97 per cent controlling interest in the Christo Road Private Hospital Pty Ltd of Newcastle. HAA has four hospitals, all in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> The American Medical International Inc. is another company which entered Australia under a different name. In June 1978 Maxmint Pty Ltd was incorporated in Victoria. One could not be blamed for assuming that Maxmint was a company engaged in manufacturing lollypops or some such thing. Later the same month, after its incorporation as Maxmint Pty Ltd, its name was changed to American Medical International (Australia) Pty Ltd-AMI. The company successfully acquired two Victorian hospitals. I am not talking about penny anti-groups; I am talking about giant multinationals which have millions or billions of dollars at their disposal and which use the device of registering in Australia under nom de plumes. Why have these companies decided to come to Australia? Health care in America, as in Australia, is an enormously costly business. America's medical care costs account for nearly 10 per cent of its gross national product, and hospitals are responsible for 45 per cent of that expenditure. In Australia health care accounts for eight per cent of our national income, and nearly 60 per cent of that health expenditure is on hospitals. Recently the United States Government introduced regulations which have the effect of restricting unnecessary spending, particularly in the private hospital area. Therefore, private hospitals in America have been driven to seek greener pastures. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr Thomas F. Frist Junior, President and Chief Operating Officer of Hospitals Corporation of America, has stated that these government regulations are his company's greatest concern. HCA's expansion into Australia is part of a plan to develop foreign markets in case domestic controls severely limit the home hospital operations. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> It's important for us, as a basic strategy, to start building beach-heads in the international market with company-owned facilities. If . . . a moratorium were put on building hospitals in this country, we could shift the commitment of our money, cash flow and re-investment from the United States to other areas. </PARA>
<PARA>That quote is from Modern Health Care of August 1978. Royce M. Diener, a previous President of AMI has stated in Modern Health Care of February 1979 that international operations are far more profitable than domestic operations. What is wrong with us in this country? What sort of people do we have on the Foreign Investment Review Board? What is wrong with members of this Parliament who allow billion dollar multinationals in the health sphere blatently to make that kind of remark. They say: 'Profits are running down in the United States. Let us go to Australia and skim the cream off there'. They are not talking about manufacturing motor cars or selling tractors. They are talking about looking after the sick, terminally ill and frail aged at taxpayers' expense. One wonders why we stand by and take it. These companies cause grave concern for a number of reasons. Dr J. Barrie Morely, a member of the Australian Medical Association who wrote 'Foreign Interests in Australian Health Services', states:</PARA>
<PARA> The high degree of profit demanded by and of these companies could have seriously aggravating effects on the major financial problems already in our Australian hospital and health care systems. </PARA>
<PARA> In order to continue to attract investor support, these companies must keep showing 15-16 per cent capital return after tax, depreciation etc. Stock exchange listings are watched by the professional analysts, and should they report adversely against a company a critical consequence is that the company immediately suffers a weakening of its line of credit. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, these corporations, like any other private enterprise companies, are profit motivated. The medical services which they provide tend to be rendered for the ultimate purpose of raising revenue rather than out of a central concern for the patient's needs. It is a long cry from the old fashioned view that a hospital existed to care for the needy, the sick and the frail. It is now big business and multinationals are moving into Australia. We are doing nothing to stop them. Some American private hospitals actually advertise for patients. They have demeaned the profession of nursing and hospital administration to that extent. For example, a Nevada hospital offers its customers-I use its term not mine-the chance to win a free $4,000 cruise if they come to the hospital to have an ingrown toenail looked at. This reduces hospital care to the level of a cheap raffle. The United States News and World Report of 5 March 1979 refers to an HCA officer as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Refiguring the cost report of a hospital . . . in order to bring in an additional $100,000 through sophisiticated cost-accounting techniques. </PARA>
<PARA>Companies such as HCA often have interests in a number of different areas of medicine-for example, health insurance, medical management and rehabilitation. This vertical integration of health services obviously carries with it the inherent danger of self-referral, that is, the referral of a patient by one section of a medical conglomerate to another. The danger of over-prescription of treatment goes hand in hand with this as well. </PARA>
<PARA> American hospital companies are also often accused of cream skimming, concentrating on well insured patients who have relatively simple complaints to the exclusion of poorer people who have complicated conditions. I stress an important point. Because these multinational companies attract government subsidies for health services and health fund payments, their investors will ultimately take profits directly from Australia's taxpayers' funds. It seems to be an incongruity that as I stand in the Senate today, proving that multinationals are making massive profits-16 to 17 per cent after tax-on Australia's sick, at taxpayers' expense, the public hospital system in the six States and two Territories is crying out to this Government for more funds to carry on and offer some form of hospitalisation to the poor and needy. </PARA>
<PARA> The indifference of the Foreign Investment Review Board to the influx of HCA and others, to the extent that 7.7 per cent of acute care beds in Australian private hospitals are now controlled by American corporations, is apparent. I propose to quote again from the 1980 FIRB report which makes this statement almost gleefully. Some of my remarks, which were quoted this week, apparently hurt some feelings when I called this group of people who run the FIRB as bordering on un-Australian in their attitude. I do not resile from that description. They are bordering on being un-Australian in their attitude when they allow foreigners to come into this country and to own our motor vehicle industry, our oil refineries, 36 per cent of our manufacturing industry, 56 per cent of all mining, 51 per cent of advertising. The sickening list goes on. The 1980 report of the FIRB states:</PARA>
<PARA> In total, 19 applications by United States firms to invest in private hospitals in Australia have been approved in terms of the foreign investment policy. </PARA>
<PARA>It is thought that none, or at most one, of the applications was refused. The report continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Foreign investment approvals in this industry were expected to lead to investment of $45m . . . The companies concerned are . . . required to admit a minimum of 35 per cent local equity into their Australian operations within three years. </PARA>
<PARA>Here is a group of Australians who comprise the FIRB, charged by the Government to protect Australian industry, to prevent takeovers by foreign based companies, gleefully gloating that in one year 19 applications worth $45m-American money-have been approved to take over our private hospitals. For goodness sake, is not this the one thing that we have the wit and the ability to do on our own? Where is the expertise? Where is the new know-how? Where is the technology that these American multinationals are bringing into this country that we did not know about? What is the motive behind their coming into this country? The answer is to maximise their profits because their profitability is running down in the United States. Not only are we not stopping them from coming into Australia but also we have a Government agency like the FIRB gloating that it has been able to allow these corporations into Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1978 a deed of equitable mortgage for $18m was concluded between the Hospital Corporation of Australia and the Australian European Finance Corporation. I say this merely for the purpose of putting it in the record. I believe it ought to be put on the record. I state categorically that in so doing I make absolutely no reflection on the Chairman of the FIRB, Sir Bede Callaghan. I have checked what I am about to say to be a fact and I believe it ought to be placed on the record. I invite honourable senators to note carefully the dates. In August 1978 a deed of equitable mortgage for $18m was concluded between the Hospital Corporation of Australia-that is multi- national foreign owned-and the Australian European Finance Corporation. This loan was of great importance in helping HCA to become established in this country. The AEFC is 77 per cent owned by foreign multinational banks. I simply note for the record that between 1970 and 1976 the Chairman of AEFC was Sir Bede Callaghan, the current Chairman of the FIRB. I repeat so that I am not misunderstood that I make no reflection on Sir Bede Callaghan. I do believe, because of the--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3V4">Senator CHIPP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am putting it on the record so that the people who might be concerned about the massive inrush of foreign corporations being allowed to come into this country to take over hospitals will know the background to the circumstances of that. It was a condition of the FIRB that HC Australia would divest 35 per cent of its equity shareholdings to Australian shareholders by September 1981. However, it now seems that HCA is seeking a two year postponement from the FIRB owing to the present loss situation of HCA, which I am told is over $7m all told and which HCA fears would make the corporation unattractive to Australian shareholders. How firmly is the FIRB prepared to stick to its original guidelines, or will it cave in again to this massive multinational? It will be interesting to see if it does cave in.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must say that on the boards of HCA and other corporations associated with these multinationals there are some very distinguished Australians. I will not name them. I make no reflection on them whatsoever. But what I do say is that it is a credit and a compliment to the way in which the multinationals which are invading Australia and taking over our enterprises work. They go out of their way to select distinguished Australians with impeccable records and ask them to sit on their boards. The answer to this lies with the Federal Government. When is it going to tighten up the FIRB guidelines? When is it going to stop favouring the expansion of private hospital development at the expense of public hospitals? When is it going to give some encouragement to those magnificent people who work in charitable organisations, those in the philanthropic field-the Salvation Army, the Catholic church, the Protestant church and the freemasons who do magnificent work in the hospital field? Why not give them some encouragement in their efforts to care for the aged, the feeble and the sick? I give notice that the Australian Democrats are far from happy about the activities of the FIRB and most dissatisfied at the massive inrush of multinationals in the private hospital business in Australia. I give notice that at an appropriate time when the opportunity is available-it is fast drawing near-we will be asking the Senate to appoint a committee to inquire into this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is discussing a matter of public importance which has been proposed by Senator Chipp. The subject really has three arguments to it. Looking at the terms of the letter which the honourable senator sent to Mr President to start this matter running, the first argument of the honourable senator is the claim that there is incentive given by the Government to private hospital investment. The honourable senator thinks this is a matter of public importance. Secondly, the honourable senator refers to the excessive entry of overseas corporations into the private hospital field. Thirdly, he refers to the need for a Senate inquiry into foreign and Australian ownership of private hospitals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe this matter is worthy of consideration by the Senate and that each of the matters raised by Senator Chipp should be dealt with seriatim and should be argued because the provision of proper, decent hospital care for Australians is what we are on about. The provision of medical services which people can use is what we are concerned with. I must say that I could not quite understand the point Senator Chipp was trying to make in bringing in Sir Bede Callaghan's name in terms of his association with some commercial organisation. I will read the Hansard report of his speech. I hope in fact the honourable senator was correct when he said that he was not in any way trying to impugn a very eminent Australian in very many areas. </PARA>
<PARA> I will put some propositions to the Senate in relation to this matter. The first is that private hospitals, as opposed to public hospitals, are necessary for Australia today. They are necessary in the Australian health system. Secondly, private hospitals are desirable, certainly with public hospitals, so that we can get a proper mix and people will have a choice. Thirdly, private hospitals need to be supervised for the benefit of the public they serve. They need to be supervised in terms of their establishment, in terms of their operation, in terms of their numbers, in terms of their situation and in terms of their practices. The fourth proposition is that foreign investment in any area requires control, and that control should be present in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> I start by suggesting that private hospitals are a desirable, a necessary and a useful part of our hospitals system. Senator Chipp, in the concluding stages of his speech, made a plea on behalf of public hospital development as opposed to private hospital development. He was slightly prejorative about private hospitals as an entity. I would say he is quite incorrect in that assessment. Private hospitals complement the public hospitals system. They often provide services to developing areas of Australia. For example, in my own city of Sydney in the rapidly expanding suburbs they provide the services first; the public hospitals only come along later to provide them. Private hospitals are able to do so because they are more flexible, they can be more quickly established and they can alter their situation to meet changing needs. Indeed it is in some of the growing areas that the private hospitals have emerged. Senator Chipp referred to the Baulkham Hills Private Hospital. That is a fine example of a hospital which was situated in an area where there was no nearby public hospital operating, and where the private hospital filled a vacuum. </PARA>
<PARA> It is true to say that the expertise which private hospitals bring is in particularly successful management practices and often flexibility in that they can follow need rapidly and are more sensitive to change than is the public hospital system. I am not denigrating the public hospital system. For 20 years, in a professional sense, I worked within the public hospital system in New South Wales. I have only the warmest memories and associations with the public hospital system, but I would not in any way imagine that we could operate a health system in Australia today without the private hospital sector. We could not operate the health system without our private hospitals. We simply would not have the capacity. The Jamison Commission of Inquiry into the Efficiency and Administration of Hospitals recognised the value of private hospitals. At paragraph 52 on page 12 of its report it states:</PARA>
<PARA> Moves to develop practical cooperative service provision ventures between particular private and public hospitals should be encouraged. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope that the Australian Democrats, in their pursuit of the public interest, would endorse that recommendation of the Jamison committee. The report goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> While they may not be cheaper overall, they may lead to more efficient use of resources and can do no harm, provided there is prior negotiation of terms involving all parties including the appropriate State health authorities. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that is just what occurs. Senator Chipp has asserted that the number of private hospital beds and private hospital capacity are increasing rapidly. That is an easily testable assertion of fact. Is the number of private hospital beds increasing rapidly? Indeed it is interesting if we examine the occupancy figures of private hospital beds in Australia. I make one distinction here. Although figures are boring, these figures are instructive. There are two areas of private bed provision in Australia. The first area is private beds within private hospitals, and the second is private beds within public hospitals. These facts which I will now give from the Department of Health bed days table indicate quite clearly a trend which I think Senator Chipp and all honourable senators would find quite disturbing. They show that there have been fewer bed days occupied in Australian private hospitals over the last five years. If one looks at the figures for 1976, 1979-80 and the estimated figures for this year one will find that compared with 1975-76 there are approximately-my arithmetic, I hope, is correct-240,000 fewer occupied bed days now. The number of bed days occupied in Australian private hospitals has actually been reducing over the last five years. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, if one examines what is happening in the public hospital sector in relation to its private beds, one discovers the reverse trend. In fact 700,000 more private bed days were occupied in the public hospital sector. I ask Senator Chipp: Whose vested interest is served by that? Whose vested interest is served by the occupancy of private beds in public hospitals? A new class of elite stands to benefit from that increasing trend. If there is any increasing occupancy of private beds in Australia it is because more private beds are being provided in the public hospital system. It has nothing at all to do with the private hospitals to which Senator Chipp has addressed himself today. </PARA>
<PARA> It might be worth putting into some kind of perspective the situation in terms of foreign owned hospital beds, private hospital beds and the number of hospital beds generally. There are in Australia about 95,000 hospital beds. Of these about 1,500 are foreign owned. Senator Chipp was talking about massive investment and massive diversion and a great national problem. There are 1,500 beds out of 95,000; that is the number of foreign owned beds in this country. The onus is on Senator Chipp, in the terms of his own letter, to establish what is excessive. I suspect that his view and the view of the speaker who will follow me is that even one foreign owned bed is excessive. I say that is blatantly nonsensical. We require the expertise of some of these people who manage the largest hospital organisations in the world. For example, they can operate their hospital beds at a fraction of the cost that our State systems can. They operate their beds cheaper and their turnover time is quicker. I shall make some of these points later. </PARA>
<PARA> I said there are 1,500 foreign owned beds. In fact 20,000 beds, of the 95,000 beds in Australia are in private hospitals. Senator Chipp has not really established as his first point that foreign ownership of private hospital beds is excessive. In fact he did not produce the figures. I submit that 1,500 foreign owned beds out of 20,000 private hospital beds or 1,500 foreign owned hospital beds out of a total of 95,000 hospital beds in Australia is a very small number and certainly should have been recognised as such. In Australia we have a balance between the public and private sectors. Indeed we have to look at the development of the private hospital sector in that context. The position relating to the companies-I am not sure that Senator Chipp set this out completely-is that Hospital Corporation Australia Pty Ltd has 1,000 of those beds. It has 11 hospitals with 1,000 beds. Hospital Affiliates of Australia Pty Ltd had five hospitals with 363 beds. American Medical International (Australia) Pty Ltd has two hospitals with 194 beds. This gives a total of approximately over 1,500 beds in 18 hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA> No private hospital can be established or can operate in Australia unless it satisfies the existing foreign investment policy. That foreign investment policy, as Senator Chipp has acknowledged, is subject to review by the Foreign Investment Review Board, under the chairmanship of a very eminent Australian to whom he referred. Under existing foreign investment policy overseas firms are free to establish new businesses in the health care and hospital industry provided that new investment is less than $5m. If it is less than $5m they are not required to seek FIRB approval. But the fact is that, as a matter of voluntary compliance, the companies coming in to buy private hospitals, even though their investments were less than $5m, on each occasion sought FIRB approval even though they were not required so to do under the rules as they exist. </PARA>
<PARA> The businesses are able to expand once they are established. To date, all new investments in private hospitals in Australia have been subject to scrutiny and approval because the companies involved have co-operated. The level of foreign ownership and control of private hospitals in Australia is low. Each proposal is examined separately by the Government and proposals are approved only if it is thought they meet the general requirements of being beneficial to the Australian community. The Commonwealth has no role in determining whether those hospitals will be licensed in any State or whether approval will be obtained for that hospital to operate in a certain situation. That is a matter for each sovereign State government. These hospitals, owned by Hospital Corporation Australia Pty Ltd, AMI and Hospital Affiliates, have opened after having obtained approval from the appropriate State government. I think it should be understood that each one of these companies has the imprimatur of a State government which has determined that the hospital has an appropriate role to play in the appropriate location. </PARA>
<PARA> The companies have not in fact constructed hospitals; they have bought existing hospitals. They have not added to the stock. I find difficult to understand the xenophobic hatred of honourable senators opposite for these hospitals. Are they saying that it is better to have an untrained businessman representing an Australian company operating a hospital than it is to have a trained businessman who may represent an international company whose expertise is in managing hospitals? No matter who owns a hospital it will be necessary for him to obey all the rules, regulations and conditions that apply to the operation of hospitals in Australia generally and in any State in particular. There is no way that HCA could come in on a favoured basis and operate its hospitals in a less than normal way. As at 30 June last there were in Australia just under 340 private hospitals. We are talking about some 18 foreign-owned hospitals, about which so much concern has been expressed. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw to the attention of the Senate the fact that on 4 March of this year there appeared at page 536 of the Senate Hansard an answer to a question on notice by Senator O'Byrne on this subject. The answer sets out each of the hospitals owned in Australia by foreign companies, also certain other information concerning private hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chipp has had some rather harsh things to say about Hospital Corporation Australia Pty Ltd and about foreign companies. However, they, for their part, have tried to co-operate with the honourable senator and have been trying to communicate with him, to make known the facts about the operations and about where they stand. For example, I have before me a letter of 22 May written by Mr T. R. Russell, Chairman, Board of Advice of Hospital Corporation Australia Pty Ltd, addressed to Senator D. L. Chipp. In the letter, which is only a page and a quarter in length, Mr Russell makes several points about what HCA is doing and is not doing. The first is that foreign-owned companies do not enjoy unrestrained entry into the Australian hospital industry; that they have to secure the approval of the Foreign Investment Review Board. That fact has emerged during the debate. He also makes the point that at present foreign companies own no more than 7.7 per cent of private hospital beds in Australia, and that that represents 1.6 per cent of total hospital beds. That fact also has emerged during the debate. A further point made is that HCA and the other companies, far from coming to Australia to cream off profits or to act as profiteers, have been operating at a loss. Mr Russell states:</PARA>
<PARA> Far from making massive profits, HCA, and no doubt other private hospitals, have been operating at a loss in recent years. Even insured persons have been so heavily subsidised by the Australian taxpayer in public hospitals that it has paid them to choose treatment in these hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Russell then gives a figure which shows the extent of that loss. Senator Chipp had this information. He knows that these companies have been operating at a loss, and he knows the extent of that loss. The writer makes it clear that the loss for 1980, as stated in an earlier letter, was $3,045,000; that the total loss since incorporation in Australia has been over $7.25m. Whatever arguments people may put up, I hope that they will not try to sell the argument that HCA is taking enormous profits out of Australia, that it is creaming off Australian profits. In fact, it is losing money. It may assist the Senate if I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard this letter, which is germane to the argument. </PARA>

<PARA> The letter read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>HOSPITAL CORPORATION AUSTRALIA PTY LTD</PARA>
<PARA>22 May 1981</PARA>
<PARA>Senator the Hon. D. L. Chipp,</PARA>
<PARA>Leader of the Australian Democrats,</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House,</PARA>
<PARA>Canberra, A.C.T. 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator Chipp,</PARA>
<PARA> I am writing briefly to follow up the talks which you kindly arranged between Mr Max Edwards of your office and Sir David Hay and Mr Tom Usher of Hospital Corporation Australia on Friday last, 15 May 1981. I do so against the background of statements attributed to you in reports of your press conference at Burwood State College on 10 May. I would ask that in your proposed statement in the Senate you might keep in mind the following points:</PARA>
<PARA> That foreign owned companies do not enjoy unrestrained entry into the Australian hospital industry. They have to secure the approval of the FIRB which insists on Australianisation of staff and direction, and also on a suitable proportion of Australian equity, and lays down a timetable for these objectives to be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA> In the health field, foreign owned private hospitals, like locally owned private hospitals, can only operate under licence from the State health authorities. This affects the size, location, and type of service offered. Private hospitals would for instance, be involved in any rationalization scheme designed to reduce the total number of beds in any State. </PARA>
<PARA> That foreign companies at present own no more than 7.7 per cent of private hospital beds in Australia, and that this represents 1.6 per cent of total hospital beds. Leaving aside religious and charitable hospitals, the maximum percentage of the total Australian hospital industry which could be acquired by foreign companies is 9.4 per cent, if all remaining private hospitals were acquired-which in any case would be commercially impossible. </PARA>
<PARA> That foreign companies must operate within the health policies of the Australian governments and of the Australian medical profession. HCA, for its part, has set itself high ethical standards based upon providing the highest quality medical care at reasonable cost. Far from making massive profits, HCA, and no doubt other private hospitals, have been operating at a loss in recent years. Even insured persons have been so heavily subsidised by the Australian taxpayer in public hospitals that it has paid them to choose treatment in these hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA> (On page 3 of my letter of 12 May 1981 a loss figure of $3,045,000 is stated. This is in fact the loss for 1980. The total loss since incorporation in Australia is in fact over $7.25m. We understand also that the other American owned major company (Hospital Affiliates) has lost in excess of $2m and we would hope that you would, in further statements, correct the previous impressions you have given of 'massive profits'). </PARA>
<PARA> That the bed day subsidy payable in respect of patients at a private hospital is substantially less than that payable in respect of patients at public hospitals. This means that the Australian tax payer benefits if, in the areas for which private hospitals provide health care, patients have the opportunity as well as the right to choose the private hospital and not the public hospital. </PARA>
<PARA> That the Jamison Report recommended that access to private hospitals be open to both pensioners and the disadvantaged. HCA would welcome this 'open door' policy on the same basis of finance as that which operates in such case when treated at public hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours faithfully,</PARA>
<PARA>T. R. RUSSELL, Chairman-Board of Advice</PARA>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. In the last few minutes available to me I wish to refer to the question of incentive, a matter to which reference is made in Senator Chipp's matter of public importance. Firstly, I would indicate that private hospitals in Australia have experienced diminishing occupancy rates. In 1975-76 they had an occupancy rate of 71 per cent. By 1979-80 that had dropped to something just under 60 per cent. I repeat, such hospitals are an important part of the Australian hospitals system. Just as we could not operate our school system without the independent, non-government schools, which take 22 per cent or 23 per cent of our school children, we could not operate our public hospitals without the 22 per cent or 23 per cent of beds which are taken up by the private hospital sector. For instance, I draw attention to the fact that the Sydney Adventist Hospital in my area plays a very important role in that regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The extra $16 a day which has been provided by the Government is the only additional compensation received by private hospitals during a period when public hospitals have been subsidised at taxpayers' expense. For example, although the subsidy will go up to $28 a day for a private hospital, with a rebate which will bring the total to $75, the cost of a bed in the Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney at the moment is $182 a day. The number of days occupied, under similar conditions, is lower in private hospitals than it is in public hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA> The appointment of a Senate inquiry is entirely a matter for the Senate to determine. I only hope that if the Senate does decide to set up such a committee it does so on the basis of fact and that it can competently determine some useful issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) has given the Senate no cause for complacency about the intrusion into Australia of private hospital investment. I would like to commend Senator Chipp and am very pleased to support his matter of public importance, namely:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The incentive given by the Government to private hospital investment, the excessive entry of overseas corporations into the private hospital field, and the need for a Senate inquiry into foreign and Australian ownership of private hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister, in the course of his remarks, did nothing to ease the concern felt about this matter in Australia. Does he, in his defence of this trend, believe the new Australian-based American hospital organisations are benevolent societies and that the shareholders on Wall Street will continue to struggle to obtain shares in these organisations when they are running at a loss? Of course, the Minister failed to point out that they, like most other intruders, as Senator Chipp has said, tried to enter by stealth, by assuming an alias and claiming that they were community services rather than the vanguard of American organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps, to put the matter into perspective, I should say that what Senator Chipp and we on this side are trying to sound a warning to the Government about is the Government's complacency concerning what we can expect here in the future when these overseas organisations proliferate and become established on a scale similar to that seen in the United States. I wish to quote briefly from the New England Journal of Medicine a special article written by Dr Arnold Relman. Dr Relman states:</PARA>
<PARA> The most important health care development of the day is the recent, relatively unheralded rise of a huge new industry that supplies health care services for profit. </PARA>
<PARA> Proprietary hospitals and nursing homes, diagnostic laboratories, home-care and emergency-room services, hemodialysis, and a wide variety of other services produced a gross income to this industry last year of about $35 billion to $40 billion. This new 'medical-industrial complex' may be more efficient than its nonprofit competition, but it creates the problems of overuse and fragmentation of services, overemphasis on technology, and 'cream-skimming', and it may also exercise undue influence on national health policy. In this medical market, physicians must act as discerning purchasing agents for their patients and therefore should have no conflicting financial interests. Closer attention from the public and the profession, and careful study, are necessary to ensure that the 'medical-industrial complex' puts the interests of the public before those of its stockholders. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Peter Baume told the Senate nothing that would allay the fears that that will happen in Australia in the future. My interest in this matter arose when I saw an article in the Age on 21 November 1978. It was the first reference I had seen to the Hospital Corporation of America, which was then applying for approval to build a new private hospital, to be called Saint Luke's, in Doncaster in Melbourne. A spokesman for the Corporation claimed that fees were to be set so as to provide a profit of 17 per cent on the investment, rising to 21 per cent as the hospital was developed. The project did not go ahead and I understand that there was a court appeal by Hospital Corporation Australia Pty Ltd against the Victorian Health Commission's refusal to allow construction of the hospital at Doncaster. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say that it has been in Victoria where there has been most public scrutiny and opposition by the medical profession and resistance by the State Government to the building of new foreign investor owned private hospitals. Senator Chipp mentioned Dr Barry Morley in Melbourne. His vigilance and application to this matter deserve the highest credit. I would like publicly to pay tribute to Dr Morley. The Federal Minister for Health at the time, Mr Hunt, wrote to me on 29 December 1978 in answer to a question I asked about Hospital Corporation Australia. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> My consideration of this matter has not yet reached the point where I am in a position to offer a firm view of this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA>I thought that was a rather weak reply from the Federal Minister. As I pursued the matter further, I questioned the quality of the advice that he was getting from the Health Department. The Minister seemed to think that overseas investment in Australian hospitals was simply a technical question for the Foreign Investment Review Board to sort out. There was no indication that his Department did any cost-benefit studies on the impact that such corporations would make. When a National Country Party colleague, the honourable member for Murray, questioned the Minister about the HCA and the expansion of the private hospital sector, the Minister admitted that attempts to control hospital costs through cutting back the public sector could be nullified if increases took place in the number of private hospital beds and in-bed utilisation. That was in May 1979. </PARA>
<PARA> This afternoon the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has applauded the entry of such hospitals. Yet the Minister's concern at the increases in the number of private hospital beds and inbed utilisation remains unanswered. Now two years later the situation is worse with the beginning of a massive retreat by the Federal Government from the health area. In August 1978 the Australian Financial Review, when reporting the HCA Press conference to announce its plans for a $45m investment in a chain of Australia's hospitals, carried the headline 'Business moves in as Government quits hospital beds'. What will the headlines be in the newspapers in two years time or when we catch up with the situation which exists in the United States at present, as cited in the article I mentioned? That article further stated:</PARA>
<PARA> In his farewell address as President on January 17, 1961 Eisenhower warned his countrymen of what he called 'the military-industrial complex', a huge and permanent armaments industry that, together with an immense military establishment, had acquired great political and economic power'. </PARA>
<PARA>The same trend has happened in medicine and hospital care. The people of Australia should be warned of it well in advance because it could have an insidious influence on the sick, the aged and those in the community who need medical and hospital care. After all, the claim is made that we are a charitable and kindly Christian society in which one of the first obligations is the care of the sick. The trend whereby the sick are becoming the objects of exploitation purely for profit-making purposes makes the argument of the Minister fall to the ground when he says that these very good Santa Clauses from the United States are running at a loss simply to provide a service for those people who need hospital care. What will the headlines be in two years time or more? Is that what the Government wants for hospitals in this country?</PARA>
<PARA> According to the HCA, the only condition imposed on it by the Foreign Investment Review Board was that it should give an undertaking eventually to allow 20 per cent Australian equity. A study by the Monash University Department of Social and Preventive Medicine has indicated a high density of doctors' financial interest in the Australian equity. On 4 December last year I asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health in the Senate whether investment in hospitals by members of the medical profession had ever been assessed by his Department, which after all pays a bed day subsidy to such hospitals. I raised the question of a possible conflict of interest and quoted the then Director of the Victorian Consumer Affairs Bureau, who compared doctors referring patients to hospitals in which they were shareholders with a judge having shares in a gaol and being paid accommodation charges for the inmates. The situation is as cynical and as sick as that. The Director of the Consumer Affairs Bureau recommended that doctors be required to declare their pecuniary interests in hospitals. I got the usual 'none of the Commonwealth's business' reply from the Minister. I point out that the new health proposals of the Government provide for a bed day subsidy of $28 for surgical beds in private hospitals, compared with $16 a day for non-surgical beds. What a wonderful bonanza that will be for the growing number of private hospitals with their American bases. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that private hospitals have traditionally concentrated on elective surgery and that Australia has a much higher rate of such operations than does the United Kingdom. The Queen's Counsel in the current inquest into the death of a child after the removal of tonsils referred to a little industry in tonsillectomies involving large sums of public money. The general practitioner and the specialist surgeon to whom he referred the child were both shareholders in the private hospital in Sydney in which the operation was performed, with the general practitioner doubling up as the anaesthetist. The Queen's Counsel cited the claim in the Jamison report that only 5 per cent of the tonsillectomies performed in Australia were necessary. The Monash study of the non-benevolent, that is, the investor owned private hospitals, found that doctors' relatives, especially wives, were also shareholders in Victorian private hospitals. Perhaps the Australian Medical Association should have a stated policy of its code of ethics. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister, during his remarks, made no reference at all to the AMA and its attitude to this new dimension in hospital care and the intrusion of foreign owned and dominated hospitals in Australia. Surely the ethics of the members of the medical profession are still enough in evidence for them to state their view but they are strangely silent on this very important matter. At the moment the Victorian and Western Australian branches of the AMA have passed resolutions recommending that doctors should disclose any such financial interest to the patient. The New South Wales branch is worried by such financial interests of doctors only if the doctor overpersuades a patient to enter a hospital in which he is a shareholder. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;'Overpersuades' is a very nebulous and ambiguous word. After all, the traditional doctor has been the be all and end all, the father confessor, the guide, the counsellor and the friend of the patient. Unfortunately, there has been a trend in the last generation for the young doctors to find out where the most cases of infected tonsils are and where the most of other easily removable parts are. As a matter of fact, once someone jokingly said that doctors could almost go into the spare parts business as they were removing parts so rapidly. Patients tend to take the advice of their doctors about referrals. I recommend to all honourable senators an article which appeared in the 23 October issue of the New England Journal of Medicine written by the doctor I referred to previously. He pointed out that in the medical market-place the classic laws of supply and demand do not keep prices down, as was implied by Senator Baume.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A Senate inquiry into foreign and Australian ownership of private hospitals would be very desirable and would inform this chamber of the extent to which doctors and their families are involved as well as which other business interests are involved. The Monash study was limited to Victoria. It found that nominee private companies, private trusts and benefit funds were not accessible to company searches. </PARA>
<PARA> The patient does not make the decisions but is dependent on the advice and judgment of the doctor. Surely the Australian Government should recognise that the people of Australia regard health care as being different from commodities bought and sold in the market-place. Health care is a basic right of all citizens and is a public rather than a private responsibility. I hope that the Senate will give its fullest support to this matter of public importance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon the Senate is considering a matter of public importance placed before us by Senator Chipp. In his letter to you, sir, he refers to what he calls the incentive given by the Government to private hospital investment and the entry of overseas corporations into the private hospital field and he calls for a Senate inquiry. Senator Chipp is reported in the Canberra Times of 11 May, when speaking at a meeting in Melbourne, as saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The number of foreign-owned private hospitals was growing at an 'alarming rate'. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Apparently they are not discouraged by the Foreign Investment Review Board, which is instituted by the Government . . . </PARA>
<PARA>One of the factors in the economic and social development of a nation is the combination of elements necessary to provide services for the community and the public. Community services are needed and funding and finance are needed not only to establish them but also to work them. Hospital and health services are among the most necessary services in any society. They are among the earliest services provided in a developing society. In new towns, new suburbs, new country areas and in societies such as ours, hospital services are among the most important services needed as these communities are established and developed. </PARA>
<PARA> Hospital services are particularly important. Hospital services are also very expensive. Money must be found not only to run them but also to keep them going, improving and extending to meet whatever the need is. In a socialist economy such services are totally government funded, controlled and designed. Under the present Administration in this country many services of public importance are shared by the private sector one way or another. The involvement of private organisations in the various fields and services is of great benefit to the community. Firstly, it allows the individual a freedom of choice. The matter of freedom of choice may be a fairly familiar thing but I think it needs to be stated and restated. In so many areas of today's society a machine takes over, a network assumes control or a merging takes place and freedom of choice is taken away. It is important constantly to remind the community of the value of freedom of choice. This applies especially in this matter of hospital services. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the matter of private organisations within this field provides also for competition. It promotes better quality services and, without doubt, leads to greater efficiency. Thirdly, private sector involvement assists the Government in areas which require large public expenditure. Government and government instrumentalities operate to ensure that many of these services about which I have been speaking are adequately provided. It is under government supervision that private organisations enter into many of these fields. </PARA>
<PARA> Foreign investment is a life-giving stream to any economy and any nation. If it is active it indicates that the country concerned is in a stable situation, that it is well managed and, what is more, that it is worthy of the investment. In relation to foreign investment in Australian private hospitals, private sector organisations must meet and comply with the requirements of Commonwealth departments and State health departments as well as, of course, with those of the Foreign Investment Review Board. All of the foreign-based investors referred to in the matter of public importance before the Senate this afternoon have met with FIRB approval. Such approval is given subject to those parties meeting certain requirements and demands. They had to meet the requirements of all the relevant health authorities-Federal and State. Permission is given subject to their agreeing not to expand their operations without taking such proposals for expansion to the FIRB for additional approval. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to emphasise that this is a condition which does not apply normally in other foreign investment areas and under our foreign investment policy. Approval is given subject to the introduction of a 35 per cent Australian equity into their operations within three years. I make the point that the entry of these organisations is closely monitored at all levels and the applications are closely scrutinised. I think it is also clear that the entry of these organisations, particularly into the private hospital field, has been far from excessive. </PARA>
<PARA> Combined, the Hospital Corporation of Australia, the Hospital Affiliates of Australia and American Medical International operate some 18 hospitals within Australia, with a capacity of some 1,500 beds. This figure represents less than 8 per cent of the total number of approved private hospital beds and only 1.6 per cent of the total number of hospital beds in Australia. The services offered by these hospitals are of excellent quality and the hospital world benefits from the chains of contact and information about the new technology and access to the new technology which these world-wide organisations can provide. The Hospital Corporation of Australia has given as its reason for the expansion of services and the success of them the quality of its services. If the services had been inferior they would not have been supported by the public and would not have grown. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the Australian Medical Association Gazette of 30 August 1979. Dr Vincent Youngman argued the case for such companies on evidence he had collected after visiting Hospital Corporation of America hospitals in the United States of America and speaking to their medical personnel. In the first instance he referred to Dr Frist Senior who is the founder of the Hospital Corporation of America. Dr Youngman wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> Dr Frist . . . a physician in Nashville, had had a comparable problem to ours in Brisbane-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, difficulty in raising finance-</PARA>
<PARA>until he linked with a businessman ten years ago. Medicine used business finance and technique. But good medical care is the dominating theme in their organisation and the plan on which their success is based. Medicine needs the financial help of business to implement modern procedures. The type and pattern of treatment is the responsibility of the doctors who use the hospitals. I cannot see any reason why their organisation could not play a role in Australia as we believe in free enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA>A little later in the AMA journal the doctor went on to point out:</PARA>
<PARA> Private hospitals have to be efficient or they close their doors. This contrasts with government hospitals which can spend large sums of money on inefficient planning and utilisation of resources without any real accountability. </PARA>
<PARA>He took up the observation a little later when he referred to the major criticism relating to the profits. He said that the balance-sheet of HCA did not indicate this and that after all, even our church hospitals find that they must have profit to finance change and to proceed with development. So private hospitals have an important role to play in the provision of health and medical services in Australia. Dr Barrie Morley, who has already been quoted this afternoon, rightly recognised that when he wrote in the AMA Gazette that what he termed 'entrepeneurial private hospital services' have assisted in the heavy burden of the nation's health care. That fact was also recognised in a 1979 discussion paper on hospital facilities and charges. This was a paper by Dr Sidney Sax, the man who prepared a report on hospitals in Australia for the Commonwealth Government a few years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> The 18 private hospitals in Australia currently operated by these foreign based companies received from the Government a daily occupied bed subsidy of $16. This subsidy is paid to all private hospitals in Australia. This financial year it will amount to $72m. The Jamison Committee report described it as simply 1.9 per cent of the Commonwealth's health budget. Under the new health arrangements due to commence in September this year there will be a new subsidy of $28 a day for private hospital patients undergoing surgery. This will cost the Government $21m in a full year, but only $2m of it will be paid to patients in what are described as the foreign owned hospitals. These subsidies are substantially less costly for the taxpayer than the alternative, that is, payment by the Government of additional costs for insured patients who choose to be treated in public hospitals. Firstly, without that $16 a day subsidy-it has not been increased for the last six years-many private hospitals would have had to close because of financial problems and this would have forced more hospital expenses onto the Australian taxpayers. The hospitals which have been built by these companies and for which there has been a demonstrated need would have added to the Government's costs in the health care area if private enterprise had not constructed them. </PARA>
<PARA> The point to be made is that private hospitals, including the foreign owned private hospitals, add to the health services of Australia. They benefit the consumer directly and they ease the cost of provision of health services to the Government, thereby benefiting the consumer taxpayer quite considerably. They take their place also in the provision of employment. For example, at present the Hospital Corporation of Australia, which has been charged with employing a number of Americans, according to information that I have been able to ascertain today, employs one American and all the other employees are Australian nationals. A private hospital, foreign owned or church operated, is no different from any other business. Unless there is a satisfactory service, unless there is good management and unless there is good housekeeping, it will not succeed or grow. </PARA>
<PARA> To sum up, as the Minister has emphasised, these kinds of hospitals must meet not only Commonwealth requirements but also the requirements of State government, and at every point they need the approval of the State authorities. It is wrong to suggest that States are concerned only with foreign owned private hospitals. Three States have taken steps to control the growth of private hospitals in the same way as all States have expressed their control over public hospitals. The supply of hospital beds, both public and private, is under the control of the States, and the Commonwealth's decisions on health funding will encourage States to examine more closely growth in the total hospital system. </PARA>
<PARA> At present foreign companies own, as I have said earlier, about 8 per cent of private hospital beds. No progressive country can live entirely without technology and introductions of new technology from overseas. The private hospital system that is outlined in today's matter of public importance provides the Government, the taxpayer and the consumer with not only a choice but also a quality service. It is saving the taxpayer money and assisting the Government in the total health program, and it provides a freedom of choice in that program. Furthermore, private hospitals are recognised by the Jamison inquiry. The Commission's report stated at page 314 of volume 2:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission is convinced of the important and needed role which the private hospitals play in Australian health services especially for short-term, simple medical, surgical, obstetric and psychiatric care. </PARA>
<PARA>The last item in Senator Chipp's matter of public importance, namely, the need for a Senate inquiry into foreign and Australian ownership of private hospitals, is a matter for decision by the Senate. Senate inquiries usually spring from a circumstance in the community which the Senate feels it is necessary to investigate. So it becomes a matter of persuading the Senate that it should undertake such an inquiry. This persuasion is usually initiated within groups or party rooms and finally determined on the floor of the Senate. The opportunity to reach such a determination in the Senate later this year is well known to all honourable senators. I have no doubt that the approach to Senate inquiries may very well have a different emphasis to that which it has had in the past. Mr President, any matters relating to public and personal health are of importance. It is well submitted, as Senator Chipp's letter has said, for discussion. However, I think the matter has taken sufficient of the Senate's time today, so I move:</PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The Statute Law Revision Bill 1981 has three purposes. First, it is designed to correct some printing and drafting errors that have been found to exist in a number of Acts. Secondly, it provides for the repeal of a number of Acts and provisions of Acts the operation of which is exhausted or which are no longer required. Thirdly, it makes a number of technical or minor amendments which, whilst having some substance, are regarded as being of a non-controversial nature. The Government has decided to introduce Statute Law Revision Bills into the Parliament on a regular basis, at least once in each year and, if required, once in each sitting. This will enable the prompt correction of mistakes and errors and removal from the statute book of expired laws. In the absence of the regular passage of Bills of this kind, the correction of an error in an Act can only be achieved by having a special Bill passed for that purpose or waiting until the Act needs to be amended for some other more important purpose. An objection sometimes made to omnibus amending Bills is that they result in so-called 'hidden' amendments. However, the Government Printer now issues monthly tables of Acts passed by the Parliament and these tables indicate clearly whenever an Act is amended by an omnibus Act such as a Statute Law Revision Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions of the present Bill that deal with the correction of errors and the repeal and amendment of expired laws do not call for particular comment. I propose to explain in some detail the nature and effect of the provisions of substance. </PARA>
<PARA>Acts Interpretation Act 1901</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The Bill provides in Schedule 1 for the insertion in the Acts Interpretation Act of a provision that is relevant to the whole body of statute law. The provision is to the effect that, in the interpretation of a provision of an Act, a construction that would promote the purpose or object underlying the Act, whether that purpose or object is expressly stated in the Act or not, shall be preferred to a construction that would not promote that purpose or object. Mr President, under our constitutional arrangements it is the function of an independent judiciary to interpret the law and no proposals which we make can or should undermine the freedom that this function requires. Nevertheless the general approach to be adopted to statutory interpretation is something which this Parliament can-and at this stage should-address. The volume and complexity of legislation are assuming daunting proportions and the task of understanding and applying it grows in proportion. Increasingly the more significant decisions our courts are called upon to make turn on a point of statutory interpretation. Our problems are not unique. They are shared, for example, by the British Parliament, to which proposals have been made along the lines now proposed by this Bill. The British proposals, I should add, have been initiated and supported by very distinguished law Lords, including Lord Scarman and Lord Wilberforce. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of the provision to be inserted in the Acts Interpretation Act will be to confirm that in interpreting provisions regard is to be had to the object or purpose underlying the Act in question. I am not among those who would say that the general approach of our courts is at present overly legalistic, but I do think that there is scope for expressly stating that the statutes we make are to be interpreted in a purposive manner. Tax decisions constitute a topical and important example that will come readily to all senators' minds, but the matter has wider implications that extend to many other statutes. I therefore commend the provision to the Senate, but before moving on I should invite the Senate's attention to some related questions. Explanatory material is often provided by the Government to assist senators and members, and subsequent users of legislation. The material is of particular value where legislation is complex or specialised in subject matter or both. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that we need to consider placing this practice on a more regular basis, even to the extent of having an explanatory memorandum approved by the Parliament and able to be taken into account by the courts in interpreting difficult provisions in the Act. The memorandum could not and would not be controlling. However, apart from contributing to the ease with which an Act can be understood by the public as well as by senators and members, such a practice offers the hope that the draftsman, when faced with the difficult choice of either using general language which might, however, leave the courts without sufficient guidance, or introducing lengthy detailed provisions, could feel some security in choosing the former course if he knew that a memorandum approved by the Parliament would embody its intent. </PARA>
<PARA> A cognate question arises where an Act is based on an expert report tabled in the Parliament for example by the Law Reform Commission. Courts can at present consider such reports, but the precise way in which they can use them has been the subject of dispute. The fear has been expressed that the use of extraneous materials such as reports and explanatory memoranda will increase the cost and length of legal proceedings. Certainly the possible disadvantages have to be considered and weighed against the benefits that would flow from the use of such materials. The time has come, however, when the matter should be fully explored and I take the opportunity of stating to the Senate that I propose to do so with a view to developing specific proposals that can be brought into the Parliament for further consideration. In the meantime, the present position on the use of extraneous materials is preserved by stating in the proposed new provision that it is not to be construed as authorising the consideration of extraneous materials for any purpose for which they could not be considered if the new provision had not been enacted. </PARA>
<PARA>Administrative Appeals Tribunal 1975</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>Part II of the Bill repeals the provisions of the Schedule to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 that confer jurisdiction on the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in matters arising under various other Acts, and other parts of the Bill re-enact the provisions concerned as part of those other Acts. In the course of transferring these provisions from one Act to another, Part IV omits the requirement that the Tribunal be constituted by a presidential member sitting alone when a decision is being reviewed under section 20 of the Australian Capital Territory Taxation (Administration) Act 1969. That section empowers the Commissioner of Taxation to revoke a banker's authority to issue cheque forms that are pre-stamped with the duty payable under that Act if the banker is convicted of an offence against that Act. Part XI provides for the Tribunal to have jurisdiction to review decisions of the Collector of Customs under sections 22 and 23 of the Distillation Act 1901. Those sections relate to the renewal of licences to distil spirits. In all other respects these amendments do not make any change in substance to the jurisdiction of the Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA>Schools Commission Act 1973, Tertiary Education Commission Act 1977</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The Bill provides for the word 'Commonwealth' to be included at the beginning of the names of the Schools Commission, the Schools Commission Advisory Boards and the Tertiary Education Commission and provides for these bodies to perform the same functions in relation to the Northern Territory as they perform in relation to a State. Clause 117 amends references in various Acts to the former names of these bodies. </PARA>
<PARA>Defence Act 1903, Air Force Act 1923 and Naval Defence Act 1910</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The amendments made by Parts III, X and XV and clause 116 give effect to recommendations made by the Millar Committee report on the Citizen Military Forces in 1974 regarding the title and structure of the Army Reserve. The Millar Committee recommended that the Citizen Military Forces be retained as the country's immediate reserve of Army units and be renamed the Australian Army Reserve. The Committee also recommended that the members of the Regular Army Reserve, the Regular Army Emergency Reserve and the Reserve Citizen Military Forces be brought into this single Army Reserve organisation. On 4 April 1974, the report was tabled in the House of Representatives by the then Minister for Defence, who announced approval of these two recommendations. It was not appropriate to proceed with formal amendment to the titles and structures of the Reserve Forces until the Government had considered a further recommendation of the Committee that the Army Reserve be available for service in situations short of a proclaimed time of defence emergency. Honourable senators will recall that in January 1980 the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) announced that the Government had decided not to vary the availability for service of the Army Reserve. </PARA>
<PARA> In recommending a change to the title of the Citizen Military Forces, the Millar Committee recognised the concern within that force that the existing title misrepresented the nature of the Citizen Military Forces. It was considered that the essential nature of the force was more accurately reflected in the title 'Australian Army Reserve'. The validity of the Committee's view is shown by the general acceptance of the title 'Army Reserve', except where the use of the present formal title 'Citizen Military Forces' is dictated by legal requirements. Before legislation could be introduced to reflect the new title, it was necessary to consider whether corresponding title changes should be made to the Citizen Naval Forces and the Citizen Air Force. It was also necessary to consider the structures of the Citizen Forces of all three Services because some of the elements of those forces bore derivative titles such as Active Citizen Military Forces and Active Citizen Air Force. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill amends the Defence Act to rename the Active Citizen Military Forces as the Active Australian Army Reserve and the Reserve Citizen Military Forces as the Inactive Australian Army Reserve. The Regular Army Reserve, which is a non-training element of the Permanent Military Forces, is abolished and its members are transferred to the Inactive Reserve. In the context of Reserve Forces, 'Active' denotes those elements the members of which have specific training obligations. The Bill also removes from the Defence Act reference to the unattached list and the Reserve of Officers. These relate to the internal administrative arrangements of the Active and Inactive Reserves, respectively, which are matters of administrative detail appropriate to be dealt with by the regulations or by determinations under section 33 of the Defence Act. It has been decided not to incorporate the Regular Army Emergency Reserve into the Australian Army Reserve as recommended by the Millar Committee. The Emergency Reserve comprises former members of the Regular Army who agree to become members on cessation of their Regular Army service. Members may be called out by the Governor-General when he considers it desirable to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The enactment of the provisions of the Bill to which I have referred will bring to finality implementation of the recommendations of the Millar Committee, except for those few recommendations with which the Government has chosen not to proceed. Parts III and XV of the Bill amend the Air Force Act 1923 and the Naval Defence Act 1910 to make amendments in relation to the Air Force and the Navy corresponding to the amendments made in respect of the Army. The Bill renames the Citizen Air Force as the Australian Air Force Reserve. It also restructures the Reserve so that the Active Citizen Air Force becomes the Air Force Active Reserve, the Air Force Reserve become the Air Force General Reserve and an additional element, the Air Force Specialist Reserve, is introduced. The Air Force Specialist Reserve will comprise officers and airmen having specialist skills, such as doctors, dentists, lawyers and chaplains. Members of the General Reserve and the Specialist Reserve will not usually have peace time training obligations. The Bill renames the Citizen Naval Forces as the Australian Naval Reserve. It does not deal with the elements into which that body is divided because this is dealt with in regulations under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The opportunity has been taken to revise the provisions of the Defence Act, the Air Force Act and the Naval Defence Act with regard to the rendering of service-other than continuous full time service-by members of the Reserve Forces. The revised provisions are more closely tailored to the needs of the Reserves and provide more accurately for the regulations relating to obligatory and voluntary periods of non-continuous service. Clause 116 amends references in various Acts to the former titles of the Reserve Forces and to 'continuous full time service'. </PARA>
<PARA>Federal Court of Australia Act 1976</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>Schedule 1 amends the Federal Court of Australia Act 1976 so as to permit an affidavit to be sworn before a district registrar and a deputy district registrar of the court. It also amends that Act so as to enable a reserved judgment to be delivered at any subsequent sitting of the Court, whether or not the Court is sitting as a full court. </PARA>
<PARA>Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>Part XIII amends sub-section 3 (5) of the Historic Shipwrecks Act 1976. The Amendment relates to the description of the area adjacent to Queensland contained in the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967 and is, consequential on an alteration that is proposed to be made to that description by another Bill during the present sittings. </PARA>
<PARA>Migration Act 1958</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of the amendments made to the Migration Act 1958 by clause 59 is to overcome a problem resulting from the amendments of section 16 of the Act that were made by the Migration Amendment Act 1979. Section 16 deems to be a prohibited immigrant a person who, for the purpose of securing entry into Australia, produces or produced to an officer an official document that was not issued to him or was forged or obtained by false representation. A doubt has arisen as to whether section 16 would apply to a person who produced a visa or return authority to an officer before 1 November 1979, which was the date on which the amending Act came into force, in a case where the visa or return authority was not a separate document but was stamped in the person's passport. The amendment will make it clear that the section will apply in such a case. Clause 2 will make the amendment retrospective to 1 November 1979. </PARA>
<PARA>Navigation Act 1912</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>Schedule 1 amends the Navigation Act 1912 so as to enable judges of the Federal Court to sit on courts of marine inquiry without the need for special authorisation by the Governor-General. </PARA>
<PARA>Parliamentary Counsel Act 1970</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>Schedule 1 amends the Parliamentary Counsel Act 1970 to remove any doubts as to the validity of the long-standing practice of making dormant acting appointments to the offices of First and Second Parliamentary Counsel. These are appointments that are made in anticipation of any absences from duty of the holders of those offices and are designed to take effect automatically whenever an absence occurs during the currency of the relevant acting appointment. </PARA>
<PARA>Pig Industry Research Act 1971</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>Schedule 1 inserts the word 'Australian' at the commencement of the name of the Pig Industry Research Committee, which is constituted under the Pig Industry Research Act 1971. This will bring the name of the Committee into line with similar committees established under other Acts. </PARA>
<PARA>Public Service Act 1922</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>Clause 79 corrects an obsolete cross-reference in sub-section 82 (6B) of the Public Service Act 1922. That sub-section provided that the services of a temporary employee to whom Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act 1979 applied could not be dispensed with except on the ground that the employee had been guilty of conduct which, if he were an officer, would constitute an offence referred to in sub-section 55 (1) of the Public Service Act. However, on 15 March 1981 the provisions of sub-section 55 (1) were replaced by the new disciplinary provisions of Division 6 of Part III of the Act. Clause 79 therefore omits the reference to the repealed sub-section 55 (1) and replaces it with a reference to specified grounds of dismissal, which are the same grounds as are set out in the new Division 6 of Part III of the Act. Clause 2 provides that clause 79 is to be deemed to have come into operation on 15 March 1981. </PARA>
<PARA>Social Services Act 1947</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Schedule 1 amends the Social Services Act 1947 to enable claims for age, invalid or widows pension, or sheltered employment allowance, to be lodged with any registrar. That Act presently requires such claims to be lodged with the registrar whose office is nearest the place of residence of the claimant. </PARA>
<PARA>Trade Union Training Authority Act 1975</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>In 1979 the Australian Council of Salaried and Professional Associations and the Australian Council of Trade Unions were amalgamated and the former body ceased to exist. Part XXIII provides for the abolition of the offices of the persons representing the former body on the Australian Council for Union Training, and on each of the State Councils for Union Training, established under the Trade Union Training Authority Act 1975, but it increases by one the number of persons representing the ACTU on each of those councils. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA>Customs Amendment Bill 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The principal purpose of this Bill is to amend the Customs Act to give effect to a number of recommendations of the Australian Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs. The royal commission made a large number of recommendations. In many cases only administrative action was recommended or was found to be required on an examination of the recommendations. There has been substantial progress already towards implementation of those recommendations. Other legislative recommendations did not relate to the Customs Act. Some required action by the Governments of the States and the Northern Territory. These amendments give effect to the Government's decisions on those of the royal commission's recommendations which are considered by the Government to require action by way of amendment to the Customs Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The royal commission recommended that responsibility for narcotics control under the Customs Act in situations beyond the Customs barrier should be transferred from the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs to the Australian Federal Police. This recommendation has been implemented by an Administrative Direction and Administrative Arrangements Order. This Bill contains provisions to give clear legislative authority for the division of powers and functions. The division particularly affects the seizure of goods and their custody, claims for recovery of seized goods, avenues of redress and the final disposal of any seized goods which become condemned to the Commonwealth. The proposed amendments are contained in clauses 3, 26, 33, 34, 36 and 38. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 25 is proposed to implement the recommendation of the royal commission that a person seeking to clear goods through Customs might be required to disclose and prove his identity or the identity of the owner of the goods. This measure is designed to facilitate the apprehension of those importers of illicit narcotic drugs who address the drugs to ficticious persons for collection by anonymous agents. The royal commission also recommended that the Customs control over ships and aircraft at sea or in air space within three nautical miles of the Australian coast should extend to the area within 12 nautical miles of the coast. This is consistent with international law and convention. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill implements that recommendation in clauses 12, 24 and 29. However, the Bill provides that the limitation to the area within 12 nautical miles will apply only to foreign ships and aircraft. Customs control over Australian ships and aircraft will be exercisable to the full extent consistent with international law and convention. The Bill also proposes a number of amendments of a more general nature. These amendments flow from a continuing process of review and modernising of the Customs Act. All imported goods become subject to Customs control on importation. They remain subject to this control until they are released by Customs. The control is essential to the Customs barrier against prohibited imports such as narcotics or quarantinable goods. It is also essential to Customs' duty collection role. The control usually is exercised through a system of documentary checks. These necessarily are supplemented by physical examination of a proportion of the imports. </PARA>
<PARA> The Customs Act imposes responsibilities on those who are in possession of goods which are subject to Customs control. They are required to keep the goods safely and to produce them or account for them when so required by Customs. The Customs Act now recognises the passing of Customs entries as the principal authority for dealing with imported goods. When the entry is endorsed as passed the entry document remains in the possession of the Customs. It has been necessary to develop administrative procedures for a written authority to be given to the person in possession of the goods. The authority allows the person, usually a shipping company or an airline, to deliver the goods for the purposes for which they have been entered; for example for warehousing or for home consumption. </PARA>
<PARA> It is proposed to give legislative effect to that practice by replacing the passing of entry by the giving of an authority to deliver the goods. Clause 9 proposes that delivery authorities may be as prescribed by regulation. Almost half of the clauses of the Bill are consequential on these changes. The delivery authority will usually be given on the basis of an examination of commercial documents furnished by the owner of the goods, or his agent. However, intelligence may be received from other sources suggesting that narcotics may be concealed in the goods or that the goods are not properly described in the documents. Provision is made, therefore, to permit an authority to be suspended in order to allow a physical examination of the goods. </PARA>
<PARA> It is now an offence to move, alter or interfere with goods which are subject to Customs control. This offence is too limited in its present terms. The employee who improperly moves the goods will be liable. The principals, who have the responsibility to keep the goods securely, are not liable for their failure to implement and oversight effective systems for that purpose. Accordingly, Clause 5 now proposes that principals should be liable for the acts of employees involved in the unauthorised movement of goods which are subject to Customs control. A defence is provided to protect those principals who do take reasonable precautions and exercise due diligence to ensure proper compliance with the Customs Act. Clause 13 proposes an amendment to section 64 to authorise regulations to prescribe the time and manner for ships, aircraft and their cargo to be reported to Customs after arriving from overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year the Customs Act was amended to provide a means for dealing with refugee boats or other illegally imported vessels. Clause 26 now proposes new sections to supplement those powers. New section 207 will permit the speedy disposal of a seized vessel that is too unseaworthy to be maintained by Customs. Customs will be able to dispose of the vessel even though it has not been condemned to the Commonwealth. This will reduce the costs now incurred in keeping such vessels. New section 208B provides that a person with an interest in the vessel has a right to take proceedings to recover the proceeds of any sale of the vessel or the value of any destroyed vessel. </PARA>
<PARA> New section 208E allows conditions to be imposed on the sale or disposal of ships or aircraft which have been condemned to the Commonwealth. By clause 30 they may again be forfeited if the conditions are not complied with. </PARA>
<PARA> Customs Tariff Proposals are introduced into the Parliament from time to time following Government decisions to alter the Customs duty on imported goods. These Proposals are usually incorporated in a Customs Tariff Amendment Bill or a Customs Tariff Validation Bill. Clause 28 proposes to amend section 226 to extend the validity period of Customs Tariff Proposals from 6 months to 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed extension of the life of Proposals will reduce the number of Customs Tariff Bills. It will not diminish in any way the authority of the Parliament to scrutinise Customs tariff changes. Provision is made in clause 35 to allow Customs Tariff Notices to have up to 6 months retrospective effect except where the proposal alteration would increase the duty payable. Honourable senators, the Bill represents a desirable advance towards a modernised Customs Act and will assist effective Customs administration. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA>Excise Amendment Bill 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to amend section 114 of the Excise Act 1901 to extend the validity period of Excise Tariff Proposals from 6 months to 12 months. This amendment is being proposed as a consequence of the Customs Amendment Bill 1981. That Bill similarly proposes an extension to the validity period of Customs Tariff Proposals. Excise Tariff Proposals are introduced into the Parliament from time to time following a Government decision to alter excise duty. It has been the practice to incorporate the Tariff Proposals into an Excise Tariff Amendment Bill. These are normally introduced late in a parliamentary sitting. </PARA>
<PARA> When an Excise Tariff Amendment Bill is unable to achieve passage prior to six months after a proposal is introduced, it has also been the practice to validate that proposal by an Excise Tariff Validation Bill. This proposed amendment will have the effect of reducing the number of Excise Tariff Bills. It will not however diminish in any way, the authority of the Parliament to scrutinise excise tariff changes as they occur. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night, when the Committee debated the departments in group B-namely, the Department of Education, the Department of Communications and the Department of Home Affairs and Environment-I moved a motion which referred the first annual report of the Special Broadcasting Service for the period 1 January 1978 to 30 June 1979 and the second annual report of the Special broadcasting Service for the period 1 July 1979 to 30 June 1980 to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations and I spoke to that part of the motion. At that time I did not address remarks to the rest of the motion, namely, that the Committee on Finance and Government Operations examine and report instances where departments and authorities may have breached statutory reporting requirements and the matter of financial assistance for the exhibition tour of the United States of America by the speed boat Spirit of Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I discern the position no further senators want to speak on the estimates for the Department of Communications. Therefore I will comment on the section of the report which relates to the Department of Home Affairs and Environment and to the third and fourth parts of my motion. The third part follows on from the first and second parts which relate to reporting by the Special Broadcasting Service. I do not intend to give details-unless honourable senators are interested in details-of the allegation that it appears that other groups have not met their responsibilities in reporting to Parliament. The Finance and Government Operations Committee will go into that matter in some detail. I will speak very briefly on the fourth matter-the matter of financial assistance for the exhibition tour of the United States of America by the speed boat Spirit of Australia. One of my principal concerns on the evidence received in relation to granting $93,000 for the purpose of this tour is that that matter arose as a result of questions I asked about the use of the Advance to the Minister for Finance. I am concerned whether that Advance was properly used in this instance. I make it clear that it is certainly not my intention to pass any judgment on Mr Warby, whether he should have received that grant and the value of the tour because the evidence requested by Estimates Committee B did not indicate whether that tour was successful, worth while or anything else. I cannot comment on whether it was a good thing or whether it was done properly. The matter will be looked at by the Finance and Government Operations Committee. Nevertheless, I emphasise that the whole issue arose in relation to the use of the Advance to the Minister for Finance.</PARA>
<PARA> In the comments I will make today I will refer further to the subject of the Advance to the Minister for Finance, evidence that came up in Estimates Committee B and other matters which relate to the general conduct of Estimates committees and the quality of evidence received by them. I have never, in my seven years' experience on Estimates committees, had anything like the range of extraordinary experiences that I had on Estimates Committee B in relation to both issues and evidence presented to the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I will pursue for a moment the subject of the Advance to the Minister for Finance. Yesterday the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) made a statement to the Senate, in response to a report from the Finance and Government Operations Committee, on the subject of the use of the Advance to the Minister for Finance. I am sure that those positive recommendations which she indicated will be acted on by the Government. Indeed some recommendations already have been acted on and will be welcomed by the Senate as they assist its consideration of government policies in relation to expenditure. They may tighten up a situation which is altogether too lax at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> A couple of noteworthy examples came to the attention of the Committee. I refer to page 12 of Estimates Committee B's report on the subject of a Southern Cross Replica Museum Trust. Evidence was given to the Committee that an advance of $50,000 had been made to the Department of Home Affairs and Environment for this item. I remind the Committee that the general principle is that money from the Advance to the Minister for Finance does not come in the course of normal appropriations for departments; it comes from an amount of money voted to the Government to enable it to meet urgent and unforeseen expenditure. We like to be assured that it is for that purpose. The advance for the Southern Cross Replica Museum was for $50,000. When questions were asked about why this money was either urgent or unforeseen or urgent and unforeseen, it turned out that only $15,000 of the $50,000 requested by the Department of Home Affairs and Environment from the Department of Finance was indeed urgent. Evidence indicated that $35,000 could have waited until Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1980-81 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1980-81. </PARA>
<PARA> We sought an explanation from the officer from the Department of Finance who attended our Committee hearing. He did not have the information available nor did he have any reason to have it with him as no indication had been given to him that he would have to answer these questions. So we did not advance any further on why $50,000 was provided when only $15,000 was requested urgently. I will quote from page 13 of the report of Estimate Committee B which cites written evidence from the Department of Finance. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Contrary to the advice given by the Departmental witness to the Committee, the Department of Finance was not told that only $15,000 of the grant was required immediately. </PARA>
<PARA>I cannot guess why the Department of Home Affairs and Environment would have said that it needed all the $50,000 for the balance of the financial year on an urgent and unforeseen basis when, in fact, it needed only $15,000 on that basis. The other $35,000 could have come through the Appropriation Bills. I shall not speculate on the Department's motives, but I reiterate to the Department and the Committee that it is not good enough, in my opinion, in the opinion of this Committee and, I believe, in the opinion of the Senate for a department to take such a casual approach in its submissions to the Department of Finance on why it needs money from that source rather than waiting for the Appropriation Bills. I think this is a matter which bears some explanation. We have also said, as a committee, that we believe the Department of Finance should take greater care to ensure that in future similar requests meet the necessary criteria. The Department of Finance clearly, from its written evidence, is a little sore that it was not told that only $15,000 was needed urgently. It is possible that the Department of Finance, when it receives requests from other departments, could be a little more careful about the detail of how much is urgent and unforeseen. I indicate to departments which appear before hearings of Estimates committees on which I sit in the future, to the Department of Finance and witnesses from that Department that they ought to be prepared to answer in some detail questions on individual items in respect of the Advance to the Minister for Finance. </PARA>
<PARA> The second aspect in relation to operations of Estimates committees on which I think it is worth spending a couple of minutes is the quality of evidence received by committees. Estimates Committee B's report refers to examples of misleading or contradictory evidence which was presented to it during its hearings. A minute ago I gave one example of this which related to the Advance to the Minister for Finance and the Southern Cross Replica Museum where we got contradictory evidence from the Department of Home Affairs and Environment and the Department of Finance. Another example that the Committee encountered related to the subject of the observance of Australia Day. This involved evidence from the Department of Home Affairs and Environment and the Australian Broadcasting Commission under the appropriation for the Department of Communications. It was fortuitous that Estimates Committee B dealt with the Department of Home Affairs and Environment and the Department of Communications. If it had not happened that we subsequently had Australian Broadcasting Commission witnesses before us, we would have been in great difficulty following up in any meaningful way the evidence given to us by the Department of Home Affairs and Environment. We were told by that Department that $36,000 was requested as part of the cost of staging an Australia Day concert. The Department's explanatory notes, that is, the printed notes that are supplied to the Committee to explain Budget Estimates and Supplementary Estimates, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . initial advice from the ABC was that the Committee-That is, the Australia Day Committee-</PARA>
<PARA>would not be required to contribute to the cost of the concert and accordingly no provision was made in the 1980-81 estimate. However, following a close examination of the concert's costs the Committee was informed that some contribution would be required for the concert to proceed. </PARA>
<PARA>As noted in the report of the Estimates Committee, the Committee members were confused by the evidence presented on this matter. Witnesses from the Department of Home Affairs and Environment endorsed the statement that the ABC would not require funds to support the concert. When we questioned them they were uncertain, however, why this situation had changed and, further, were unable to say how the money was spent. The money appears in the estimates, but witnesses were unable to tell us how the money was spent. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of Estimates committees is to find out details on this sort of expenditure. As I have indicated we raised the matter again during the consideration, of the Additional Estimates for the ABC under the estimates for the Department of Communications. Witnesses from the ABC contradicted the explanations given by witnesses from the Department of Home Affairs and Environment. The Home Affairs evidence appears on pages 109 and 110 of the Senate Estimate Committee Hansard for Monday, 27 April 1981, and the ABC evidence appears on page 128. In particular, the Committee was told that the ABC had never undertaken to meet the costs of the concert. The ABC's evidence was subsequently supported in further information received by the Committee, after it had finished its hearings, from the Department of Home Affairs and Environment and the ABC. </PARA>
<PARA> I am saying as simply as I can in a big hurry that we were given in written form in the explanatory notes an explanation for an item but the explanation was just not true. When details of the item were sought at the Committee hearing witnesses were unable to tell us what the details of the item were. When further information was sought from another department the original evidence was flatly contradicted. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise the question of where this leaves an Estimates Committee which is acting on behalf of the Senate. If Committee members cannot take at face value the words written in the explanatory notes, if they cannot believe what they are told by witnesses, they really do wonder what is the attitude of the departments, the witnesses or whoever to Estimates committees. I suspect what happens on occasions is that witnesses do not know the answer. They might know part of the answer but instead of saying 'I do not know, I will find out' they make up an answer around what little they may or may not know. It has certainly been my observation in the chair and just as a member of Estimates committees. All of us are aware of the different quality of evidence that we receive from different departments. When I was on the committee which dealt with the estimates for the Department of Foreign Affairs it was a pleasure to go through the estimates because invariably whatever questions were asked there was an expert present who could give a prompt answer. If anyone wanted to follow up the information given in the answer then and there he could. If there was not someone present who could give the information-and this was fairly rare in the whole range of the evidence that that Department covered-the witnesses would say: 'We do not know. We will find out'. They did not mess around with making up half an answer. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to make a plea to witnesses who come before Estimates committees. We would rather them say 'I do not know' than pretend to know for a little while and waste the time of committees and make its members very short tempered indeed when they discover that they are not being given evidence of the quality that they should be given. Further, I suggest to Ministers that they look at the standard, the highly varying standard, of witnesses who come before Estimates committees. I have mentioned the Department of Foreign Affairs. It is interesting to look through the rankings of witnesses who appear from that Department. They are all fairly senior people who are in a position to know and who can give a precise answer. It rarely happens that committees talk to senior officers who do not know or who, if they do not know, will try to pretend that they do. I make a plea to Ministers, who have an undoubted influence, to determine just which of their officers will appear before Estimates committees and to ensure that the witnesses are high level officers for the sake of the operation of Estimates committees, not only for the quality of the evidence but also for the quality of temper of us all by the time we have finished. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to apply a litmus test to the remarks of Senator Martin about prompt responses to questions asked by Estimates committees. I direct my remarks to the Department of Communications. As the honourable senator will be aware, I was only a visiting senator to Estimates Committee B. I happen to be a member of Estimates Committee D. The information I am seeking relates to an area which may be straddling the functions of the Department of Communications and the Department of the Capital Territory. I refer to the Black Mountain tower. There is a prologue to my questions. Way back in 1972 I, and a Queensland colleague of mine, Senator Keeffe, foreshadowed the stupidity of foisting a glorified restaurant on to a project designed to improve communications. We said it would not work. The evidence I subsequently got in reply to questions upon notice revealed that there is a rather high-powered army of private security people guarding the tower. We favoured the improvement of communications for the people of the Australian Capital Territory but we did not feel that the Government should disturb the surrounding parkland with massive excavations to construct a restaurant that is a virtual white elephant.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a mystery to me why I have not been able to get figures about the tower. I do not know whether this comes within the responsibility of the Department of Communications, or the Department of the Capital Territory. In the spirit of what Senator Martin has said in respect of the seeking of information, I want a breakup of the rental per year for the Black Mountain restaurant. I want that balanced against the cost of the army of private security people who, because the public have access to the Black Mountain tower, have to protect the communications operations. I have never argued about the need for security, but I can see that the Government is in a bind. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Keeffe and I brought down a minority report in 1972 which said that there was no need for the restaurant and it would not be a financial success. I am not one of those people who have an obsession with balancing the budget, as this Government has, but I have been unable to get information as to the rental that is received for the Black Mountain restaurant. I want that figure balanced against how much the Government pays the contractors whether it is the Metropolitan Security Services or other organisations which play at being toy policemen. I think it is a simple request. I repeat that the decision to have a restaurant was wrong. I am very curious to know how much we are subsidising this restaurant because of a wrong decision. I am getting well above party politics in this matter because the decision was made by the Public Works Committee, which is representative of all major parties. I repeat that Senator Keeffe and I have been proved completely right. I would like to get a complete breakup on how long the restaurant has been going, what its actual takings have been and the rent it pays and balance that information against the cost for the MSS operatives that guard the tower. If the restaurant did not exist there would be no need for the massive number of MSS operatives that are being used. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last night Senator Walsh asked questions relating to the activities of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. He did so in the context that some unfortunate circumstances prevented him being present during the full committee deliberations. He therefore had some questions and I undertook to try to provide answers for him today when consideration of Appropriation Bill (No. 3) was resumed. He asked: Who authorises travel for the chairman, members and staff of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal? What is paid in respect of that travel? He also asked whether the Auditor-General is investigating any matters concerning travel and subsistence for the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The officers have gone to some lengths to try to provide some information. I am able to advise the honourable senator as follows: Travel within Australia for the chairman and members of the Tribunal is arranged by the secretary of the Tribunal as is necessary for the chairman and members to attend hearings or otherwise conduct official business. In these instances fares are paid by the Tribunal and the chairman and members receive a daily rate of travelling allowance to cover accommodation and subsistence. This is at a rate prescribed by the Remuneration Tribunal, and currently stands at $72 for the chairman and $61 for the members for each overnight stay. Travel within Australia by staff of the Tribunal is authorised by the chairman or the secretary to the Tribunal as appropriate. Fares are paid, together with a daily rate of allowance, to cover accommodation and subsistence in accordance with the rates--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Within Australia. The rates are prescribed from time to time by the Public Service Board and are applicable to staff employed under the Public Service Act. In respect of overseas travel proposals by the chairman or members of the Tribunal are subject to approval by the Prime Minister. Overseas travel by the secretary or staff of the Tribunal is subject to approval by the Overseas Visits Committee within the quota arrangements of that Committee. Fares and travelling allowances for overseas visits are paid in accordance with procedures established for all overseas visits by Commonwealth officers. The accounts of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal are subject to examination by the Auditor-General. I am informed that the Auditor-General has just completed an examination of the accounts of the Tribunal. The Tribunal has advised that it is not aware of any further investigations being sought by officers of the Auditor-General's office. Those are the answers which we promised to get for Senator Walsh.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must now respond partly to some of the matters that Senator Martin has raised. For some period I was the Minister at the Committee hearing while some of the examination was going on. I suppose that someone must appear as a friend of the officers. They cannot come into the Senate and speak for themselves. In fact some pretty harsh things have been said about them in the last few minutes by the honourable senator in relation to some of the evidence given and some of the discrepancies which emerge between different answers. I should like to make quite clear and to put on the record that I hope that no one is suggesting that the officers who attended that Committee's hearings and those of other committees were not attempting to assist the Senate and the Parliament in every way possible to get information. I assert that as a fact. We had 28 senior officers from the Department of Home Affairs and Environment who were trying to do their best. I must say that appearing before a Senate Estimates committee is a strange experience, especially for the first couple of times. It is an environment with which honourable senators are familiar and with which officers generally are not. There is a genuine desire to assist, but the fact is that they are not senators; they are not subject to the hurly-burly of debate in this chamber. I sit on many Estimates committees. When there is a breakdown of communications such as occurred in this case it is not a bad idea to look at both sides of the communication process and not just at one. Honourable senators often can contribute to the way in which answers are given by the precision of the questions and also by a general attitude, whether it is an attitude of co-operation--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. I am just responding on behalf of some officers who have been pretty roundly criticised. I will not suggest that there was no material requiring criticism, but some of the criticism was directed towards the officers themselves. If there is an aggressive line of questioning, sometimes it is not easy for them to cope with it. I am suggesting that if officers are attacked in a fairly aggressive way it often makes it more difficult for them to do their jobs properly. I reject any suggestion that there was any deliberate attempt to distort the evidence or to distort what the Committee received. I imagine that the honourable senator would agree with me. There was no such deliberate intention. We would like to get that on the record. Having said that, the honourable senator has raised a number of matters which require some answer because they are matters which quite properly have concerned her.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They have concerned her and the Committee. I sat as Minister on several committees. Different committees operate in different ways. The first point which was raised by the honourable senator was the point relating to financial assistance towards the exhibition tour of the United States of America by the speedboat Spirit of Australia. The honourable senator had some concerns in relation to payments made to Mr Warby. The report of the Committee expresses concern that this financial assistance had not been properly accounted for in terms of the agreement with Mr Warby, and, in particular, that the final part payments were made without an evaluation of the original part payment of $100,000. I think that states the Committee's concern. The explanatory notes did not deal with this aspect.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the Committee hearing the departmental witnesses indicated that all the funds had been provided in pursuance of a government decision. That is to say, if there was a reason it was done, it was not as a result of a decision of officers; it was a government decision. The Committee was told that it would be provided with the available details of expenditure. In written replies to questions the Department went on to indicate that the final payment of $43,000 was made to Mr Warby on 11 February on the instructions of the then Minister that steps should be taken to obtain the funds. The matter was dealt with urgently because Mr Warby was leaving for overseas. In its reply, the Department of Finance stated that it had approved this final payment in response to the approval given by the then Minister for Home Affairs and Environment, and the Department of Finance decided it was not required by the Audit Act or Finance Regulations or by the terms of the original agreement of the Minister for Finance to withhold part payment until evidence was available of proper expenditure of the earlier part payment. </PARA>
<PARA> I am saying to the honourable senator that there may well be matters requiring criticism, but the officers of the Department at all times acted under ministerial instructions. The Department of Finance acted within its regulations, and it may well be that what the honourable senator seeks is perhaps a variation on the procedures which apply. What was carried out was within the procedures. The Department of Home Affairs and Environment acted on ministerial instructions, and the Department of Finance processed those instructions in accordance with the relevant provisions. The Department, of course, will ask Mr Warby to account for the expenditure of the total amount. All action was taken by the Department of Home Affairs and Environment in response to a ministerial direction and with the agreement and the authority of the Department of Finance. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the honourable senator then referred to the Southern Cross Replica Museum Trust. She noted that of an advance of $50,000 which had been sought and obtained from the Advance to the Minister for Finance only $15,000 was required immediately. I think that states the honourable senator's concern. There may have been some misunderstanding. My understanding from the Department was that the total $50,000 was required before the Appropriation Bills could be passed. That is the understanding I had been given by the officers. The sum of $15,000 was required immediately and the whole $50,000 was required before the Appropriation Bills could be passed. In those circumstances the written reply given by the Department of Finance is consistent with this. The Department of Finance states that it was not told that only $15,000 of the grant was required immediately. I put it to the honourable senator that the problem facing the Department of Home Affairs and Environment was that it required the $50,000-to the best of its assessment, and I believe it turned out to be the fact-before the Appropriation Bills went through. On that basis it sought some money from the advance. It is quite clear that there was some misunderstanding on the part of the witness from the Department, and perhaps even on the part of some committee members, of the distinction between the money being required immediately and the money being required urgently. The Department considers that the money was required urgently in that it was required before the Appropriation Bills were passed. </PARA>

I submit that it may well be a matter of misunderstanding. The fact is that there was need for the whole $50,000 in advance of the passage of the Appropriation Bills. I hope that that will be of some assistance to the Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The next matter raised by Senator Martin to which some response should be made concerns item 14 of subdivision 3 of division 330, the observance of Australia Day. On page 14 of Committee B's report it is stated that the Committee was confused by the evidence presented on this matter; that the Department's evidence was contradicted by the Australian Broadcasting Commission. Senator Martin, in tabling the Committee's report said:</PARA>
<PARA> It appears that the Australian Broadcasting Commission officer was telling the truth. </PARA>
<PARA>The explanatory notes presented by the Department state on page 19 that the cost to the Australia Day Committee of staging the Australia Day live concert was $36,000 although initial advice from the ABC had been that no contribution would be required; that accordingly no provision was made in the original 1980-81 estimates. At the hearing the departmental witness stated that the Committee was not aware before December 1980 that the ABC would require any funds from it. In its written replies, the Department explained that the need for additional funds had arisen from a shortfall in sponsorship. </PARA>
<PARA> The apparent contradiction clearly arose because the departmental notes and witness were not sufficiently precise. Here I acknowledge the point made by the honourable senator. This was completely unintentional and I bring to the chamber on behalf of the Department apologies for that unintentional inadequacy in the notes. It was thought initially that the cost of the concert would be met through sponsorship which was to be organised by the Committee, and that no contribution from the Committee's appropriation would be required. This did not prove to be the case. Of course there was clearly a certain degree of verbal confusion but no intention to mislead. The officers of the Department had no intention other than to assist and help the Estimates Committee. I believe that those are the only matters that have been raised by the honourable senator--</PARA>

<PARA> However, since the sittings of the Estimates committees we have heard further rumblings about the administration of the Australian Institute of Sport. On a number of occasions prominent athletes attending it have expressed dissatisfaction with it and have returned to their home States. I received a response to a question about the personnel of the management committee of the Institute. Perhaps I could now be given an indication as to whether there have been any worth while discussions between the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment, Mr Ian Wilson, and Mr Don Talbot for the purpose of clarifying matters. Is the ship, so to speak, on a rather rough course and perhaps being steered towards a reef? Perhaps the Minister can indicate when the high-powered management committee of the Institute, which is studded with sporting luminaries, is to meet, particularly at this time of apparent crisis. In other words, I would like to know the state of play in regard to the administration of the Australian Institute of Sport. </PARA>

I appreciate the Minister's soothing bedside manner and accept the purpose of his comments. I am sure, conversely, they were not aimed at any particular members of Estimates Committee B. We appreciate that witnesses do attempt to assist members of this chamber in every way possible. What I was trying to say was that they would assist us even more if they would not attempt to give answers when they do not really know the answers. It would be of greater assistance if more often they would simply say'; 'I do not know; I shall get that evidence for you'. Frequently failure to do that leads to the problem that I have mentioned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I understand that briefing sessions are held for witnesses who are to appear before Estimates committees. I do not know whether it would be applicable to the Department of Home Affairs and Environment, the Department of Communications or the Department of Education-I know that it applies to some other departments-but I suggest that the suggestion of our Committee might be included in those briefing sessions, which are directed to informing witnesses on how they should handle appearing before Estimates committees. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister. I understand that the briefing arrangements are informal in nature. I also ask the Minister to consider the possibility that one of the reasons senators become very aggressive, and indeed positively hostile, is that they become irritated about the quality of the evidence that sometimes is presented to them. A little better understanding of that point might make Estimates committees function more smoothly. I would not suggest for a moment that when a committee comes upon an item in respect of which it believes that something has not been conducted as it should be, it should take that out on a witness. Nevertheless, the committee will direct its questions to such witnesses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I did not suggest, as the Minister conceded I did not, that there had been a deliberate attempt to distort. However, the final item that I wish to mention-that in Appropriation Bill (No. 4)-requires special attention. Although it was not perhaps the subject of a deliberate attempt to distort, we saw displayed a rather cavalier approach on the part of a witness to the giving of evidence before an Estimates committee. I would like briefly to point out to the Senate and to the Minister an aspect of the debate on the Southern Cross Replica Museum Trust in respect of which it was indicated that some confusion existed. The Minister said that the money was required urgently, that it was not unforeseen, rather that the fact that it was to be required urgently was unforeseen. That was accepted by the Committee. Nevertheless, I should like to refer to one or two matters that were raised in evidence. I refer to page 119 of the Hansard report of the proceedings of Estimates Committee B, at which this exchange is recorded:</PARA>
<PARA>Chairman:</PARA>
<PARA> So you knew in June last year that costs were going up. You knew that it was likely that it would be necessary to ask the Government for an additional grant?</PARA>
<PARA>Witness:</PARA>
<PARA> No, we were still very hopeful that we could raise the balance of that money from private enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA>Chairman:</PARA>
<PARA> When did you know you would not?</PARA>
<PARA>Witness:</PARA>
<PARA> Only about January or so of this year. </PARA>
<PARA>Chairman:</PARA>
<PARA> So in February you asked for $50,000?</PARA>
<PARA>Witness:</PARA>
<PARA> That is right. </PARA>
<PARA>Chairman:</PARA>
<PARA> Has the money been expended?</PARA>
<PARA>Witness:</PARA>
<PARA> The $50,000?</PARA>
<PARA>Chairman:</PARA>
<PARA> Yes. </PARA>
<PARA>Witness:</PARA>
<PARA> Some of it, certainly. </PARA>
<PARA>Chairman:</PARA>
<PARA> How much?</PARA>
<PARA>Witness:</PARA>
<PARA> It would have to be a guess. I would think somewhere about $20,000. </PARA>
<PARA>As it transpired it was about $15,000. A little later, the following was said:</PARA>
<PARA>Chairman:</PARA>
<PARA> So in March you said that you would need $50,000. By what date?</PARA>
<PARA>Witness:</PARA>
<PARA> At that stage we were asking for money that was urgently needed for use within about a fortnight. </PARA>
<PARA>The $50,000 was needed, and it was needed over a period, but only $15,000 was needed urgently. I accept that perhaps the Department did not know that it would spend only $15,000 out of the $50,000 by the time the Appropriation Bills came forward. However, it should have been a little more definite, and the Department of Finance should have been a little clearer, that there was a case for $50,000 before the Appropriation Bills. Some written evidence on this issue from the Department of Finance states:</PARA>
<PARA> The former Minister for Home Affairs and Environment wrote to the Minister for Finance on 24 February 1981 seeking a further and final emergency grant of $50,000 to the project. The Minister's letter included an indication that half of the $100,000 total funds needed to complete the project was required immediately to permit construction to continue and to give the Trust time to raise the balance from other sources. </PARA>
<PARA>Further on it was stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Information was requested at officer level from the Department--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the Department of Home Affairs and Environment-</PARA>
<PARA>inter alia on the urgency of payment and why it had not been foreseen earlier. The explanations of the Department were provided to the Minister for Finance. </PARA>
<PARA>There was need for the Government to indicate immediately that it would give the $50,000. There was not need for the Government to give the $50,000 immediately. That is the point being made. We would just like to see a little more care on that point. I accept that it was not known precisely how much would be needed before the Appropriation Bills, but I put it to honourable senators that the evidence suggests that it could not have been claimed that all the $50,000 was needed urgently. </PARA>
<PARA> I point out to honourable senators that Estimates Committee B has asked that the consideration of certain evidence be given to a committee. We considered this very carefully. There is no institutional way in which the Senate-except in debate, which is not very quickly-can come quickly to grips with the issue of the quality of evidence given to Estimates committees and how we might give some guidance to departments on what we expect in terms of quality of evidence. Accordingly, Estimates Committee B has recommended that a meeting of Estimates committee chairmen be convened to consider the apparently misleading and contradictory evidence presented to the Committee and that Estimates committee chairmen report to the Senate on their findings. The committee of Estimates committee chairmen would be an informal committee, but I think it important that a group of people who have a very clear and firm interest and motivation in that subject undertake to go into these matters in some further detail instead of our canvassing them for hours in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a precedent for this. At one stage some years ago there was some concern about the Advance to the Minister for Finance. Estimates committee chairmen at the time met informally and agreed, not just as a committee but after consultation with other honourable senators who had an interest in the subject, on advice that might be given to departments, to Ministers and to the Department of Finance about information that could be given to us with the explanatory notes and in relation to the Advance to the Minister for Finance. That was the only way we as a committee could see how we could somehow move quickly to come to grips with this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, I want to make a couple of points on this final item. The Minister made some comments about intent, good will and so on. The evidence we received on this final item does not help at all. It may be a once in a lifetime or once only occurrence, but I would not like to think this is in any way the standard we could apply to evidence or information given to us in explanatory notes. We were told in the explanatory notes that an amount of $1m was being requested for this item. The explanatory notes stated:</PARA>
<PARA> An amount of $1m will be required in 1980-81 for the following projects;</PARA>
<PARA>The notes went on to list five individual projects for which the money would be allocated. The following was revealed in evidence from a witness, as reported in the Estimates committee Hansard:</PARA>
<PARA> It may be that the $1m goes to two or three of those facilities in the first instance and not to all of them. </PARA>
<PARA>I will quote from the Hansard to show how this came up. The question was:</PARA>
<PARA> Does that mean that it is unlikely that those two facilities will incur the expenditure allotted?</PARA>
<PARA>The witness said:</PARA>
<PARA> No, it is more than likely that a priority may be rated as a higher priority by the State when more investigation is undertaken in that sense. </PARA>
<PARA>My question was:</PARA>
<PARA> For 30 June?</PARA>
<PARA>We were being asked to vote $1m to be spent before 30 June and at that stage it was still not clear what the expenditure program was. Of course, we were seeking details of that. The witness said:</PARA>
<PARA> Yes, but that $1m may not be spent on all of those projects, given that some of the projects are in a much more advanced state than others. </PARA>
<PARA>He gave some examples. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> It may be that the $1m goes to two or three of those facilities in the first instance and not to all of them. Given that the $1m is part of a total $25m appropriation, the position will level itself out. </PARA>
<PARA>Question:</PARA>
<PARA> So the statement that: 'An amount of $1m will be required in 1980-81 for the following projects;' is not correct?</PARA>
<PARA>Witness:</PARA>
<PARA> It says 'for the following projects'. It does not say for all of the following projects. </PARA>
<PARA>Question:</PARA>
<PARA> One would assume that that is what that statement meant. Is that true?</PARA>
<PARA>Witness:</PARA>
<PARA> Yes, that is true. </PARA>
<PARA>One would assume, when reading in notes the statement 'An amount of $1m will be required in 1980-81 for the following projects', with the projects then listed, that the money was going to be spent on those projects, not on some assortment of them. Do we have to examine all the prepositions that appear in explanatory notes to be sure that the information we are being given is accurate? I say that not in a nasty sense, but I think it should be noted-it was certainly discussed by the Committee-that that evidence was given without a blush, a wink or a hint of hesitation. If the witness was feeling some nervousness about appearing in front of aggressive senators, he certainly was not showing it. That sort of evidence certainly makes senators more aggressive. I hope that that was a once only occurrence. It would be very disturbing to think officers, in preparing explanatory notes, believe such a statement can go in when they must be fully aware of the potential of such a statement to mislead any one who was prepared to take those notes at face value and not to seek further details. That is the reason we suggest that this matter be looked at by an informal committee-I am not moving that a committee be set up-comprised of chairmen of Estimates committees. Such a committee could look at this detail, at the quality of the evidence we receive and at what Estimates committees can do when they receive contradictory evidence. I remind honourable senators that it was fortuitous, when our Committee got the contradictory evidence, that the other department involved was present. When the other department was not present, an officer from the Department of Finance was there and we could ask for an undertaking that information be given. That was fortuitous. I think it is something on which we need further information. I think there should be some report and recommendation to the Senate on the matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Martin says that it could have been more precise. Instead of referring to the program in general terms only the explanatory notes should have stated explicitly that the funds required in 1980-81 were part of a three-year program and that that three-year program involved those projects which were listed. I think that probably would have got over the difficulty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I return for one moment to the $50,000 for the Southern Cross Replica Museum Trust. The Department of Finance advises me that of the amount of $50,000, $15,000 was required to meet that week's payroll and other necessary expenditure-literally that week. The Trust is not permitted by law to go into overdraft. It is not permitted by law to enter into commitments unless the funds are actually held by the Trust in a bank account. It could undertake no further activity unless it had money on hand. Guarantees that funds will be forthcoming are not acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation was that the balance of $35,000 was required to enable commitments to be entered into for major items such as engines and timber for the wings. Provision also had to be made to cover wages in advance because of the nature of retrenchment requirements. The total of $50,000 was required well in advance of the passing of Appropriation Bill (No. 3), which of course we are still working on now. It has all been used. I really think that again it is a matter that fits in with the general exchange that has taken place in the Senate in which a genuine attempt has been made and, I think, more information has emerged as we have investigated it. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I say to Senator Mulvihill that the Government is committed to the long term development of the Australian Institute of Sport and to the development of the capacities of our elite athletes. Funds have been provided in this financial year to permit the recruitment of world class coaches and to assist our athletes to continue their training and education in Canberra. It has always been intended that the Institute's development would be staged-not one-off, but staged. Funds will be provided next year to develop the facilities further and to permit a small increase in the number of young people who can attend the Institute. I am aware that there have been some problems with competing demands for the use of facilities, and the honourable senator and I have discussed them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I should like to refer to the Department of Communications. I direct a question concerning the Australian Broadcasting Commission in Darwin. I drew attention recently to the fact that the Darwin ABC had been given State status. In other words, it had been given a certain amount of autonomy. I put a question forward in this place-it was not during the hearings of Estimates Committee B-concerning the funds available in two areas: Firstly, I referred to the establishment of the State status of the ABC and, secondly, to the ongoing funds needed to keep the ABC operating. As yet I have had no reply, so I raise the matter again. Without dwelling too much on this matter-I have already given this information to the Australian Broadcasting Commission Committee of Review, commonly known as the Dix Committee-I make the point that infrastructure is needed for small organisations in the same way as it is needed for large organisations. The cost per capita in a place like Darwin for the ABC, education and other services must be higher than in the States. I must say, of course, that there was general agreement when I put forward this thesis to the Dix Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The establishment of an organisation like the ABC in the Northern Territory obviously must be cheaper when some facilities already are available. The ABC was operating as a small part of the South Australian organisation. Some funds are still needed. Can the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) indicate approximately how much more money is needed to establish the ABC in the Northern Territory under its own system as distinct from being part of a State system? Where are these funds provided in the Additional Estimates? They must be contained in the Additional Estimates, of course, because the State status was given only about two weeks ago. I make the point also that ongoing costs must be high because once again the per capita cost must be higher in an organisation which has to provide a rural commentator, an outside broadcast unit, a sports commentator and so on. Can the Minister indicate what is the differential? I imagine that this amount also has been included in the Additional Estimates. Can the Minister direct me to where I will find that figure?</PARA>
<PARA> We are very conscious in the Northern Territory, of course, of the fact that we do not want simply a repeater station for southern programs. We want to see our own programs developed. I am rather mindful of the comments that my colleague Senator Townley made the other day in relation to Tasmania. His comments were reinforced by those of my colleague Senator Wheeldon who talked about the Western Australian situation. We want to see individual programs developed in the Northern Territory. I put these questions to the Minister: How much extra money will be needed? Where will it be found?</PARA>

I pay tribute to the officers. I received an in-depth reply about the method of consultation with various overseas postal services and I understand, the Yugoslav Government. In the meantime I publicised the response I received from the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) via the Committee largely through Novo Doba, the leading Yugoslav newspaper in Australia, a host of clubs and with my colleagues from Western Australia and Queensland and particularly the Atherton Tableland. There appeared to be a considerable amount of interest among people of Yugoslav origin as to when finality in this matter would be achieved.</PARA></TALK.START>

The Remuneration Tribunal has determined that holders of particular public offices will be entitled to the same rates and allowances as permanent heads. The Chairman of the ABT is entitled to the cost of accommodation plus an allowance as set out in the schedule-I will provide a copy of that schedule to Senator Walsh-to cover meals and incidentals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The usual practice is for an advance to be paid before departure and the officer must fully acquit that advance by production of receipts on return. Official credit cards are not used. However, officers sometimes adopt the practice of using their own credit cards as a useful means of accounting for expenses to acquit their advance on return. The Chairman's expenditure is covered by the accounts of the Tribunal and is subject to the Auditor-General's investigation.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to indulge in carping criticism. I think the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) will accept my comments in the spirit in which they are given. We have seen a repetition of the practice of a full backup staff being present when the Estimates committees are meeting but when the Committee of the Whole is meeting there is limited backup staff. That has occurred tonight. This situation amazes me. Perhaps the best way I can illustrate my point is to draw an analogy with rugby. I do not know whether we play seven, 13 or 15 a side at the committee stage. I paid tribute to the advice I received from officers of Australia Post after Estimates Committee B met. I take it that senior officers are present and that their wisdom is on tap. How is it decided who will be here and who will not be here?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me use a rugby terminology to illustrate my point. How does the Minister decide whether he will have six or seven forwards and no backs or all backs and no forwards. How did he arrive at a decision tonight concerning the departmental representatives. The Minister must have known that questions like mine would have been asked. With respect to Australia Post, has the Minister put in his first or second team? Who decided which officers' services would be dispensed with? Senator Martin and, in the past, the eloquent Senator Rae, have raised the question of what is the perfect system. If the Committee of the Whole is meeting and senior officers of departments are present, why is it that the full team is not here? One can compare this situation to a car's transmission: If one interferes with it the car will not go. It amazes me that we have this facade. It is a facade because we do not have the full team from the first to the thirteenth player or the first to the fifteenth player. I suppose that if it were a soccer team the Minister would not win if he took out his half back line. That is what happened with the Australian team. After having made those sporting analogies, I think it is time we took stock of ourselves. </PARA>

If a department seeks further moneys it has to face up to queries across the whole of the spectrum. I do not think it is reasonable to criticise Senator Mulvihill for seeking information about other sections of a department which may not be seeking further funds. If departments or Ministers do not wish that to happen they should not seek any further appropriation but should wait until the main Budget is presented. I think it is a little unfair for Senator Messner to try to wipe us off. It is perhaps fortunate that I have no questions to ask about this group of estimates. I might be prepared to contribute to the next group. In all seriousness, once a department's estimates are opened again, senators have a right to ask questions about the estimates for the whole department.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise some matters relating to group C. First of all, I wish to correct the content of a question that I put to the officers of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet in an Estimates committee hearing. I said to Senator Guilfoyle, who was the Minister appearing before the Committee, that I had had a question on notice for quite some time for which I was awaiting an answer. That question asked whether the previous Governor-General had been provided with a free telephone service in the United Kingdom. I had that question on notice for quite some time-I think ever since he left this country and went to the United Kingdom-and I became very frustrated with the answers that I was getting. They were very negative. I was not told whether or not the previous Governor-General had a free telephone. The answer that I kept getting back from the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) was that the information was not available-or, if it was available, he would not give it to me. All the Government needed to say was yes or no. So I must take it that in fact the Government does provide the previous Governor-General with a free telephone service in the United Kingdom. Otherwise, it would quickly deny the suggestion. But I cannot find out how much it costs the taxpayers of this country to service that free telephone.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have said in the Senate on quite a few occasions, it is my opinion that the book that the previous Governor-General wrote was dictated over the telephone to the proof readers in Melbourne. It must have been done at an enormous cost to the Australian taxpayers. I will not pursue that matter any further because immediately the Labor Party becomes the Government, which will happen at the next Federal election, I will be able to get that information. Then I will reveal to the public the double standards of this Government and how it pays people for services rendered. The services rendered were those performed on 11 November 1975 when Gough Whitlam was unceremoniously sacked. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to correct the misconception of my question to Senator Guilfoyle. I said that I had had the question on notice for quite some time and that I had not received an answer. As I have said, I became so frustrated with the negative answers I was getting that I gave notice of a motion to the effect that the Senate expresses its grave concern that Senator McLaren could not be provided with an answer in the interests of the taxpayers of this country as to how their hard won earnings were being expended by this present Government. As I have said, I will have to pursue that matter much further. The other question that I have asked consistently in the Senate ever since the change of government in 1975 concerns how much it costs to run Kirribilli House and the Lodge. I am always told--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Walsh" NAMEID="TJ4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator Walsh</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What about what it costs to keep Kerr in booze?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4L7">Senator McLAREN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, that is another matter. Perhaps Senator Walsh would like to raise it. I have already raised the question of what it costs to supply him with a free telephone service, and how he was able to write a book over the telephone at enormous profit to himself. I am concerned about the double standards of the Prime Minister. I have asked in the Senate on many occasions what it costs to maintain Kirribilli House and the Lodge. Every time that question is asked in this place and in the other place we receive the stock answer from the Prime Minister. He quotes the previous Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, saying that the four official establishments, including the Lodge, Kirribilli House and two other establishments, cannot be separated. But, as I have said in this place on many occasions, the Prime Minister very conveniently had at his fingertips on 24 March 1976 some information relating to the running of the Lodge in respect of the last six months of Gough Whitlam's occupancy in answer to a Dorothy Dix question from the honourable member for Barker in South Australia, Mr Porter. Mr Porter asked:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Can he inform the House of the cost last year of running the Lodge and Kirribilli House?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Fraser, in his answer, said:</PARA>
<PARA> I do not have the figures for the whole of last year but I have them for the last part of the year for both places. In the last six months of last year the Lodge cost the Australian taxpayer $64,941, running at an annual rate of $129,882. Kirribilli House, where perhaps the then incumbent spent a somewhat greater part of his time, cost $75,379 for that same six months, running at an annual rate of significantly over $150,000. </PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister, in an effort to embarrass the previous Prime Minister, quite conveniently had those figures at his fingertips. Every time I have asked what it has cost to run the Lodge and Kirribilli House since he has been the occupant, he has reverted to precedent, saying that those costs cannot be divulged. I asked this question again in the Estimates Committee hearing and I received no answer. The most pertinent part of his answer was the statement that for the same six months the cost of Kirribilli House was running at an annual rate of over $150,000 and that the then incumbent spent a somewhat greater part of his time at Kirribilli House. </PARA>
<PARA> Where does the present incumbent of the Prime Ministership spend the greater part of his time? He spends it at Nareen. What does it cost the Australian taxpayer to ferry the Prime Minister back to Nareen every weekend? What are the costs of the VIP aircraft and all the facilities that have been installed at Nareen? I shall ask further questions before we conclude consideration of the estimates for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. I am not satisfied with some of the answers that have been supplied to questions asked in the Estimates Committee hearings. What does it cost the Australian taxpayer to keep the Prime Minister installed at Nareen? It would cost much more than it cost for Gough Whitlam to reside at Kirribilli House. The previous incumbent of the Prime Ministership, Gough Whitlam, did not have to have all the security facilities, including an airstrip and all the facsimile equipment, installed at Kirribilli House. It was all there. </PARA>
<PARA> The present Prime Minister, the head of this Government, puts the taxpayers of this country to enormous expense. Yet he had the hide in answer to a Dorothy Dix question, off the top of his head, to come up with what it cost to run Kirribilli House and the Lodge while Gough Whitlam was the occupant. There again is evidence of the double standards of the Prime Minister. I could use much stronger words. You could not stop me from using them, Mr Temporary Chairman, because, as I said in the Senate the other day, I have a whole sheaf of extracts from the Hansard record for the period of over three years in which the Labor Party was in government, showing what we were accused of. I am quite prepared to use them. As I said to Senator Chaney a couple of weeks ago, I will put them all together at the appropriate time and make a speech about them just to prove to the electors the type of government this country has at present and the double standards under which it operates. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight I again ask the officers who are sitting behind Senator Messner for a breakdown of the costs of running the Lodge and Kirribilli House for the last 12 months. I wish to know also how long the present Prime Minister has occupied Kirribilli House in the last 12 months. He is on record as saying that he was not going to use Kirribilli House as a place of residence during his term of office, that it would be used and occupied only by very important persons visiting this country. He may not be in residence at Kirribilli House at any particular time, but surely we can be told what it costs to run the Lodge. I also ask-I am sure that I will not be told-what it costs the Australian taxpayers to have Mr Fraser flying backwards and forwards from Nareen. Only last week I saw an article in the Press which stated that Mr Fraser flew by VIP aircraft to a place in New South Wales to buy a bull. That was at taxpayer's expense. </PARA>
<PARA> I assure people who are listening to this broadcast tonight that at no time ever did Gough Whitlam use a VIP aircraft to fly anywhere in this country to buy a bull. Nor did he ever use a VIP aircraft to see a son working as a jackaroo on a cattle station. That is on the record. I expect that the VIP manifest will be tabled, if the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) runs true to form, before we get up. But it will only go back to 31 December last year so I will probably have to wait until the end of this year before I can debate the matter I mentioned. However, I will pursue the matter, as honourable senators know, with great vigour. I served as a senator in the three years of the Whitlam Government. Since the unceremonious dismissal of that Government by the previous Governor-General in 1975, I have had to sit on this side of the chamber and listen to the diatribes by honourable senators opposite about the honesty and open government that they engage in when, in fact, the reverse is the case. All of those things are on the record. No public money was misused by a Labor government. The money that we used was for the benefit of every Australian citizen, particularly those people in need. Yet day after day we find enormous amounts of money being expended by this Prime Minister to satisfy his luxurious needs, such as going to buy a bull. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to another matter-I do not think it was mentioned in the Appropriation Bills or explanatory notes with which we are now dealing-which relates to people whom he is sending overseas as couriers with personal invitations to attend the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. I asked Senator Guilfoyle many questions as to the cost of the CHOGM conference. Part of the answer was that out of the expected expenditure of $12m, $6m would be expended on security measures in Victoria. The money would have to be paid to the Victoria Police. Expenditure of that kind was not undertaken by the Whitlam Government. We saw fit to expend the taxpayers' money in this country to look after people in need. This Government that we have now says: 'To hell with the people in need. We will feather the nests of our great financial friends'. We now see the chickens coming home to roost. </PARA>
<PARA> If honourable senators look at the front page of today's Australian they will see that every Liberal government in this country today is in disarray. In Western Australia a member of the State Parliament has resigned because the Liberal Premier forced a gerrymander. We see problems in Victoria where Mr Hamer is under attack by a Mr Smith, the previous Minister for Agriculture. In New South Wales we saw Mr Mason under threat of dismissal because of disunity in his party. We see the present Prime Minister under threat of dismissal. No Government senator attended the dining room until 1.50. The party meeting went on until 1.50. There were great ructions there. Not one of the rebels on the other side was in the Senate during Question Time. I could name all the honourable senators who were not here. There were many vacant seats. They had a swarm outside. The country is in disarray but at the same time we have a Prime Minister who could not care less about expenditure of taxpayers' money. These are the questions that have to be asked and answered. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I go any further I want to see whether the Minister can obtain from the officers who sit beside him the expenditure of taxpayers' money on running the Lodge for the last 12 months. I have asked that question for God knows how many years in this place-at least five. I also want to know: Does the Prime Minister occupy Kirribilli House? If so, what was the period of his occupancy in the last 12 months? I will leave it at that. My quarter of an hour is nearly up. Of course the night is long and I am prepared to stay here until breakfast time, until I get the answers. I have done this on previous occasions. I will not say any more until I find out whether I can get answers to the questions I raised, not only on the Estimates committees this year but also on Estimates committees of years gone by and in this chamber in the Committee of the Whole. At this stage I will cease speaking to see whether I can be provided with those answers. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator McLaren well knows that successive governments, including that of Mr Whitlam, followed the precedent that information concerning individual breakdowns of expenditure on the various official residences was not provided. Rather, the whole sum appropriated is given and consequently that is available for discussion. With regard to the point that Senator McLaren raised on the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting which is coming up in October, I have some information for him. Additional CHOGM expenditure requirements this financial year have been identified as planning for the meeting has progressed. Commonwealth heads of government meetings are held every two years. Since 1971 the venues for the meetings have been Singapore, Ottawa, Kingston, London and Lusaka. This year the meeting will be held in Australia. This will be the first full meeting to be held in the Pacific area. Up to 45 heads of government from Commonwealth countries, accompanied by Ministers and officials, are expected to attend. This will be the largest meeting of Commonwealth Heads of Government ever in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The current estimate for the total appropriations of CHOGM is $12m. Australia must be prepared to bear this cost when countries such as Jamaica and Zambia have been prepared to bear similar costs in the past. Of the estimated appropriations of $12m, $6m is related to security requirements. Senator McLaren acknowledged that. A substantial portion of this $6m will comprise the transfer of funds from the Commonwealth to the State of Victoria to offset increased operating costs of the Victorian police force for the provision of the required security. Also included in the $6m for security is expenditure on security communications equipment such as portable radio transceivers and television surveillance equipment. The majority of equipment will be available for Commonwealth use after the meeting. The other major items of expenditure cover residential accommodation, transport, fitting out of the meeting venue, furniture and operating costs of the task force which has been established to handle the arrangements for the meeting. Of course this is one of the great significant meetings of the world, having so many Commonwealth heads of government present in one place. In fact such a meeting has not occurred in this nation since Federation and indeed it represents a milestone in the development of the Australian Federation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to pursue this matter because when the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) rose to answer my question his first words were that a precedent had been created that the figures were not divulged. I did not read all the answer given by Mr Fraser to Mr Porter, but I think for the record I have to do so, and that is going to be very embarrassing to Senator Messner, the Minister in charge of these estimates. It will also be very embarrassing when it is thrown back at the present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). I will give in full the answer which the Prime Minister gave to Mr Porter when he sought this information. I have cited some of the figures about the amount of money. Mr Fraser said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact that both residences were being paid for by the taxpayer for the benefit of one particular person--</PARA>
<PARA>There was then an interjection by Mr Innes who said:</PARA>
<PARA> Tell us about Manila. Tell us about Singapore. </PARA>
<PARA>We all know about that. That is not a point to be debated here tonight. Every member of this Parliament knows about the episode there and how a member of Foreign Affairs fell foul of the Prime Minister, but I am not going to indulge in that tonight. I want to read out the answer given by Mr Fraser. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable gentlemen opposite do not like the facts of life about their Leader. That is why they keep on trying to hide them. But I think that a few people have a right to know and a few people have a right to be able to understand. Both places were costing the Australian taxpayer ($280,000 and, since I thought that this was much too great a subvention by the Australian taxpayer to house the Prime Minister of this country, it is one of the significant reasons that Kirribilli was returned to its proper purpose as a residence which can be used by distinguished overseas guests . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Now, Mr Minister, you have it in black and white. I have been quoting from the House of Representatives Hansard of 24 March 1976. That is where the precedent was created by this Prime Minister and that is why I have repeatedly asked for the last five years for the costs of running Kirribilli House and the Lodge for Mr Fraser. What does it cost taxpayers? He is on record as saying it is a cost to the taxpayers. The taxpayers and the members of Parliament have a right to know. I am asking you again, Senator Messner. Apparently your officers know. Of course they are under some restriction because we know what happens to public servants if they do not bow to the wishes of this Prime Minister; their jobs are under threat. I ask you, Mr Minister, to accept the responsibility of telling this Parliament tonight what it is costing Australian taxpayers to house this Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, at the Lodge. I am not sure whether he has ever slept at Kirribilli House. I have asked you that question. You did not answer it in your reply. I am waiting for that reply. Your officers must know. They are here as the representatives of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. They must know, otherwise what is the use of having appropriations put before this Parliament and the explanatory notes being made available if Ministers are going to come in here and hide the facts from the taxpayers, which Mr Fraser said you have no right to do? I have read out his words. You have no right to do it. I again say, if you are not prepared to answer it, this country is now being run by a Prime Minister, who has very expensive and luxurious tastes and who is afraid to divulge to the Australian taxpayers what it costs them to keep him in luxury not only at the Lodge but also to fly him to and fro by VIP whether it be to Hamilton then to Mount Gambier, then by commuter aircraft or by Commonwealth car from there to his residence at Nareen and what it costs to fly him at taxpayers' expense to outlandish cattle stations to purchase a bull. We want to know and that is the whole purpose of putting appropriations before the Parliament. I say to you, Mr Minister, again that we are entitled to an answer and I want it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is quite obvious that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) is not going to give us the information so I can only take it from the Minister's silence that he is either afraid of the reaction that he will get from his leader if he divulges the information or else he is under threat from the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) not to divulge the cost. I think it puts at very grave risk the whole government when a Minister is prepared to protect his leader in respect of the squandering of taxpayers' money and not to divulge the costs. If he had nothing to be afraid of, nothing to hide, he would be quite prepared to divulge the information to the Parliament. We have not got the numbers in this place. We may have the numbers in this place when we are considering the Budget Estimates later this year. It might be a different story then. We might get back to what it was like in 1975. This Government might find the Budget held up until such time as it is prepared to give representatives of the taxpayers of this country their rights. This Government should not forget that every member of this place has a responsibility to the taxpayers of Australia. We are their servants. We are elected by them and we should endeavour to act in their best interests. I have had many requests from taxpayers in the State in which I live, in view of the answer Mr Fraser gave to Mr Porter, who also is a South Australian representative, back in 1976. As I said, he was able to give an answer off the top of his head. Of course the question was a Dorothy Dixer. He had it all there. As I have said before on many occasions, the answer was purely an attempt to belittle the previous incumbent of the office. I could go on to quote many other things that were said, but I will not do so tonight. I will do so at the proper time when we may be able to force this Government to divulge to the community at large what it costs to house this Prime Minister, that is, if he is the Prime Minister of course when the Budget is debated in this chamber.

It is of no use my pursuing the matter as I have done before in this place hour after hour.

<PARA> I am not terribly interested in the answer to Senator McLaren's question. I do not think that it is the most important question that I want answers to, but that is not the point. The point is that he is a senator elected by the people and has asked for a breakdown of the figures for what it costs to keep the Lodge and Kirribilli House. I asked: Is that information available? Do the officers have it? If the officers have it I want the Minister to say that the officers have it but that for policy reasons the Government will not disclose it. I would not like that answer because it goes against the spirit of freedom of information, but at least it would be an answer. At least the Minister would not be treating the Committee with contempt. Senator McLaren has asked for information. He has not been given an answer. I have asked the same question, and so has Senator Georges. The Government might wonder why senators on this side of the chamber, and indeed on the other side of the chamber, are pressing for a proper Freedom of Information Bill. If we continue to have a Minister such as Senator Messner treating this place with such utter contempt as he has tonight, either wilfully or unconsciously, this will increase the demands for a Freedom of Information Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I will move that we report progress unless the Minister indicates he will answer the question. The whole procedure is a farce. For the benefit of those people who are listening to this broadcast, I point out that there are 25 to 30 highly paid-although underpaid, no doubt-civil servants present in the gallery who will be here all night. God knows how many others are waiting out in the corridor to come into the gallery once consideration of this group of estimates has been concluded. The civil servants are present to advise the Minister on matters which senators such as Senator McLaren are raising from time to time. Judging by the progress we are making we will be here until 11 o'clock tonight. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7V4">Senator GEORGES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) has indicated that the information is available and refuses to give it. That is what I infer from his remarks. He has the information but is refusing to reveal it. He would not want to be before the Joint Committee of Public Accounts because it would take a very serious view of his attitude to withholding information. It does not concern security in any way. It is not a matter of the security of the nation. The policy of governments has been not to answer questions about the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation or other security agencies. We have argued about that, but we generally accept that it has some validity. But there should be no hesitation to give the costs of running Kirribilli House and the Lodge. They are residences which are supported by the taxpayer. There is no personal involvement by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) or anyone else. It is the taxpayers' money. I think the Minister admitted that. It seems to me to be quite extraordinary that the figures should be withheld unless the costs which have been incurred are such as to invite a considerable reaction from the community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to refer to the other matters within this group of estimates but I will not until the Minister gives a far better answer than that which he has given. I think that what Senator Chipp has indicated-that we should move to report progress-is the sensible course in the circumstances. I think the Committee will have to thrash this matter out. A Minister is refusing to give information concerning public expenditure. It is as neat as that. He is refusing to give the figures for the running of Kirribilli House and the Lodge. The Minister may argue that he does not want to give a breakdown, but at least he can give us the total cost of running those two places. Is he not prepared to do that?</PARA>

I consider that reporting progress is a serious matter. It is even more serious in that this is possibly the second or third time that we have reported progress against the same Minister. Honourable senators may recall that on previous occasions he has not been able to give us the information that we required. I ask the Minister to reconsider and give the information that we seek. Surely there is nothing to hide-or is there? Is the Minister saying that there is something to hide? Is he afraid to give the figures? If he is not afraid to give the figures, the answer is simple. His advisers have the figures. Give them to the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have reached in this place the ridiculous situation of honourable senators on this side seeking information similar to that which was made available in 1976 by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in answer to a question from Mr Porter in another place. The Prime Minister, in making that information available, gave details of the running costs of Kirribilli House and the Lodge and said that he was doing that because the public should know. He accused the Opposition at that time-it was the Government just prior to that time-of trying to hide the facts from the people. The simple fact is that this is public expenditure; it is expenditure by the second citizen of this country-if we consider the Governor-General to be the first citizen-of taxpayers' money. It is information which has previously been made available by the Prime Minister of the moment. It is information which he made available because he felt the public should know.

At least we should get an explanation as to why the Minister at the table cannot tell us what is going on and why he has been instructed not to tell us what is going on. He may stonewall all he likes on this problem. He can refuse us reasons and information and we will persist in asking for that information. We have not only not been given the information; we have also not been given one reason why that information should not be made available. When we were in similar situations on other occasions in this place we heard long and agonising speeches from those of the then Opposition about the right to know. We demand the right to know and we persist in seeking this information. </PARA>

Is it going to be necessary for us to wait until the Estimates come before the Estimates committees again so that we can ask the members of the Public Service directly how they feel about having information available which they are not prepared to give to the Parliament? Surely the Minister is going to act a little more favourably than he has. We will be accused later of holding up the proceedings of the Senate, but surely that criticism must fall very much on the Minister's shoulders. After all, when we started to debate the Estimates this evening we made considerable progress. It was only when the Minister now before us took his place and refused so arrogantly to give information that progress slowed down.</PARA></TALK.START>

I am directing a request to the Minister and the Minister is engaged in conversation with the Government Whip. I take it that the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting will still be held in Melbourne. Is it intended to shift that meeting from Melbourne to Canberra? If it is to be moved from Melbourne to Canberra, what will be the cost of that exercise and how can it be justified?</PARA>

Why should honourable senators in this place and the taxpayers of this country not know what is going on? What has the Government to hide? What has the money been spent on that the Minister will not tell honourable senators about in this place? By how much has the expenditure increased that the Government will not tell honourable senators in this place? What has been going on at Kirribilli House and the Lodge?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I have been maligned by the good Minister, perhaps I can explain to the people to whom the Minister was calling in such longing tones that the situation is that in 1976 the Prime Minister of this country, Mr Malcolm Fraser, was perfectly willing to give to the House of Representatives the information which we are now seeking. He gave that information in response to a question-allegedly without notice-from one of his own back benchers. We are now told by the Minister that the Senate, in 1981, cannot have that information because it is Government policy not to give that information. Why is it that in 1981 the situation is that the Government has decided that it is policy not to give that information when in 1976 it was perfectly willing to give that information for its own political purposes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We wish to know what has happened to the taxpayers' money in this area. It is a simple question. In the Budget context, I believe it is not a lot of money. It ill becomes the Minister, who has not been a member of this place for as long as he seems to think he has been, to suggest that in asking what has happened to the taxpayers' money we are holding up the Committee and that we are asking vexatious questions. We are asking questions which can be answered simply. If they cannot be answered simply there is no one keeping accounts in the residences we are talking about. If that information was available in 1976-without notice-in the House of Representatives, it should be available in debate on the Appropriation Bills in this chamber in 1981, with plenty of notice. </PARA>
<PARA> Why should we not ask for it and why should the Minister, with all his seniority and all his experience in this place, cast aspersions on people in this place who seek that information? Why should his colleague, who is sitting behind him, sit and sneer when she so often cries for information in this place? Why should we not have the information? Not only are we not given the information, but the only reason we are given for not getting it is that it is Government policy not to give such information. Why is it Government policy? Why is the Government, which claims that it is open to the people, which claimed it was going to open up politics in this country, not willing to give this simple information? We ask that question. We have repeatedly asked it. The Minister has either not replied or has stonewalled and cast aspersions on people on this side of the chamber. It is not satisfactory and, as I said before, it ill becomes a Minister of the Government to behave in such a way. </PARA>

I can recall the days before the establishment of Estimates committees when we met as a Committee of the Whole. I can recall one evening in this chamber when I asked the responsible Minister a question. He was a responsible Minister-not irresponsible like the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner). A sum of $10 had been spent. The Minister agreed-and the amount was in the Department of Air estimates-that it was a question he could not answer. He deferred consideration of that section of the Estimates until the information had been obtained. The sum involved was $10. Afterwards it was found that this sum had been spent near a Royal Australian Air Force depot in the Middle East to buy a push-bike for a local civilian. It was a legitimate expense. He was an honest Minister who decided that he would hold up consideration of the Estimates rather than be in a situation in which he would refuse to answer a question.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;(Western Australia) (9.26)-For the benefit of those radio listeners who may have just tuned in and for the benefit of those Government members whose concentration spans are very limited, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) has been asked the cost of maintaining the four official establishments on an individual basis. After a great deal of prevarication he said that he did not have that information on hand. He added that even if he did have the information on hand, he would not disclose it. That answer has come from the representative of a Prime Minister who, in 1976, not only provided that information but also was able to provide it ostensibly in reply to a question without notice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That brings me back to the question I asked before the division. If that information is not available, why is it not available? The inescapable conclusion is that it is not available because either the Minister does not want to get it or the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has told him that he is not allowed to get it. The Prime Minister was able to supply this information, ostensibly in response to a question without notice, in 1976 but refuses to supply the same information in 1981. That is the sort of background which, I suppose, one would expect from a Prime Minister who, three weeks after the recommendations of the razor gang were brought down, three weeks after an allegedly ruthless exercise in cutting superfluous government expenditure, took a VIP trip to Armidale-a VIP trip being a prime ministerial journey in a special Royal Australian Air Force aircraft-to buy a bull. </PARA>

This should not be an emotional debate. I do not think there is any special desire to embarrass the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner). The important point is that we have responsibilities as elected politicians under the Westminster system. The Government alone is not responsible for expenditure. All parliamentarians are responsible for every cent of taxpayers' money spent. It is a responsibility that we have to honour and that we have to carry out. An appropriation may come before us which may or may not be justified.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In this case we are asked to allocate an extra $27,000 for official establishments. We find that nearly $1m was allocated for official establishments in the 1980-81 Budget as against a far lesser amount in the 1978-79 Budget. In the last Budget the expenditure for official establishments was increased tremendously. That may or may not have been justified. Obviously not enough money was appropriated. Another $27,000 is required. It may be justified. But whether we belong to the Australian Labor Party or the Liberal Party, surely we should not be prepared to spend taxpayers' money-we have a solemn obligation to protect taxpayers' money and to see that it is spent wisely-unless we know where the expenditure is going and for what reason it is being made. That is what honourable senators on this side of the chamber want to know. That is what all the questions have been about. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not good enough for a Minister to say that he does not know where money is going or that he will try to find out the necessary information.

He could say that we should vote so much for a certain purpose. Are we carrying out our responsibilities if we vote for such an appropriation without knowing whether it is a justifiable expenditure?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When I first came into this Parliament in 1963 we had a big debate when only one appropriation Bill was presented to the Parliament. It included capital expenditure and expenditure for the ordinary annual services of the Government. A protest was made in this Parliament and a vote was taken on the question. It was found that the Parliament considered that it was not a proper presentation of official accounts because the Senate is limited in its inability to amend money Bills only if they are for the ordinary annual expenditure of the Commonwealth and not if the Commonwealth wants to make an expenditure for any other purpose. The then Treasurer, Mr Holt, gave an undertaking that in future two appropriation Bills would be introduced, one containing the ordinary annual expenditure and the other containing other expenditure. </PARA>
<PARA> I now question the extra expenditure sought for official establishments. If it is sought to cover an increase in the wages of employees at the official establishments it would be covered by ordinary annual expenditure. If it is sought to cover some alterations or enlargement of the establishments it should not be included in Appropriation Bill (No. 3). On one occasion an appropriation was sought to put in a new window at the Governor-General's house. We had no say in whether it was justified. I think the then Governor-General condemned the window because every time he looked out it he saw the tower on Black Mountain, which he could not stand. </PARA>
<PARA> We must not forget our responsibilities. This matter goes across party lines. Honourable senators opposite cannot tell me that members of the Liberal Party are immune from their responsibilities to their electors. They know they are not. I would like one honourable senator opposite to justify spending taxpayers' moneys for, which they are custodians, when they are not aware of what that money is to be expended on. That is the whole issue. I think the Minister is in an extremely difficult situation. I think he should report to his superiors. According to our oath of office it is essential that we insist this information be supplied. If the Minister is not permitted to supply it I think another Minister who will supply the information should be appointed to attend to these particular appropriations. The Minister says: 'I do not have the answer to the question but I will get it.' That is all right so long as we get the answer before we vote on the appropriation. We should not vote to appropriate money for any department on a Minister's assurance that he will supply certain information after we have voted on the appropriation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Every single cent. In 1976 the present Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), who uses these establishments, was willing, in answer to a question, allegedly without notice, to give information about the running of those establishments to the House of Representatives. The information was freely available in 1976 and, in the words of the Prime Minister at that time, it was available because the public had a right to know. The members of the Committee are now asking for a breakdown of that expenditure. The only answer we can get from the Minister is that he will not give it to us because it is not Government policy to do so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That answer should not be satisfactory to any senator on either side of this chamber, particularly in view of the fact that the Prime Minister, a few short years ago, was willing to give that information not only to this chamber but also to the other chamber and to the people of this country. Even though an amount of only $27,000 is sought, we should not be willing to pass this appropriation in the light of the Minister's answer. I am aware that the Minister is not answering on his own behalf. I am aware that he is being instructed by the Prime Minister, through the gentlemen who are advising him in this chamber tonight. But that is no excuse. We have asked the questions. Every member of the community can find out what every member of this chamber earns. The community knows what our salaries and allowances are. That information is publicised freely through the documents of this Parliament and the Press. There is no reason why every member of the community and every member of this Parliament should not know what it costs to run the Government establishments. To be told that the only reason we cannot know is that it is not Government policy to let us know is the absolute opposite of democracy. It is the absolute opposite of what this chamber and this Parliament are all about. </PARA>
<PARA> I join Senator Cavanagh, Senator Chipp, Senator Walsh and others who have spoken tonight in asking for simple answers to simple questions about amounts of money which are absolutely insignificant in the total context of the Budget of the Commonwealth of Australia but which, despite their minuteness, are absolutely essential in maintaining democracy and public accountability in this country and the rights of this Parliament and, through this Parliament, the rights of the taxpayers of this country, to know what is done with the taxpayers' money. I just ask the Minister and his ministerial colleague to think really about the answer that has been given. If we allow this sort of answer to go through, as Senator Cavanagh has said, we could get the same answer to questions in relation to all sorts of other appropriations. We could get the same answer in relation to the Department of Social Security, the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the Department of Primary Industry and all the other departments. The relevant Minister could say: 'It is not Government policy that you should know'. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not only the Opposition but also the Government that does not know these facts. I must point out that the only people on the Government side of this chamber at the moment are the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume), the Minister for Veterans' Affairs and the Government Whip. The rest of the Government senators will not sit there and put up with the embarrassment of what is happening in this chamber tonight. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs may be happy enough with this situation in which he finds himself. I certainly would not be, and I do not believe that anyone else in his situation should be happy. </PARA>

I am advised that changes were made to make the beds collapsable and that this was done to provide more working space and not to improve or alter the accommodation facilities. I have been listening to the debate about the apportionment of costs for the official residences. It seems to me that certain facts are available. An enormous amount of information has been provided about the aggregate costs of the official residences. I do not think that anyone is in any way questioning the fact that the aggregate costs for the official residence are shown function by function. They are shown between pages 14 and 18 of the explanatory notes. More details are given in Appropriation Bill (No. 1), which shows the costs of all the different functions of the official residences.

The practice which we are following on this matter and which has been set out to the Senate is the practice which has been followed by numerous governments for a long time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator may say that it is not relevant but I am stating the reasoning which Mr Whitlam put forward, which is the reasoning that we are putting forward today unchanged. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For many years, successive Governments have followed the principle that costs of the four official establishments-Government House, Admiralty House, Kirribillie House and the Prime Minister's Lodge-should be regarded as a total charge against the annual Budget appropriation. Each year the Budget papers show the total commitment for maintaining all four residences. Both estimated costs for the ensuing year and actual costs for the preceeding 12 months are given. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the principle which has been followed over many, many years by governments of which Senator Chipp was a member and of which honourable senators opposite were members. It was enunciated very clearly by Mr Whitlam and it is the practice which we are following tonight. I believe the people who have to live in these official residences-I am thinking particularly of the Governor-General and the residences he occupies-do not have an easy life; they do not have much privacy. I think there are good grounds for each of the governments which have taken this view doing so. Over a number of years governments of all political persuasions have taken this view. If there are particular expenditures about which senators want to know, if they put their questions to us-I cannot answer their questions at the present time and I am not even sure whether we can get the answers-we could see what information could be provided. But the practice which has been followed for many years by governments of all persuasions, by people from all the parties in the Parliament, seems to us to be an appropriate practice to continue to follow. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am quite amazed at Senator Baume's explanation, although it takes us at least part of the way along the road to what we are trying to find out. He must know that his Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) repudiated that agreement in 1976 when he decided to expose everything in an effort to denigrate the former Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam. A few moments ago we had a visit from Senator Carrick, the senior minister in this chamber. He came into the chamber with a very disgusted look on his face because of the way in which his two junior Ministers are handling the business of this chamber, and he walked out again. Quite obviously he does not want anything to do with their embarrassment tonight in this chamber. It is beyond comprehension that, except for one backbencher, the Government benches are deserted. The Government Whip and two very junior Ministers are trying to hide the dishonest things that this Government is doing. The Government is dishonest.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Prime Minister, whose estimates we are trying to debate, gave approval for two senior backbenchers, Mr Jull and Senator Collard, to accept private money to visit America in order to compile enough information to give a certain private consortium the benefit of their experience and knowledge that they gain.

Yet we have in the chamber junior Ministers who are hiding what is going on in the Department of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet. This involves taxpayers' money. The Government is not prepared to allow this matter to be exposed, because somewhere dishonesty is going on. The taxpayers of this country are facing another big problem, and that is the sending of six backbenchers and six Ministers, carrying little gold embossed invitations, to attend a conference to be held later this year at Captains Flat or Bungendore or somewhere else. As my colleague Senator Georges said, arrangements are being made so that the conference will not be held in Melbourne. The Minister who gave approval for the episode that I mentioned a while ago is getting out of this Parliament. Why is he getting out? Is it because there are so many things that have been lined up to compensate him for the loss of his funeral parlours? What of the consent that has been given to this illegal visit by two backbenchers who at least had the grace to withdraw from the trip to America?</PARA></TALK.START>

The honourable senator has no right to object to any honourable senator on this side of the chamber calling his Prime Minister corrupt.

There comes a stage in the activities of an individual when he is not treated with kid gloves or presented with bouquets, when sometimes there is justification for saying things that would not normally be said. Senator Keeffe, I think, led with a series of illustrations, all pointing to the fact that there was corruption and he assessed that the leader of this corruption was the Prime Minister. He then expressed the statement 'led by your corrupt Prime Minister' but he had established the foundation leading up to that statement.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Temporary Chairman. I suggest that Senator Kilgariff go to see the people who look after hearing aids as soon as possible. I made my attitude to this quite clear. One cannot get down on one's hand and knees and crawl across to Senator Kilgariff's benches and say 'Sorry, Bernie'. It is just not on. His action is a diversion to try to hold up our consideration of the Estimates. If the Minister in charge of the chamber at the moment were prepared to be an honest Government Minister, upstanding with some ideals left-he has lost a lot since he became a Minister-he would say: 'Fair enough, let us have another look at this; let us come back with the answers tomorrow'. The people on this side of the chamber are going to be accused of holding up the consideration. I again say that the Labor Party senators have not held up the consideration in this chamber at all. We came here for two weeks in February but the Government had no business for us to deal with. The Prime Minister was not prepared to allow his senators to go home. He was not prepared to allow people like Senator Withers to go out to organise themselves against him. So he kept them all here where he could keep an eye on them. In fact, for about only half of this session this chamber has done a worthwhile job. The other half of the time we have been held here could have been used in doing more profitable work for the people in our own areas for which we are responsible political representatives. Now we come to the crunch-the end of the session. I forecast that Prime Minister Fraser will keep us here till midnight on 30 June 1981 because he lives in fear of the Chippocrats. He lives in fear--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to get to the point of this matter. I wish to ask the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume), who is the second Minister who has dealt with this subject tonight, just what is the answer that is being given to the Opposition. We have asked for the detailed breakdown of the costs of running these Prime Ministerial establishments. We were told by Senator Messner, the Minister who preceded this Minister, on roster I understand, that we could not have this information because it was not Government policy to give this information. We have been told, I believe, by the Minister in charge of the chamber at the moment, that we are not to be given this information because Mr Whitlam did not give this information in 1974. I make the point that Mr Fraser was perfectly happy to give this information in another House in 1976. If the Government persists in not giving us the information, will the Minister please tell us why? Is it because it is Government policy? In that case, it is completely unsatisfactory, I believe, to this chamber. Is it because the Government has now suddenly taken up the attitude that Mr Whitlam had, and with which we may not agree, in 1974? If that is so, why is the Government turning its back on the attitude of its own Prime Minister, whose establishments these are, in giving this information in 1976?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have been given the run around here tonight. I believe it is a simple principle that this House deserves to be told what is happening with public money. It is not a very large amount of public money. I believe if we are not to be told-whether we accept that is up to this chamber, I believe-at least we ought to be given consistent reasons why we should not be told in this place. We certainly have not been given them tonight. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to put this matter into some order. I do not see the Whitlam guidelines as setting out a prohibition on the provision of information. I thought we could agree with the Whitlam guidelines as read out. As I understood the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) when he read them out, information will be supplied on the individual costs of the four establishments. That is what we are asking now. The response of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) was hopeless and he arrogantly told us that it was not government policy to give any answer. Therefore, I raise the question. We have a responsibility. We must have the answers before we can vote taxpayers' money. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, on taking over responsibility in the chamber, somewhat repudiated the remarks of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs. He knew the weaknesses of the Minister and cleared the matter up as best he could. He gave an answer which I thought, to an extent, was satisfactory. He said that the expenditure on the four establishments is provided. He said that the answer to the questions is not yet known but that he would obtain the information and provide it to us. This is a complete repudiation of the statement that the information is available. It is not known at present. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs does not have it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That answer is satisfactory except for the fact that surely as I expressed before, knowing our responsibility and our right as custodians of taxpayers' money, before we vote $27,000 we should have the answers which the Minister said he will get. It is a question of adjourning this appropriation until after consideration of some other appropriations so that we do not delay the proceedings. Then he can supply that information. This permits us to carry out our responsibility. It gives the Government a clean sheet to say: 'We made everything available to you, now vote it or reject it'. I think, bearing in mind the fairness of the Minister, he could say that he could do his best and give the information to us before the appropriations are completed, and we could proceed. That would end the argument. It would delay this appropriation until the other appropriations were dealt with. I do not think it is a question of reporting progress, it is a question of adjourning this appropriation until the consideration of other appropriations is concluded. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Temporary Chairman, thank you for the call at last. As I was the senator who raised this matter earlier tonight, I found it very difficult to answer some of the assertions made previously by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) and now by Senator Peter Baume, who apparently did not hear my remarks earlier. If he had he would not have come into the chamber and quoted from what he termed the Whitlam bible as to the setting down of guidelines for expenditure on the four government establishments. We know that the expenditures on Kirribilli House, the Lodge, Admiralty House and Government House are all lumped together. At no time have I or any other senator on this side asked for the breakdown of the expenditure on Government House or Admiralty House. I think those are the four establishments in question. We have asked persistently-I have done so since 1976-about this matter. Doing a quick mental calculation tonight, I note that this is the ninth time that I have sought this information in the Committee of the Whole, quite apart from seeking it at Estimates committee hearings, over the years. It is no good the Minister saying in here tonight that the information is not available and that he might get it for us and provide it to us later. Of course, once the vote is passed that is it. We are being fobbed off when it is not available. We will raise the matter again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What I am upset about is that Senator Baume quoted the guidelines of Mr Whitlam. After quoting them to everyone who was listening to the Parliament tonight he said that his Government has religiously followed those guidelines except on one extreme occasion. What was that extreme occasion? Senator Baume knows. It has been said over and over in this chamber. It is on the record, it is in the Hansard, it is everywhere. I will state again, in order to put people's minds at rest and to give the contrary point of view to what was put tonight, the remarks of Mr Fraser in the House of Representatives on 24 March 1976. </PARA>

<PARA> My question is directed to the Prime Minister. Can he inform the House of the cost last year of running the Lodge and Kirribilli House?</PARA>
<PARA>Right off the top of his head Mr Fraser was able to tell the House of Representatives what it cost. Yet these questions have been posed to Ministers one after the other in this place for the last five years, and they cannot tell us. They had warning about it. They are warned every year that it will come up. They know it will come up. Senator Messner even said tonight that I should know that I will not get an answer, but I will persist until I get it. Senator Baume can rest assured of that. That is why the taxpayers pay me, to ferret out where their money has been wasted by a very extravagant Prime Minister. It is quite all right for Mr Fraser to say Mr Whitlam was extravagant. He said:</PARA>

<PARA> But I think that a few people have a right to know and a few people have a right to be able to understand. </PARA>
<PARA>Again I agree with Mr Fraser's words. That is what I have been trying to do for the last six years. Mr Fraser went on:</PARA>
<PARA> Both places were costing the Australian taxpayer $280,000 and, since I thought that this was much too great a subvention by the Australian taxpayer to house the Prime Minister of this country, it is one of the significant reasons that Kirribilli was returned to its proper purpose as a residence which can be used by distinguished overseas guests who come to this country and not as a second house provided by the taxpayer for the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>I put two questions earlier tonight. I wanted to know the period of occupancy by this Prime Minister of Kirribilli House. The other one is the persistent question: What is it costing the taxpayer to maintain the Lodge? We cannot get the answer. It was quite convenient for Mr Fraser to castigate Mr Whitlam for what it was costing the taxpayer when he was the occupant. Of course, it is not convenient now to reveal to the public at large what it is costing the taxpayer to keep Mr Fraser over there. If it is good enough for Mr Fraser to use the words which I have just cited-I have hurled them back at the people who sit opposite-it is good enough for people on this side of the chamber to want to know what it is now costing while he occupies it. That is a simple question. Surely the accounting of the Government must be in a terrible shambles if the officers who are here tonight from the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet cannot tell us what it is costing. </PARA>

I am very disturbed when I look around-I have said this before in the Parliament-and at a quick count I see that 25 of the top Commonwealth public servants have been sitting in this chamber since 8 o'clock. It is now 20 past 10. They have had to sit here while we tried to get two simple answers. How often does the Prime Minister use Kirribilli House? He is on record as saying it would never be used by the Prime Minister; he was changing the whole concept of it; it was only for overseas visitors. The Minister could quite easily have told the chamber tonight that the Prime Minister has not used it at all, or if he has used it for a week, a fortnight or three weeks, he could have told us. We would have been satisfied tonight, for the purpose of examining these appropriations, if the Government had told us how much it cost to keep the Prime Minister installed at the Lodge. Of course, we know that it has cost an enormous amount because so many kitchen cabinet meetings have been held there, in the last six months especially.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Life was not meant to be easy. That is what the Prime Minister said. It is certainly not meant to be easy for the taxpayers of this country, particularly those on the lower incomes, but obviously it is meant to be very easy for the Prime Minister because he will not divulge to the taxpayers how much they have to fork out of their pockets to keep him at the Lodge in luxury. It may well be that if the Prime Minister were prepared to tell the Parliament what it was costing we would not have an argument about it. I put a similar question earlier. Did the Government provide the immediately previous Governor-General with a free telephone service from London to Australia? Of course, the Government will not tell us. We know that he has it or the Government would say: 'No, he hasn't one.' We do not know what it costs the taxpayers because the Government will not tell us. Nor do we know what it is costing to have Mr Fraser installed at the Lodge, again because the Government will not tell us. He was quite prepared, in an effort to embarrass Mr Whitlam, to tell the public at large what it cost to keep Mr Whitlam there during the last six months for which he was Prime Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What do Government senators think we are on this side of the House? We have been here for two hours and 10 minutes-we dealt quickly with the appropriations brought on before the dinner adjournment-in an endeavour to extract from the Government two simple answers. It is quite obvious to the people at large that when Senator Peter Baume came into the chamber and quoted the guidelines laid down by Mr Whitlam he was trying to draw a red herring across the trail. I did not think that he would endeavour to do that. Had he been listening to the earlier stages of this debate he would not have done so because he would have known that his contention has been refuted. No matter what he says, or how often he quotes those guidelines, he cannot alter the fact that the Prime Minister, his own leader, broke the guidelines and set a precedent so that we, in turn, want to know what it was costing him to occupy the Lodge. We will continue to seek that information. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said tonight, at about a quarter past eight, if we do not get those answers before the next election we will certainly get them after it. We will not need to present a Dorothy Dix question to our new Prime Minister. He will make to the Parliament a statement as to what it cost the taxpayers of this country to keep Mr Fraser installed at the Lodge during his five and a half, six or seven years of occupancy. Those figures will be revealed and they will not be very nice either, because the Government has tried to cover them up for such a long period. Such action represents complete dishonesty. Labor was accused of being dishonest in government but its accusers were unable to prove their statements. However, the present Government, by its attitude toward this question alone tonight and since it assumed office, leaves us with no alternative to accusing it of being dishonest. I repeat, it was quite prepared to reveal the cost of the last six months of occupancy of the Lodge by Mr Whitlam but ever since it has tried to cover up the situation and has backed its stand by quoting the guidelines set down by Mr Whitlam. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee ought to adopt Senator Cavanagh's suggestion and pass over this item in the appropriations for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. It should proceed to a consideration of the other groups that we must deal with tonight. It should not take a vote on the matter now before us. Let us do that tomorrow after Ministers have consulted the Prime Minister and have read in the Press the reaction of the people of this country to this big cover-up. </PARA>
<PARA> I repeat, honourable senators have only to look at today's copy of the Australian to see what a shambles the Liberal Party is in in this country, especially in Western Australia, Victoria and New South Wales. One has only to see the way in which my own State of South Australia is rapidly going bankrupt under a Liberal Government. When the people read tomorrow of the way in which the number two man in this country-as Senator Grimes said tonight, the number one man is the Governor-General and the number two man is the Prime Minister-is trying to cover the expenditure of taxpayers' money they will see it as nothing short of a scandal and a gross piece of dishonesty. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to discuss an item that relates to the expenditure by the Department of Finance. I have raised the matter several times in the last two and a half years and it is one that the Government has said it has considered. At times Ministers have even commended it mildly, but the years have passed and nothing has happened. I wonder whether we could be given a progress report concerning it. I refer to some means of redesigning or changing our bank notes so that various denominations may be identified by touch. This is a matter which affects tens of thousands of disabled Australians. I refer to those who are so unfortunate as to be blind. This is a year, I thought, in which we were supposed to be doing special things for, and making special concessions to, disabled people. I had hoped that as the year wore on the Government might give some consideration to this important matter or some indication that it would have regard for the special position of these people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One point that has been made in this year of the disadvantaged is that it is absolutely essential that disabled persons be able to control as much as possible the environment in which they live; that it is vital to their dignity, comfort and general joy of living that these things should be made possible. I have been in touch with many blind people, and virtually every organisation for the blind in Australia on this matter. They all support it and point out that our present bank notes are quite difficult to identify by touch because the difference in size between them is not sufficient. They say that blind people throughout Australia are placed in a totally demeaning situation in which they are forced to trust people with whom they transact business as to whether they are given the correct change. It is quite reasonable to expect that from time to time they do not receive it. A number of other countries, such as Holland and Switzerland, have long enjoyed this civilised facility. I should like to know why the Government looks at an idea like this, says that it is a good one several times over nearly three years, yet continues to do absolutely nothing about it. I hope that the Minister who is in charge of the Committee, Senator Chaney, will not tell me again that this is something that is fine, that the Government is thinking about it and give me no better account of it than that. </PARA>

<PARA> I have asked a question about compensation because I want to refer to one of the most scandalous episodes that has ever taken place in the history of this country. I refer to what happened with regard to compensation for the people who were bombed at the Hilton Hotel in Sydney last time a similar meeting was held. The shopkeepers in the Hilton Hotel were compensated very quickly for the loss of their takings as a result of that bombing. But what happened about compensation for the dependants of the members of the Municipal and Shire Council Employees Union who were killed in that bombing? As a result of pressure from this side of the chamber and from such people as the Honourable Peter McMahon, M.L.C., who was general secretary of the union in New South Wales, the families and dependants of the people killed were helped by collections taken up by the union throughout New South Wales. I must say that finally the Federal Government adequately compensated those families, but it took years and a lot of pressure from this side of the chamber. The shopkeepers in the Hilton Hotel were compensated very early on. I would like to know whether the proprietors of the Lakeside Hotel are to be compensated if the whole of the hotel is to be closed. We would like to know whether that is a fact and how much it will cost. </PARA>

In spite of the fact that Senator Lewis said that there is no accommodation, plenty of accommodation and plenty of chambers are available. If necessary, the conference can be held in this place and in the place across the road. There is no reason why that could not be done. Is there a possibility that the conference will be transferred from Melbourne to here? What cost is likely to be involved? I know that the Minister cannot give me that answer with regard to cost straightaway, but there must be some calculations to indicate whether the amount of money requested in these Estimates may not be sufficient. If it is not sufficient, to what extent does the Minister believe it will be extended?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On reflection, Mr Temporary Chairman, I think it might be better if I were to put on the record all the questions which I want to ask. Just to give the officers, who I presume are present, an opportunity to alert themselves, I point out that they pertain to parliamentary and ministerial staff and services-I have asked one such question already-and also to the Government Information Unit. I am not apologising for asking these questions now but I will explain why I am doing so now. I know that it would have been more appropriate to ask these questions in Estimates Committee C. It was my intention to ask them in Estimates Committee C on 27 April, but I was told by the Opposition Whip, who had been told by the Government late on the afternoon of Friday, 24 April, that Estimates Committee C would not sit on the Monday if the then air strike was still on. The air strike was still on; it was not settled until, I think, about the next Thursday. But because I had been inaccurately informed by the Government, through the Opposition Whip, I neither came to Canberra for the Monday hearing of the Estimates Committee, nor did I hand on the questions to anybody else who was at the hearing. I did not find out until the Tuesday after the Committee had sat that it had in fact sat.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having made that explanation, I will proceed with the questions. In addition to the question I have asked about the definition of a major political party in the context in which it appears in the explanatory notes, I ask: What staff are provided, other than the normal staff provided to any member of the Senate, to the Australian Democrats senators and Senator Harradine? What classifications do those staff have? Were the positions available upgraded at the same time as the Government positions were upgraded?</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the Government Information Unit, can the Senate be supplied with the names, classifications and salaries of all employees of the Government Information Unit-including the Federal information directors-the location of those employees, how the employees were engaged, that is, whether they were engaged under the Public Service Act, and information on whether the jobs were advertised? What conditions apply to public servants who take up positions in the Government Information Unit, and do they remain in the Commonwealth employees superannuation scheme?</PARA>
<PARA> Who would have the authority to dismiss Vincent Matthews? Likewise, who would have the authority to dismiss Laurie Power? If any Government Information Unit employees have been dismissed, on whose initiative have they been dismissed in each case, if there were any cases? On whose authority is travel undertaken by Mr Laurie Power, Mr Vincent Matthews and Mr Verbickis? Whose signature appears on travelling allowance claim forms for the three Government Information Unit officers named, that is, Mr Power, Mr Matthews and Mr Verbickis? Which officers, if any, of the Government Information Unit may claim payment for overtime worked? Who signs or authorises the overtime claims in each case if the question is applicable? How many officers of the Government Information Unit were previously employed within the Public Service or in other positions? Who signed the job offers for Messrs Matthews, Power and Verbickis before each commenced employment?</PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to division 140.2.01, Travelling and Subsistence-Within Australia, which can be found on page 111 of the explanatory notes. Again, these questions are relevant to the Government Information Unit and are really an extension of a question I asked earlier; that is, who authorises travelling allowance for the three officers-Messrs Matthews, Verbickis, and Power-and for any other officers to whom it may be applicable? Likewise, when cars are hired by those three gentlemen or by any other officers to whom the question is applicable, what hirer code is used? Does the Government Information Unit have its own separate code or is the code of a Minister used? What are the car hire entitlements of employees of the Government Information Unit? I mentioned before, and I do so again in case it was not so regarded by the Department, that for the purposes of those questions I include as members of the Government Information Unit the Federal information directors. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are all the questions I have, Mr Temporary Chairman. I realise that it could take some time to obtain answers to those questions. I am not sure how long the Senate will sit tonight. From earlier information, I gather that it is likely to sit until 12 o'clock. I hope that answers can be provided before the Senate rises tonight, but if not--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer to the Department of Administrative Services estimates, division 130.5.02-Contract cleaning. There has been an increase of 6.6 per cent in costs, and the explanation given is that the increase is needed because of an increase of the labour content of some contracts. Since the estimates were dealt with, I have learnt that all watchmen cleaners in the Customs House in Melbourne and in the Treasury Place offices in Melbourne have been or are about to be sacked. They are being sacked so that Wormald Security can take over the watchman duties. Perhaps the same firm will take over the cleaning services. I want to know whether these increases in cost have anything to do with the fact that contracts have now been let to those firms to do the work for which these men and women were once employed. I would like to know what the difference in cost is now that contracts have been let to those firms as against the cost of the watchmen cleaners and cleaners who were employed in those areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When we talk about the difference in cost, can we include in that the cost of the unemployment benefit that will have to be paid to the people who have been sacked? Some of the people who told me they have been sacked or are about to be sacked include a man of 55 who will be eligible for a Service pension when he is 60 and who has no way of earning his living for the five years in between and a man of 57 who will get no pension until he turns 65 and can see no way of earning a living in the eight years in between. I suggest that the amount of unemployment benefit that will have to be paid to those people should be taken as a cost in these cleaning and security arrangements. In the course of being provided with the information about the difference in costs and what is to happen to these people, I also would like to be informed of what arrangements is it suggested will be made by the Department of Administrative Services to administer Customs House in Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA> It is an area where Federal members have their offices and Federal members who do not have their offices there, as well as those who do, use the area to interview people and to hold conferences with people. These members are in the habit of using this area after ordinary office hours when, presumably, the building will now be closed. Up to this point there has always been a watchman to let one in and out. I would also like to know where else these private security firms are to be used. Up till now we have had Commonwealth policemen guarding, for instance, the home of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) at Nareen. Are the private security services to be used in that area? Is the cost of that security included in the estimates of the Department of Administrative Services?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the sort of detailed question which one might be able to answer at an Estimates committee when a substantial number of officers who are concerned with detailed matters are present. The officers who are here are actually waiting for the consideration of estimates of other departments. A number of officers from the Department of Administrative Services are present but they are not conversant with the matters the honourable senator has raised. Again I will simply have to indicate that I will seek that information for the honourable senator as soon as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will pick up one point in what the honourable senator said. If there has been a change from employees to contract cleaning I think one can assume that the contract cleaners will also be employing men or women in that task so that, in fact, human beings will be employed in that work. In terms of any estimate of what additional costs might be incurred by the Commonwealth with respect to people who cease to be employed and go on to unemployment benefit, that cost could be only guessed because the decision of whether any benefits are payable is contingent upon the subsequent work history of those people-whether they obtain similar or other employment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a further question dealing with the same matter. It relates to a question I placed on the Notice Paper on 3 March. I am more than somewhat surprised that at this time, with the Parliament drawing to a close, I have not yet received an answer. It is Question No. 394 in which I sought information about the proportion of hire cars and the amount paid for hire cars. A whole list of detailed questions are asked. My question arose mainly from an answer given to Mr Morris to Question No. 310. That answer, which was given to Mr Morris on 25 February, caused me some concern. That was the reason I placed my question on the Notice Paper. Some time has lapsed-April and May-and it is very nearly three months since I placed that question on the Notice Paper. As yet I have not received an answer. I hoped that I would have received it before we considered the Department of Administrative Services in the Committee of the Whole so that I could pursue the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There was one pertinent question I wanted to ask which the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) might be able to answer tonight even if he does not have the full details. It arises out of part of the answer given to Mr Morris. The answer referred to the cost of Government cars at the ordinary rate of $15.60 an hour and a special rate which applies when a Commonwealth car is specially requested. I want to know which members of parliament and public servants have the right to request a Commonwealth car as against a taxi or a hire car. The Minister would be aware that on many occasions in this Parliament I have objected to the use of taxis and hire cars while Commonwealth drivers, whom we look upon as being very reliable and trustworthy, are sitting at home. The staff is being allowed to run down through natural depletion such as retirement, death and one thing and another. These drivers are not being replaced. </PARA>
<PARA> I have expressed concern in this chamber for quite a period that we might come to the stage where the whole of the transport section, not only in Canberra but also in other areas, will be taken over by private enterprise-by taxis and by hire cars. I think I have expressed my concern about this matter in view of the fact that many public servants are moonlighting on taxis. These people are already on the Government payroll. When I go to get into my car at night to go home I find when I ask a question of some of these people, that they are already on the Government payroll. I asked a young chap whether he drove taxis full time. He said: 'No, I work for Senator Carrick'. At the time Senator Carrick was the Minister for Education. One of his staff was moonlighting on a taxi. Our Commonwealth drivers are very reliable and courteous to us. They know our needs and they know where we reside. Those chaps are not allowed to avail themselves of overtime and they are not being replaced. This is of great concern to me. That is why I put that question on notice. I want to know in particular who has the right to specify that he wants a Commonwealth car. If we, as senators, have that right I am sure that all honourable senators would prefer to be transported by a Commonwealth car rather than by a taxi. In Canberra taxis are licensed to carry the ordinary citizens. When I first raised this matter I had people contact me who said: 'I am very pleased you raised this matter because when we come out of the pictures or a play at night in Canberra we have to stand in the cold, on many occasions when Parliament is sitting, to wait for a taxi to take us home'. Honourable senators will be aware that under the pine trees opposite Parliament House there is a great line of taxis waiting for a government job. Their job is to serve the residents of Canberra. They are supposed to provide a service. That is what they are licensed for. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Prior to the division I had nearly finished my remarks. I was expressing my concern about the rundown of Commonwealth drivers and the replacement of them with taxi drivers. I have nothing against taxi drivers, but I object to the fact that people who are already in receipt of a very good income as members of the Public Service are moonlighting by driving taxis at night when Commonwealth drivers are being deprived of that work. We ought to be recruiting more drivers. This would alleviate some of the high unemployment. I reiterate that all honourable senators-this applies to honourable senators on the other side of the chamber-have complained when they have left late at night and have to wait for a car because one is not available.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said, I have no objection to taxis as such. They are here for a purpose. The reason that they are licensed in the Australian Capital Territory is to serve the needs of the citizens not members of Parliament. Whilst taxi drivers are at the rank waiting to carry members of Parliament and staff home at night they are not available to ordinary citizens who may want to make use of them. That is why I express concern. I hope that eventually some notice will be taken of the plea that I have made here over the years. No taxi or hire car manned by a public servant who is moonlighting should be given work by the Government. In view of the very high rate of unemployment I think it is most necessary that the Government and the Department of Administrative Services, before engaging cars, should ascertain whether taxi proprietors and hire care proprietors are employing public servants to drive their cars. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not aware of who is entitled specially to request a Commonwealth car. Of the last three cars I have had from the car pool, one was a hire car, one was a taxi and one was a Commonwealth car. I found that they all got me to my destination with equal facility. The honourable senator made a series of suggestions for the Minister for Administrative Services (Mr Newman) with respect to the administration of the car pool. I will refer those suggestions to the Minister for his attention.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) back to the answer he gave me about the watchmen-cleaners. I understand that he may not have the staff available to give some fine detail but I cannot believe that with the advisers he must have available from the Department of Administrative Services he cannot tell me whether the watchmen-cleaners in Victoria have been sacked. I cannot believe that it would take a great deal of time and trouble to get an answer to that question. I do not believe that the Minister cannot tell me whether contracts have been let to do the work that those people used to do in Victoria.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not think it is very smart for the Minister to say that we cannot take into account the unemployment benefit that may have to be paid to these people, because people will be used by the cleaning firms. People are at this moment employed by the cleaning firms and, presumably, the security and the cleaning firms that now have the contracts want more work for those people. The other point of which we are all aware, including those on the Government side, is that the jobs of a large number of people who work for these security and cleaning firms are second jobs. They finish a daytime job and then take up a night time job as cleaners and security people, mostly, of course, because they cannot live on the wages they get from their day jobs. I press the Minister for an answer. Have the watchmen-cleaners that were employed by the Commonwealth offices in Victoria been sacked? Has the work that they did up to this point been given to security and cleaning firms?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier tonight I requested that the estimates for the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet be left over but in view of the fact that we are awaiting the answers to many questions in relation to the Department of Administrative Services asked by Senator Melzer, Senator Walsh and me, I suggest that the vote on the estimates for group C be held over until tomorrow and that we pass on to another group tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been drawn to my attention that a precedent was set some years ago in relation to the information we have been seeking tonight, particularly in relation to the cost of the various government establishments. The now Mr Justice Murphy was then a member of the Senate. I was not here then. I dare say that had I been here I would have taken part in the debate. Information was sought about the use of VIP aircraft. That created quite a furore. I think Mr Howson, the then Minister for Air, was the responsible Minister. The Parliament was told repeatedly that the information sought was not available. Because of the persistence of members of the Opposition and in particular Senator Murphy, as he was then, Mr Gorton, who was then a senator and who went on to become the Prime Minister, finally relented and tabled the required documents. There has been no problem ever since. Twice a year the manifests for VIP flights are tabled in this Parliament. We have the opportunity to question the use of VIP aircraft, as I sometimes do. That precedent has been set. I think we are fast reaching a similar situation now in relation to the cost of running the Prime Minister's Lodge and Kirribilli House. We might well see a repeat of what happened during Mr Gorton's days in this chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. Mr Gorton went on to become Prime Minister. Unfortunately, I do not think Senator Chaney would like to follow in his footsteps. Mr Gorton was apparently too small a liberal for the Liberal Party. He was a man of the people. Of course, the Government to which Senator Chaney belongs is a long way from being a government of the people. Certainly, under Mr Fraser it is not a government of the people. I will not use the time of the Committee tonight to expand on that matter. I suggest to Senator Chaney that we postpone the vote on the estimates in group C until tomorrow, when we might be provided with the answers we are seeking, and pass on to group D, which comprises the estimates of the Department of Defence, the Department of Foreign Affairs, and the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. Otherwise we might find ourselves bogged down until a very late hour tonight, getting nowhere with group C. I make that suggestion to the Minister in all good faith.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was thinking about Senator McLaren's request to postpone consideration of group C Estimates as the honourable senator spoke. Any inclination I had to go along with it disappeared with the interjection by Senator Chipp. Now that I have been in government for a while, the last thing that I would want to contemplate is the fate that he suggested. The fact is that the bulk of the questions which have been asked and for which answers are not available tonight are of such a nature that they should have been asked before the appropriations were dealt with in this chamber. In my view they should have been asked in the Estimates Committee hearings. With respect to the detailed list of questions submitted by Senator Walsh, I accept that for reasons beyond Senator Walsh's control he was not able to put those questions in the Estimates Committee hearings. I do not think that was the Government's fault.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Chaney has opened up Pandora's box by saying that the questions that have been asked tonight in the Committee of the Whole should have been asked in the Estimates Committee hearings. Senator Chaney should know full well that when the Estimates Committees were first set up-he was not here and neither was I, but I have read Hansard and I have read Odgers' Australian Senate Practice-that there was an understanding in the Senate that no senator would be deprived of exploring any matter that he wished in the Committee of the Whole. It is physically impossible for all senators to attend every Estimates Committee hearing. It is being suggested that we can ask questions only at Estimates Committee hearings. If we are interested in the estimates for a department being considered by a committee which we cannot attend, we are to be gagged in the Committee of the Whole and told that we may not use this Parliament to seek information. I think the country is coming to a very sorry state.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My request tonight was a very simple one. The Minister does not have to have all the officers present tomorrow. I do not think that we will explore the matter any further than we have. If the Minister says tomorrow that we are not going to get the answers, as Senator Messner has said, we cannot go any further than that. We do not want to be bogged down. In view of the fact that we are seeking answers and, as my colleague Senator Cavanagh said tonight, that we are to be asked tonight to pass into law an expenditure of taxpayers' money without knowing where it is to be expended, we are asking that the vote on the estimates in group C be postponed until tomorrow or Friday or whenever we can deal with them. Let us get on with the other groups. I think I have put forward a very sensible proposal. If the Minister cannot agree to it, I for one will not be very co-operative in relation to the estimates for the other departments. I could be very awkward. I am not making a threat; I am just asking the Minister once again to acquiesce with this side of the Committee and assist the good working of this chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to ask a question about the Public Service Board. It has been drawn to my attention lately, that the Government, as this is the International Year of Disabled Persons, has a policy of encouraging people to employ disabled persons. Presumably the Commonwealth Public Service Board has been part of any such plan. How far has the Public Service Board got in its campaign to employ disabled people? How many disabled people have been taken into the Commonwealth Public Service in view of the staff ceilings and cutbacks that have been imposed by the Government in recent days? I would also like to know whether the Commonwealth Public Service is liaising with State public service boards in an effort to employ disabled people especially in view of the fact that it is using the Loan Council to impose staff ceilings on State public services.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The officers do not have the figures requested by the honourable senator. I advise the Committee that as part of the Government's efforts in the International Year of Disabled Persons the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs has been promoting a campaign specifically for the employment of disabled people in the private sector. I think that campaign started at the beginning of April and is proceeding with some success. I have not had my attention drawn to any specific figures within the public services, either Commonwealth or State. I think the matter which has been raised by the honourable senator is an important one. Like the other matter which was raised with respect to the currency, it is one which I am very glad to have drawn to my attention as Minister responsible for co-ordination. I will undertake to get the facts from the Public Service Board. I will go beyond that and ensure that the matter is listed for discussion at the next Ministers meeting so that the broader question raised by the honourable senator can also be discussed. If one draws a parallel between the special efforts which have been made with respect to the employment of Aboriginal people as against the special effort which is being promoted this year for the employment of disabled people one sees that there is a very clear parallel with the encouragement of employment in the public sector and in the private sector. Indeed employment in the public sector preceded the campaign conducted by the private sector. I am afraid I am not as well informed with respect to the particular point which has been raised, but I will get an answer and see that the matter is further pursued.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I suppose to speak at this time of the night is like coming on as a late second half replacement. I wish to deal with two matters which relate to the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. They also concern strictures similar to those applied earlier to Senate McLaren. I am seeking information that flows from answers that I received on Estimates Committee D hearings. I have not had an earlier opportunity to do so. The first matter relates to an answer to Question on Notice No. 623. The Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) has a copy in his hand. It dealt with the checkered career of a former Royal Candian Mounted Policeman Mr Stawiarski who was also suspected of having KGB links. Some weeks ago, when startling revelations were made in Britian about security breaches, I said to the Attorney-General (Senator Durack)-I was referring to a gentleman named Bennett who was a permanent resident in Perth and who never sought Australian citizenship; if he did he may not have got it-that we were becoming a latter day Botany Bay for peculiar people who may be spies who came in out of the cold or, in the case that I have mentioned, a spy who came out of the cold and went into it again. In the question to which I have referred I wanted to know how this gentleman got here as he had a dubious background.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the Minister looks at the copy of the answer that he has he will see that this gentleman, who was a Canadian national, arrived in Australia in 1976 with his family. In 1978 he returned to Canada and in November 1980 he was issued with security authority to re-enter Australia. Part 2 of the answer says that on 2 April 1981 he was convicted for what is called a breach of trust. From that wording I assume that it includes people like Sir Anthony Blunt and people of the establishment who have been proved to have been involved in espionage for foreign powers. I am not overdoing the James Bond approach, but I want to know why the Department of Immigration representative who interviewed this man in Ottawa made this mistake which sometimes happens with people who are supposed to come from impeccable backgrounds. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee knows that I raised a question regarding the former American legal mouthpiece for the mob in California named Wainwright. I think we had given Mr Wainwright approval to come here and that a Los Angeles court had indicted him. I think, the American terminology of a grand jury was mentioned. We have all heard of similar cases. I have a case of a person who wanted to get his father to come here from a European nation. Apparently the father had a weakness for souveniring car radios. He did not come here. A number of offences were involved. If we can detect a minor felony, how is it in this world of espionage that we get the dregs of ex-security people who have divided loyalties?</PARA>
<PARA> I would like the answer relating to this gentleman to be fleshed out. Did we make a false evaluation of him? I repeat that there seems to be a class assessment. The fellow in Europe happened to be a motor mechanic. I am not defending his standing habits. If a member of the legal fraternity a Canadian immigration officer, a Canadian mounted policeman or someone who apparently had some links with British security went bad, how are we conned into accepting such people when they get here? I am not satisfied with the situation regarding Mr Bennett who is also here from Canada. I would like more detailed information in relation to Question on Notice No. 623. Did we fail in our original assessment of this man? It is easy to get someone from Europe or South America if it is believed that he had a militant trade union background. But if a person comes from a top public schoolboy background in Britain or its equivalent in Canada we give him the benefit of the doubt. I might say that I speak with quite a bit of feeling on this subject because I, Senator Wheeldon and one or two other people who are no longer with us were members of the Townley Committee that did interview members of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. I will not go into the position in detail as it existed in those days but I do say that some of the material that I got was handed over to Justice Hope for use in his inquiry. I am confident that some of those double standards which applied in those days are no longer in existence. </PARA>
<PARA> But I do say, presuming we had ASIO operatives overseas-and we do have them-whoever we had in Canada was a misjudgment. Anybody who has read of some of the happenings that have occurred in Britain in respect of intelligence agents will know that it is not a question of loyalty; they are in it for what they can get. I suggest that we should not place any reliance on some of the defectors who come across to our side. They use the political system for their own advancement. When it gets sick of them and we make a better offer they want to be involved. I know that the responsible Minister on this particular subject has had the answer placed in Hansard. However, so that the readers of Hansard will know the full ramifications of what I am saying, I ask that it be incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The answer read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Durack-The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Mr Daniel Stawiarski (Starwairski) migrated to Australia in 1976 and left with his family in 1978 for Canada. In November 1980 he was issued with authority to re-enter Australia which has been cancelled. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) Mr Stawairski was convicted under the Criminal Code of the Province of British Columbia, Canada for a ''Breach of Trust'' in connection with the duties of his office. He commenced serving a six months prison sentence on 2 April 1981. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GM7">Senator MULVIHILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to refer to one other matter about which I think the Minister may be aware. After the hearings of Estimates Committee D I received a schedule which set out the backlog of people who were using either the Administrative Appeals Tribunal or the Federal Court of Australia for lodging appeals as a means of circumventing a decision by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs that they should leave Australia. I think the position is epitomised by the case of a New Zealand national, Mr Brett Collins. I think he is well known. He is well known in Sydney. I think his main claim to fame is as a succesful or unsuccessful bank robber. We all know that plenty of Australians are asked to leave countries because they have committed criminal offences. I do not think we ask any special favours for them. The schedule that I received from the Minister sets out a mass of people who are quite obviously here in breach of our immigration regulations. I suspect some of them came across the Tasman. The Minister would know that the Opposition has agreed with the Government's proposal to impose tighter controls on people coming across the Tasman. In the case of Brett Collins I notice the concluding paragraph on page 2 of the letter I received from the Minister on 12 February states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Administrative Appeals Tribunal has affirmed the Minister's decision that Mr Collins be deported. However, Mr Collins is to appeal to the Federal Court of Australia on questions of law arising from the Tribunal decision. </PARA>
<PARA>Far be it for me to try to usurp the authority of the judge, but I have heard senior Immigration officers voice their opinions before various committees. When I succeeded Senator Davidson as the Chairman of the Immigration Advisory Council we used to get a little holier than thou and say: 'Look at how the Canadians got themselves into a jam'. They virtually had an appeals system whereby any tourist who went to Canada could claim on some legal pretense that he or she should be allowed to stay in Canada. The Canadians were inundated with appeals. Surely we should have learned from that experience. The thing that mystifies me is how we have cluttered up the system. Like other honourable senators I have always been one of those who have fought for justice to see that somebody who has come to Australia and wanted to stay here permanently and apply for citizenship, but where there has been some misunderstanding about his past, was exonerated. Conversely, when people have been knocking on the door to enter Australia, particularly people from countries embroiled in turbulence, I have always tried to see that humanity was extended to them. </PARA>
<PARA> But that is completely different from the position of those people who are hypocritical, cheats or sneaks. If they have come here on a tourist visa they well know the conditions of the visa. I say this with more force now than I would have a couple of years ago. I think we all know of friends who have travelled overseas and got into difficult situations. I venture to include the British Home Office in this remark because only yesterday I asked a question in relation to its attitude. All countries are adopting a tough attitude on people coming into and going out of them. I have a request to make of the Minister. It is a two-pronged follow-up to the question on the schedule that I have. The Minister has given me a list of the people who are exercising their rights of appeal before the Ombudsman, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and the Australian Federal Court. I would like the nationalities to be shown in brackets beside the names of those people so that I can dissect the information and find out how many people have prostituted the reasonably flexible travel arrangements across the Tasman. I think it is very important to get that information. Perhaps I could also get an updated briefing as to what is happening in the case of Mr Brett Collins. Has the Federal Court fixed a date for his hearing? If so, what was the outcome?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Mulvihill has raised a series of questions. He referred to an answer to Senate Question No. 623 concerning Mr Stawiarski. I have a little bit of further advice on that matter from the departmental officers. Senator Mulvihill asked me to flesh out the answer which had been given. I am advised that, in fact, Mr Stawiarski had no convictions when he came to Australia. He was admitted to the country as the spouse of an Australian resident. We are making inquiries about the matters on which he has now been convicted. We are awaiting a transcript of the court evidence in Canada. The further information which the honourable senator has sought is, we hope, on the way but we may not be able to provide that further information in the short term.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Concerning Mr Bennett who was referred to on page 293 of the Senate Estimates Committee D Hansard when Senator Mulvihill was asking questions, I have no further information at this stage. I will see whether the Minister can provide further information for the honourable senator. In a sense the inquiry which was then raised about the position of Brett Collins and the rights and wrongs of appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal are answered by Senator Mulvihill's own comments about the errors which can occur in the immigration area. Whilst it is, I think, fair enough to say that we would want to see humanity-all honourable senators are aware of the frequent attempts of Senator Mulvihill to make sure that humanity is exercised in this field or a sense of humanity is brought to bear-the distinction between the people who deserve humane treatment and those who are hypocrites and sneaks, as the honourable senator referred to them, is one which will lead to problems at times. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I am trying to make, and I am trying to make it shortly, is that making judgments of this sort can lead to errors. The Government has seen fit to give people in this situation more rights than they had previously to appeal to bodies which are independent of the Government and of the bureaucracy. I take on board the caution which has been uttered by the honourable senator in his contribution to the Committee debate. I will refer those points to the Minister. The honourable senator referred us to the real difficulties which have occurred in other countries with the clogging up of appeals systems and the tightening of eligibility conditions. My advice is that in fact 30 outstanding cases are before the AAT or the Federal Court of Australia at the moment, which does not sound too frightening a total. But I will undertake to provide the information which the honourable senator has requested, namely, an indication of the nationalities of the persons on the list which has already been provided to him who are taking advantage of appeals to the Ombudsman, the AAT or the Federal Court. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a number of minor issues which caused me some concern in Senate Estimates Committee D. The first matter I wish to refer to is the additional sum of $65,000 which was required for travel associated with the Boeing 707 simulator continuation training. I think I should refresh the minds of honourable senators that what happens is that special training is given to the crew of VIP aircraft. Every year they are sent to the Cathay Pacific Airways simulator in Hong Kong. Each crew, after its initial training, needs to return to Hong Kong three times a year for refresher training. That refresher training takes a grand total of 12 hours at a time. The reason the crew has to undergo this training is that there is no 707 simulator in Australia at the moment. Qantas Airways Ltd does not fly any 707s. In fact I do not think any airlines at the moment are flying out of Australia using 707 aircraft. There might be some flying in, but that does not alleviate the problem that there is no simulator in Australia for crews to train on. The additional $65,000 was spent because a whole crew left the Royal Australian Air Force last year, and subsequently a new crew had to be trained.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Unfortunately, it appears that no sooner do we train an RAAF crew-we give them intensive training to fly these 707s-then they are offered better paid jobs flying these planes with private airlines overseas. Of course, a number of private companies are still operating 707s in Africa, the United States, Europe and South America. I suggest to the Government, especially in light of the razor gang's suggestions which have come up recently, that it ought to look seriously at selling these aircraft if it wants to save some money. That sale would make a large profit. It would be possible to modify the BAC111s that we have at the moment. I am not arguing that we do not need a VIP fleet. In fact I say we do. But the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anthony, has flown in a BAC 111 from Australia to the Middle East. I believe that these aircraft can be modified for overseas travel. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the catch-22 situation in which we find ourselves at the moment is that because we continue to have these expensive 707 aircraft we have to train crews to fly them. As soon as we train a crew to fly them they are open to suggestions that they should fly for private companies overseas. I see no way in which the Government can stop this drain of air crews that will occur. We will find time and again in the Estimates these additional costs for the training of the crews. I suggest that if we did not have these planes and if the Government modified the BAC 111s the same situation would not occur. The offers would not be made to the crews and therefore we could save not only the cost of the 707s but also the cost of training the crews to fly them. </PARA>
<PARA> Another item of great expense which the Committee found was the cost associated with picking the tactical fighter aircraft. The Government now is looking at only two options, the F16 and the F18. Because of the Government's failure to decide on one of these two aircraft last December we found additional expenditure of $245,000 in the Estimates that had been spent just on additional overseas travel. I made further inquiries during Estimates committee hearings and I was informed that from 1978 until June this year $510,483 had been spent on determining which aircraft to buy. I was able to find out also that there had been 41 military overseas visits and 27 civilian overseas visits in connection with this project. That is a total of 68 overseas visits and we still have not determined which aircraft we will purchase. I hope that it is the Government's intention to decide by October this year which aircraft it will buy. If it does not, it seems from these estimates, that we will spend another quarter of a million dollars early in the new year. </PARA>
<PARA> Another item that concerned me was an item of $20,000 in the Department of Defence estimates which was listed to pay outstanding Telecom Australia accounts dating back to 1977 for installations at engineering development establishments but which were only presented for payment in 1980-81. I suggest that any four-year delay in presenting a telephone account from Telecom has something to say about its administrative ability and its inefficiency. I could understand a minor account being misplaced, but I do not understand an account for $20,000 being misplaced. Another item in relation to the Department of Foreign Affairs which has been raised by me and by Senator Robertson in the Senate many times is that relating to the establishment of a consulate in Bali. We have finally been informed by officials of the Department of Foreign Affairs that that consulate will be opened. No date for the opening has been given. We were told that the delay in opening the consulate was apparently due to staff ceilings. I believe that a serious fault exists in the system when staff ceilings stop the opening of any of our embassies or consulates abroad and especially one that would fill such a great need as a consulate in Bali. I believe that if Australian representation is necessary at a place like Bali then it should be put into effect immediately. Of course, we should not leave it to organisations like Qantas Airways Ltd. I believe that the Qantas office in Bali is doing a tremendous amount of work, every week, every month, right throughout the year which should be done by consulate officials. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter that concerned me was one that I put to officials. I asked whether the Department had any way of monitoring the Indonesian Red Cross's use of Australian donations towards East Timor relief. After the meeting-not during the Estimates Committee meeting-I received an answer to this question. I am sure a number of honourable senators will be interested in the reply. The reply was that the relief operations in East Timor were under the joint control of the Indonesian Red Cross and the International Committee of the Red Cross until its conclusion on 15 April 1981. Australian contributions were paid to the ICRC. We have no way of monitoring the specific uses of these funds. The reply stated further that the ICRC had issued situation reports at approximately six-monthly intervals and that the Government had been satisfied with the distribution of donations. We should ask the question: What will be the situation in the future? Will the Indonesian Red Cross take it upon itself to issue situation reports? One thing that is clear is that there is a great doubt about our ability to monitor any Australian contributions to East Timor relief in the future. I think that the situation has been taken completely out of Australia's hands. That is the situation that causes me a great deal of concern. (Quorum formed). </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have certain questions to ask in relation to the Department of Defence, under group D. They follow questions which I asked in the Estimates committee hearings and are to be found at pages 269 and 270 of the Estimates Committee Hansard of 30 April. I asked whether Brigadier McMillan was involved in drawing up the specifications for the Defence Integrated Secure Communication Network, or DISCON, and the specifications for tenders and whether he is now employed by a firm which tendered for the contract. The comments made in reply to those questions mentioned that a similar question, No. 641, was on notice and that a reply to it was being prepared for consideration by the Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I understand that the answer to that question is yes, that Brigadier McMillan was involved in drawing up the specifications for that contract and that he is now employed by a firm which tendered for that contract. If that is so, and I believe I am reliably informed that it is, I ask whether Brigadier McMillan obtained permission from the responsible officer-I believe the permanent head of the department-as he is required to do by Public Service guidelines prior to taking up that employment. If he did not seek and obtain that permission, is he in breach of those guidelines which I believe require a two-year time lag after leaving an area of the Department with which he has had some association before he takes up employment with a firm which had business dealings in that area of activity?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A number of matters have been raised concerning these estimates. With respect to simulation training, which was raised by Senator Sibraa, it is cheaper to undertake such training than it is to use aircraft for training, so that in itself involves an economy. The honourable senator may have exaggerated somewhat the problems that we face in retaining crew. I am advised that we have lost only one crew of two pilots for the Boeings since 1979. I would merely acknowledge the point made by the honourable senator and move on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In regard to the cost of taking up a new tactical fighter, I understand that the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) has given an undertaking that a decision will be made by October. There was some fear that the decision would be made too soon and for the wrong reasons. Honourable senators will understand that their purchase is a significant and a substantial one and Australia needs to be sure that it is getting the right fighter. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter of the telephone account to which Senator Sibraa referred is really one which suggests some inefficiency on the part of Telecom Australia and perhaps should be drawn to the attention of the responsible Minister so that he can pass it on. </PARA>

<PARA> I have received a number of representations supporting two applications by the Devonport Council for financial assistance for the East Devonport Child Care and Community Centre.</PARA>
<PARA> I have carefully considered the current submission for funding the East Devonport Child Care and Community Centre but as child care funds have been fully committed in 1980-81, I have no prospect of providing a grant this financial year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Foreign Minister has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Third United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea unanimously agreed at its Resumed Ninth Session (August/September 1980) on a program of work which required that negotiations be concluded at the Tenth Session (March/April 1981). However, prior to the commencement on 9 March of the Tenth Session, the State Department issued an announcement on United States policy, the full text of which follows:</PARA>
<PARA> 'After consultations with the other interested departments and agencies of the United States Government, the Secretary of State has instructed our Representative at the UN Law of the Sea Conference to seek to ensure that the negotiations do not end at the present session of the Conference pending a policy review by the United States Government. The interested departments and agencies have begun studies of the serious problems raised by the Draft Convention, and these will be the subject of a thorough review which will determine our position towards the negotiations.'</PARA>
<PARA>It will be clear in these circumstances that it is not possible to predict what shift in the United States policy (if any) will come out of the review. The Australian Government understands that the review will not be completed until after the next Session of the Law of the Sea Conference, which commences in August 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The previous United States Administration had supported the conclusion of negotiations on the Draft Convention on the Law of the Sea at the Tenth Session, and the Australian Government was in agreement with that aim. However, the wish of the new United States Administration to review its policies means that the timetable for the conclusion of any agreement will be extended.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Australian Government understands the need of the new United States Administration for more time to consider its position on issues of such importance and complexity. The Australian Government hopes, however, that the policy review being conducted by the United States will be completed quickly so that a comprehensive and widely-accepted Convention on the Law of the Sea, in which Australia has substantial interests, can be concluded without delay.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Yes, on several occasions. During my discussions with Secretary of State Haig in Washington in early March, I restated the position of successive Australian Governments, that Australian interests in the Law of the Sea would best be protected by the early adoption of a comprehensive and widely-supported Convention. The same position was expressed by, among others, His Excellency Mr K. G. Brennan, the Leader of the Australian Delegation to the Law of the Sea Conference, to the Leader of the United States Delegation, Mr James Malone, during the course of the Tenth Session, and by Sir Nicholas Parkinson, the Australian Ambassador to the United States, to the Deputy Secretary of State, Mr William Clark, in April.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The Australian delegation to the Law of the Sea Conference will continue to participate in the discussions on the issue of seabed mining beyond the limits of national jurisdiction on the basis that such activities are to be carried out for the benefit of mankind as a whole.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) As I announced on 29 April 1981, the Government has decided that the funds it provides for public hospitals, the general community health program and the school dental scheme are to be included in general revenue grants.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Science and Technology has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Technology Transfer Council Advisory Board was originally set up to provide the former Department of Productivity with advice and assistance on the establishment of a technical referral network for the metals manufacturing industry. That initial task was completed when a company, Technology Transfer Council, was created to operate the network. The function of the Advisory Board then changed to one of advising and guiding the directors of Technology Transfer Council and the Department of Science and Technology on the operation of the network.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The performance of the Advisory Board has been entirely satisfactory. However, the Government felt that a formal organisation was no longer a necessary part of the process of obtaining advice.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Technology Transfer Council and the Department of Science and Technology will seek advice on the operation of the technical referral network from a wide range of individuals and organisations in industry, government and the tertiary education sector.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) No Government services will be affected.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) All the information which was available in the past will still be available.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Advice on the operation of the technical referral network will no longer be available as a consensus of opinion of a group of expert individuals and organisations. Rather, a range of different views will be available, which Technology Transfer Council and the Department of Science and Technology will have to assess and evaluate.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) There will be a saving in departmental expenses of approximately $1,000 a year. It should be noted that the members of the Advisory Board did not receive sitting fees, travelling expenses or other reimbursement.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 10 March 1981 (Hansard, page 417) Senator MacGibbon asked me, as Minister representing the Treasurer, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer and relates to yesterday's announcement that the contract for the development of the Winchester South coal deposit in central Queensland has been awarded to a consortium comprising the multinational oil company British Petroleum and the Australian Thiess and Westfield Holdings companies. Is the Minister aware that tenders for development of this resource were received from some companies that are wholly Australian, companies which have the financial and technical resources successfully to develop the field? In view of the spirit behind the foreign investment provisions of existing Federal legislation, will the Government consider amending that legislation so that in future cases Australian companies with proven capacities have first refusal of similar resource development.</PARA>
<PARA> I undertook to refer the question to the Treasurer, who has provided the following answer:</PARA>
<PARA> The awarding of the Authority to Prospect over the Winchester South streaming coal deposit was a matter entirely within the responsibilities of the Queensland Government. The Foreign Investment Review Board, which advises the Commonwealth on foreign investment matters, was therefore not aware of all the tenders that were submitted for Winchester South. However, several parties did inform the Board on a confidential basis of their intentions to submit tenders.</PARA>
<PARA> Before development of the deposit takes place, the parties will need to obtain the approval of the Commonwealth Government under its foreign investment policy.</PARA>
<PARA> The general objective of the Government's policy on foreign investment in Australia's natural resources is to seek a minimum 50 per cent Australian equity together with at least 50 per cent of the voting strength on the board held by Australian interests. Proposals that are not contrary to the national interest but which do not meet the 50 per cent guideline may be allowed to proceed if the Government judges that the unavailability of sufficient Australian equity capital on reasonable terms and conditions would unduly delay development. In that event, however, the Government will, as appropriate, seek satisfactory arrangements for Australian equity to be increased to at least 50 per cent within an agreed period.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has taken note of the honourable senator's suggestion but to implement it would appear to involve Commonwealth intrusion into the procedure for the granting of mineral titles by the State governments.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Transport has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The decrease in annual profits was the result of a number of factors including the decision to write off losses on Swiss Franc borrowings. The Australian National Airlines Commission has exercised its commercial judgment in a manner acceptable to the Government. Trans-Australia Airlines is required to conform, when producing its financial statements, to accepted accounting standards applying to the business sector of the Australian economy. The Auditor-General is of the opinion that the financial statements are based on proper accounts and records and that the statements show fairly the financial operations for the year ended 30 June 1980 and the state of the affairs of the Commission as at that date. The Government is concerned about the unfunded superannuation liability and, as noted in the notes to the accounts, action has been undertaken to alleviate the problem. It should also be noted that the notes confirm that, despite the increased liability, the assets of the Commission's groundstaff superannuation fund are adequate, on the basis of an on-going superannuation scheme, to meet commitments falling due for some time into the future.</PARA>
<PARA> On 1 April 1981 it was announced that the Government had decided to restructure the Commission as a public company. The nature and structure of such a company are currently under consideration.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 31 March 1981 (Hansard, page 884) Senator Watson asked me, as Minister representing the Treasurer, a question without notice concerning the establishment of a bureau to record the plans of foreign companies wishing to operate in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Treasurer has provided the following information in answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> In order to achieve the objectives the honourable senator has in mind companies would need to disclose details of their proposed investment. The question of maintaining a register of foreign investment proposals was raised by the honourable member for Griffith in a question upon notice on 3 December 1980. My response to the honourable member's question, based on advice received from the Foreign Investment Review Board (FIRB), is contained on pages 448 and 449 of Hansard of 4 March 1981. I indicated that procedures requiring the compulsory publication in a register of all foreign investment proposals would have a number of disadvantages whereas the principal benefits that might be expected to result from such a register are for all practical purposes being achieved by the present practices followed in respect of foreign investment proposals. A major disadvantage is the fact that many of the cases coming before the Government involve commercially sensitive proposals and the interests of the parties could be adversely affected if such commercial information were made public.</PARA>
<PARA> One of the major functions of the FIRB is to work towards a high level of Australian participation in new investment undertakings in accordance with the basic objective of the Government's foreign investment policy of providing opportunities for Australians to participate in foreign investment proposals to the extent appropriate in the particular circumstances, with specific guidelines being set down for Australian involvement in new natural resource projects.</PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of avenues by which the FIRB can, and does, assist foreign companies experiencing difficulties in acquiring suitable Australian equity participants. For example, the FIRB may suggest appropriate avenues for publicly announcing or otherwise advertising a proposal. Where this is not commercially realistic, the parties may be referred to possible Australian participants who have expressed an interest to the FIRB in new investment opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA> The present policy and practice provide substantial opportunities for Australian companies and institutions to participate with foreign investors in resource development and other investments in Australia. This gives opportunities for small investors to participate in projects of this kind through shares in the Australian companies involved or through investments in institutions, which are increasingly becoming more directly involved in the development of Australia's industries and natural resources. Small investors are also having increased opportunites to buy shares in partly foreign owned companies operating in Australia which are providing greater scope for Australian equity participation under the provisions for naturalisation or other aspects of the Government's foreign investment policy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In the adjournment debate on 9 April 1981 (Hansard, page 1369) Senator Colston asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Education, to raise with the Minister for Education a matter relating to the first term closing date in Queensland for receipt of applications under the secondary allowances scheme. Senator Colston referred to a recent press release put out by the Department of Education urging parents to apply before the closing date, which occurred about two weeks earlier this year-on 16 April-because of the State's new four-term system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the grounds that the new arrangement may have led to some confusion among applicants over closing dates, he asked that the matter be referred to the Minister for Education 'to see whether it is possible on this occasion to extend the period by which applications may be lodged because this is the first year in which this has arisen, even if it were only for another two weeks'.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Education has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The press release mentioned by Senator Colston was part of the normal 'last-minute reminder' publicity carried out each year by the Queensland office of my Department towards the end of the first term. This was a follow-up to the extensive nationwide publicity carried out late last year and early this year aimed at making potential applicants aware of the scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> As in previous years, the recent publicity appears to have been successful in reminding parents that they must apply by the end of first term in order to attract a full year's benefits. The application rate once again increased significantly in the final weeks and by the closing date was still well above that for previous years, as it had been throughout the term. Despite the earlier deadline, about 250 more applications were received than by the end of first term in 1980.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Colston has referred to the possibility of confusion among applicants on the closing date issue, particularly in relation to the use of the word 'term'. My Department's understanding is that under the new arrangement the four segments into which the school year is now divided are still commonly known as 'terms'. For some years secondary students in Queensland have been accustomed to a division of the school year into two semester periods of assessment, even though there have been three terms for vacation purposes. The fact that the second mid-year vacation now coincides with the end of the first semester does not appear to have affected the continuing general use of the word 'term' to refer to the four administrative periods bounded by vacations. It seems unlikely that parents who had noted in the Department's publicity that they should apply before the end of the first term would genuinely have believed that they had until the end of the first semester, that is, 26 June, to do so. Certainly the figures I have given above suggest that, if there was any confusion on this issue, it had no indentifiable effect on applicant numbers.</PARA>
<PARA> In these circumstances a formal extension of the first term closing date by two weeks would not appear to be warranted. However, it has in fact been possible to accept as being on time for a full year's benefits all applications received in the Department's Queensland Office up to Friday 1 May, that is, two weeks after the official closing date. This is in accordance with normal concessional arrangements under which, for example, a parent who has learnt of the scheme just before the closing date is sent an application and then has up to two weeks in which to submit it.</PARA>

<PARA> The shooting down by Israeli aircraft of two Syrian helicopters near Zahle on 28 April, and the subsequent introduction of ground-to-air missiles into the area by Syria, have led to an alarming increase in the risk to peace in the Middle East region as a whole. The Government is glad to note, however, that some progress towards a reduction in tension in Lebanon seems to have occurred following Syrian Foreign Minister Khaddam's visit to Beirut on 28 and 29 April, and that Israeli Prime Minister Begin has clearly stated that Israel wants a peaceful solution.</PARA>
<PARA> The situation in Lebanon has been the subject of consultations by members of the United Nations Security Council and Secretary-General Waldheim continues to confer with the parties to the conflict. There has, however, been no proposal that the Security Council take up the matter formally and no proposal that a United Nations peacekeeping force for the whole of Lebanon should be set up. The Lebanese Government has announced its opposition to the formation of such a force, and this circumstance makes it inappropriate to propose it at present.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is nevertheless determined to work actively within the United Nations framework to support moves towards a political reconciliation in Lebanon. Accordingly, on 1 May, at the Minister's direction, the Australian Permanent Representative to the United Nations advised the President of the Security Council of Australia's support for a firm and unequivocal Security Council statement calling on all parties to work for a ceasefire, to behave with restraint, and to respect the authority of the legitimate government of Lebanon.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 30 April 1981 (Hansard, page 1545) Senator Hearn asked me, as the Minister representing the Minister for Communications, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is the Minister representing the Minister for Communications aware that an aid known as Porta Printer II, designed to assist the deaf with communication, is available only at the cost of $800 a unit-$1,600 for two people to communicate-plus the cost of installation? As most deaf people cannot aspire to highly paid jobs because of their communication difficulty, they would be unable to afford to buy this unit. Could this equipment be provided at a reasonable rental for those in need of this facility?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Telecom Australia has advised me that the Porta Printer II telephone aid for the deaf is available to the public through a private company, Intercept Communications of Camberwell, Victoria. Owing to a recent upsurge of demand for the equipment in the United States of America, however, supplies of the units have been exhausted. Efforts are being made by the supplier to obtain other equipment but it is likely to be some time before any is available.</PARA>
<PARA> The device has obvious advantages for the profoundly deaf who have been unable to use the conventional telephone. Telecom has given a permit for its connection to the telephone network and, as part of its contribution to the 1981 International Year of Disabled Persons, is to act as distributing agent for the company. In acting as a distributor for the private company, Telecom will have the Porta Printer units available on a sale only basis. It is not known whether the private supplier intends making the units available on a lease basis. The sale price of the units will be in the order of $500-$1,000, however, it is understood that the supplier intends to offer a cheaper rate to disabled persons and organisations.</PARA>

<PARA> I direct my question to the Minister for National Development and Energy in his capacity as representing either the Prime Minister or the Minister for Trade and Resources. I preface my question by saying that I hope that the Minister has noted that the British Government has allowed Taiwan's first commercial bank to open a branch office in London and that an article in yesterday's Australian Financial Review states that the United States is now moving closer to Taiwan. In view of the fact that total trade between Australia and Taiwan is now approaching $1,000m a year, what is Australia doing to promote closer diplomatic and commercial ties with Taiwan which were broken off during the time of the Whitlam Government.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Trade and Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The arrangements establishing diplomatic relations between Australia and China in December 1972 preclude any possibility of the Australian Government establishing a trade office or any official presence in the Province of Taiwan. We recognise the People's Republic of China as the sole legal Government of China, and acknowledge the position of the Chinese Government that Taiwan is a part of China.</PARA>
<PARA> However this does not preclude private organisations from doing business with the province of Taiwan or establishing offices to assist such activities.</PARA>
<PARA> In this regard the Australian Chamber of Commerce has been exploring the feasibility of establishing such a non-official trade support facility in Taipei. The type of commercial reporting that would be expected to be available from the Australian Chamber of Commerce's Office in Taipei would have direct relevance to the overall responsibilities of the Department of Trade and Resources in providing guidance and assistance to Australian companies involved, or interested, in exporting and generally in the promotion of Australia's trade.</PARA>
<PARA> On that basis, the Department would wish to subscribe to the services of the Chamber, provided through its office in Taipei, to obtain commercial information not presently available to it and, in general, not widely available to Australian commercial interests.</PARA>

<PARA> Will the Government accede to the demand made by the member for Macarthur, Mr Baume, last Thursday, 5 March-it is recorded on page 499 of Hansard-and impose a levy on live sheep exports in order to encourage further processing in Australia which in turn will mean increased job opportunities for Australian workers?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Trade and Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> While the Government's policy is to encourage the further processing of Australia's raw materials for export, the Government also believes that this development must be consistent with sound commercial practice and in keeping with the realities of the market place.</PARA>
<PARA> The pattern of Australian meat and livestock exports to the Middle East has been determined by normal market forces. The dominance of live sheep in the trade results from the fact that consumers in the region have a strong traditional preference for fresh killed meat. If the Government interfered in the trade by hindering live sheep exports the most likely result would be that the Middle East would take a much smaller quantity of live sheep without increasing the volume of its meat imports.</PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, by establishing closer trading links with the region, the development of the live sheep trade has probably been a major factor in the expansion of our meat trade to the Middle East. In the decade to 30 June 1980, sheepmeat exports increased from 10,000 tonnes to 86,000 tonnes on a carcase weight basis. Beef exports to the area increased from 1,600 tonnes in 1970-71 to 51,700 tonnes carcase weight in 1979-80.</PARA>

<PARA> I undertook to seek further details and now provide the following answer:</PARA>
<PARA> No information is available at present in relation to the patterns of health of personnel referred to. However, mortality and morbidity rates of naval personnel involved in the Monte Bello tests are being investigated as part of the Government's survey of all Australian personnel involved in the United Kingdom atomic tests in Australia. Results of this survey will be made public.</PARA>
<PARA> Atomic tests were carried out in the Monte Bello Islands on 3 October 1952, 16 May 1956 and 19 June 1956. Following the tests, radiation levels were monitored by four ships:</PARA>
<PARA> HMAS Hawkesbury: 8.10.52-26.11.52 (intermittently)</PARA>

<PARA> Following the third test, some 30 tons of stores including generators were embarked from Hermite Island by HMAS Karangi for shipment to Fremantle, and subsequent transfer to Maralinga for use in the 1956 test series. Hermite Island was the operational base for the tests and was not a contaminated area. It is therefore unlikely that these stores would have been contaminated.</PARA>
<PARA> HMAS Karangi visited the Monte Bello area on 14 occasions following detonation of the first atomic weapon. These visits were in relation to radiation monitoring, laying of moorings and light beacons, and transport of stores and personnel.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 8 April 1981 (Hansard, page 1204) Senator Sim asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Resources, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Has the Minister seen the latest survey of international trade prospects by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade which points out that a key factor in the present international malaise is the widely held belief in industrialised countries that the problems of adjustment in problem industries such as the textile industry should be left until their economies achieve a higher growth rate? The GATT report points out that because the future of these industries is inherently doubtful they cannot generate a decisive investment momentum, even behind increased protection, and that at the same time protection lowers the prospects of more promising national industries. The report goes on to comment that protection inhibits industrial investment opportunities in the less developed countries and their export potential. Does the Government accept the views of GATT? If so, why do we continue to afford high levels of protection for labour intensive industries accepted as being unsuitable for developed economies, thereby reducing the capacity of less developed countries to generate export income essential to meet the problem of high oil prices and to develop economies essential to a stable world economic situation?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Trade and Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> I am aware of the views of the GATT Secretariat on structural adjustment of industry and the effects of protection on trade, especially developing country exports, set out in the document referred to by the honourable senator. Distortions caused by barriers imposed against trade in order to protect industries which are uncompetitive by world standards reduce opportunities for trade, including Australian exports. It is a matter of record that Australia has been working through international bodies such as the GATT to improve multilateral trade flows.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government recognises that structural change-both nationally and internationally-is an essential part of the process of industrial development. In recent years structural change and policies to deal with it have been the subject of searching examinations in Australia (White Paper on Manufacturing-1977, Report of Study Group of Structural Adjustment-1979).</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of this process, the Government has reiterated its intention of encouraging the development of competitive manufacturing industries which are more export oriented, involve specialisation in particular skills and products, use advanced technology, draw on wider markets to take advantage of scale economies and rely less on government support. To this end the Government has made it clear that tariff reductions are an important factor in encouraging adjustment to a more efficient manufacturing industry in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Although change within industry is inevitable, careful attention must be given to the community's ability to absorb such change and to accommodate the economic and social consequences of change. The Government therefore follows a policy of gradualism-for instance with regard to reductions in tariffs against imported products.</PARA>
<PARA> Both the White Paper and the Study Group report have acknowledged that industry specific policies will be needed to meet the special problems of certain industry sectors. The approach adopted by the Government is, in general, one of providing support for a sector for a defined period during which real efforts should be made by the industry itself to improve its structure and efficiency, thereby helping it to acheive a better and more certain long term outlook.</PARA>
<PARA> In line with Government policy the average nominal rate of assistance to domestic manufacturers against imports has declined from 24 per cent in 1968-69 to about 15 per cent in 1978-79, a reduction of almost 40 per cent. Australia relies mainly on the tariff which is visible rather than non-tariff barriers used by some other countries.</PARA>
<PARA> Developing countries have been major beneficiaries of Australia's trade liberalisation. Imports of manufactured goods from Developing Countries increased more than sixfold between 1972-73 and 1979-80 (from $255m to $1,612m) and increased at a faster rate than imports of these products from all sources. Their share of imports of manufactured goods increased from 8 per cent to over 13 per cent in this period.</PARA>
<PARA> Being aware of the need for developing countries to participate to a greater degree in world trade the Government operates a developing country tariff preference scheme. This scheme covers a wide range of dutiable imports and was recently extended in a significant way to cover the textiles, clothing and footwear areas.</PARA>
<PARA> Clearly achievement of an increased growth rate provides better conditions for adjustment to take place. To this end the Government is trying to contain inflation because inflation must be restrained if the problem of increasing and excessive protectionism is to be overcome. Pressures caused by inflation reduce growth and increase unemployment resulting in a declining resistance to erect barriers to protect industries from outside competition.</PARA>
<PARA> If inflation is not controlled Australia will not attain adequate growth rates and will not achieve the conditions necessary for greater liberalisation of trade which will benefit all countries.</PARA>
