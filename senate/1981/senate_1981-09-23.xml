<PARA> 1. Note that legislation establishing plant breeders' rights in other countries has had serious adverse effects, namely:</PARA>
<PARA> a. Virtual monopoly control of seed production has passed into the hands of a few large international corporations seeking to profit from the exclusive rights over plant genetic materials created by such legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> b. The varieties of seeds available have been restricted mainly to hybrids which will not reproduce truly and will not grow without the aid of artificial fertilisers and pesticides, thus maximising corporate profits without regard for the interests of growers and consumers.</PARA>
<PARA> c. The genetic diversity of crops has been eroded, rendering them vulnerable to disease and other environmental threats.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Recognise that maintenance of the genetic diversity of plant varieties is crucial to the continued well-being of the Australian nation, and take all necessary steps to preserve and promote such genetic diversity as a public resource and to prevent exclusive control over plant genetic materials from falling into private hands.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Defend the vital interests of Australian farmers and gardeners, independent Australian seed companies and their employees, and consumers of Australian farm and garden produce, by rejecting any proposal to legislate for the establishment of plant breeders' rights in Australia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Is it true, as reported, that an Australian diplomat is at present in Kabul, the capital of Afghanistan, on a two-week visit approved by the Afghanistan Government? Was the visit carried out secretly to avoid disclosure that the diplomat had applied for a visa from a government not recognised by Australia? On a similar matter, I ask: Is it a fact that Soviet trade missions have regularly visited Australia in the last few months without obstruction but that members of cultural and scientific delegations have been denied visas as a result of the Soviet incursion into Afghanistan?</PARA></TALK.START>

I am able to confirm media reports that an officer from the Australian Embassy in Islamabad is currently visiting Kabul, Afghanistan, to undertake administrative tasks. A similar visit took place in April this year. The visit in no way implies recognition of the illegal regime. Australia will continue to withhold recognition of the Karmal regime, which was installed by invading Soviet forces in December 1979. I noted the question with regard to the visits of Soviet delegations to Australia but I have no information on that matter. I will get that information as soon as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Defence. I have been reading correspondence from the Minister for Defence relating to 'Kangaroo 81', the exercise to gee up our armed forces to oppose a threat to Australia from an imaginary nation of 'Orangeland' located in the south-west Pacific. Is the Minister aware that the particular country is named 'Orangeland' and that the map of the region really depicts Tasmania turned upside down in the south-west Pacific? Is the Minister also aware that 'Orangemen' are few and far between in Tasmania and that we seldom stand on our heads, although we are stood on our heads every August by the State and Federal governments to ensure that no money is left in our pockets? Is it a fact that the Minister, after a well publicised gathering in Brisbane on the night of 17 March, gave instructions to his Department to turn Tasmania upside down and relocate Tasmania, renamed 'Orangeland', in the south-west Pacific; or is it a result of the insidious influence of the Goon Show over the air waves of Australia? If the latter be the case, can the whole matter be referred to the Minister for Communications so that he might suggest that it be referred to a Senate select committee for investigation and report?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am afraid that I am not aware of the map or whether it depicts Tasmania or how the name was chosen. I am sorry if Senator Harradine has jumped to the conclusion that anyone would think that Tasmania was a threat to Australia.

It is very easy to agree with the proposition that Senator Jessop advanced in his question-that this sort of strike should not be able to arise when matters are under consideration by arbitral tribunals. My understanding of this dispute is that the relevant officer of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission has recommended a return to work, and that the strike has persisted notwithstanding that recommendation.

It is a fact that the Government of Zimbabwe has agreed to accept an offer of military assistance from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea. The Prime Minister of Zimbabwe, Mr Mugabe, has said that the offer relates to the provision of training and equipment for a brigade of the defence forces of Zimbabwe. North Korean instructors have already arrived in the country. Mr Mugabe has said that other units of the defence forces of Zimbabwe will continue to be trained with the assistance of the British military team, in accordance with the agreement made between the governments of Zimbabwe and the United Kingdom. The Government of Zimbabwe, in announcing its decision, stated that the North Korean offer of military training was consistent with Zimbabwe's policy of non-alignment. We hope that the North Koreans approach their assignment in the same light. The Australian Government does not have under active consideration any involvement in Zimbabwe.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, concerns the prohibition by the Department of Foreign Affairs on the film On Sacred Ground which was the subject of a question asked by my colleague, Senator Coleman, of the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 27 August. I draw the Minister's attention to the reply from his colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who, in enumerating the reasons for banning the showing of the film overseas, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A further concern was that overseas distribution of a film made by a Commonwealth instrumentality which included criticism of the Western Australian Government's policies could prejudice the domestic consultation between Commonwealth and State authorities on land rights and mining issues. Since advancement of Aboriginal interests requires co-operation between the Commonwealth and State authorities, it would be contrary to the best interests of the Aboriginals if the Commonwealth Government were seen by a State Government to be acquiescing in the overseas showing of such a film.</PARA>
<PARA>I ask: How does the Minister reconcile that statement with his Government's professed policy of self-management? Surely there is a direct conflict between the judgment of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the judgment of the Aboriginal people concerned-that is, the Aboriginal people of the Kimberley region-who believe that their interests are best served by the exhibiting of the film at home and abroad and who have consequently arranged a screening of the film for 29 September in Melbourne to coincide with the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting. Will the Minister undertake discussions with his colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, with a view to promoting the distribution of the film to our overseas missions in line with the express wishes of the Aboriginal people concerned?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A large part of that question concerns the Minister for Foreign Affairs, whom I do not represent in this place. I will try to pick up those parts of the question which are related to my portfolio. I understand that the original format and objectives of the film On Sacred Ground were decided upon well before the Noonkanbah conflict arose. It was planned originally as a documentary film to study the land rights movement which, at that time, had gone largely undocumented on film. The filming was planned to take place in two stages. The first stage involved the filming of a number of stations and the activities of various Aboriginal communities. By the time the second stage of filming took place Noonkanbah had developed as the focal point of interest for the communities being filmed. I remind honourable senators of the position taken consistently by my predecessor regarding the whole Noonkanbah problem. My predecessor indicated that more reasonable views on each side would have certainly been better for seeking resolution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These events at Noonkanbah had the effect of converting a social documentary into a film with significant current affairs content. This had not been originally intended. Film Australia consulted the Department of Aboriginal Affairs during both the research and the filming stages of the film. Film Australia-I am speaking now in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs-has taken a decision to revamp the film in order more effectively to achieve the original objectives of the film. When this work has been done a decision will then be taken about the marketing of the film.</PARA>
<PARA> I am not aware that the film was made by Aboriginal people. The honourable senator might tell me if I am wrong. While the original film was screened widely in Australia, it was never offered for television sale outside this country. I understand that this work being done by Film Australia to revamp the film and return to the original goal is something which should be achieved before any decision is taken on its distribution overseas.</PARA>

Will the Attorney inform the Senate whether Australia's objections to South African policies relate only to long standing racial prejudices and practices in that country or, more particularly, to specific obnoxious legislation adopted over the last 30 years which has intensified the political, social and economic suffering of the black and coloured people in South Africa?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Certainly Australia's objections to South African policies relate not only to the long-standing racial prejudices and practices in that country but also to a number of other specific legal discriminations, which I propose to mention. In broad terms, Australia's objection to the South African Government's policies are based on our total rejection of the policy of apartheid which has enshrined racism in the South African Constitution. Of course, this discriminatory and exploitative system represents a basic affront to the dignity of man and his fundamental human rights.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I should like to list some examples of the discrimination practised against black and coloured people in South Africa and the legal authority for that discrimination. These examples do not cover social attitudes or examples of petty discrimination. For instance, there is a denial of suffrage. The South African Constitution provides that only white people have the right to vote for members of parliament. There is a denial of freedom of movement and compulsory relocation. The so-called pass laws and influx control regulations require black and coloured people to have specific authority to enter designated areas for employment purposes and render them liable to deportation to so-called homelands. There is a denial of freedom of association. Blacks may not form political parties. A series of laws, including the Terrorism Act, provide the legal authority.</PARA>
<PARA> Freedom to live in areas other than those designated by the Government is denied. The Group Areas Act gives legal authority for most areas to be designated as white areas. Black and coloured people may not purchase houses in these areas. In regard to the denial of freedom to marry, the Mixed Marriages Act and the Immorality Act forbid marriage or cohabitation between people from different racial groups. There is also denial of freedom to work, in that the job reservation regulations under the Industrial Conciliation Act still forbid employment of black people in certain specified occupations, particularly in the mining industry.</PARA>
<PARA> Those examples, coupled with the enshrining of the policy of apartheid in the Constitution, give a very clear picture of the sorts of legal discriminations and violations of human rights that exist in the legal structure of South Africa. I say nothing further about the other aspects of the matter, which are really more within the responsibility of the Minister for Foreign Affairs.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs to a report in the Melbourne Age newspaper of 10 September concerning aid to the 31 poorest countries. That article reports that a recent United Nations conference determined that aid-giving countries should allocate a target of 0.15 per cent of their gross national product to these least developed countries. Australia did not oppose this determination at the conference. In fact, yesterday the Australian Foreign Minister was reported as saying that 'industrialised countries would be asked to carry the biggest share of the burden' in aiding the world's poorest countries. As Australia's total aid contribution is merely approximately 0.4 per cent of gross domestic product, can the Minister say what proportion of this amount in fact is directed to the 31 countries defined by the UN as being the world's poorest? Will the Minister agree that once again the domestic policies of this Government do not conform to the international rhetoric?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The Budget provides $662m in this year to promote the economic and social advancement of developing countries. This is an increase of about $100m, or 18 per cent, over the funds that were provided last year. This will mean, as was suggested in the question, that our proportion of gross domestic product directed to overseas aid has moved from 0.43 per cent last year to 0.45 per cent this year. On this basis, Australia ranks in the middle of the 16 major Western donors, although the ratio of our aid to our gross domestic product has declined in recent years. The substantial increase in this year's Budget will reverse the decline that had occurred over more recent years.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The full statement on the aid program has been available from the Minister. It was discussed at the hearings of the Senate Estimates committees, and I am sure in other places. I think it needs to be recognised that there are many countries which need the assistance of countries such as ours, so far as we are able to provide it. Our increase of about $100m for aid in this year is a recognition of this very great need and of our desire to do as much as we are able to assist. I am not aware of statistics that would break this up into particular countries. I will see that Senator Bolkus is given the readily available information as soon as possible.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct a question to the Acting Treasurer. The Northern Territory Chamber of Industries, representing the commercial life of the Northern Territory, has considerable concern regarding sales tax being charged on the freight component of goods sold in the Northern Territory and the fact that people living in the more sparsely populated areas of Australia are expected to pay higher tax for the same commodities than do people living in the major capital cities. Will the Government give consideration to restructuring sales tax so that it is charged at the point of final manufacture instead of at the final wholesale point so that everybody in Australia pays the same amount of tax for the same commodity?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="895" SPEAKER="Guilfoyle Sen The Hon Dame M.G.C." NAMEID="6D7" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame MARGARET GUILFOYLE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; We have had many suggestions in recent days about the application of sales tax, its collection, the payment of it to the Commissioner of Taxation and so on. That probably signifies that it is difficult to achieve equity without sacrificing simplicity, without increasing the costs of collection and compliance and without creating a number of other administrative problems. The problem referred to by Senator Kilgariff applies also to goods that are sold between capital cities. It ought to be noted that both the Commonwealth Committee on Taxation of 1953 and the Asprey Taxation Review Committee see the present system as a reasonable compromise. For the many goods which undergo several stages of processing, total exclusion of freight charges between any points would be very difficult administratively. For instance, the freight charge would have to be recorded and documented at each stage of processing and manufacture and later dissected between taxable and non-taxable goods. That would add costs to the final price. Exclusion of freight charges on wholesale goods could also disadvantage decentralised industries because freight charges on raw materials can be a necessary cost borne by them but not by their competitors. So we see that other anomalies and difficulties can occur. Some wholesalers arrange to sell their goods ex-store so that freight charges are the responsibility of customers and not part of the taxable sale. I suppose we could discuss a number of such instances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable senator has asked that we consider the matter raised in his question. I will certainly refer it, through the Treasurer, to the Commissioner to see whether there is any way in which the suggestion can be accommodated. As I have tried to indicate, it is difficult to achieve equity. It seems to me that the collection of sales tax is becoming increasingly complex as people put their minds to the sales tax Bills that are before the Senate.</PARA>

I asked a question about this yesterday, as noted by Senator Chaney in his reply to a similar question from Senator Jessop today. It was noted again that our questions have been or are to be referred to the Minister for Industrial Relations and the Minister for Transport. As there is only one more sitting day for the Parliament before a break of two and a half weeks and as South Australians, who are suffering all the dislocation of this petrol shortage, look to their representatives in the Parliament to obtain this week an assurance that a remedy, if at all possible, is at hand, can the Senate have a reply by tomorrow? I reinforce this urgency by noting not only that private transport has collapsed in South Australia but also that there is the immediate danger that public transport may collapse as the drivers of buses and trains, for lack of petrol in their cars, are finding they cannot get to work. In my State, newspaper headlines on the petrol shortage which have appeared for several days now serve only to emphasise that this enormous breakdown is affecting so adversely literally everyone in South Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have already acknowledged the concern which is obviously felt in South Australia and in other States at the very considerable inconvenience and disruption which is being occasioned by this strike. As I indicated in the earlier response which I gave, this dispute is one which has been before the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The Deputy President who is dealing with the matter has ordered the Australian Institute of Marine and Power Engineers to lift bans. As I understand it, those bans have not been lifted. I do not have information later than that. The bans, incidentally, were ordered to be lifted by this morning. It is my understanding that there has not been a lifting of them, but I do not have precise advice on that.</PARA></TALK.START>

I will pass on to the Minister for Industrial Relations the concern which has been expressed by the honourable senator on these two occasions.

The Minister will be aware that in calculating the income test for a service pension, the Department of Veterans' Affairs counts only half of any disability pension as income and that from January 1982 only 40 per cent of such pension will be so regarded. On the other hand, those ex-servicemen and women who cannot qualify for the service pension but also have a disability pension have all of their disability pension regarded as income by the Department of Social Security when their rate of age pension is assessed. Has the Minister considered removing this anomaly by discounting the value of a disability pension for the purpose of an age pension income test? If not, will he have the matter examined?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It will come as no surprise to the Senate that this matter has been raised with me on occasions by people who see it in the same terms as does the honourable senator, that is, as being an anomaly. It is true that only half-shortly the proportion will be 40 per cent-of the disability pension is taken into account when applying an income test for a service pension and that the whole of the disability pension is taken into account in considering a social security pension for a person who is not entitled to a service pension. That distinction results from the fact that in a number of respects repatriation pensioners receive favoured treatment when compared with other Australians. It is a well-established tradition in this country that people who have had war service receive benefits which are not generally available to the rest of the population. The anomaly or distinction to which the honourable senator draws attention is simply part of that pattern. Individual Australians who have qualified for a service pension receive that pension on more generous terms, with regard to their other income, than do people receiving pensions through the social security system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With respect to the suggestion by the honourable senator that we should change the social security system to provide the same concession to people entitled to a disability pension-give them a social security pension on a more favourable basis than is accorded other Australians-that is a matter which has to be determined on balance. On balance the determination has always been that the Department of Social Security should deal with all Australians on an equal basis. That principle has been pursued with some success. The Department of Social Security has tried to ensure that its benefits are available to Australians generally. Historically, we have not always managed that. For example, Aboriginals and migrants have sometimes not had as good access to the social security system as have other Australians. Considerable effort has gone into ensuring that the social security system applies uniformly to the whole of the Australian population. That is a principle which we should breach only with very great caution. Whilst I am quite certain that I shall have to consider the matter over and over again, as it is one on which I receive quite regular representations, and will-as in all matters-always endeavour to keep my mind as open as possible to suggestions that are made to me, I think it likely that the distinction to which the honourable senator has drawn attention will be maintained.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not aware of what consultation, if any, took place with the Uranium Advisory Council but, to put the matter into perspective, there is under review at this moment a total searching of the Atomic Energy Act to see how it can be modernised or rewritten to meet peace time needs in regard to nuclear energy. I think there is a misunderstanding of the powers of the States and the Commonwealth. Let it be perfectly clear that in matters relating to regulatory powers over nuclear issues, in matters related to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, in matters related to the movement of fissile materials from Australia abroad and in matters related to the monitoring of it throughout the world, the Commonwealth has and will maintain its responsibility. The Australian Safeguards Office is part of my portfolio and will remain so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Within Australia, within the various States, there is a very considerable quantity of radioactive material, most of it of low grade radioactivity, which is used in industry and medicine day by day. I refer particularly to radioactive isotopes. Responsibility in that case comes primarily within the purview of the State health departments. What is being aimed at is a common code for radioactive materials throughout Australia which will be observed in the ordinary commercial movement and protection of such materials. That is being worked on now. Nothing will be done which will diminish the overall responsibilities of the Commonwealth as, indeed, the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry saw them, as the International Energy Agency sees them and as we see them in terms of nuclear non-proliferation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier in Question Time Senator Hearn asked me a question about Telecom facilities for disabled persons. I am able to advise the honourable senator that Telecom Australia has negotiated with a private supplier to make an acoustically coupled telephone typewriter readily available to deaf people in Australia. The new product is called Porta Printer Plus. I think that is the product to which the honourable senator referred. It is now available on a national basis through Telecom's business offices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The honourable senator asked also about disabled people and I promised to obtain further information on that subject. I am advised that, after extensive field research, work has commenced on the development of a new product called an access dialler which will enable people with severe upper limb difficulties and those with short term memory loss to set up a telephone call without assistance. The device is operated by two large push-button pads and it offers repertory dialling facilities. If it is combined with a loud speaking telephone, it can provide hand-free operation. It is planned to launch it at the end of next year.</PARA>
<PARA> Two other matters which are relevant to the honourable senator's question include a report prepared by Telecom entitled 'Disabled People and Telecommunications'. The report has been distributed nationally and overseas to increase public awareness in the International Year of Disabled Persons. The report is the result of a study relative to Australia's disabled population. It forms the basis for planning telecommunications technology to meet best the needs of disabled users. Finally, in each capital city there is a permanent centre displaying suitable products for disabled people. These special centres are staffed by trained consultants to provide specialist advice on a State-wide basis on telecommunications products and services for disabled customers. If any other aspects of the honourable senator's question remain unanswered, I will seek to obtain further information for her.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; Yesterday Senator McLaren asked me about workers compensation and third party insurance. I undertook to get a response from the Treasurer. The Treasurer, in his Press statement of 20 September, announced the Government's decision that the proposal by the Dutch-owned Nationale-Nederlanden (Australia) to increase its shareholding in Mercantile Mutual Holdings Ltd was not contrary to the national interest, subject to a number of amendments to the acquisition arrangements. The Treasurer referred also to a number of influences affecting the general insurance industry that had been taken into consideration in making the decision, including the influence of State government activities on general insurance business, including premium setting in respect of particular classes of business, as well as competition from State government insurance instrumentalities directed against the private sector. Notwithstanding any media interpretation, the Treasurer's comments should be seen simply as a reference to one of a number of influences affecting the industry which would be addressed as part of proposed government-industry discussions which would be conducted with a view to obtaining an up to date assessment of market conditions and industry prospects.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Since the tabling last Thursday of the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations we have witnessed an extraordinary sequence of events. That report contained 513 paragraphs. One could be excused for believing that it contained no paragraph other than paragraph 9.38. The first extraordinary event was that within 20 minutes or so of the report being tabled, the former Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Sinclair, rushed into the House of Representatives and made an ill-considered response aggressively to what the Committee's report carefully did not say. One wonders why he should have expected it to say what it carefully did not say. Since then the matter has escalated primarily as a result of the activities of Messrs Sinclair and Anthony.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Yesterday the Committee, after a meeting, issued a statement repeating what is the fact in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee stands by its conclusion that 'on the balance of probabilities, Mr Sinclair's recollection of the events was not as reliable as that of Mr Webster'. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be appreciated that this conclusion does not amount to a finding, one way or the other, that any possible misrepresentation involved in Mr Sinclair's account of events was deliberate. </PARA>
<PARA>Let me further identify what the Committee did not say. In paragraph 9.38, which was carefully drafted, we said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee concludes that on the balance of probabilities, Mr Sinclair's recollection of the events was not as reliable as that of Mr Webster. In other words, it appears to the Committee that on the balance of probabilities, Mr Sinclair was told of the terms of the compromise-</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise the words 'was told of the terms of the compromise'-</PARA>
<PARA>which necessarily involved a continuing breach of GATT. </PARA>
<PARA>That does not say that he was told expressly of the continuing breach of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, nor was there evidence which would have enabled the Committee to say that Mr Webster asserted at any time specifically that he mentioned a continuing breach of GATT. What Mr Webster told the Committee in clear and unequivocal terms was that he had told the Minister of the terms of the compromise reached in Manila on 15 November 1976. That compromise necessarily involved a continuation of the breach of GATT. Any Minister worthy of the position would, on being told of the terms of the arrangements, recognise that fact, particularly having regard to his prior knowledge of the existence of the breach. Notwithstanding this, Messrs Sinclair and Anthony and others chose to conduct the debate in the House of Representatives yesterday upon a basis of attempting to rebut that which the Committee had not stated. By adopting this tactic they were able to attempt to cast doubts upon the validity of the Committee's finding on the basis that Mr Webster did not tell us specifically that he had referred to the breach of GATT. The wildest accusations, the misrepresentation of the Committee's report and the clear and deliberate quotation out of context such as that engaged in by Mr Killen, which was most regrettable, I believe--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0P7">Senator PETER RAE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator Missen. All those things were part of that which happened yesterday to which I take the strongest exception. Time does not permit me to answer each of the various points raised. I will therefore concentrate on rebutting two new matters which were introduced in an attempt to besmirch the credibility of Mr Webster-a man already under police investigation at the instigation of this Government-and, thereby, apparently to prove the credibility of Mr Sinclair. I regard the innuendo that Mr Webster should be regarded as unreliable because he is the subject matter of a police inquiry as unworthy of those who would assert it. There is a clear presumption in this country that people are innocent until they have been proven guilty. That does not say that the Committee accepted every word in its totality which Mr Webster uttered in evidence to it. To suggest so, as was done yesterday, is absurd. The main point was not adverted to in yesterday's debate, apparently because most people were unfamiliar with the facts, the evidence and the documents-as they were with the report. However, I am not so sure that that can be said of Mr Sinclair. Mr Anthony referred to a document he tabled which was an extract from a record of interview in Melbourne on 13 October 1976, during which Mr Webster is noted as saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> . . . a discount of $25 per tonne . . . had been provided until recently when skim milk powder prices reached the minimum specified in the GATT-SMP arrangement. . . . the ADC had invoked the Majeure clause in the contract in order to discontinue sales to the Philippines at prices which would have been inconsistent with the GATT minimum. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Anthony concluded from that document that Mr Webster had given the Trade Development Council information that was wrong. He pointed to the fact, as did Mr Sinclair, that it was not until subsequently, on 9 November, that Mr Sinclair instructed Mr Webster to cease the breach of GATT. Far from this information being wrong, it is totally corroborated by the correspondence available to Mr Sinclair. I repeat that it is totally corroborated by the correspondence available to Mr Sinclair. I would like to refer briefly to that correspondence. I start with a telex of 27 September 1976. I remind honourable senators that on about 31 August the Department of Primary Industry, having had the information available to it since the beginning of April 1976, finally woke up to the fact that there may have been a breach of GATT going on and took some action. Acting with great speed and alacrity, after some four months, it sent a telex to the Australian Dairy Corporation suggesting that action could be taken in relation to the matter. That telex was received at the beginning of September. I refer to a telex of 27 September 1976. It is from Mr Uytengsu and it is addressed to Tony Webster. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Believe your action to arbitrarily cutoff or reduce supply and change arrangement without reasonable notice due to your own peculiar internal problems is unfair and prejudicial . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In other words there is the confirmation in a telex from Mr Uytengsu that Mr Webster had already taken action to terminate the breach of GATT. I turn to a letter of 14 October. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Walsh" NAMEID="TJ4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What date was that?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0P7">Senator PETER RAE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was 27 September 1976. However, a letter of 14 October, which I will table, is far more important still. It is a letter from Mr Uytengsu of Holland Milk Products Industries Inc., a copy of which was sent to the Honourable Ian Sinclair. I will quote from that letter. It is addressed to Mr A. A. S. Webster. Amongst other things, it states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Now to suddenly cut us off on your commitment as to milk supply in such a short notice is unfair to a customer who is also your partner. </PARA>
<PARA> You will also recall that during your visit last September 1976-</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, it is the confirmation, again from Mr Uytengsu, that Mr Webster had acted in September after receiving the telex from the Department of Primary Industry. I go on to more interesting correspondence. On 14 December 1977, in a letter from Holland Milk Products to Mr Webster, the following statement appears:</PARA>
<PARA> There can be no doubt that this type of strained relationship cannot continue to go on as partners and I must now indicate to you that I am no longer prepared to accept your presence on our Board, and so long as you remain the Chairman of the Australian Dairy Corporation, our company will not buy one single pound of Australian milk powder. </PARA>
<PARA>There is a futher statement which reads:</PARA>
<PARA> I must therefore demand that you arrange for me to have a meeting sometime during late January in Canberra with the Minister for Primary Industry, Mr. Ian Sinclair, or your First Assistant Secretary, Mr A. Wallace, First Assistant Under-secretary of the Department . . . </PARA>
<PARA>A carbon copy of that letter was sent to Mr Ian Sinclair. I refer to that letter only because it is the next letter which is of real significance. It is a letter dated 23 December 1977 from Mr Webster who, at that time, would have been unlikely to believe that this inquiry would take place and that he would one day be accused of the misrepresentation and lack of credibility of which he was accused yesterday in the House of Representatives. In that letter addressed to Mr Uytengsu he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> I can assure you that the Australian Minister for Primary Industry and the First Assistant Secretary, Mr Wallace, are fully aware of the facts and have been throughout, and there has never been any suggestion of impropriety on any individual's part. </PARA>
<PARA>That statement relates to the actions which had led to the cessation of the contract and the relationships between the Australian Dairy Corporation and Holland Milk Products in the sale of skim milk powder. I repeat that in December 1977 Mr Webster said:</PARA>
<PARA> I can assure you that the Australian Minister for Primary Industry and the First Assistant Secretary, Mr Wallace, are fully aware of the facts . . . </PARA>
<PARA>There are one or two other small matters in relation to that evidence which I do not think time will permit me to refer to in any detail. Those are letters which are available and which have been known to the Department of Primary Industry, copies of most of which have been sent to Mr Sinclair. Yet those statements besmirching the credibility of Mr Webster were made by those two Ministers yesterday-accusing him on the basis of this extract from a record of interview with Mr Tony Webster, Chairman, and Mr Alan Page, senior marketing officer of the Australian Dairy Corporation, in Melbourne on 13 October 1976. They made their case substantially rest on this attack on Mr Webster. I ask the Senate and the gentlemen themselves: Who is it now who may be regarded as a reliable witness? I repeat: Who is it now who may be regarded as a reliable witness? Mr Webster commenced breaking off the contract in breach of GATT in September early after it had been drawn to the attention of the ADC by the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> There can be no doubt that at the time in October 1976 when Mr Webster said what he said, which was that he had taken action in the Philippines in relation to this contract, that the ADC had invoked the majeure clause. We then find that some new act intervened in this situation between 13 October 1976 and 15 November 1976 when, surprisingly, Mr Webster negotiated a contract which involved the continuation of the breach of GATT until the end of June 1977. What was the act, of which we are aware, which took place between 13 October and 15 November 1976? It was the interview with Mr Sinclair. What was said by Mr Norwood, the General Manager of the Australian Dairy Corporation? He said that it was a very touchy subject and that there was great concern as to what would happen if this contract were suddenly broken off and Australia was forced to find a new outlet, at a time of overproduction around the world, for its excess amounts of skim milk powder. That evidence is in the transcript of evidence at pages 184 to 188. That was one act which perhaps caused Mr Webster to reconsider whether he should continue on the course he had already so clearly and demonstrably set in train to cut off Australia's continuing supplies of SMP at a price below the world GATT minimum. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the reasonableness of the interpretation placed on Mr Webster's letter of 19 November 1976 to Mr Sinclair, which specifically refers to the letter of 14 October 1976. I have the letter of 14 October 1976 to Mr Webster from Mr Uytengsu. That letter makes no reference to a breach of GATT. How is it, then, that Mr Sinclair concluded, when he received a letter, that at the meeting in Manila on 15 November an amicable arrangement had been made in relation to the matters raised in the letter of 14 October and that that proved conclusively that there was no continuation of a breach of GATT? It is absurd to suggest that that was a reasonable interpretation. There was no reference to a breach of GATT. Mr Sinclair had received copies of the correspondence in September and October and yet pretends innocence that he really first became involved in the matter on 9 November. He had known for months and took no action. One asks: Why? I say all of this in relation to the first item of the matter of public importance. There are so many unanswered questions and such an apparent loss of memory by Mr Sinclair that one wonders how and whether it would be possible for Mr Webster to have the result of a police inquiry impartially and objectively considered by people who have treated Mr Webster in the way in which he was treated yesterday in the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> I pass briefly to what I trust my colleagues will be talking about in more detail, that is, the history of a disastrously inept administration in the Department of Primary Industry and a free-wheeling subsidiary which behaved as if money was going out of fashion and accountability was an unknown word, a Department which behaved as if it could see no evil, hear no evil and speak no evil, and it did not really matter what else happened. There was not either on the Australian Dairy Produce Board an observer from the Department or on the Board of the Australian Dairy Corporation a member who was a senior officer of the Department, and all these things happened year after year during the period the Committee investigated these matters. What action was taken by the Department? What steps were taken by the Department to correct this situation? The first memorandum was in 1972 and there was another in 1975, but was anything done? Was anything done other than putting some suggestions on paper? Did we see any real change? By 1977 the Department got around to discussing whether there might not be some guidelines. I gather from what Mr Nixon said last night that it might now have introduced them-in 1981, only about nine years after the obvious, clear necessity for action became apparent to every person who was in any way involved in the consideration of the administration of the affairs of the dairy industry by a Government agency, its subsidiaries and the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> A breach of GATT existed for 15 months, from April 1976 until June 1977, to the available knowledge-I emphasise available knowledge-of the Department, because an officer was present when the two matters were discussed at an adjacent time at a Board meeting, but, he says, he never thought to put the matters together. For 15 months that breach of GATT continued, notwithstanding the fact that at one stage the Department said to the ADC that it should stop and at another stage the Minister said it should stop. Yet apparently nobody took any steps on behalf of the Department, nor did the Minister take any steps; nor did they seem to say yesterday that they thought they had to take any steps even to inquire specifically whether the breach of GATT had stopped. Is it a case where the Minister, perhaps in the best interests of the primary producers and the skim milk powder processors of Australia, decided that the contract should be honoured? Mr Uytengsu was certainly becoming most unhappy, most threatening, about the attempt to break the contract. </PARA>
<PARA> One wonders what really happened at that discussion on 9 November which led Mr Webster to go to negotiate the agreement he did on 15 November in Manila, which involved the continuation of the breach of GATT. What the Committee did not say in any way was that Mr Webster had told Mr Sinclair of the continuation of the breach of GATT. The Committee said that he had told him of the facts which necessarily involved, to anyone who liked to apply himself, a continuation of the breach of GATT. I wonder-I conclude with this-why it was that Mr Sinclair, having received the report, went straight into the House to defend himself against a charge that was not made by the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unlike my learned Committee Chairman, Senator Rae, I do not normally take the view that we here in the Senate are the last bastion of rational and civilised politics in this country and that we need to defend ourselves against the hairy barbarians of popular democracy beating on our doors from across King's Hall. Equally, I take the view that the Senate committee system is one of the more rational and substantial achievements of our parliamentary system. The many reports that over the years have been generated by Senate select and standing committees have been, with no exceptions that I can think of, fair and balanced, well researched, well reasoned, and reasonably lucidly constructed and written. I believe that the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations on the Australian Dairy Corporation and its Asian subsidiaries does fall squarely within this description. There is nothing in it from which we as Committee members, or indeed the Senate as a whole, need backtrack or resile. It is a matter of profound disappointment that Government spokesmen have chosen to deal with the political embarrassment undoubtedly caused by some of our findings in that report not with reasoned argument but rather with misrepresentation, calumny and invective.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The report, of course, is about many more things than simply the credibility of Mr Sinclair. Some of those things-certainly not all-are listed in the title of the matter of public importance set down for today, and they are the issues that will be picked up and pursued by my colleague Senator Walsh. That said, it can scarcely be denied that one of the real issues raised by the report is the credibility of the former Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Sinclair, in claiming, as he has, that he was not told of the actual terms of the arrangement to wind up the $25 rebate and that, as a result, he was not a party in any way to the continuation of the breach of Australia's international treaty obligations. This is the issue which occupied the House of Representatives yesterday and which occasioned the extraordinary outpouring of vitriol on the Senate Committee-both its findings and its individual members-that we yesterday witnessed. This is the issue which, accordingly, I believe most urgently needs to be put back into its proper perspective. This is the one on which, like Senator Rae, I will concentrate. As we all know, the Committee's finding stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee concludes that on the balance of probabilities, Mr Sinclair's recollection of the events was not as reliable as that of Mr Webster. </PARA>
<PARA>We did leave entirely open the question of whether there was anything deliberate about any misrepresentation that may have been involved, on some views, by Mr Sinclair's account. However, that fact has been systematically ignored by those who have mounted the defence on his behalf. </PARA>
<PARA> We are dealing here with very complex questions of fact, and it is easy to get totally bewildered by claims and counterclaims, by quotes and counterquotes. I suspect that that is at least part of the response of those who witnessed or read about yesterday's debate. I believe that the issues can be best untangled here today and that the respective credibility of the Committee's findings on the one hand and Mr Sinclair's defence on the other hand can be best assessed if we break the elements of the dispute into five distinct areas: Firstly, the meaning of Mr Webster's evidence; secondly, the credibility of Mr Webster as a witness; thirdly, the credibility of Mr Sinclair's answer in the context of the whole sequence of events from which that answer was derived; fourthly, the effect of the evidence of the two departmental witnesses, Messrs Wallace and O'Bryan; and, finally, the effect of the documentary evidence that has been called in aid, apparently, by Mr Sinclair in his reference to 'all the minutes and documentation that were available to the Department of Primary Industry'. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at each of those points in turn and try to get the debate on this particular and rather complex matter back on the rails. Let us deal first of all with the meaning of Mr Webster's evidence. Was it in fact claimed by Mr Webster that Mr Sinclair had been told in substance of the actual terms of the termination agreement or was it rather the case, no doubt as a result, as Mr Spender would say, of my inadequate cross-examination, that he was allowed to get away with just hinting at this without actually committing himself to unequivocal statements with which he might later be caught out? That is the question here. I raise a few quick points in relation to it. The first one is that, obviously, there has been an extraordinary selectivity here, as elsewhere, in the quotations which have been employed in support of that particular thesis. I do not believe that any fair minded observer could be left in any doubt, especially upon reading the evidence of Mr Webster as a whole and not just the segment of it that is extracted in the text of the report, that the 'facts' and 'details' which Mr Webster says he put to the Minister were the facts about the continuation of the breach of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer the Senate to three extracts from among many which could be chosen from my cross-examination of Mr Webster in order to refresh the minds of those who no doubt have been poring over the report so assiduously over the last few days. I quote from page 147 of the report:</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Was the Minister made aware of the fact that the GATT minimum was still being breached by virtue of the post-15 November arrangement?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Webster-I advised the Minister of the facts. </PARA>
<PARA>The exact same word is used. The same expression is used. And this, of course, follows a long sequence of earlier cross-examinations in which Mr Webster had made it perfectly clear what the facts had been and had identified them as such. I quote now from page 148 of the report:</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Did the Minister endorse the solution that you had reached in Manila or did he tell you to go and renegotiate it because GATT was clearly continuing to be breached?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Webster-The Minister noted what I said. </PARA>
<PARA>That followed, when read in context, a clear indication by Mr Webster of what he had in fact said on just that issue. The long preceding answer makes that clear. Finally, here, on page 149 of the report, is perhaps the most direct, explicit and unqualified assertion of them all, following my question in the following terms:</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Was the decision to continue those shipments through until June 1977, notwithstanding the breach of GATT, brought to the full knowledge of the Government?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Webster-It was aware. </PARA>
<PARA>How could one be more unqualified? How could one be more precise than that? Obviously the Government defenders of Mr Sinclair believe that the Webster evidence can be subject to no other possible interpretation than that which it has, of course, universally been given. They would hardly otherwise have taken such pains to try to destroy Mr Webster's credibility, a point to which I will come back. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me say this in further elaboration of this particular point about the meaning of Mr Webster's evidence. I readily acknowledge that my cross-examination of Mr Webster, which took place in the initial exploratory phase, it needs to be remembered, of the inquiry, and in a context where the claims here being made for the first time certainly caught us somewhat by surprise, could possibly have been supplemented by further questions designed to produce even more unequivocal answers. I note in this respect that there seem to be no complaints from Mr Spender about my skills in cross-examination later in the evidence when it came to testing Mr Wallace. It was only by my continuing to press and draw him out in the interests of fairness, after he had made a complete fool of himself, that any kind of direct and unequivocal answer was produced. I wish Mr Spender's greater court experience was matched by the intellectual capacity to employ it in this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly I gave consideration personally as to whether Mr Webster should be recalled to give supplementary evidence. I certainly would have been only too happy to insist on this had any doubt been raised by Mr Sinclair, or anyone acting on his behalf, as to what Mr Webster was actually saying when Mr Webster's evidence was first put to him. But the point is, of course, that no such doubt was raised and, as a result no such re-examination seemed to be necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Peter Rae's letter to Mr Sinclair on behalf of the Committee dated 25 March, drew attention to what he described as 'a clear discrepancy' between Mr Webster's evidence and Mr Sinclair's recollection, as that recollection had been expressed in Mr Sinclair's initial letter to the Committee of 16 March. But nowhere in that initial letter from Mr Sinclair, or in Mr Sinclair's reply of 22 April to the second Rae letter, or in Mr Sinclair's subsequent personal explanation of 7 May-all of which are fully set out in the text of the report-is the point taken that Mr Webster's evidence is not clear and unequivocal. The claim that the Webster evidence is imprecise and meaningless has all the earmarks of a recent invention designed to help the Minister extricate himself from the hook on which it is all too obvious he has impaled himself. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the credibility of Mr Webster as a witness. Mighty efforts were made, of course, by Mr Sinclair's defenders to impugn Mr Webster, to destroy his reputation and character, in order, of course, to destroy the credibility of the evidence that he gave. Reference was made to an unsigned memorandum of 13 October in which Mr Webster is said to have told certain persons interested in Australia's trade policy that action had been taken to discontinue Australia's sales of skim milk powder to the Philippines because of the GATT breach. It may be that Mr Webster did not tell the full story to those whom, here, he had no obligation to do so of just when that particular discontinuance was likely to become operative. A more likely interpretation, however, is that, as Senator Peter Rae has said, Mr Webster had embarked already on the process of discontinuing, of severing, our sales arrangement with the Philippines on 13 October when he spoke to these gentlemen, but that following the meeting with Mr Sinclair on 9 November he changed course. That seems to me to be a much more likely interpretation. It appears that the famous memorandum, the new memorandum, the one piece of documentary evidence newly appearing on the scene in yesterday's debate, will prove to be one of those double-edged swords which has returned, Viner-like, to decapitate its wielder. </PARA>
<PARA> It may be, however, if the worst light is put upon that event of 13 October, as Mr Norwood attested and as is also referred to in the O'Bryan letter, and of course as was pointed out in the House of Representatives, that Mr Webster did not tell the Board of the ADC either of all the details of the termination arrangements or when the sales were to actually cease. That may not have been unusual, regrettably, in Mr Webster's dealings with the Board, and certainly it is no more defensible for that. It may again prove, of course, to be the case that Mr Webster will in fact prove to be in trouble on matters of financial administration when the long awaited reports of the Auditor-General, and more particularly of the police, are eventually tabled. Certainly there were some not very well concealed hints and suggestions darkly made to this effect by some of the more high minded of Mr Sinclair's defenders in the other place. </PARA>
<PARA> The point is, of course, that all this kind of material, with the one exception of the memorandum of 13 October, was known to the Committee and was taken into account in the course of our deliberations. The Committee was well aware of a number of Mr Webster's managerial and other limitations. We have indeed been highly critical of Mr Webster at several points in that report. But we were anything but naive about what might be said and what might be thought about Mr Webster's credibility. We took that very much into account in finding as we did. </PARA>
<PARA> The third point, of course, is the credibility of Mr Sinclair's claims in the context, as I have said, of the sequence of evidence from which they arose. Mr Sinclair did not put his evidence on oath but he did make a solemn statement to the House of Representatives and I, for one, am not disposed to make much of the difference. Clearly his evidence has to be given great weight; but it should not be accepted blindly. The one thing I think, perhaps more than most other things, that told against it to the Committee was the total situation, the total context in which the claim by Mr Sinclair came to be made. Let me remind the Senate of the undisputed evidence as to the chronology of immediately relevant events. In April 1976 the ADC knew for the first time of the impending price drop and that this would result in a breach of GATT. In late August or early September, perhaps earlier than that but certainly no later, the Department became aware of the breach and requested the ADC to do something about it. During September 1976, on Mr Wallace's explicit written evidence early on, the Minister was notified of the breach. On 9 November 1976, following discussions which we are told by Mr Norwood in evidence were at length between Mr Webster and the Minister, the Minister requested, not directed-on his own account in the letter to Mr Sinclair on 16 March this year-Mr Webster to take action to remedy the situation. On 15 November 1976 the rebate termination arrangements were negotiated in Manila. On 19 November Webster's letter to Sinclair was received, saying that an amicable solution had been reached. </PARA>
<PARA> So much, of course, is clear. What is in dispute is whether, following Webster's return, there was any meeting between Webster and Sinclair in the course of which the actual terms of the settlement were in substance communicated to Sinclair so that he knew that, although sales were to be terminated, the breach would in fact continue for another six months until Australia's accumulated rebate credit was exhausted. It appeared to the Committee to be beyond reasonable comprehension in all the circumstances that Mr Sinclair, despite his well known indifference to some matters of administrative detail, would not have had the curiosity to find out how it came to be that this very difficult and, as Senater Peter Rae has said, very sensitive contract had been able to be so amicably terminated. The matter was one of very great gravity, although one could be forgiven for thinking the ADC and the DPI thought otherwise, given the delays which occurred in their taking serious action on this, not to mention the delay of the Minister between when he first became aware of it in September and when he gave his direction, or request, whatever it may have been, to Webster on 9 November. It was also an issue which was obviously pregnant with gravity so far as the possibility of embarrassment politically, domestically and in terms of our international trade reputation was concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> There was, on all the evidence, despite what was said yesterday in the House of Representatives, a mountain of skim milk powder crying out to be moved and accordingly pressure of an enormously significant kind was coming from the dairy industry. The matter had been the subject again of high level discussion, as we know, in the Department and of course on the Minister's office. Mr Uytengu's hostility to any variation of the contract and indeed to all the cast of characters involved in this matter was, as Senator Peter Rae has told us again today, well known. The termination of the contract was not something that could just be unilaterally accomplished by a stroke of the pen. We had a high-powered negotiating team which had just been dispatched to Manila and had just returned. </PARA>
<PARA> Does anyone really believe that under these circumstances Mr Sinclair's curiosity was so minimal that he simply took absolutely at face value the proposition that an amicable solution to the problem had been reached? Mr Norwood, now of course Manager of the Australian Dairy Corporation, then a member of the Manila negotiating team, put the real probabilities of the situation very neatly in a passage in his evidence which occurs, as it turns out, just a couple of paragraphs before that which was quoted supposedly against the Committee in the House of Representatives yesterday. On pages 185 and 186 of the transcript Mr Norwood is reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> If we had told the Minister we had a problem and obtained his agreement to a course of action, I would find it very surprising if the result of those negotiations were not conveyed to the Minister in some way. Our files show that that was done neither by Telex nor by letter, nor was any official advice conveyed to the Department. But knowing it was such a touchy subject, I would be surprised if we did not relay the information in some way. </PARA>
<PARA>The transcript goes on:</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Are we entitled to assume that firstly the Department and secondly the Minister were made aware of the final washup arrangement made with Mr Uytengsu and of the intention to continue giving Mr Uytengsu a $25 per tonne rebate in breach of the GATT minimum price?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Norwood-Logic would tell me that the Government would have been advised of the outcome of the debate with Mr Uytengsu, even if not of its implications: That the arrangement was to continue for some time. </PARA>
<PARA>I think the fourth point-the evidence of the departmental witnesses, Messrs O'Bryan and Wallace-can be dealt with much more quickly. It appeared likely from Webster's evidence that one or other of those officers had been present at the meeting which Webster claimed had taken place. Mr O'Bryan's evidence, either orally to the Committee or in the letter which it was claimed, entirely erroneously, had been suppressed, made it clear certainly that he had not been party to any such meeting and knew of no such meeting. He also made it clear that he was away on sick leave at the crucial time, between 11 October and 29 November 1976, which period, of course, included the crucial fortnight immediately after the return of the negotiating team from Manila. I think Mr Wallace's evidence, which did finally produce a clear-cut denial which has been much relied upon, is perhaps best left to speak for itself with a little help, as we have had in recent days, from Senator Peter Rae. Suffice it to say that demeanour is crucially important in assessing any witness's credibility and that Mr Wallace's demeanour and the way he prevaricated in his answers were such as to leave no one who physically attended that hearing in any doubt but that his evidence was worthless. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I come to the fifth point, the famous documentary evidence which Mr Sinclair claimed existed in departmental files and would exonerate him completely. We were somewhat disconcerted on the Committee to find that there was apparently such a body of crucially probative documentary evidence. We had been told on several occasions that no such documentary evidence existed. We waited with bated breath for the revelations in the House of Representatives yesterday, but when it came time to put up or shut up in the House of Representatives yesterday the dog failed to bark. 'There was no documentary evidence as to any such meeting,' said Mr Sinclair, 'and therein', said Mr Sinclair triumphantly, 'lies the proof that no such meeting occurred'. The fact that there might be another explanation for the absence of a departmental minute of this kind does not seem to have occurred to Mr Sinclair. It was all, of course, a diversionary tactic. Any reply will do, however misleading, if it takes the heat off. No document has been produced, with the exception of the memo of 13 October, which we have already dealt with, which was not fully taken into account by the Committee in its findings. What I am sure about, when all is said and done and the history of this matter is written, is that this Committee and its report, despite all the abuse that has been heaped upon them, will stand a lot more respectably, a lot more honourably and a lot more proudly than the reputations of those who have sought to malign them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I had proposed to speak towards the end of this debate because I had understood that we were debating a matter of public importance in the terms that were submitted by Senator Peter Rae. It does seem to me, however, having listened to Senator Peter Rae and Senator Evans, that we are indeed debating not 'the nature of the administration of the Department of Primary Industry', not 'the relationship between Ministers and statutory authorities', not 'the accountability of statutory authorities and their subsidiaries to the Parliament and to the Government', not 'the future of Asia Dairy Industries and the Dairy Industry Stabilisation Fund', but we are debating yet again the credibility of Mr Sinclair and the finding of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations as set out in paragraph 9.38 of its report which was, of course, the first finding that called forth comment in this chamber after Senator Peter Rae put down the report in this place only last week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To that extent we are not debating an examination of how this country ought to be run. Let us not fool ourselves or try to fool anybody else. We are debating questions which are purely political and which were described by the Chairman of the Committee when he was talking about criticism of the fact that the Committee had made a finding on credibility. On 22 September he said:</PARA>
<PARA> In other words we did all those things which juries around Australia are every day asked to do. Having assessed that evidence we reached a conclusion on the basis used in proceedings of the civil courts of Australia, that is, the standard of proof . . . </PARA>
<PARA>And so on. In other words, this Committee has set itself up as a court. It has made findings on disputed questions of fact. It has made findings of law. For example, it has made findings as to the validity or otherwise of a contract. I think that in trying to move from the role of a Senate committee, from the role of a parliamentary committee to the role of the courts, the Committee has made a fundamental mistake. Senator Evans smugly asserted that he will be judged kindly by history, but the outcome may well depend on the future role of this Parliament in its treatment of Australian citizens and whether it is seen as an oppressor or indeed as a parliament which protects the people. </PARA>
<PARA> For, I suppose, 10 years now I have been discussing with Senator Peter Rae the role of parliamentary committees. That is not an academic matter in this country. Since the Senate set out on its new committee activities and the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange brought before it some people who were potentially under threat of prosecution and asked them questions, there has been debate in this country about the role of parliamentary committees. In the few minutes I have in this debate I do not have time to expand on that matter, but I raise before the Senate what I see as a very serious question-whether it is proper for the Senate Committee to have set out to be judge, jury and prosecutor and to assume all the other roles that it assumed in this matter. I would like very quickly to refer to the sorts of difficulties which arise in this area and which were mentioned in the Australian Law Journal back in the early part of the 1970s when this matter was being so vigorously debated. I shall read a short passage from that journal. I ask honourable senators to apply this passage very soberly to the sort of debate which has taken place in this chamber and in the other place since this report was brought down. I quote a very small extract referring to the powers of the Houses to punish. I think this is a power which has been discussed in the context of committee activities. The journal stated:</PARA>
<PARA> There is no calm, deliberative atmosphere such as exists in a court of law. There is no independent tribunal trained to disregard irrelevancies and emotional responses. There is only the prosecutor, represented by a large number of members of the house of parliament, mostly unfitted by training for the task or bound by party discipline to vote as directed and resentful perhaps of the conduct of the person to be punished. </PARA>
<PARA>I know that every member of the Committee will reject that but I ask them to consider soberly whether, as in the words of the Chairman, they are entitled to act as a jury in these matters and whether they should hold out themselves as having the ability to make the sorts of findings which have been made. Because time is very limited I will address myself briefly to the two major areas which have arisen in the debate. One is not directly raised in the matter of public importance, that is, the criticisms of the Minister for Communications, Mr Sinclair. The other is the substance of the matter of public importance, which is the question of the administration of the Department of Primary Industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the key point in the second area is that the criticisms of the Department, which I have been told in this debate extend over ten years, are criticisms which to a large extent have already been recognised by government over a period and which to a large extent have been acted upon by government. The central points of the speeches which have been made so far relate to the question of Mr Sinclair's credibility. Mr President, those matters have been addressed at some length in the House of Representatives. I would commend the debate in that place to your attention, and particularly the speech of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) which I think is an extremely good analysis of why the finding of the Committee can be called into doubt. I do not think any lawyer would doubt that if this were a judgment of a court-we might wish it were-it would be appealable. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the facts which are beyond dispute and which are apparent from the report itself. It is accepted by the Committee that Mr Sinclair issued an order that as the existing arrangement breached the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade it had to cease. There is no argument about that. The Minister learned of the breach-there is criticism because he did not learn of it early enough-and he said that it had to be brought to an end. There is evidence from Mr Norwood that Mr Webster had said that the Minister had acknowledged the reason the contract had been entered into with the rebate and pointed out that if the arrangement now breached GATT it must cease. Mr Sinclair advised the Committee that he could recall discussing the situation with Mr Webster in November 1976 and requested him to take action to rectify the situation so that the GATT minimum price would be observed. They are matters about which there is no dispute. The Minister found out about the breach and ordered that it cease. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no dispute about that fact-the Committee reported this-that the Chairman of the Australian Dairy Corporation was sent on a special trip to the Philippines to implement the request of the Minister. That is a second undisputed fact. The Minister ordered the practice to cease and the Chairman went off to the Philippines to do something about it. There is no dispute about the fact that an agreement was made on 15 November. The third schedule to the report contains that agreement. The terms of it might lead one to doubt that the Minister's request or order had been complied with, but the fact is that an agreement was made. There is no dispute that, within a matter of days, Mr Webster wrote to Mr Sinclair in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA> It was possible for us to arrive at an amicable solution to our outstanding difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the only piece of writing which has been produced by anybody which bears directly on this fundamental point. The great amount of concern that has been expressed about what other evidence might be available really relates to the fact that in the great mass of written material which exists there is absolutely nothing to suggest that Mr Sinclair was advised otherwise than in accordance with that letter. That is the sole piece of direct corroborating evidence. I note that Senator Evans is nodding his head. There is no dispute about that set of facts. </PARA>
<PARA> The odd set of facts is that the agreement of 15 November is one which doubtfully removed the breach of GATT, although that is a matter on which the report is uncertain. I think there is room for some uncertainty as to whether the agreement did continue a breach of GATT. That merely underlines the difficulty of a finding which suggests that Mr Webster somehow put Mr Sinclair in possession of enough facts for him to be quite clear a breach of GATT had continued. It is quite clear, when one looks at the third schedule to the report, that there is room for argument that that arrangement would not contravene GATT. But that is merely a measure of the complexity of the question that has to be determined. </PARA>
<PARA> The one piece of writing on which there is no doubt is that which confirms that there was an amicable solution reached in relation to the outstanding difficulties. The difficulty which caused the trip to the Philippines was, of course, the difficulty over GATT. Questions were then pursued by the Committee. The examination of the Public Service witnesses produced evidence which was, if anything, supportive of Mr Sinclair. Firstly, there was the evidence that Mr O'Bryan was possibly one of the public servants present. But he clearly indicated that he was not present at any such conversation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee described the evidence which it chose to doubt as evidence which only lightly supported the Right Honourable Ian Sinclair. The fact is that any evidence which came before the Committee was evidence which buttressed the evidence of Mr Sinclair. The only justification which can be given for a finding which is adverse to Mr Sinclair's recollection-I stress that it is a finding which is adverse to his recollection only-is that the Committee chose to have a very poor opinion of one of the witnesses who appeared before it. That is the sole straw on which the Committee was able to rest its case that the finding should be adverse to Mr Sinclair. The whole of the evidence which is beyond doubt-the whole of the evidence which is clear and unequivocal-favours the Minister. The evidence which goes against him is equivocal. I believe the finding which has been made by the Committee is a finding which is, therefore, not justified by the facts. </PARA>
<PARA> In the brief time which is available to me I wish to refer to the recommendations of the Committee. The recommendations go substantially to the administration of the Department and of statutory authorities. I mention some of the matters which have been given attention by the Government. For a more detailed catalogue I refer the Senate again the speech, which was given by the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) in the other place yesterday. The matters which were referred to the Committee arose out of the fact that the Government had already taken action on the matters which were of concern to it. The matter was referred to the Auditor-General by the Minister for Primary Industry. The Minister sought the intervention of the Auditor-General in these matters. Several reports have been received from the Auditor-General and, in fact, action has been taken with respect to the recommendations of those reports, including a reference to the police with respect to matters which appeared to give rise to the possibility of offences having been committed. </PARA>
<PARA> Among the recommendations of the Committee-they concern matters already acted upon by the Government as a result of implementing recommendations contained in the reports of the Auditor-General-are the following: Firstly, there was a recommendation that there should be a clear definition of the powers, authorities and delegations of the Australian Dairy Coporation and the boards and management of Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd. This has been done. The position in respect of each body is now clearly defined. This was done prior to the receipt of the report. There was a recommendation that there should be an upgrading of systems, documentation and approval processes. A revised system of budgetary control and improved documentation standards has been introduced. A recommendation was made that future borrowings by ADI are to be subject to guidelines developed by the Minister for Primary Industry and the Treasurer. These are in the final stages of development. In the meantime, no borrowings are being approved without the specific approval of both Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a recommendation that investments by ADI are to accord with guidelines determined by the Minister. These are being finalised along with the borrowing guidelines. In the meantime, no investments are taking place without the Minister's specific approval. The recommendation that the charging of expenditure and the allocation of costs between ADC, ADI and the joint venture companies be delineated has already been established by the boards of the ADC and the ADI. One of the main themes in the Committee's report was the control of expenditure by these two bodies. Many of the specific matters raised by the Auditor-General in his report to the Minister have also been acted upon with a consequent tightening of financial control. </PARA>
<PARA> May I in conclusion say that when one looks at the response of the Senate when this report was first put down, one is left with a very clear answer to the query that Senator Peter Rae raised as to why Mr Sinclair should go into the Parliament and respond to the report at such short notice. I remind the Senate that within minutes of the report being put down in this place serious allegations were being made about Mr Sinclair, he was being accused and senators who had not read this report were endorsing it and endorsing the Committee for its careful work. It sits ill in the mouth of senators to condemn a man for defending himself when he was damned by people who had not even read the report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the record I want to make it known at the outset that I was not, as Senator Peter Rae put it the other day, at any relevant stage a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations which produced this report. I did not contribute at all to the preparation of the report. I have had, however, a deep and sustained interest in the matters that it covers and I did table in October of last year extracts from the Auditor-General's report which the Committee acknowledges on page 288 was probably critical to its subsequent investigation. I might add that for tabling those documents I was villified by Country Party Ministers and by agro-industrial politicians such as Messrs Pyle and Bennett. They were supported by a slothful, sycophantic and, in some instances, corrupt agricultural media.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I support Senator Rae's proposal which essentially is that the Parliament should examine and debate the issues raised by the report. The scandals exposed last week, and previously, are due partly to structural defects in the bodies concerned but mostly to the negligence, incompetence and continual deceit of the Country Party Ministers who have controlled the authorities in question and to their vigorous endeavour to protect their cronies and lackies in the Australian Dairy Corporation-an effort maintained right up to yesterday when they turned on some of those cronies and lackies in a desperate attempt to save their own skins. Yesterday the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) accused the Committee of having presented in its report a very limited analysis, of being silent on many big policy issues and of focusing on certain negative aspects in the management and control of the Australian Dairy Corporation. There was certainly plenty of the last item but I have not time to cite examples. </PARA>
<PARA> In spite of what Mr Anthony said, the Committee did make recommendations on a number of important matters. Among others, it recommended that the Dairy Corporation should present a biannual financial report. It recommended that the Auditor-General should register as an auditor in Hong Kong in order that he could audit the books of the subsidiary, Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd, as well as its parent corporation. The Committee recommended that reports on section 63P audits-that is, special audits-should be made available to Parliament and to the public. That is in contrast, I observe, to the practice followed by the present Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) who has been sitting on the report of a section 63P audit for more than two years. It also recommended that Asia Dairy Industries should not have wider powers than the Dairy Corporation, which is its parent, and of course demonstrated the ways in which it does at present have wider powers. It recommended that the ministerial power of direction should be explicitly written into the Dairy Produce Act and that when that power is used it should be exercised only in writing and that the facts should be reported to the Parliament sooner or later. It described the present Deputy Chairman of the Australian Dairy Corporation as a man who was guilty of both stupidity and dishonesty. Are those acceptable attributes in the Deputy Chairman of the Corporation? Does the Government accept the findings of the Committee with respect to Mr Pyle? It it does, does the present Minister believe that stupidity and dishonesty are acceptable attributes in the Deputy Chairman of the Australian Dairy Corporation? If he does not believe it, when will he exercise his power under section 8 of the Dairy Produce Act to dismiss Mr Pyle, whom the Committee of this Senate has found to be stupid and dishonest, from that position?</PARA>
<PARA> What is the Government's reaction to any of those recommendations of the Committee that I have mentioned and the others that I have not mentioned? Today from Senator Chaney we had, to a very limited extent, some response. Yesterday in the House of Representatives from the Ministers responsible, past and present, we had no response at all. The Government's response to the questions I have raised is a matter for wide-eyed conjecture with the possible exception of its response to the mandatory tabling of section 63P audits. Since the present Minister has been sitting on such an audit report for more than two years one could quite reasonably assume that the Government has rejected that recommendation of the Committee in advance. Though Government Ministers who spoke yesterday in the House of Representatives were mute on matters of policy, Country Party Ministers in particular were certainly verbose on other matters-such as smearing the Committee and blaming everyone but themselves and the Department of Primary Industry for the villainies and peccadillos disclosed in the report. The primary defence was that Mr Sinclair did not know what was going on at the time that many of the matters were taking place. He in fact did know, and I will deal with that later. But even if he did not know, what is the judgment of the Government on this view on ministerial obligation which was presented at the 38th Summer School held from 29th to 31st January 1972:</PARA>
<PARA> But if a major blunder occurred in a department, of real importance to Australia, and if the Minister were unaware of it, the Minister should accept responsibility for the mistakes of his department and offer to resign. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the opinion presented nine years ago by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). Is that still what guides the Government on these matters? Are breaches of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and tax evasion in foreign countries by Australian government agencies matters of real importance to Australia? If they are, has Mr Sinclair offered to resign? If he has not offered to resign, why does the Prime Minister not enforce his own standards and insist on Mr Sinclair's resignation? What indeed has happened to the forthright principles on ministerial responsibility enunciated nine years ago by the Prime Minister? There was no response yesterday; there will be no response today; there will be no response tomorrow. </PARA>
<PARA> A basic rule of behaviour guiding Country Party politicians which I have observed on innumerable occasions over the years is this: When in trouble say anything that comes into your head that gets you off the hook for the moment and worry about the future later. That rule has certainly been applied in this case. For example, when questioned on 15 November 1979, about the release of the Auditor-General's report on the Dairy Corporation, Mr Nixon said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the practices that caused concern to the Auditor-General are no longer relevant. </PARA>
<PARA>Not only was that not true at the time he said it; it was not true 18 months or two years later. The practices which caused concern were relevant then and they are relevant still. The next week, on 22 November, Mr Nixon said that he would not table the document because 'the delicate and sensitive commercial report should not be made public'. He responded to a telegram from me on 7 December 1979. In response to my request to examine the report in his office, since it allegedly contained delicate sensitive commercial information, he replied:</PARA>
<PARA> It would be contrary to proper conduct in such matters to disclose the contents of the reports until full consideration has been given to the question of further action being taken consequent upon the reports. </PARA>
<PARA>I note, among other things, the contradiction between the reference to the need for further action and his answer two or three weeks before that the practices were no longer relevant. But that was not the end of it. On 10 April 1980 he was again questioned on the tabling of the report. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Auditor-General has advised me not to table them. </PARA>
<PARA>That matter was taken up by the Senate Estimates Committee with the Assistant Auditor-General, who denied what Mr Nixon had claimed. That denial was further confirmed by letter dated 24 April 1980 to Senate Estimates Committee A, as it was at the time, in which the Auditor-General stated that there were two types of reports, one auditing the normal functions of government, the tabling of which was mandatory under the Audit Act, and special section 63P audits, the tabling of which was optional. The Auditor-General added:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . but no recommendation was made on whether or not the report in question should be tabled. </PARA>
<PARA>The same rule of 'say whatever comes into your head to get you off the hook for the moment' has been applied following the release of the Senate Committee report. Ironically, in the House of Representatives yesterday, Mr Sinclair repeated the Nixon furphy about the Auditor-General when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> When I was Minister for Primary Industry, the Auditor-General advised me that the initial report he provided to me could not be tabled in this House. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not believe Mr Sinclair any more than I believed Mr Nixon when he used precisely the same excuse. I challenge Mr Sinclair to produce any documentary evidence that the Auditor-General so advised him. In this instance, I ask Senator Chaney to note, there is on record directly contradictory evidence from the Auditor-General with respect to the advice allegedly given to another Minister but which in fact was not given. Continuing with the application of the rule, Mr Sinclair said last Thursday, immediately after the report was released, that its conclusions were contrary to all the minutes and documentation in the files of his Department. Of course, he was immediately challenged by Senator Rae saying that, if that were so, Mr Sinclair's officers had perjured themselves before the Committee because they had said there were no such minutes and documentation. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Rae having blown that alibi out the window, on Monday morning Mr Anthony shifted his grounds of defence when he said that Mr O'Bryan's letter had cleared Mr Sinclair, and also-this was produced yesterday-that the extract of the record of a meeting of the Trade Development Council on 13 October 1979 had revealed that Mr Webster had told the meeting that the rebate had ceased under the majeure clause of the Holland Milk Products Inc. agreement. Both Mr Anthony and Mr Sinclair claimed that these matters clearly showed that Mr Webster was a liar whom only a particularly naive or vindictive committee would have believed in preference to the Minister. A number of questions arise if that minute of October 1976 is so vital to the case. It would seem extraordinary that the Department of Trade and Resources did not draw the Committee's attention to it when it wrote a lengthy letter to the Committee on 7 April this year. Of course, more importantly, Senator Rae has already shown in this debate that all the information disclosed there was on the public record. This tends to confirm what the former Country Party Leader John McEwen is claimed once to have said with respect to his successors: 'The trouble is that one is bone lazy and the other is dumb'. Mr Sinclar continued to say anything that came into his head. Yesterday in the House of Representatives he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Let it be known throughout this place and everywhere else that my successor, the officers of the Department of Primary Industry and I are most concerned that the abuses which have taken place apparently within Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd, in any of its associate companies or in any of the affiliate companies . . . should be identified . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In contrast, when Mr Hayden first raised this matter in the Parliament, Mr Sinclair launched a vicious attack on Mr Hayden the very next day. I quoted from that last week and I do not have any time today to quote further from it. That pious and sanctimonious statement made yesterday by Mr Sinclair shows that he must be the last straggler on the road to Damascus. There is too much telling evidence already on the public record for Mr Sinclair to be saved by the eleventh hour sanctimony which was uttered yesterday in the House of Representatives and which I have just quoted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, believe it or not, this is the first opportunity I have had to congratulate you on your election to the position of President, and I now do so. It is a pleasure to see you sitting in the chair, Mr President. In speaking on the matter of public importance, I bring to the attention of the Senate the fact that the subject we are supposed to be discussing is the necessity for the Parliament to address itself to the real issues raised by the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations on the Australian Dairy Corporation. In fact, to date very little has been said about that subject. So far the debate has concerned the credibility of the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) rather than the subject of the report, and I will say something shortly about that and then deal with the subject.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Webster is under investigation and I therefore wish to say very little about him. Certainly, in no way would I wish to prejudice that investigation, although, with all due respect to the Chairman of the Committee, I noticed today that he seemed to go to great lengths to defend Mr Webster. I hold no brief for Mr Webster but, having heard him and heard the other witnesses-Norwood, Wallace and O'Bryan-on the subject that everyone seems to want to talk about, I supported the finding of the Committee. I do not resile from that finding that, on the balance of probabilities, Mr Sinclair had a conversation with Mr Webster during which he was told the terms of the compromise. The terms of the compromise necessarily involved a continuing breach of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. That does not say that he was told there was a continuing breach of GATT. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Sinclair advised the Committee, and confirmed to the House, that he did not recall being told by Mr Webster that there would be a continuing breach of GATT. Of course, that is not an unreasonable thing for him to say. Many people are claiming that the Committee has found that Mr Sinclair was lying when he said that. The Committee did not so find. Individual members of the Committee, including the Chairman of the Committee today and Senator Evans the other day in the Senate, and other members of the Committee--</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NG4">Senator LEWIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that in a moment. In any event, the members of the Committee have been at pains to point that out. I observe from my reading of the Hansard record of the House of Representatives debate yesterday that some honourable members who rose to defend the Minister for Communications failed to read and understand the words of the report sufficiently to understand that simple point. Yesterday, the members of the Committee responsible for the report got together and issued a Press release which contained the following paragraph:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It should be appreciated that this conclusion does not amount to a finding one way or the other that any possible misrepresentation involved in Mr Sinclair's account of events was deliberate. </PARA>
<PARA>All members of the Committee confirmed that. I do not wish to say more on the subject. I think having heard the evidence, that, on the balance of the probabilities, it was a reasonable finding. </PARA>
<PARA> A matter raised by Senator Chaney prompts me to state that I am concerned that Senate committees should not develop into star chambers. I have expressed to various senators on the Committee my concern that witnesses should be protected. I am concerned also that we provide a public forum and that accusations are made against people who may not be able to defend themselves. To my mind the Senate committee system is in no way run like a court. We have six senators who listen to witnesses and may cross-examine them at will. Committee members often interject. Senator Evans and I are not unknown, in the midst of cross-examination, to engage in repartee on political points. Generally, a hearing is not in any way conducted like a court of law. To suggest that our Committee was sitting as a court of law is, in my view, quite wrong. In any event, if the Senate Committee had been so sitting it ought not to have been. I repeat my conviction-I am sure that honourable senators in this chamber who are concerned about civil liberties and the rights of members of the public will agree with me-that Senate committees must not go down the path of becoming star chambers. One wonders where, otherwise, the committee system might end up 50 years hence. It behoves each and every one of us to be careful when we are on committees to make sure that we do not follow that path. </PARA>
<PARA> Again in relation to something that was said by Senator Chaney, I wish to express my belief that, if our Senate committee system is to work, it ought to have the benefit of some ministerial input. It seems to me that far too frequently Senate committees consider at great length, and in detail, matters which involve government yet the Government first hears about them when the report is tabled. If the Government was aware of the situation, and wanted to, it could take action on its own initiative, but it is really up to the Senate to devise a system whereby some governmental input is assured. For example, since this report has been tabled a number of Ministers have said to me: 'Look, it is just impossible, Austin, to make a note of all the people who call in to see you and tell you things that are going on. Unless you sense immediately that there is a problem you do not bother to make a note about it. You just say: 'That's all right, go ahead, that's fine'. I understand also that on parliamentary sitting days, with quorums being called, divisions occurring, Cabinet meetings taking place and departmental officers calling in, Ministers are really overwhelmed by the volume of work. Perhaps my colleague, Senator Withers, who is to follow me in this debate, and Senator Douglas McClelland, both of whom have been Ministers, will be able to add to that comment. We are not Ministers, we are back benchers, so we do not really grasp these facts. This is a matter on which perhaps Ministers could have had some input, especially in terms of our recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to some of those recommendations. They are really important and represent what this debate is all about. It is necessary for the Parliament to address itself to the real issues raised in the report. For example, paragraph 15.10 of the report concluded:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . that it is impossible for a statutory authority to have absolute unfettered commercial autonomy. It has obligations and duties imposed on it through being created by an Act of the Commonwealth Parliament and its funds being raised through compulsory levies which are also raised by Commonwealth legislation. The rights and privileges are not conferred without creating obligations and duties in return. </PARA>
<PARA>On many occasions my Committee found that the directors of statutory authorities clearly do not appreciate their responsibilities to the Parliament. More often than not they think that if they have a bit of a conversation with the Minister that is adequate to tell the Parliament what it is all about. Those of us in the Parliament recognise that that is not adequate to confirm to the Parliament the matters with which the statutory authority is dealing. The statutory authority is created by the Parliament, not by the Executive. Our recommendation 15.12 states:</PARA>
<PARA> The relative responsibilities of the Minister and of persons appointed to the Corporation could be clarified . . . </PARA>
<PARA>There is not the slightest doubt that in many cases the officers, and in particular the directors of these corporations, do not fully understand their responsibilities. Some of the difficulties created thereby are immense. For example, when a director of an authority who is perhaps a dairy farmer and selected to represent dairy farmers is appointed to the Australian Dairy Corporation, how must he vote when faced with a difficult decision involving the Dairy Corporation, the manufacturers and the dairy farmers? Should he vote in accordance with his own beliefs as a dairy farmer and in support of dairy farmers, or should he look at the actual responsibilities of the Corporation? Of course Parliament would say that he ought to look at the responsibilities of the Corporation because once he has been--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Gietzelt" NAMEID="RG4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RG4">Senator Gietzelt</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What about the Department's representatives on the authority?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NG4">Senator LEWIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Gietzelt asks about the departmental representatives on the authority. That is another major problem. The Committee is concerned that a departmental officer who is responsible to a government can be appointed to a board and end up with a vote on the board. How is he to vote on such a difficult matter? Frankly, the Committee considered finally that it would be far better if such a person held a consultancy position so that he would not have to exercise the right to vote. As a consultant on the board he would have a pipeline direct to the Minister, or through the Department to the Minister, and could report on what the Corporation was doing about a particular matter. He would not then be subjected to problems of confidentiality when told things.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That was another problem that the Committee had to face. Clearly, the Australian Dairy Corporation comprised representatives of three different bodies. From time to time one body would not want to let the other body have information. For example, were directors who represented manufacturers to be given confidential information about the price of a product that Asia Dairy Industries was selling overseas? Such information was being kept from directors. In fact, one of the criticisms made by the Committee of Mr Webster is that on occasions he acted as a complete dictator and took very essential decisions about a number of matters without in any way referring them back to the board, or reporting to any other member of the board, because he was trying to keep the information from certain directors. All of those matters are met squarely in the report, which contains pages and pages of recommendations-all of which represent an attempt at reasonable compromise. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not suggest that the Government ought to adopt the recommendations as if the Committee had been able to set down, in biblical form, a series of rules. The Committee is an ordinary committee of the Senate. It may very well be that once Ministers have seen the recommendations they will say: 'But the Committee has failed to grasp the fact that our duties obligate us to do this or that, so we are unable to carry out the recommendations made on this matter'. On the other hand the Committee, by making these recommendations, has set out the problems for the Government and has offered proposals for their solution. I am sure that the Government will consider the recommendations in the same way as that in which they have been presented by the Committee. I hope that in due course we will arrange for improvements to be made in the relationships between statutory authorities and the Parliament, statutory authorities and the Minister, and statutory authorities and the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter I raise, so that honourable senators can understand what we are talking about, is that of the creation of subsidiaries by statutory authorities. In committee investigations we have found that 42 subsidiaries have been created by statutory authorities. In many cases those subsidiaries have been given wider powers than have been given to the statutory authorities which the Parliament created. In no case was the creation of those subsidiaries of statutory authorities even reported to the Parliament at the time of their creation, although frequently we subsequently found out that they had been created. These are matters of vital concern to which the Senate, the House of Representatives and the Ministry should turn their minds. I think it would be far better if the Parliament were to address itself to those issues raised in the reports rather than to the one matter which everyone keeps talking about and which, quite frankly, is so insignificant that it could have been left out of the report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been concerned for some time by the cavalier manner in which not only some members of the Executive but also the bureaucracy have been making a farce of our parliamentary system. No honourable senator can deny that at times on both sides of the chamber there has been an expression of concern that the parliamentary system as we know it not only is under constant attack but indeed in many respects appears to be wilting. That has been the view of the Parliament-it certainly has been the view of some honourable senators-for some time. Indeed, it was one of the reasons for the establishment of Senate standing committees. For instance, in this Parliament honourable senators have sought certain information by way of questions on notice. If honourable senators look at the Notice Paper today, they will see that questions that were placed on the Notice Paper as long ago as November 1980 remain unanswered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have been told from time to time by departments through their Ministers that too much time would be taken up by departmental officers in providing answers to the questions. Staff ceilings have been imposed by the Government, not only on government departments but on the Parliament itself. An Estimates committee was told last week that the Government had set a staff ceiling for the Senate, a ceiling well below the actual staff level that is needed to effectively serve the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> In this sessional period alone, on at least six or seven occasions Senator Peter Rae, in his capacity as Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations, has had to move that certain annual reports of departments or statutory corporations for the year ended 30 June 1980 be referred to his Committee so it can seek an explanation as to why the report was presented 14 or 15 months late. Ministers have not seemed to care. No explanations have been given by them to the Parliament as to why the reports are late. That is because, in fact, no explanation has been provided to the Ministers concerned by their departments. They have been and are being snowed by the bureaucracy. Judging from ministerial overreaction to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations, which is now under consideration, they expect Parliament to remain quiescent and to turn a blind eye to the system that they are allowing to run down. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair)-the former Minister for Primary Industry-instead of accepting the report as a constructive criticism of what has become a sleeping system about which no one seems to care has, as it were, shot from the hip. Ministers have been tolerating the lack of accountability to the Australian public, through the Australian Parliament, by departments and statutory corporations for far too long. That, in short, is the gravamen of the Committee's report and the recommendations contained in it. I suggest that that situation has been occurring because some Ministers have been in office for too long. They operate under the 'born to rule' syndrome. They have become far removed from their base, namely their constituencies and the parliamentary system. They act as though they are bricks which are mortared into the wall of bureaucracy. Departments seem to regard their Ministers as the Godfather. </PARA>
<PARA> The inferences to be drawn from the statements made yesterday by National Country Party Ministers in particular and also by the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen)-namely, that because all members of the Committee were not present at all meetings of the Committee no one can take any notice of the report of the Committee-show simply how far removed they are from a knowledge of their parliamentary committee system. Indeed, I would have thought that the Minister for Defence would not have dared to speak on the subject because it was he, as Minister for Defence, who recently had a run-in with the Country Party member for Kennedy, Mr Katter, the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, when he, the Minister, would not allow one of his officers to appear before that parliamentary committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Ministers know, and if they do not know they should know, that like Parliament itself parliamentary committees are subject to a quorum arrangement. If we did not provide for quorums the committee system would not work; indeed, Parliament itself would not work. But whilst they try to detract from the work of the Rae Committee, of which proudly I was a member, by stating that only four of the six members of the Committee were present at certain times, they conveniently ignore that a transcript of the evidence that was taken was made available to and read by the members of the Committee; that there were minutes adopted at every committee meeting; that there was a constant going over of the evidence given to the Committee; and that all members of the Committee were consulted at all stages of the drafting of the report. </PARA>
<PARA> As a member of the Committee, I can tell the Senate that there were many hours of deliberation on the part of the Committee members as to the manner in which the report would be presented. Apart from that, Ministers should also know that there is a Senate Standing Order, Standing Order 36AA, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> The quorum of a Committee shall be three. </PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> A Standing Committee shall have power to appoint sub-committees consisting of three or more of its members . . . The quorum of a sub-committee shall be two Senators. </PARA>
<PARA>When Ministers complain that only four out of six members were present at certain times, they are telling the Parliament and the public that the committee was acting firmly within the Standing Orders laid down by the Parliament. The Government knows that if that Standing Order did not exist, not one of the Senate committees would be able to function. All that Mr Sinclair and Mr Killen have done is to confirm the bona fides of the sittings of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> As much as Mr Anthony, Mr Sinclair and Mr Nixon, in particular, have whinged about the Committee's report, they have only themselves to blame for the Committee having initially to accept the reference. They cannot blame the Committee or the Senate for that reference. It was because of their lack of accountability to Parliament and the concern of Parliament, in particular the Senate, about the attitude of the Department of Primary Industry and the statutory corporations associated with it-namely, that they were not being administered effectively and that they were not providing the Minister or the Parliament with information to which the Parliament was entitled-that the reference to the Standing Committee took place. After all, there was a departmental officer on the corporation concerned, one of whose tasks was to report to senior departmental officers and the Minister, as appropriate. They are not my words; they are the officer's own words. Indeed, when the Australian Dairy Corporation was created on 1 July 1975, a departmental officer was appointed to the board to 'represent the Australian Government'. The officer appointed by the Government in 1979 to represent the Australian Government, when giving evidence before the Committee, said:</PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the functions, duties and obligations of the Government representative on the ADC, I am not aware of any formal set of guidelines applying to the Commonwealth Government representative but I understand them to be</PARA>
<PARA>. . .</PARA>
<PARA> -to report to senior Departmental officers and the Minister as appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Rae has already tabled a letter written to Mr Uytengsu by Mr Webster, the chairman of the Australian Dairy Corporation, on 23 December 1977. As Senator Rae has emphasised, these are the words that appear in that letter:</PARA>
<PARA> I can assure you that the Australian Minister for Primary Industry and the First Assistant Secretary, Mr Wallace, are fully aware of the facts and have been throughout, and there has never been any suggestion of impropriety on any individual's part. </PARA>
<PARA>A carbon copy of that letter was sent by Mr Webster to Mr Wallace who became the Minister's own representative on the board of the Australian Dairy Corporation. For that reason, the Minister, and particularly the present Minister for Communications, cannot now say that the Committee has been used as an instrument against them as individuals. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask honourable senators to read the introduction to the report. It was lack of information given to the Parliament that made the Parliament concerned about the way in which the Department of Primary Industry was being administered and the way in which statutory corporations appeared to be ignoring the doctrine of accountability. The Committee said in its introductory chapters that as far back as 1975-six years ago-criticisms were being made by the Department of Primary Industry of Asia Dairy Industries' relationship with and its reporting to its parent statutory authority and the Australian Government. Then, in September 1977, two articles appeared in the Australian Financial Review which for the first time disclosed the existence of a rebate arrangement on the sale of Australian skim milk. Understandably, those articles appeared as a result of the Australian Dairy Corporation meeting the expenses of three journalists to go to South East Asia, ironically on a public relations exercise. But it should be remembered that an officer of the Department of Primary Industry appointed by the Minister, which appointment obviously was agreed to by the Executive Council, was placed on the board of the Australian Dairy Corporation whose job it was to keep the Department, senior departmental officers and the Minister advised. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus, in October 1977 the Committee conducted a preliminary investigation into the affairs of Asia Dairy Industries and the Australian Dairy Corporation. The Committee decided to withhold making a detailed public investigation and to await the receipt of subsequent annual reports and the Auditor-General's report. Then, for reasons which have not been made entirely clear to the Committee, the Minister for Primary Industry instructed the Auditor-General on 28 March 1979 to undertake an audit under section 63P of the Audit Act into Asia Dairy Industries, a subsidiary of the Australian Dairy Corporation, on which body there was a departmental officer who, in his own words, said it was his job to report to the Minister. Obviously, for that decision to be taken by the Minister, the Minister himself must have been concerned. If the Minister was concerned, surely it was axiomatic that the Parliament and the parliamentary committee that initially conducted an investigation into the affairs of this subsidiary also should be concerned. We were told that certain matters which were the subject of the Auditor-General's report had been referred to the Australian Federal Police for investigation. As we have said in our report, we, the members of the Committee, studiously have avoided seeking evidence which may have impinged upon matters which were the subject of police investigation. But what I say is that the Minister himself obviously was concerned, the Department obviously was concerned and surely it was our responsibility as members of this Parliament to be concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee at all times acted most responsibly. The detailed inquiry was undertaken into a number of important matters which are the responsibility of this Parliament. Our conclusions have been based on the evidence that was given to us. The basis on which we worked was set by the comments of the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare which in a report to this Parliament said:</PARA>
<PARA> Parliament is the body responsible for ensuring that public servants are accountable for their actions and that Ministers retain their level of accountability to Parliament and people. Clarification of procedures and reallocation, or addition, of resources will be needed from time to time to enable the concept of accountability to retain its meaning. There is increasing doubt about the ability of Parliament to bring to account Ministers and public servants. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I enter this debate neither to defend the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations nor to attack the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair). I had some hand in the drafting of this matter of public importance. Having listened to the nonsense that has gone on in both chambers in the last two days, I think it is time that the Parliament started to address itself to the real issues raised by the Committee's report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suppose, for a start, one ought to look to the purpose of Senate committees. My understanding of their role and purpose in life is that they, as far as they are able, discover the facts and make recommendations. They are not established to be persecutors or prosecutors of people, nor are they to sit in judgment of events. I say to my friend and colleague Senator Chaney that there is a deal of truth in what he said in his opening remarks. I say to him also that if the standard of Senate committees is slipping it is most likely because they merely reflect the political standards of this country. We cannot expect the troops to behave well when the generals on both sides of both Houses behave even worse. </PARA>
<PARA> I say this because to date the debate has been about Sinclair and Webster. If we were to ask ourselves why the standard is slipping the answer lies in the fact that Australia is totally corrupted in a moral sense by partisan politics in this country. As much as we are morally corrupted by partisan politics in this country it does not do the media much credit to follow our low example. This is why the debate has been of the standard it has ever since the report came down. I do not think the debate so far reflects much credit on the Parliament or on most of the individuals who have been involved. I suppose I will not have much credibility either by the time I am finished. We are so cursed with partisan politics that we are prepared to adopt standards concerning the behaviour of our own colleagues and to make accusations about the behaviour of other people which ought not to be tolerated in a civilised parliamentary democracy. This is one of the worst developments in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, I know that perhaps occasionally Senate committees may be accused of acting in the role of persecutors and prosecutors. For goodness' sake, I have never noticed any inhibitions on the part of the executives within this Parliament-both government and Opposition executives-to denigrate and defame people outside this place under parliamentary privilege. In fact, some of the worst behaviour recently has occurred in this Parliament in respect of Mr Webster; a man who has not been charged, let alone convicted. I say to my friend and colleague, Senator Chaney, with all the persuasion I can bring to bear that before he lectures parliamentary committees I suggest that he lecture his Cabinet colleagues. Having got that off my chest, I return to what this debate is supposed to be all about, and that is parliament addressing itself to the real issues contained in the report. Some of those issues are listed in the proposal. It includes:</PARA>
<PARA>the nature of the administration of the Department of Primary Industry;</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that any fair-minded person, not reading the report but having the patience and the time to plough through the evidence which has been tabled in the Parliament, would have to come to the conclusion that the administration of that Department is not terribly red hot and has not been for a large number of years. I do not single out only that Department; I think it is a disease which runs throughout the Commonwealth Public Service. The Public Service is like the Parliament. It is good, bad and indifferent. It has loafers and hard workers. God help Laurie Oakes, I suppose it even has some drunkards in it, as this Parliament has. It is no better than any collection of 80,000 or 100,000 people. Anyone who has listened to the debate so far would think that the people in the Department of Primary Industry are either a bunch of totally inept, incompetent people or are working for Archangel Gabriel. It is part of the moral corruption of partisan politics in this place that we cannot even have a sensible non-partisan debate on the real defects in the administration of the Department of Primary Industry. The proposal also includes:</PARA>
<PARA>the relationship between Ministers and Statutory Authorities;</PARA>
<PARA>Nobody wants to tackle that because it is a bit difficult, a bit hard. The Finance and Government Operations Committee has done its best to try to point out the matters which ought to be investigated and which Parliament ought to take seriously. There is no way that members of parliament will take that matter seriously when they can, with much glee and excitement, spend their time throwing muck at each other. That is jolly good partisan politics, but I do not know whether it will advance better government in Australia. I hope that the Parliament addresses itself to the real issue of the relationship between Ministers and statutory authorities. I was once upon a time a Minister-a very improper one, I might add, by the standards of those days but perhaps not by the standard of these days. Standards change; as with obscenity laws and R rated movies et cetera. These things have a changeability about them according to the moral sense of the community for the time being. </PARA>

My friend, if not my colleague, Senator McClelland and I have both been Ministers responsible for statutory authorities. Differing statutory authorities have differing relationships with Ministers. Much of the relationship depends upon the personality of the Minister and the personalities of the heads of the statutory authorities. I do not think any serious work has ever been done on this very vital subject, which is seen as especially vital when one considers the enormous intrusion of statutory authorities into the life of this nation. At least the Committee in this report has addressed itself to some of those problems in an attempt to get some serious debate in the community on those problems. The proposal also includes:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>the accountability of Statutory Authorities and their subsidiaries to the Parliament . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is amazing the humbug spoken by members of both Houses of this Parliament about the rights of parliament, the necessity to build their monument on Capital Hill and their places in society. They go around making all these great sorts of speeches, but nobody seems to want to get to the hard nitty-gritty work concerning the accountability to the Parliament of statutory authorities and their subsidiaries. The moment we do, this curse of parliamentary partisan politicking will arise. I hope that this is a matter-which has been gone into in some detail in the report of the Committee-to which the Parliament will address itself, and continue to address itself.

There is no doubt at all that both Asia Dairy Industries and the Dairy Industry Stabilisation Fund are serious matters for the community to consider. They are matters to which the Government ought to bend its mind and on which the Parliament ought to have an opinion. Therefore, I hope that the Parliament will bend its mind to these things. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter in the report which I regard as serious is whether a statutory authority was indulging in tax evasion. I am not prepared to sit as a judge on that matter. We have been getting lectures in this Parliament from both the Government and the Opposition as to the evils of tax evasion within Australia. It seems that we are getting to the standard by which it is wrong for Australians to do that at home but that it is alright for government-owned corporations to do it abroad. It seems to be wrong for taxpayers to cheat the Australian Government but maybe it is acceptable for government-owned corporations to cheat the revenue raising authorities of friendly countries! I came to the conclusion that this case did not involve tax avoidance; in this case there was a deliberate attempt, in fact a successful attempt until the Committee came on the scene, not to disclose all the true facts to the revenue raising authorities of a friendly country. I would have thought that was a matter to which the Parliament may have directed its attention in the last two days, if we are going to direct so much of our attention to the tax avoiders and evaders of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chaney is about to direct his attention to those who so arrange their affairs that they get an unfair advantage out of the social security system. I sometimes think that perhaps we ought to clean up our own house-our own statutory corporations-before we go about lecturing the rest of the community. I think it is fair to ask: Where is all the rebate money? I think that is a nice question. So far nobody in the Parliament seems to be fussed about it. I have not noticed those who represent what we might call dairy constituencies making a song and dance in the Parliament about where their constituents' money is. I assume that it is the money of the poor old dairy farmers. It is somebody's money, but nobody seems to care. They think that, after all, it is only a few million dollars abroad, it is in some sort of bank, and why should they really worry?</PARA>

The Parliament does not seem fussed about that. It seems to be more fussed about whether a Minister had a meeting with a chairman of a statutory authority. I must confess that I could not care whether they ever had a meeting. It does not fuss me whether they had a meeting, what they talked about or what they did not talk about. I think some of these other matters I have raised are matters which the Parliament ought to fuss about. It ought to fuss about those matters, not only those concerning the Committee report which I have detailed, but also those matters raised by my friend and colleague, Senator Chaney, in his opening remarks about the standard of conduct of Senate committees. I think we ought to fuss about that. I say again to my friend and colleague, Senator Chaney, that the Cabinet ought to fuss about its standard of behaviour and maybe so should the Parliament. We ought to fuss about how we abuse privilege in this place and in other places, to bring fairness and justice to all sorts of people. I conclude as I started. I did not rise to my feet either to attack the Minister or to defend the report. I rose to beg the Parliament to address itself to the real issues raised by our report.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move the following amendment:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Paragraph (1), leave out sub-paragraphs (a),(b) and (c), insert the following sub-paragraphs:</PARA>
<PARA> ''(a) the natural values of South West Tasmania to Australia and the world; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) federal responsibility in assisting Tasmania to preserve its wilderness areas of national and international importance, including appropriate financial assistance consistent with the State's development needs and options for the State's energy requirements''. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) Paragraph (2), leave out the paragraph, insert the following paragraph:</PARA>
<PARA> ''(2) That the Committee consist of four Senators, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) two to be nominated by the Leader of the Government in the Senate;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) one to be nominated by the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) one to be nominated by the Leader of the Australian Democrats.''</PARA>
<PARA>This amendment does two things. It changes the wording of the terms of reference originally moved by the Australian Democrats and it reduces the size of the committee. The change in the terms of reference recognises certain facts which I believe should be considered by the Senate before any such inquiry is set up. Part (1) (c) of Senator Chipp's terms of reference states:</PARA>
<PARA>the future energy needs of Tasmania and energy options outside South West Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> The reference to energy options outside south-west Tasmania is interpreted as meaning, and in fact means, that the committee cannot consider the option of a hydro-electricity dam within the South West, including the Gordon-above-Olga proposal of the Tasmanian Government. In other words, the wording as it is implies that this Senate has made up its collective mind that there is no option and that there should be no option for a dam in this area. I suggest that the Senate is not in a position to decide, has not the knowledge to make a judgment about, and has not debated such a proposition. To do so and to put in such a proposition would hamstring the committee of inquiry in its consideration of Tasmania's energy needs. Such a narrow term of reference would ignore the rights of the State and the people of Tasmania to determine their own future, or at least to contribute to the determination of their own future, on this and other energy matters. Quite clearly, if the Federation is to be meaningful, the smaller States need assistance. If decisions are to be made which mean that a State will suffer economically to preserve a wilderness area or an area of special heritage which the rest of Australia wants to preserve then the rest of the country should help financially. Equally, the Parliament and the Senate should satisfy themselves as to the basis of decisions of this type and the need and extent of this type of assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that the wording of my terms of reference, which I have moved on behalf of the opposition, recognises the values of the South West of Tasmania, recognises the Federal responsibility in relation to the preservation of such areas and recognises the possible need for assistance within the parameters of the State's need for development and the State's energy option. The wording that I have moved does not prejudge the issue and does not imply interference in the State's affairs to the extent that I believe the motion from the Australian Democrats does. For that reason I believe that the amendment to the wording of the Australian Democrat's motion should be supported. I do not think that it detracts at all from the terms of reference and from the ability of the committee to make such an inquiry. It is not restrictive and it does not preclude an option which is considered to be desirable by many people in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I refer to the proposal to reduce the size of committee to four. I suggest first of all that four is a perfectly satisfactory number. There is precedent for this on select committees, especially committees which have in the past dealt with inquiries in relation to Tasmania. It seems likely that we will have expanded committee activities in this place and will continue to do so. Physically this House will, I suggest, not be able to cope with its work load if we have an increasing number of Senate select committees and we insist on having six senators on each committee. I believe that four is an efficient number to conduct an inquiry of this type. It is for that reason that I moved the second part of my amendment, that the size of the committee be reduced to four. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that both of these amendments will make the terms of reference more satisfactory and the committee a more satisfactory committee. I believe that a committee is desirable. I believe in this situation, where there is such considerable controversy in Tasmania, that it is important that the Senate and the Parliament, if they are to assist Tasmania in this way, should consider the matter properly. I believe the amended terms of reference will allow the committee to investigate this problem satisfactorily without seeming to interfere overmuch in the affairs of the State. </PARA>

<PARA> Senator Grimes has indicated that he thinks that four is an adequate size for a select committee of the Senate. I believe, although we have had a recent experience of a committee of four, and I think that that again was a committee on a Tasmanian matter, that that restricts the right of senators to participate. On a matter such as this, if the Senate agrees to the establishment of this select committee, I believe that there is no good reason for reducing the number below six. I do not believe-I am talking only to Senator Grimes's amendment-that this a matter that should be left only to Tasmanian senators. If we reduce this proposed committee to four, we are running a course where either Tasmanian senators do not get an adequate chance to participate or where non-Tasmanian senators do not get an adequate chance to participate. I think I am correct in saying that the Senate Select Committee which inquired into Passenger Fares and Services to and from Tasmania comprised four Tasmanian senators and there were other honourable senators who had a desire to take part in that matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the appointment of a Senate select committee. South West Tasmania is a national asset and is unique, although it is not unique in being a national asset. The national Parliament is right to be concerned about all national assets and so be concerned about the future of South West Tasmania, just as it would be concerned, and has been concerned, about the future of the Great Barrier Reef or Ayers Rock. We would want to have a say in those matters along with the people and governments of the Northern Territory and Queensland. If there were a proposal to dam the Heads, the entrance to Sydney Harbour, or to knock down the Three Sisters in the Blue Mountains, I would want to be involved. I reject the notion that it is somehow not appropriate for all Australians, through their Federal Parliament, to act to protect their national heritage-both natural and built-just because something is situated within the boundaries of a State. There is a Federal role. In fact, it should be larger and more consistent rather than exist only in an ad hoc way such as proposed in this instance. It would be preferable, instead of there being a select committee, for there to be a public expert inquiry appointed by the Government under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. But the Government has refused to set up such an inquiry, so a Senate select committee is the next best thing and must be resorted to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government is being very coy about its refusal to act. At a later stage I will seek leave to have incorporated in Hansard paragraphs 50 to 58 from the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation on South West Tasmania and Hydro-electric Power Development. I have not had a chance to check with the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Chaney) as to whether he will approve of that request. I should like in particular to refer to a couple of sentences from those conclusions. Conclusion No. 53 states:</PARA>
<PARA> Proposals likely to have an impact on South West Tasmania are undoubtedly environmental matters of national concern and warrant involvement. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion No. 56 states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the Committee believes that only by a Federal inquiry will national considerations and all the alternatives be fully examined. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee recommended that the Commonwealth Government seek advice as to whether the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act applies to the proposed hydro-electric developments in South West Tasmania and if there are proposals as defined under the Act that it be invoked. That was a fairly clear recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Home Affairs and Environment, Mr Wilson, has consistently refused to come to a decision about that recommendation. He is purported as saying in various places, in the House of Representatives on 10 June, and since, I believe, as well as at House of Representatives Estimates Committee hearings, that the Government does not want to make a decision about the appropriateness of that recommendation until the Tasmanian Government and the Tasmanian people make up their minds about the particular proposal involved. In my view that is a totally unsatisfactory excuse. The Minister is saying that the Government does not have a position at all on the general question of the applicability of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act to projects in the States which require loan funds. I presume advice on the question is available from the Attorney-General's Department. The House of Representatives Committee recommended that such advice be sought. If the Government has not yet received the advice, why is there a delay? If it has been received I think the Government ought to table it so that we can all make a judgment about it. In any case, there is no reason, in my view, why the Government cannot make a decision in general terms about the matter, regardless of any specific proposals. It is a general question on which the Government ought to have a position. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer quickly to the fact that the Premier of Tasmania, Doug Lowe, has expressed his objections about the proposal to form a select committee. He has said that Tasmanian decisions should be left to Tasmanians and that he does not believe the Federal Government, the Federal Opposition or the Federal Parliament as a whole ought to become involved. He has been critical of the record of 'Canberra' in both environmental and energy matters. I join him in that general criticism, especially as it applies to the present Government. But it needs to be acknowledged that the Federal Labor Government of 1972 to 1975 made giant leaps forward in its attempt to save certain environmentally important areas, in its provision of substantial financial assistance to conservation organisations, in its legislative initiatives, such as the environmental impact statement procedures which I have already referred to, and in many other ways. Even the present Government has a couple of plusses in its actions regarding Fraser Island and whales, to balance against all its negative points. </PARA>
<PARA> The basis of my criticism of Canberra would be different from that of the Premier of Tasmania in that I regret the failure of the Federal Parliament to become involved in more issues than it does. Perhaps naturally I am more of an interventionist than the State Premier. I believe that the Federal Parliament ought to interest itself in national issues and that more of the issues currently defined as State matters ought to be made national ones. I am not talking just of Tasmanian issues either. There are too many things about which nothing is done or about which it is said nothing can be done because they are matters for the States. These are the very same things which are crying out for clear overall national policies. </PARA>
<PARA> It is disgraceful that energy and resources development are left largely to the States, with the result that there are six, seven or eight different policies, or more accurately six, seven or eight of the same policies wastefully and extravagantly competing with each other. All the States fall over one another to attract, for example, aluminium industries by selling off precious power at cut prices. A national, co-ordinated policy is not just desirable but essential, but it has not happened. Almost without exception energy and resources development plans have an environmental impact. Not only is the whole issue inseparable from environmental considerations but also each project has implications for the local environment. </PARA>
<PARA> The conservation issue cannot be ignored, yet so often it is, or at least it is acknowledged but deemed to be subservient to the development plans. Certainly the two cannot be isolated from each other. Hence this inquiry of a Senate select committee will end up dealing not only with the environmental value of south-west Tasmania but also with the plans which threaten it. It is a great pity that all Australia's power development plans cannot be looked at together. However, the Zeidler Committee of Inquiry into Electricity Generating and the Sharing of Power Resources in South-east Australia, is examining the possibility of a south-eastern Australia's power grid, perhaps including a Bass Strait cable. Senator Carrick alluded to this in Question Time yesterday. I think his words were that the report would be available in the immediate weeks ahead. I hope he means that the report will be publicly available and I hope the immediacy will be sufficient for it to be studied not only by this select committee but also in the context of the coming referendum in Tasmania. What that report says may well affect the result of the poll. I support the amendment moved by Senator Grimes. I also now seek leave to incorporate paragraphs 50 to 58 of the House of Representatives committee report. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>6 Conclusions</PARA>
<PARA> 50. The Committee has not had the time nor has it the resources to examine in detail the complex considerations such as wilderness and conservation values, employment, alternative proposals, future energy requirements and industrial development. Accordingly, the Committee makes no recommendations supporting or opposing further hydro-electric developments in South West Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> 51. The Committee believes that many areas of Australia should be preserved in their natural state for the enjoyment of future generations. Any decision to alter areas as significant as South West Tasmania should only be taken after an extensive examination of the alternatives and only when the decision makers are satisfied that there are no feasible and prudent alternatives. It is the Committee's view that this detailed examination has not been undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA> 52. As outlined earlier in the report, sections of the conservation movement have asked for a Federal Government inquiry into the proposed scheme on the grounds that South West Tasmania is important, not only to Tasmania, but to Australia as a whole. Various State and Commonwealth authorities have recognised the national and international value of the region. </PARA>
<PARA> 53. The Committee, in its report on legislative and administrative arrangements relating to environmental protection, commented that there will be issues of national importance which warrant Commonwealth involvement. Proposals likely to have an impact on South West Tasmania are undoubtedly environmental matters of national concern and warrant Commonwealth involvement. </PARA>
<PARA> 54. The Commonwealth is already involved in the region in a number of ways. It provides funds for the South West Tasmania Resources Survey and is committed to assisting the Tasmanian Government in the establishment of parks and reserves. Further, the region has been listed in the Register of the National Estate. In addition, borrowing for the proposal will require the approval of the Australian Loan Council of which the Commonwealth is a member.</PARA>
<PARA> 55. The Committee notes that the proposal has been examined by the Co-ordinating Committee on Future Power Development and the Tasmanian Government has proposed a hydro-electric development which will leave the Franklin River undammed. </PARA>
<PARA> 56. Notwithstanding this review and the Tasmanian Government decision the Committee believes that only by a Federal inquiry will national considerations and all the alternatives be fully examined. </PARA>
<PARA> 57. Mechanisms for this full examination may exist at the Federal level through the public inquiry provisions of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. Accordingly, the Committee recommends that:</PARA>
<PARA> the Commonwealth Government seek advice as to whether the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 applies to the proposed hydro-electric developments in South West Tasmania; and</PARA>
<PARA>if there are proposals as defined under the Act, it be invoked. </PARA>
<PARA> 58.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak briefly on this matter. I am a little worried about the effects of the motion which has been moved by the Australian Democrats relating to the establishment of a Senate select committee to inquire into the south-west area of Tasmania. If the Senate passes certain motions I believe it could quite easily pre-empt a decision of the Parliament of Tasmania which is a sovereign body. If this matter is put to a referendum the setting up of such a committee could pre-empt some of the decisions that could be taken by the Tasmanian electorate. There is a great deal of agonising in Tasmania as to the future of the wilderness areas and the State's future power needs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe this motion could be one of the many that will come into this Parliament because many people are concerned about preserving areas of national heritage. I can see an inevitable conflict arising. I think that most of us are concerned about preserving the national heritage, but when this impinges on legitimate States' rights there is undoubtedly an area of great conflict. This delicate question has to be resolved with a great deal of goodwill on both sides of the chamber and between the Federal Parliament and the State parliaments. Some people have expressed reservations that only today a decision was made that there would be a limited number of questions posed at the referendum. I believe that this matter will be subject to further debate and discussion. </PARA>
<PARA> One matter which has escaped a lot of attention is the fact that we need power in Tasmania now, and we need power urgently. It has been said that no listings have been made of the industries that require power. As my colleagues and I have moved around and talked to industry leaders all too frequently they have asked for an increased supply, only to be told that the price will be twice the current contract price. Clearly this is unacceptable if we are to develop our industries in Tasmania. What will be the effect of this? It will mean the postponement of expansion. It will mean inevitable delay. In some cases expansion will take place not in Tasmania but on the mainland by associate companies. I believe we have to resolve this question urgently because the job situation in Tasmania is extremely important. Too many of our young men and women are having to go to the mainland in search of jobs. I believe there is a need to create acceptable industries within our State. </PARA>
<PARA> If the people of Australia decide that matters of national heritage should be preserved in Tasmania, it is only right and proper that the State or locality derives compensation from the Federal Government. I believe it is a Federal responsibility to do so if such a decision is taken. I believe it will be in the interests of the power debate and the wilderness debate that a decision on this matter be postponed to a later time. At that time decisions can be taken not only by the Parliament of Tasmania, which is a sovereign body, but also by the people at a properly constituted referendum. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to support some of the comments which Senator Watson has made and perhaps to try to reassure him about certain others. The points he has made are quite valid. It would seem a poor appearance if the Senate were to be running across the wishes of the people of Tasmania and in some way trying to intrude into their affairs or their sovereignty. This is a very important matter for people everywhere and that is the last thing that we would want to do. It is fair enough to state the Australian Democrats position; that is, that we are opposed to any new power generation in south-west Tasmania. We are in favour of preservation in the south-west. Just because the Australian Democrats have moved for the establishment of a Senate select committee, such a committee would by no means be the property of the Australian Democrats. We hope that it will be a vehicle for tapping into and marshalling the many points of view which should come forward in an investigation of this matter. It is designed to be of assistance in practical ways to the people of Tasmania and the Government of Tasmania not only to allow reasonable points of view to be expressed but also to help in financial terms. I refer again to the second of the terms of reference we propose in our motion. It reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . federal responsibility in assisting Tasmania to preserve its wilderness areas of national and international importance, including appropriate financial assistance;</PARA>
<PARA>I suggest that this matter ought to be beyond party politics and regional loyalties. To that end we will accept from either side of the Senate, any reasonable amendment or improvement to the initiative which we have brought forward. I will say here and now that whether the membership of the committee consists of four or six members is not a matter of great importance to me, provided we can set up this committee and it is able to get on with its work. That seems to me to be the important matter. I would hate to see an examination of this matter delayed because I feel it has been deferred sufficiently already. </PARA>
<PARA> Regarding Senator Watson's point of view that such a committee would run across a referendum, I would not have thought that it would do that. I would have thought that it would be a parallel initiative to the referendum, and perhaps a very important parallel initiative. It is natural that the people of Tasmania should not be expected to be placed at an economic disadvantage as a result of action which is taken. </PARA>
<PARA> If we say, as we do-these are high sounding words-that south-west Tasmania is not only the property of the people of Tasmania but also the asset of Australia and the world, then indeed other parts of Australia should be prepared to assist the people of Tasmania in a financial way and in any other way necessary to preserve the area. In other words, the people of Tasmania should not be expected to pay a price in terms of money or employment opportunities, which the preservation of the south-west might involve. If there is any such burden it should be shared. Quite clearly, that is the view of the Australian Democrats. That is why we put forward the motion in the terms we have. </PARA>
<PARA> If the south-west is preserved, Australians from all over the continent will have the opportunity of visiting it and experiencing its beauty, grandeur and that primaeval quality which I think every urbanised human being has a need of from time to time. That is a practical value. It is not an idealistic value. It is a value of importance which goes forward into the future from generation to generation. I believe we have an obligation to consider that aspect. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of how this assistance might be provided to Tasmania ought to be one of the major preoccupations of the select committee. If it can establish that principle that there should be some assistance and then seek out practical ways in which the Tasmanian people and the Tasmanian Government can be supported, it will be very worth while. I suggest to Senator Watson that this would perhaps meet his point, namely, that the committee would not be running across the sovereignty of the people of Tasmania and that the Tasmanian Government could conduct the referendum quite fairly on types of matters it wants, without any intervention or interference from the select committee which would have other functions. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no way that I would see this inquiry as cutting across or in any way affecting the referendum to be held by the Tasmanian Government. It was with great satisfaction that I heard the Tasmanian Premier, Mr Lowe, on the Australian Broadcasting Commission program AM-I think it was last Monday-state that the option of no additional power scheme at all in the south-west will be presented to the people of Tasmania in that referendum. I urge all honourable senators to support this motion for the establishment of a select committee. I feel that there is agreement around the chamber substantively in a tripartite way. I see no reason for our delaying the matter any further. It has been delayed for some time. I think we ought to proceed with the matter and see whether we can establish the committee as soon as possible. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the proposal to set up a Senate select committee to inquire into the consequences of damming the rivers of south-west Tasmania. What has happened here has been greatly confusing. Today a proposal was put forward by the Australian Democrats and then this evening we received from the Australian Labor Party a proposal which seeks to change the terms of reference of the committee. I do not think that aspect is of great importance. The proposal also seeks to reduce from six to four the number of people who would sit on this inquiry. I believe that would be unwise. It seems to me that it would be better to have a wider spread of representation. In particular, I believe there should be looking into the question a spread of people in this Senate who are not Tasmanians. I think that a wider group of people should look into the matter. However, I do not regard that as the vital question in relation to this matter. I think the vital question is whether the Senate should proceed now to establish a committee of inquiry in respect of the desirability or otherwise of a dam in the south-west area of Tasmania. Today in Tasmania things have happened that have come to my notice only in the last 10 minutes or so. I understand that this morning the Premier of Tasmania, Mr Lowe, said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If the question did not allow the 'No Dam' supporters to express their view, there would be a 'great' question mark over the credibility of the referendum.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the question in the referendum on which the people of Tasmania, who after all represent 3 per cent of the population of Australia, will express their attitude in respect of the construction of one dam or another or no dam at all. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Mason" NAMEID="YJ7">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YL7">Senator MISSEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is so. I have been told tonight that today the Caucus overruled the Premier of Tasmania and decided that the question which will now be put before the people of Tasmania in the referendum is to be as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government, the Opposition and the Legislative Council favour the construction of a new hydro-electric power scheme on the Gordon River in south-west Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA> Do you favour such a scheme being located</PARA>
<PARA> (a) above the Olga River, or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) below the Franklin River?</PARA>
<PARA>That is the question, full stop. The people in Tasmania who, I believe, represent a very substantial section of the Tasmanian opinion that neither of those two alternatives should be considered, are now to be excluded from recording their views. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YL7">Senator MISSEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will get to that question to be considered. That is another question. That will not be voted on in the referendum at all. The referendum is in respect of two possible dams-a battle between a lower House and an upper House view. There are only two possibilities. That is the only thing to be voted on and presumably the result of the referendum will tell the Government of Tasmania what is the opinion of the people of Tasmania. Yet I understand that in about seven opinion polls that have been held more than 50 per cent of the people have indicated that they want the Franklin saved and that each of the two rallies in Hobart attracted more than 7,000 people. Apparently those views are not to be allowed to be expressed in the referendum or alternatively, they will be expressed by a preference for the lesser of two evils-which one is opposed least. The Government may then determine to apply that solution as though it is the majority view of the Tasmanian people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But really it is not a matter entirely for the Tasmanian people. I have had many representations from people in Victoria, in New South Wales and in other States who are concerned about this matter. I am sorry, Mr President, that so few of the members of the Senate may be interested in this question, but I believe the people of Australia are interested. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YL7">Senator MISSEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe there is a good deal of feeling on this subject among the people of Australia and it is not confined to Tasmanians. Matters of national importance are involved in this wilderness-an area unique in the world. There are important areas around Australia such as Fraser Island and the Great Barrier Reef with which the Commonwealth Government has had to concern itself. I believe south-west Tasmania is an area with which we have some concern.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Earlier in the debate Senator Coates said that perhaps we should not interfere. He said there ought to be a public inquiry under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. Unfortunately that is the sort of inquiry which at the moment, I think, cannot be undertaken. There is no impact proposal by the Tasmanian Government and therefore I do not think the provisions of that Act can be invoked but it may well be that they will become important a little later if after the referendum Tasmanians consider the matter to be important. </PARA>
<PARA> The important thing at this stage is that the Senate should decide to hold an inquiry. It may be that the proposed inquiry will not have proceeded very far by the time the referendum is actually held and decided. It is probably undesirable that at a time when the referendum is being campaigned for and against in Tasmania we should call for much evidence which may be directed more at public expression in connection with the referendum, but at least we should be under way. We should determine at this stage that in fact the Senate and the Commonwealth have a public interest in this matter. I notice that Senator Coates, in defence of the Premier of Tasmania who today seems to have been repudiated by the Labor Party in Tasmania, quoted the Premier as saying that 'Tasmanian decisions are for the Tasmanians.' I dispute that. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YL7">Senator MISSEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;All of the other sorts of power. It is proposed that this dam in Tasmania will produce 280 megawatts whereas the Loy Yang station in Victoria will produce 4,000 megawatts. In fact, we should consider whether it is practicable and desirable to place a cable under Bass Strait to provide Tasmania with power. Clearly it is Australia's responsibility and clearly Australia must pay to retain the great value of this national asset that exists in Tasmania. I believe these things should be recognised by Australians. In the past the Australian Government has recognised its responsibilities. In fact, it has contributed to the survey that has been done in Tasmania. I believe it will have to make further contributions so far as the Tasmanian people are concerned. I do not want to expand on that too much because the Ziedler inquiry has not yet reported. A good deal of information will have to be obtained. I point out that the report from the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation presented in August 1980 stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> 55. The Committee notes that the proposal has been examined by the Co-ordinating Committee on Future Power Development and the Tasmanian Government has proposed a hydro-electric development which will leave the Franklin River undammed. </PARA>
<PARA> 56. Notwithstanding this review and the Tasmanian Government decision the Committee believes that only by a Federal inquiry will national consideration and all the alternatives be fully examined. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the view expressed last year by that Committee of the House of Representatives. I think it behoves this Senate, which has both the interests of the States and the interests of the nation in hand, to undertake an inquiry through a Senate committee. It is, I believe, an international and a national asset with which we are concerned. I therefore believe the proposal to set up a committee of inquiry, which the Australian Democrats have put forward, is a sensible one. I recognise that in the amendment to the terms of reference proposed by the Labor Party there may be improvements. I am not particularly fussy about the two forms of terms of reference but I do believe, as I have said before, that the proposed committee ought to have six members of the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> I wish to say a couple of things relating to the power situation in Tasmania. As an engineer, I feel that I have some responsibility in this chamber to point out a few of the things that may well happen. The first is that I believe a lifeline to Tasmania from Victoria to tie us into a national grid would be a very good thing. Having got that off my chest, as I believe Senator Withers alongside me did earlier tonight in his speech, I think it is not a practical situation. The cost of running a lifeline, a cable, from Victoria to Tasmania would be in the order of $600m. That is more than the engineers anticipated. I think they said that it would be about half that amount, but they neglected a few things I believe are essential, and they will come out in the Zeidler report. If we cannot afford a lifeline, that cable to bring power from the brown coal burners of Victoria, we have to look for some alternative. So we look to what my colleague Senator Rae suggested, that is, an atomic station. I would be pleased to hear what the Australian Democrats have to say about atomic power generation in this country. </PARA>

It would cost $600m, it would be twice as long as any other cable in this world, it would have to be built in situ, and it would take 15 years to build. That is one point. If the honourable senator had been listening he would have remembered that. The next point is that an atomic power station would take 10 years to build and it would generate twice as much power as is presently being generated in Tasmania. We do not really have any alternative to generating more power in Tasmania. I differ here with some of my other colleagues. I believe that we need to build as many efficient dams in Tasmania as will produce the maximum amount of power that will be needed in the next 15 years.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>I believe that, in view of Mr Lowe's request, the motivation within the Senate tonight to establish a select committee is, if nothing else, a vote of no confidence in him. It has been put already that there are virtues in deferring the consideration of such a committee until the people of Tasmania have been given a chance to have their say.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate calls on the Government to:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) transfer the responsibility for administration and funding of the Community Youth Support Scheme (CYSS) to a national committee appointed by the Commonwealth Government with respresentation from the community, the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs, the Department of Education and, at the State level, from TAFE and Youth and Community Services;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) include in the guidelines, in addition to the responsibility for support services now provided by CYSS, the responsibility to seek permanent part-time work for those unemployed people between the ages of 15 and 20 who are unable to find suitable permanent work and who are unable or disinclined to pursue, or temperamentally incapable of pursuing, full time study; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) introduce legislation providing that the entitlement to unemployment benefits of young people employed under this scheme is not affected by the receipt of wages for up to 10 hours work per week. </PARA>
<PARA>I will make one or two brief comments about this motion. Firstly, I am aware that there are on both sides senators who are genuinely concerned about the rapidly approaching deadline for the closure of the Community Youth Support Scheme. Time is running out. I suggest that, if an expression of concern cannot be passed in this chamber tonight, any move to save the Community Youth Support Scheme will be too late. It will be two and a half weeks before Parliament reassembles. In the last few weeks those of us who are concerned about the Community Youth Support Scheme have been living in the hope that the Government would make a statement which would hold out some hope that this vital scheme for the support of our unemployed young people could be continued in some guise or other. However, on 15 September, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, in answer to a question from me, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> I give the assurance that CYSS will not be replaced by a scheme of another name to be administered by another department. As I have said, the funding for the CYSS program will cease on 31 October as has been announced in the Budget.</PARA>
<PARA>On the same day the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown) made a similar statement. Nothing has been announced that will encourage one to hold out any hope that the initiative of the Government will be other than was expressed in that very clear statement. In other words, people in the community who are concerned about CYSS, who are trying desperately by all means available to keep this vital scheme going, are rapidly running out of hope. This is the last opportunity that the Parliament has to express to those people the hope that perhaps there will be a change of heart by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> CYSS represents a vital link between the community and unemployed youth in this country. The scheme has had the backing of churches, local councils and concerned citizens generally. Already, on Government instructions, the CYSS programs are being run down. The Commonwealth Employment Service no longer refers young people to CYSS. The organisers of CYSS projects have been told to run down their cash balances. This Parliament will reassemble in two and a half weeks but by then, if we do not pass this motion now, CYSS will be virtually non-existent. A vital link between the community and unemployed, one supported by this Government, will end. This afternoon I heard from Senator Withers probably the most inspiring speech I have heard since I have been a member of the Senate. I will not attempt to quote him but essentially what he said was--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Evans" NAMEID="VD4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8R7">Senator SIDDONS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understood Senator Withers to say that it was about time the Parliament stopped point scoring and got on with the business of facing up to the vital problems with which this country was involved. I took his speech at face value; it inspired me. The motion before the Senate is simply a request to the House of Representatives to do something about preserving vital community involvement in assisting our unemployed young people. It is purely a request-nothing more. It seems to me that if the Senate is so hide-bound that senators on both sides of the chamber who are genuinely concerned about preserving this community-based support scheme in some form or other cannot vote other than on strictly party lines, there is something very wrong with our Parliament. We are suggesting purely that a request be made to the House of Representatives. We are approaching the deadline. This is the last opportunity the Parliament will have to make a clear expression to the thousands of people who support CYSS. This is the last opportunity that the Parliament will have to say that there is still some hope that the Government can yet be prevailed upon to change its mind or to come up with some alternative. It is a practical suggestion. It gets away from administration of the support scheme by the rigid control of a government department. It puts the responsibility for administration and funding upon a community-based scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There are many precedents for this course of action. For instance, each year the Australia Council receives considerable funding from the Government to assist the arts. It is a worthwhile cause and I do not criticise the fact that that is done. What is suggested in the motion represents a similar approach. The present total expenditure on CYSS is $11.5m which is not, I suggest, a large amount to expend in satisfying a vital community need. If we vote down such a request at this time, there can be no doubt in the minds of the thousands of people in the community who try to support unemployed youth that this Government has turned its back on their efforts. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Evans for that. He might have listened to me before drawing his conclusion. But we cannot expect every justice to prevail in this chamber. I appreciate what Senator Siddons said about the Community Youth Support Scheme. I too support a continuing existence either of CYSS or of another form of organisation to serve a similar purpose. Senator Siddons in his motion suggested one possibility, one way in which CYSS might be continued. I must say I have received a great number of representations that have urged that it should not cease on 30 October, that it should be continued for a period to develop a desirable situation in the community or, alternatively, that it should not go altogether but should be replaced by another scheme.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I regret very much that, at the time, the Government proposed the abolition of CYSS because it felt it had weaknesses-undoubtedly there were weaknesses in some of the CYSS groups. I was sorry the Government did not come up with an alternative. I recognise that there is a very considerable demand in the community for a scheme which is something like CYSS. It is all right to say that there ought to be training schemes for the unemployed. That is a very desirable first alternative. At the same time, a number of young people in the community do not find such training schemes of any use to them. They have left school. They have given up that form of training. They need to win back their confidence. They need the assistance of the community in doing so. </PARA>
<PARA> I have supported and been interested in CYSS since its foundation. I think that in most places where it has operated it has provided a very useful means whereby such people have been able to feel that they are wanted in society, whereby they have been able to feel, in company with other people, that they can take action to assist themselves in getting jobs. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that in the past some unwise restrictions have been placed on CYSS whereby the objective of seeking jobs has been denied to people. I believe that any new scheme that arises ought to incorporate the practical belief that people ought to be able to use the new skills they acquire in obtaining jobs for themselves. I do not think that the situation is in any way as hopeless as Senator Siddons would lead us to believe. Of course, there has been a great deal of discussion by Government members and a great deal of representation to the Ministry and, in particular, to the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown) in regard to this matter. The Government is examining the matter at the moment. Its officers are going around various areas and are working out the need that exists and the extent to which employment and training schemes will be needed to help the people who need help. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YL7">Senator MISSEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will come to that point; I will not ignore it. I think we will find that the Government's analysis of the situation will reveal that there are people who just will not be covered by employment and training schemes and that, therefore, there is a necessity for a substantial scheme which does one very important thing, namely, brings in employers and members of the community who are interested in helping and encourages them to provide equipment, to help to set up projects and to assist in their operation. I believe that that is one of the best things that has resulted from CYSS. That sort of involvement must continue. Sure, the date for CYSS to end is not far away. Time is short, but I believe that the examination of schemes being undertaken at the moment by the Government and its attempts to find out what is happening in the community will lead it to make useful decisions well before that date.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I recognise that people presently employed as project officers in existing CYSS programs face great difficulty in deciding whether to look for a job elsewhere now or to stay until the deathknock. I urge them to stay, to continue in CYSS. I express the hope that the Government, before the date CYSS is to end, will have worked out a scheme which will pick up all the best aspects of CYSS and will continue the community involvement aspect of CYSS. </PARA>
<PARA> For those reasons, I will vote against the motion. I hope that the Government will consider the type of scheme Senator Siddons has put forward in his motion, irrespective of whether we pass or defeat the motion. The great bulk of honourable senators on this side of the chamber are very much of the opinion that there must be a scheme which perpetuates the best elements of CYSS. </PARA>

For those reasons I will oppose the motion. If I did not believe that the Government would do that I would support the motion, although there might be aspects of it which I did not particularly support. But I believe that the Government recognises that there is a very genuine, widespread demand by society for continued community involvement in the problem of youth unemployment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the motion. One could well have taken most of Senator Missen's speech as being in support of the motion, but that is not uncommon with Senator Missen. Senator Siddons's motion is an attempt to get the Senate to make a statement to the Government and to the other House of this Parliament that, first of all, the Community Youth Support Scheme should be retained and, secondly, that the CYSS guidelines and its structure of control should be changed in certain suggested ways to make it more effective. I might not agree with every word in the motion, but I think it is a reasonable motion and one that deserves support, particularly in the circumstances which Senator Siddons mentioned, namely, that the Parliament is about to rise for a fortnight, the scheme is about to be closed up completely and it is worth supporting.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 25 August, soon after we resumed the sittings of the Parliament, I raised a matter of public importance concerning the decision to abolish CYSS, which was announced in the Budget. I did so first of all, because of the obvious support in the community for the continuation of a program like CYSS and, secondly, because of the manner in which the scheme was to be closed down. In the months before the announcement of the cessation of CYSS we heard repeated statements from the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, Mr N. A. Brown, and from other Government supporters that CYSS would continue. Only a week before the Government announcement that CYSS was to be closed down, new project officers were taken on, some of whom had left other jobs to become project officers with CYSS. We had some 800 project officers and more tutors involved in CYSS who had been working in the guaranteed expectation-they had received letters from the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs, and had been advised by the Minister and by other Government members-that CYSS would continue. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Missen tells us that he has hope that the Government will reverse its decision. I do not know where he gets that hope from. Since the decision was announced we have heard repeated statements in this House from the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle), who is in the House at the moment, that the Budget decision will remain, that it is a firm decision. We have heard repeated statements from Mr Brown, the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs, that the Government decision will stand, that there is no intention to change it. The only hopeful statement I have seen reported has in fact been one from the Treasurer, Mr Howard, who said that the Government might look at the number of young people who were not covered by CYSS. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to make it quite clear that I am not an uncritical supporter of CYSS as it is and as it has been. Certainly I consider that some CYSS projects have not been efficient and have not been working in a satisfactory way. But the people who have worked in CYSS and who have been involved in committees conducting CYSS projects recognised that. They repeatedly made requests to the Government that their terms of reference and guidelines be broadened to include aspects such as more counselling and the sorts of work training and development programs that Senator Siddons mentioned in the second part of his motion to enable them to do more for the unfortunate group of people in our community who for so long in many cases have been without work. They certainly showed more concern for the young unemployed than did Mr Brown only last week when reportedly he was talking to a 18-year-old girl at the CYSS project in Shepparton and she told him she had been out of work for 18 months. The Minister told her: 'You don't need a job; you need a psychologist'. One wonders what sort of attitude that is from a Minister who is supposed to be concerned for the unemployed in the community. Speeches have been made on this subject in the other place. I refer in particular to one made the other night by Mr Baume, the honourable member for Macarthur, who said that these people do not need assistance of this type; they should be put on welfare because they do not want to work. </PARA>
<PARA> The CYSS program, with all its faults, brought concerned people in the community together onto the committees which ran the projects. It brought together project officers and tutors who had a concern to work with individuals who were in the difficult situation of being unemployed at such a young age with not much hope of employment. They demonstrated a concern that there was a need in the community for this sort of work to be done. Bits of propaganda, delivered to us right up to the day after the Budget, pointed out that CYSS was functioning, what it would do and that the Government supported it. The August Youth Affairs newsletter is practically devoted to paeans of praise about the effectiveness of CYSS and the effectiveness of the Office of Youth Affairs in the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs. All the indications have been that this project would be continued. Yet in the Budget we are told it has two or three months to run. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, for all these reasons-because of the manner in which the program has been disbanded, because of the firm statements since the Budget from senior Minisers and Ministers directly involved that the Government would not go back on its decision, and because of the obvious concern in the community-I believe that Senator Siddons' motion deserves support. Senator Siddons suggests a means of administration and funding of CYSS by a national and pretty representative committee. One may quibble about who is on it and who is not but it would be a pretty representaive committee. The honourable senator urges a review and a widening of the guidelines. He urges the formulation of legislation to assist and to encourage young people to take on permanent part time work without having their unemployment benefit removed and thereby building disincentives into the system. </PARA>
<PARA> For these reasons I am at a loss to understand why all honourable senators in this place will not support this point of view which can be modified as it is examined by the Government, the House of Representatives or the Senate. But, with the short time available to do something about the matter, the motion is worthy of our support for the moment at least, and I urge honourable senators to support it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to take part in this debate. I have some sympathy with what Senator Siddons is endeavouring to do. I agree with the previous speaker that his approach to this matter is no better than what I or a number of my colleagues have been doing over the last two or three weeks.

The Minister has had consultations. Yesterday and today he talked to a number of people who have been involved for some considerable time with CYSS. He is continuing to have those discussions. I am quite confident that the kinds of issues that have been raised here tonight will be taken into consideration by the Minister and the Government. I am confident that a statement will be made very shortly by the Minister that will satisfy all of my worries about the phasing out of CYSS. Rather than CYSS being cut off at a given date, I and a number of my colleagues naturally would have preferred a phasing in of the new scheme that the Minister will come up with as CYSS is phased out. </PARA>

I have had quite lengthy discussions with Senator Siddons on a number of occasions about what he was proposing to do. I said earlier that I have sympathy with what he is endeavouring to do. But in my view his proposition will serve no more purpose than what I and my colleagues have been endeavouring to do over a number of days and weeks by consulting the Minister and the Government on what is the best thing to do for the young people who have been catered for through the CYSS program. The Minister has given me an assurance and I am quite prepared to accept that assurance. I will wait until he makes that announcement to find out exactly what he is going to come up with.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think that this Budget item has had more discussion than almost any other matter raised in this years' Budget. The motion that has been brought forward by Senator Siddons calls on the Government to restructure the Community Youth Support Scheme, to form a national committee and to do the other things mentioned in his motion. The decision in the Budget was made against the background of the additional training programs and the additional opportunities for training that were provided in the Budget funding for young people. The Government feels that young people would be better served by employment and training programs that would lead them into opportunities for employment. But, as we have seen over the last few weeks when we have been discussing these matters, there is a recognition in the community of the work that has been done through the CYSS programs for those young people who may not be able to involve themselves in training programs, education programs or any of the other programs that provide opportunities for them. It seems to me that the community has developed a discussion about CYSS that has brought out some of the things that were said by Senator Bonner, Senator Grimes, Senator Missen and Senator Siddons who introduced this motion. There has been a degree of community involvement which needs to be recognised for the value and the extra dimension it brings to a program of this sort.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The motion moved by Senator Siddons speaks of the administration of CYSS being transferred to a national committee. The honourable senator set out in the first paragraph of his motion how that body should be styled. We ought to remember that CYSS has been administered by State committees which consist of two represenatives from the community, a representative of the Commonwealth Department of Employment and Youth Affairs and a representative of the relevant State department. Usually the State department is the department responsible for youth affairs. The school to work transition program is also administered by State committees consisting of representatives of Federal and State departments of labour and education, including the technical and further education authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> In the last couple of weeks I have answered a number of questions in regard to this program on behalf of the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown). I have said on a number of occasions that at present the Government is considering the information that is coming through to the Minister from the Department of Employment and Youth Affairs as the result of the decision in the Budget to terminate at 31 October CYSS as it presently exists. We have said that as a result of that information, if there are gaps in the range of programs, consideration will be given to taking special action to meet the needs of young people who are not catered for in the training, education and employment programs. As I said quite recently, and as the Minister has said, the matter is being investigated by Commonwealth Employment Service officers. If there are people who, for reasons of geographical location or lack of attitude, aptitude or ability, cannot undertake further educational training, the Government will consider that and the Minister, I feel, will make whatever appropriate announcement needs to be made. </PARA>
<PARA> The establishment of a national committee suggested by Senator Siddons in his motion would need to be considered in light of the fact that even if a national committee were formed to oversee the CYSS program the administration and funding of it must remain within a specified portfolio with a specified department being responsible. The formation of a national committee would not solve some of the difficulties that may have existed in some of the programs, as has been mentioned by some honourable senators. I think it was Senator Grimes who said that he is not uncritical of some CYSS programs as they have existed in the past. All a national committee could do would be to make recommendations to the appropriate Minister whose responsibility it would be to administer a program such as that envisaged by Senator Siddons. In other words, that could even complicate the administration of the program without necessarily addressing the main issue, and that is to make available to young people opportunities for education, training and employment. </PARA>
<PARA> The second part of the motion deals with the inclusion in the guidelines of some further matters. With regard to that part of the motion I say simply that part time vacancies may be lodged with the Commonwealth Employment Service. There is really no need to duplicate the services provided by the Commonwealth Employment Service through a new CYSS network. The CYSS projects are already able to undertake incidental placements including part time work. Some CYSS projects, especially those in the country areas, are now doing this. These placements are, however, only additional to their basic functions. If the Government believes as a result of its current investigations that there is a need for an enhanced service of this type, consideration will be given to that matter. In the meantime, anybody who wishes to lodge part time vacancies for young people should do so through the comprehensive Commonwealth Employment Service network which already exists and which is decentralised throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The third section of the motion refers to introducing legislation to vary entitlement for unemployment benefit. In that connection I say that the income test provisions for unemployment benefit were changed in the Budget of last year. Under those changes young people may now earn up to $40 a week before unemployment benefit expires. They lose 50c of their unemployment benefit for every dollar over $3 earned in a week. Those changes were made in order to increase the incentives for young people on unemployment benefit to undertake part time work, which is the matter addressed in that third part of the motion before us. In other words, again it is not necessary to have a CYSS project to increase this incentive. </PARA>
<PARA> In any event, it could be unfair to those young people who undertake part time work on their own accord to be disadvantaged by a more severe income test than the test given to those who obtain their work through a CYSS project. A young person doing part time work for 10 hours a week could expect to earn, say, $25. If this person were in receipt of unemployment benefit he would lose $11 of that benefit, making the total income $50 a week; that is, $25 of earned income plus $25 of unemployment benefit. It would be difficult to justify the exemption of certain income for income test purposes for only one group of people who were involved in a particular program, as is envisaged in this motion. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the Minister is presently giving a great deal of time to consultation on and consideration of the matters being investigated by the Commonwealth Employment Service. As soon as the investigation has been undertaken and completed to his satisfaction he will be in a position to address the needs of those young people who are not catered for in the programs for which ongoing funding has been provided in the Budget. I feel sure that he will make appropriate statements dealing with those matters. For these reasons the Government is not able to support the motion moved by Senator Siddons, although we recognise the sincerity with which he has brought forward these matters. I thank the Senate for the way in which they have been discussed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too place on record my appreciation of Senator Siddons bringing this matter before the Senate. However, I wish to point out the very evident fact that, firstly, we in the Senate-each one of us-had nothing to do with the abolition of the Community Youth Support Scheme. Its abolition came as a complete surprise to us as it did to anyone else. Secondly, even if we were to adopt the proposal now before us it is quite clear that that would not in any shape or form alter the decision made by the Government in respect of CYSS. Were I Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs I would have sorted out those CYSS programs which were beneficial to the youth of this country from those programs which were and are prejudicial to the youth of this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it has been said on both sides of this Parliament, in both this chamber and the House of Representatives, that there is not unqualified support for all of the CYSS programs. My view is that rather than abolish the CYSS programs, the Minister should have grasped the nettle and abolished those programs which were not doing any good for the youth of this country and allowed those which were beneficial to operate. However, no matter what we do tonight the Government is intent on proceeding to abolish CYSS. On no fewer than three occasions I have had the opportunity of discussing with the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs (Mr N. A. Brown) the issues involved in this matter. I-along with Senator Siddons, Senator Bonner and others in this chamber-am concerned at the prospect of what will happen to those persons who are temperamentally incapable of pursuing full time work at this stage. I am concerned particularly for those people in the regional districts. I believe the Minister has made it clear that following the consultations now taking place between departmental officials and people in CYSS programs, on his receiving those reports he will make an announcement which will address this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I can state only that my view is the same as that of Senator Bonner. He presented the case more eloquently than I could and I support what he said. At this time I am prepared to allow the Minister the opportunity, once these investigations have been made, to make his statement. After that it may well be that this chamber and the House of Representatives will need to consider that statement and in light of it determine their positions. I believe the motion is premature at this time. I believe that carrying this motion may give false hope to those involved in the program that it is going to continue when, no matter what we say in the Senate, it will not continue. Therefore, at this stage I am not prepared to support the proposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate declares that any decision by the Senate to make requests to the House of Representatives for amendment of the Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1A-9A) 1981 does not indicate that the Senate considers that all of the provisions of those Bills are properly included in Bills imposing taxation. </PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this motion is twofold. Firstly, its adoption by the Senate will indicate quite clearly and unambiguously to the House of Representatives that, even though the Senate might convey to the House certain requests on these Bills, such action does not preclude any later action which the Senate may be forced to take in relation to those features of the Bills which the Senate may consider objectionable. Secondly, the motion before the Chair is intended to focus particular attention on the form of drafting of these Bills, in particular Bills 1A to 9A, so it is perfectly clear to all concerned that even at this early stage of consideration of the Bills the Senate is suspicious that an unprecedented form of drafting has been deliberately employed by the Government for devious and unscrupulous purposes in an attempt to circumscribe the Senate in the proper exercise of its power. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators no doubt will be aware, since the discussion of Standing Orders has been the order of the day, that our Standing Orders contain a provision for a motion called 'the previous question', which provision I understand has never been used previously. It is a means of avoiding a vote on a motion which is immediately before the Chair. In other words, it really takes the form that the question be not now put. I have noted that this procedure is available in a number of union rules, and it is available to the Senate. In a sense, what I am doing tonight is intended to forestall the presentation in the media or in the corridors of this Parliament of what could be described loosely as 'the after question'. My motion is framed so as to prevent the suggestion being made, after the transmission of requests to the House of Representatives, that the Senate, by confining itself to those requests, thereby relinquishes its right to take further action on these sales tax Bills which it considers necessary to take. Such action includes my suggestion of a division of the Bills pursuant to Standing Order 330 or the other avenue mentioned in my letter to the party leaders dated 4 September this year, namely, action via the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will recognise that adoption of my motion will tend to prompt agreement by the House of Representatives to any request which a majority of the Senate may make about the Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1A-9A) in the Committee of the Whole. In effect we will be saying this to the House of Representatives: 'The Senate is offering the House of Representatives this immediate opportunity to remove the iniquitous features of these Bills, that is, those features which impose a sales tax on previously exempted items, necessities of life, as they have been described, clothing, footwear, educational books and the like, but let it be clearly understood by the House of Representatives that if it rejects these requests then the Senate may very well take certain other action.' This will add strength to any request which we adopt in the committee debate which will follow. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely it is not too strong for me to use the words 'unprecedented', 'devious' and 'unscrupulous' to describe the drafting of these Sales Tax Amendment Bills (No. 1A-9A). The way that these Bills have been drafted comes very close to re-instating a practice which brought contempt to the Parliament in Great Britain 300 years ago. In the 17th century, and earlier, the House of Commons deliberately included in Supply Bills and Bills of Aid matters which were foreign to the main purposes of those Bills. This practice was described as tacking. The whole purpose was to make those Bills non-amendable because of their money character. The same tactic has been applied by the Government on this occasion so as to suggest to certain honourable senators that the Sales Tax Amendment Bills (No. 1A-9A) are non-amendable. Unless the Senate signals its recognition of the Government's endorsement of that tactic, we will be conceding grounds of power which we rightly possess under the Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA> There are some among this Government who would emphatically support the words of the late Harold Holt in 1967, two days before the Senate legitimately negated the second reading of the Post and Telegraph Bill, when he declared that it was allegedly 'a firmly established principle' that a House of review-that is the Senate-'should not reject the financial decisions of the popular House'. He used that term to describe the House of Representatives. I am indebted to an article in the journal The Table by our former Clerk, Mr Roy Bullock, about those events in 1967. But let us pause for a moment and consider the implications of Mr Holt's words 'the financial decisions'. He apparently did not even concede the powers given to the Senate in the Constitution. Quite clearly the Senate has those powers to reject those Bills. In respect of proposed laws, it does have the power to proceed in accordance with its Standing Orders. </PARA>
<PARA> Tacking is not something that is done only on the River Derwent on a Saturday afternoon, or even on the Sydney Harbour; it is something which an unscrupulous government does so as to place its actions above parliamentary amendment. In this instance the Government might not have made itself open to a formal breach under section 53 of the Constitution. It is too clever by half. I have a secret admiration for the way in which the Government has drafted these pieces of legislation. This legislation has been drafted in an unprecedented fashion. This fashion has never been used in the 51 years in which the principal Act has existed. It has never been done before. Why has it been done? What has occurred on this occasion which has not occurred previously is that the Government has incorporated machinery provisions with the provisions of a tax. I seek leave to table the various sales tax amendment Acts and sales tax Acts over the last 51 years. I defy any honourable senator to go through all of these Acts and find where the Government previously has done what it proposes to do on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What it has done is best illustrated by asking four simple questions. Firstly, is a Bill to amend the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act a Bill which the Senate may amend? Secondly, are Bills to amend the Sales Tax Assessment Acts Bills which the Senate may amend? Thirdly, does proposed new section 6 in clause 3 of each of the Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1A-9A) modify each of the Acts referred to in the preceding two questions? Fourthly, have any Acts amending the Sales Tax Acts (Nos 1-9) contained provisions modifying the Sales Tax Assessment Acts or the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Acts? The answer to all of those questions is in the negative. But the answer to the question 'Has the Government on this occasion included in the one Bill before the Parliament provisions to amend the Sales Tax Assessment Act and the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act', is yes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> So here we have a situation in which the Government, for the first time in 51 years, has proposed a set of Bills which is unique and designed to hoodwink the Senate into the belief that they are non-amendable. I point out to the Senate that I for one and, I believe, the majority of the Senate will not go along with that tactic that has been used by the Government. Why has it used this unprecedented tactic on this sole occasion in the last 51 years? It has done it precisely for the same reason that the despicable practice of tacking was employed 300 years ago, namely, to clothe the proposed laws in a non-amendable garb. There is no doubt about it, these Bills have been imperfectly drafted. The imposition of the tax should have been separate from the machinery provisions, as has been the case over the last 51 years. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator HARRADINE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Okay. I am talking about the history of sales tax provisions. If this is the level of the information of the Government on this very important question then I despair of the Government and the legal eagles in it. If we concede that these Bills have been properly drafted on this occasion, what wider provisions are likely to be included in all future taxation Bills to come before the Senate? That is the question to which we ought to address our minds. I suggest that the limits to the boundaries of such Bills will never be constrained by the determination of the Government to thwart the Senate and the ingenuity of skilled draftsmen who are at the disposal of the Government. I do not blame the skilled draftsmen on this occasion. They act under instructions. But when the Archives records are available in 30 years I believe there will be very little written evidence as to the instruction given by the Government on this occasion to those skilled draftsmen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If any honourable senator has any doubt about the unknown possibilities which lay ahead of them, they should consider the case in 1943, which was cited by Mr Odgers, in which the government of that day linked the proclamation of an income tax Bill with the operation of the National Welfare Fund Act. Who in the Senate believes that the Government, if it gets away scot-free on this occasion, will not turn to manoeuvres such as those which were employed in 1943 and which, incidentally, were not determined but were by-passed after a conference between the two Houses. Just imagine the different forms of siamese twins which could emerge from linking tax Bills to non-tax Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> In the final analysis the limitations of section 53 of the Constitution of Australia are for the Senate itself to interpret and for the two Houses of Parliament to determine. I re-emphasise that point, Mr President. You were not in the chair when we were discussing this matter on a previous occasion. We are dealing with proposed laws. Those proposed laws and our actions in relation thereto are not subject to any outside decision by any court in this land. They are proposed laws. Whatever legal argument the Government may advance, subsequent to my address tonight, to defend its current action, it cannot disguise the fact that for 51 years governments of all kinds have fastidiously separated machinery provisions from the imposition of sales tax itself. The adoption of my motion must lead to a more serious consideration by the House of Representatives of the requests which, I understand, will attract the majority of support on the balance of probabilities in the Committee of the Whole. In effect, if we accept my motion, we shall warn the House of Representatives, in a polite but firm manner, that its agreement to the requests now might prove to be the least embarrassing course open to it. At the same time the Senate will be conveying to the Government that there is a line of demarcation between what is right and proper and what is clever and unscrupulous. It will also be an invitation to the Government to move from the course it has set in the twentieth century towards the reimposition of tactics which were abandoned in their most distasteful form almost 300 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, lest the Government, as part of its justification of or opposition to my motion, relies on the proposition that the Senate can make requests only in respect of Bills which it may not amend pursuant to section 53 of the Constitution, I draw the Government's attention to the word 'suggest' in section 57 of the Constitution. Quite clearly, the Senate has the power to make suggestions to the House of Representatives in respect of any Bill, whether or not it is a money Bill. Lest the Government hangs its hat on the proposition that a suggestion is not a request, let me remind you, Mr President, and the Senate of what I said when I moved for the suspension of Standing Orders. It is inconceivable that anyone could sustain a pro- position that a suggestion made by this place is not in fact a request to the House of Representatives if it is attached to the Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate of what I said previously in the hope that the Government does not take this track. To make a suggestion to a Bill is not simply a matter of passing a motion and put it in a suggestion box in the middle of King's Hall which once a week is cleared by the Joint House Department and the honourable senator making the suggestion receiving some sort of reward. A suggestion is in fact what it is designed to be in section 57-a legitimate tactic by this House to suggest amendments to the House of Representatives. In all of the circumstances I urge the Senate to support the motion that the Senate, in making requests to the House of Representatives, does not necessarily consider that the Bills which are currently before us-namely, the Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1A-9A)-are properly drafted. I commend the motion to the Senate. </PARA>

The Opposition will not oppose Senator Harradine's motion, although we have quite serious reservations about it, one of which is the opinion delivered by the Solicitor-General last Thursday. The opinion quite categorically rejected the legal basis of Senator Harradine's argument. Indeed, no lawyer's opinion would be held, I think even by lawyers, to be infallible. We will not oppose the motion because it is a declaration only-it is a holding action-and is something which paves the way or allows the Senate to reconsider its position when the House of Representatives rejects the requests which appear likely to be added on to the Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1A-9A) at the Committee stage.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government takes a much more positive-perhaps I should say 'negative'-attitude in relation to this matter than does the Opposition. I say 'more positive attitude' because the Opposition is prepared to go along with the motion because it is drafted in a pious form. The Government is deeply concerned about the implications of the motion of Senator Harradine and will oppose it. We do so because we believe that if the motion is passed by the Senate it will have very serious fundamental constitutional implications. Because the proposal has been moved in what we might call a pious form, it does not mean that we as a Senate can absolve ourselves from taking a firm view on it one way or the other.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The position which the Government takes is that the legislation which is before the Senate, if passed, would become a valid law under section 55 of the Constitution. If the Senate, because of the form of the legislation which is before us, were to breach section 55 of the Constitution, it would be struck down in the High Court of Australia. Therefore, when the Government presents legislation which, if passed, has the sanction ultimately that it would be held to be in breach of section 55 of the Constitution, there are very serious consequences for the Parliament and the Government proposing to the Parliament legislation which would be constitutionally invalid. We have very firm views that this proposed law is not constitutionally invalid but is in accordance with the terms of section 55 of the Constitution. Naturally, on a subject of such importance as this, I have obtained the advice of the Solicitor-General. </PARA>

In some mysterious way he believed the Senate would be able to redraft the Bills, dividing them in some way. Senator Harradine has abandoned that proposal for the time being. I do not quite know why. We are now dealing with this pious motion of Senator Harradine which the Australian Labor Party is prepared to support. I wonder what they would do if this were really a serious matter.

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The opinion read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>SALES TAX AMENDMENT BILLS NOS. 1A TO 9A WHETHER CONSISTENT WITH SECTION 55 OF THE CONSTITUTION</PARA>
<PARA>Opinion</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> My opinion has been sought on the following question: ''Are any of the provisions that are proposed to be inserted (by the Sales Tax Amendment Bills Nos. 1A to 9A) in the Sales Tax Act (No. 1) 1930 and other Sales Tax Acts provisions that, by reason of the Constitution, should not be included in any 'law imposing taxation'?''</PARA>
<PARA> 2. For clarity's sake I shall say something of the statutory background against which the Bills must be understood. I shall treat the Sales Tax Act No. 1 as the type for each Sales Tax Act and the No. 1 Assessment Act as the type for the various Assessment Acts. </PARA>
<PARA>Sales Tax Act (No. 1) 3. Section 2 provides that the No. 1 Assessment Act shall be incorporated and read as one with the Tax Act. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. Section 3 imposes tax at the rates specified in section 4 upon the sale value of goods manufactured in Australia by a taxpayer (an expression defined in section 3(1) of the Assessment Act) and, on or after 16 August 1978, sold by him or treated by him as stock for sale by retail or applied to his own use. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. The various rates of tax imposed are described in section 4 by reference to goods covered by Schedules to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act and by reference to a further class defined as those not covered by the Second, Third, Fourth or Fifth Schedules to that Act and on the sale value of which the Exemptions and Classifications Act does not provide that sales tax imposed by the Sales Tax Act (No. 1) shall not be paid. </PARA>
<PARA> 6. The Sales Tax Act (No. 2) follows the same scheme for imposing tax, but, because laws imposing taxation, except those imposing duties of customs or excise must deal with one subject of taxation only (section 55 of the Constitution, second paragraph), section 3 imposes tax at the rates specified in section 4 upon the sale value of goods manufactured in Australia and, on or after 16 August 1978, sold by a taxpayer who purchases them from the manufacturer. </PARA>
<PARA> 7. Section 2 of each of the Tax Acts (Nos. 1 to 9) incorporates the corresponding Assessment Act and describes the goods the subject of the tax by reference either solely or partly to Schedules to the Exemptions and Classification Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Assessment Acts 8. The Assessment Acts contain provisions necessary to work out the scheme of imposition and the procedures essential to the determination and recovery of the tax imposed by the Tax Acts. They contain, in other words, some provisions dealing with the imposition of tax additional to those contained in the Tax Act and others relating only to its recovery. </PARA>
<PARA>Exemptions and Classifications Act 9. The Tax Acts are in much the same general form now as on their introduction in 1930. Then as now the relevant Assessment Act was incorporated: Each Act defined one subject of taxation; but, due to the passing in 1935 of the Exemptions Act and of the Exemptions and Classifications Act in 1940 and their subsequent amendment, the goods upon the sale value of which the tax was imposed came mostly to be described by reference to the Schedules of that Act. </PARA>
<PARA> 10. Thus, essential to the imposition of these taxes was a statement of the transactions attracting tax, the goods the subject of the transactions, the persons participating in them and the rates of tax. The Assessment Acts contained provisions dealing with the imposition of tax necessary to an understanding of the Tax Acts as well as other provisions, and the Schedules to the Exemptions and Classification Act described goods subject to and exempt from tax. None of these Acts impose taxation. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bills 11. Again I shall treat the Bill (No. 1A) 1981 as the type and describe it in language apt to its operation if passed. </PARA>
<PARA> 12. Clause 3 repeals sections 3 and 4 of the No. 1 Tax Act, that is, the provisions which describe the transactions upon which tax is imposed (part of the subject of taxation) and that which specified the rates of tax varying according to which Schedule of the Exemptions and Classifications Act described the relevant goods and in paragraph (d) defining a class by reference to the fact that they do not appear in the nominated schedules and are not otherwise exempt by the Exemptions and Classifications Act. </PARA>
<PARA> 13. It proposes in their stead a new section 3 imposing as from 1 January 1982 tax upon the sale value of goods to which the new section 4 will apply and then describes the transactions. </PARA>
<PARA> 14. The new section 4 declares the rates of tax again in part by reference to goods covered by the Second, Third, Fourth and Fifth Schedule to the Classifications and Exemptions Act and in part by reference to all goods except those to which section 5 of that Act applies and those which that Act says are goods upon the sale value of which no tax is payable although section 5 does not apply to them. </PARA>
<PARA> 15. The new section 5 also imposes tax as from 1 January 1982 at 2.5% upon the same subject of tax mentioned in the new section 3, but only by reference to transactions in such of those goods as are described in nominated items in the First Schedule to the Exemptions and Classifications Act and those which were immediately before 1 January 1982 exempt because goods of a kind mentioned in paragraph 5 (2) (a) were so exempt. </PARA>
<PARA> 16. The new section 6 (a), bearing in mind that section 2 of the No. 1 Act (which the Bill seeks to amend) provides that the No. 1 Assessment Act shall be incorporated and read as one with the No. 1 Tax Act, says (and I state the substance) that it shall be so read as if it had no section 20 for the purpose only of reading it with the proposed new section 5, but not with the new sections 3 or 4. The new section 6 (b) says that the Exemptions and Classifications Act is to be read for the purpose of the new section 5 as if the items referred to in the new sub-section 5 (2) were not there, but it is not to be so read for the purposes of reading it with the new sections 3 and 4. </PARA>
<PARA> 17. Clause 4 continues in existence the repealed provisions as tax imposing provisions in relation to the period up to 1 January 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> 18. The remaining Bills do not require separate examination. </PARA>
<PARA> 19. Section 55 of the Constitution requires that laws imposing taxation shall deal only with the imposition of taxation. Such laws must deal only with one subject of taxation except that laws imposing duties of customs and excise may deal with more than one subject of taxation provided they deal only with duties of customs and excise respectively. </PARA>
<PARA> 20. I shall deal first with the question whether the Bills deal with more than one subject of taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> 21. What constitutes a subject of taxation is ''based on common understanding and general conceptions, rather than on any analytical or logical classification'': Resch v. Federal Commissioner of Taxation (1942) 55 CLR 198 at p. 223 per Dixon J. I should think it is clear beyond reasonable dispute that each of the Bills deals and only deals with one subject of taxation to the same degree and for the same reasons as have the corresponding Tax Acts since 1930. Each selects one transaction or event in relation to defined dealings in goods by defined persons. </PARA>
<PARA> 22. Do any of the Bills deal with any matter other than the imposition of taxation? The incorporation of the Assessment Act in the Tax Acts by section 2 operates only for purposes of reference. Those Acts are not thereby to be treated as if they dealt with any matter other than the imposition of taxation. Such has been the law since 1911: Osborne v. Commonwealth (1911) 12 CLR 321; Federal Commissioner of Taxation v. Munro (1926) 38 CLR 153 at pp. 185, 192-193, 208-210, 215-216, 218. This is so although some provisions of the Assessment Acts deal with the imposition of tax and others deal with additional matters: Re Dymond 101 CLR 11 at pp. 20-21 and 23-25. </PARA>
<PARA> 23. If the Assessment Acts may be incorporated for reference purposes without infringing section 55, it necessarily follows that a provision such as the new section 6 (a) of the Bills does not infringe the section. Its sole purpose is to indicate the extent of the reference. The provision does not, of course, amend the Assessment Act. It operates for the purposes of one proposed section only and thus assumes that the Assessment Act continues unaffected not only for other proposed sections, but for all other purposes. Even it its effect was to amend the Assessment Act, it would do so to explain the nature of the tax imposed, that is, it would impose or deal with the imposition of taxation.</PARA>
<PARA> 24. As I have earlier indicated, tax has been for many years imposed by reference to the Schedules to the Exemptions and Classifications Act. In that way the Tax Exemptions and Classifications Act. In that way the Tax Acts describe the goods, dealings in which are made the occasion of imposition of tax. The proposed section 6 (b) indicates the extent to which the Exemption and Classification Act is to be referred to for the purposes of one new section only and like the proposed section 6 (a) does not amend it. The authorities I have earlier referred to show that this provision like the proposed section 6 (a) does not infringe section 55. </PARA>
<PARA> 25. It should be remembered that the Bills before the Senate do not contain provisions incorporating the Assessment Acts. No ground save the references to specific provisions of the Assessment and Exemptions and Classification Acts exists for saying they deal with matters other than the imposition of tax. Once it is realised that the Assessment Acts contain provisions which may appear in the Tax Acts (as Re Dymond (supra) establishes), then that reference cannot support the proposition that thereby the Acts infringe Section 55. Both history and common sense are clearly opposed to it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not have to clear things before I seek leave. I distributed copies of the opinion to the of Opposition parties and Senator Harradine earlier this evening. I turn to section 55 of the Constitution. Mr Byers's opinion deals at length with the Bills in a detailed form and the provisions of section 55 of the Constitution. The clauses of the Bills regarded by Senator Harradine as infringing the Constitution are those dealing with the modification to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act and the Sales Tax Assessment Acts. It appears that Senator Harradine does not fully appreciate the scope of section 55 of the Constitution. Let me put it as simply as I can: A law imposing taxation can contain two types of provisions without infringing section 55. A law imposing taxation can contain provisions, firstly, which actually impose taxation and, secondly, which deal with the imposition of taxation. When so combined the proposed law retains its character as a law imposing taxation and, by virtue of section 53 of the Constitution, cannot be amended by the Senate. As is made clear in the Solicitor-General's opinion that I have incorporated in Hansard, there is clear and unequivocal High Court authority for these propositions. I refer to the case of Dymond which was dealt with in the previous opinion of Mr Byers, a copy of which some honourable senators would have received. To give the Senate an idea of the type of provisions which can be included in a law imposing taxation without infringing section 55 I shall quote from the judgment of Mr Justice Fullagar in the case of Dymond. I might say that the other justices of the High Court, including Sir Owen Dixon, agreed with him. The judgment reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It does not mean that an Act imposing taxation can do no more than say 'An income tax is imposed at the following rates', and then specify the rates. It would not be 'dealing with' anything other than the imposition of taxation if it prescribed the persons who were to pay the tax and the classes of income in respect of which they were to be taxed. It may very well be that an Act imposing an income tax could, without offending against s. 55, contain all or most of the provisions in fact contained in Pt. III of the Income Tax and Social Services Contribution Assessment Act, which is headed 'Liability to Taxation' (now Part III of the Income Tax Assessment Act). Such provisions do not impose taxation, but they deal with the imposition of taxation, because the specification of the persons who are to be liable to taxation and the definition of their liability is part of the denotation of the term 'imposition of taxation'. </PARA>
<PARA>Thus, for Senator Harradine's assertion that the provision of the Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1A-9A) 1981 modifying the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act and the Sales Tax Assessment Act infringe section 55 to be correct, these provisions must neither impose taxation nor deal with the imposition of taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> I will deal with the modifications to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act and the Assessment Act separately. With reference to the exemptions and classifications Act, the only difference of legal opinion to date, or at least until Senator Harradine's contribution, is on whether that Act imposed taxation. After all, a Bill to remove an exemption would automatically result in liability to sales tax in respect of the relevant goods under Sales Tax Acts (Nos 1-9) or deal with the imposition of taxation. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Harradine" NAMEID="6H4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6H4">Senator Harradine</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are amendable by the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is what we are debating. To my knowledge, never before has the argument been raised that the exemptions and classifications Act or any amendments or modifications thereto neither imposed nor dealt with the imposition of taxation. Indeed, the eminent constitutional lawyer Professor Lane in his book entitled The Australian Federal System at pages 394 and 395 and citing re Dymond as authority lists what he considers to be provisions dealing with the imposition of taxation. In that list he expressly includes 'provisions by which liability to tax is ascertained, such as those dealing with deductions, rebates and exemptions'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Turning to the proposed section 6 (b) to be inserted in each Sales Tax Act by Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1A-9A), the Senate should understand that that paragraph provides for the exemptions and classifications Act to have effect as if presently exempted items referred to in proposed section 5 (2) were omitted from the exemptions and classifications Act. This paragraph is a necessary adjunct to the imposition of sales tax on those items referred to in proposed section 5 (2). Clearly, proposed section 6 (b) is, at the very least, a law dealing with the imposition of taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the modification to the Sales Tax Assessment Acts by proposed section 6 (a), I draw the Senate's attention to the Solicitor-General's opinion at the foot of page 2 where he says that 'they' that is, the assessment Acts-'contain some provisions dealing with the imposition of taxation additional to those contained in the Tax Act'. I refer the Senate further to that opinion. </PARA>
<PARA> This brings me to the final point of the argument that I wish to present to the Senate this evening. Senator Harradine has accused the Government of acting improperly when it combined the amendment and modifications to the Sales Tax Act, the Sales Tax Assessment Act and the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act in one Bill. As I have said, whether the Government is entitled to do that depends in the end on section 55 of the Constitution. The decisions of a government and this Parliament ultimately will be determined by the High Court. I have referred to a decision of the High Court, the leading High Court authority on the subject in Re Dymond. The Government maintains that the Bills as drafted satisfy the requirements of that High Court decision and of section 55 of the Constitution. But it raises a point-a fundamental point which honourable senators ought to observe and one which, I think, Senator Harradine in his argument seems to have overlooked-which is fundamental to our Constitution. The point is that the Government, being the group having the majority in the House of Representatives, and the Government alone, is responsible for the content and form of laws imposing and dealing with the imposition of taxation. The Senate can reject them. There is no doubt about that whatever but, subject to the Constitution and subject to the High Court, it is for the government of the day to determine what should be in money Bills that are to be introduced-and can be introduced only into the House of Representatives and furthermore can be introduced into the House of Representatives only on the motion of the Executive. Those are absolutely fundamental points of our Constitution. The Government is entitled to present its money Bills in the form in which it chooses. To reinforce this point, and to conclude my remarks in relation to this motion, I would like to quote from another constitutinal text of Lumb and Ryan. The learned authors stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The formulation of the revenue requirements for the financial year are to be determined by the government of the day, and the Bills piloted through the House of Representatives by the Treasurer, who will inevitably be a member of the Lower House. It is clear, therefore, that it was not to be the task of the Senate to take the initiative in formulating such basic proposals of government. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, the motion before us tonight which has been moved by Senator Harradine strikes at the very foundation and the provisions of our Constitution in relation to this vital aspect of the financial proposals for the year which are the responsibility of the Government to introduce into and pass through the House of Representatives. For those reasons the Government will oppose strongly the motion that has been moved by Senator Harradine. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; in reply-Mr President, for the last quarter of an hour the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) has dealt with a subject matter which is not consistent with the proposition that is now before the chamber. That proposition seeks to indicate that the Senate, in determining its attitude as to requests on the Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1A-9A) does not thereby consider that the Bills before the Senate are properly drafted. That is all that this proposition is doing at this stage. Why is it doing that? Because we are dealing with a proposed law. The burden of the Attorney-General's speech was to deal with laws already enacted by the Parliament; that is to say, dealing with section 55 of the Constitution. Of course, section 55 of the Constitution is clear. It deals with legislation already enacted by the Parliament and given royal assent. It is certainly for the High Court to determine whether those laws are valid but we are not dealing with that question at all; we are dealing with proposed laws. We are dealing with laws proposed by the Government, formulated by the Government and presented by the Government in a manner in which it has never before presented them to the Parliament. That is the one thing to which the Attorney-General has not addressed his mind.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I ask you, Mr President, and the rest of the Senate: Has the Attorney-General explained to the Senate why on this sole occasion the Government has decided to incorporate in the one Bill the provisions that it has incorporated? The Attorney-General's sole defence for that is to allege that the Government-I hope I quote the Attorney-General correctly-is responsible for what laws will come before the Parliament and in what form they will come. That is not contested in regard to money Bills. Under section 53 of the Constitution, the Senate does not have the power to formulate and initiate laws relating to money Bills. Of course, it is for the Government and the House of Representatives to do that. In those circumstances the Government by definition must determine the form in which money Bills are presented to the Parliament. So what? If the House of Representatives alone has the power to initiate money Bills, of course the Government alone has the power to determine in what form those money Bills will be presented to this Parliament. That begs the question entirely. </PARA>
<PARA> We are saying that when those proposed laws come before the Parliament, we as a Senate have the responsibility and the right to consider the appropriateness of their formulation. We have the responsibility to consider whether there is some subterfuge, exercised by the Government, designed to thwart the power of the Senate. That is what we are talking about. We are not talking about the gobbledegook that has been outlined by the Attorney-General and, with respect, by the Solicitor-General, It is not gobbledegook if we are talking about section 55 of the Constitution. What the Solicitor-General and the Attorney-General have said is undeniably correct. There is no question at all of that, but they are not addressing themselves to the crux of the matter: Has the Government on this unique occasion presented the Senate with a set of Bills so as to thwart the Senate in the proper exercise of its powers?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, the answer is yes. It has done so, and it has done so on this occasion for the first time in the history of sales tax legislation. I submit that all the statements of the Attorney-General have been directed to section 55 of the Constitution, which deals with laws already enacted, and to the power of the High Court, for example, to determine whether those laws are valid. What we are dealing with tonight is a proposition as to whether we as a Senate, an integral part of the legislative power which is enshrined in section 1 of the Constitution, have the right to determine our own affairs, to determine whether those sales tax Bills are properly formulated and whether they seek to deny and thwart our power. That is the simple question. In my motion I am not asking honourable senators necessarily to make a judgment on that matter but simply to say that when requests are made to amend Bills 1A to 9A we are not thereby denying ourselves the right ultimately to consider the legislation and to divide it in accordance with Standing Order 330, if that is so determined at that stage.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Although strictly speaking we are now considering Bills Nos 1-9, perhaps I should outline what the Opposition intends to do with the three packages of Bills which are currently before us. Bills Nos 1-9 increase existing sales taxes by 2 1/2 per cent and in a full year raise an estimated $420m in additional revenue. The second group of Bills, Nos 1A-9A, impose a tax of 2 1/2 per cent on items which previously were not taxed. That is estimated to raise $330m in a full year. The third package, the amendments to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act, rectifies the so-called anomalies but in fact raise an additional $142m in a full year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party opposed all of these Bills at the second reading stage because they are inflationary, unjust, unnecessary and ill-considered. I understand that, at the Committee stage of consideration of Bills 1A-9A, the Australian Democrats propose to move a series of amendments which will delete from the taxable category a number of the items to be taxed. I then intend to move certain additions to that list. I understand that the Australian Democrats do not intend to support those additions. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite what the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) implied a few minutes ago, it has been agreed generally that the Senate can amend the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill. Of course, whether that is in fact in dispute will ultimately be determined not by Senator Durack but by other authorities. Senator Evans intends to move effectively to that Bill the same amendments as the Australian Democrats, I understand, will be moving to Bills 1A-9A. In doing so, he will deal briefly with the legal aspects involved. At that stage we will not seek to add to those the amendments we will have moved in respect of Bills 1A-9A. If our understanding is correct and the Australian Democrats will not support those amendments in respect of Bills 1A-9A, we assume that they will not support them in respect of a subsequent Bill. I will then move separately to exempt eight specific items from the so-called anomalies changes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-In respect of all nine Bills I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) That the House of Representatives be requested to make the following amendment:</PARA>
<PARA> Page 2, clause 3, proposed new section 5, sub-section (2), paragraph (a), leave out ''51''. </PARA>
<PARA>The intention of this request to the House of Representatives is to exempt from the 2 1/2 per cent proposed sales tax books and other information publications. Senator Harradine referred earlier to a number of nefarious dealings undertaken by a British government hundreds of years ago. I would like to refer briefly to another tax measure that was undertaken and later dropped. I refer to the tax on windows. Of course, that tax had the effect of blocking the light. I contend that a tax on knowledge of the sort envisaged in the taxing of books and other information would be, metaphorically, a tax on the light that those items afford the Australian public. It is an absurd tax to impose and one to which we are opposed. Like other honourable senators, I have been inundated with requests from organisations that we oppose the proposed 2 1/2 per cent sales tax. I quote from one of those letters in order to give their essence:</PARA>
<PARA> This proposed tax is in reality a tax on the free flow of information and a tax on education. There is a real danger too that this tax will be increased in future years much in the same way as other sales tax provisions have been increased in the 1981 Budget. Furthermore, a sales tax of this nature could potentially be used to carry out censorship. </PARA>
<PARA>I remind honourable senators of a comment that I made on 9 September in a second reading speech on these sales tax amendment Bills. In referring to the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights, I made the point that we intended to oppose the imposition of sales tax on the necessities of life-the sorts of things covered by Articles 25 and 26 of the Declaration. Specifically in relation to this amendment, I refer honourable senators to the first sentence of item 1 of Article 26, which states that everyone has the right to education. It must be patently apparent to everybody in this chamber that access to education, either formally through the primary or secondary schools, or the tertiary system, or informally through access to general information, will be hindered if people find it beyond their means to acquire that information. The Australian Democrats feel strongly that the House of Representatives should be petitioned, and petitioned constantly, to remove item 51 from clause 3, proposed new section 5, sub-section 2. </PARA>

I want to say a few words on the matter presently before us, but I might say I hold this view in regard to some of the other sales tax measures also.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I hasten to say that I will not vote in favour of the amendment moved by Senator Haines to return these Bills to the House of Representatives with requests. I will not vote against any proposals which form part of the Budget of the Government. Ten days or a fortnight ago I made a lengthy speech on the Budget, in which I explained my view on refusing to vote against Supply and money Bills.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Labor Party senators can shout their heads off. They have proved themselves now to be quite inconsistent in principle. For so many years they were so hot and strong in claiming that they would never vote against money Bills, that they would never vote against Supply Bills. They fought hard in the Constitutional Convention to have the Constitution changed to prevent the Senate defeating Supply or money Bills. I am glad Senator Evans is here tonight because he is on record as saying a number of things about that. But now they think they can do something about those sorts of Bills. Whilst perhaps they cannot defeat provisions, they feel they can delay their passage through the Parliament and send them back to the other place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Many of us in this chamber and on this side of the chamber have written to the Government about complaints concerning the provision in this legislation imposing sales tax on books and papers. A relatively small amount of money is involved at this stage, but I believe that for many of the companies engaged in the industry and people who are interested in books and papers it is a tax that will be very difficult to bear. I regret the fact that the Government has made a decision to impose a tax in that area and in other areas that are close to the needs of people. I think a good case has been made out by the Government for a general imposition of sales tax, for spreading the field of tax so that more of it is collected in sales tax, a system that is less susceptible to the evasion and avoidance problems which can arise in collecting personal income tax. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that generally a case can be made out for widening the tax base. I have my own views on whether some of the areas chosen by the Government for the imposition of sales tax were wise and I believe that this one in particular was not wise. I have said so firmly in representations I have made to the Government on the matter. But I do not believe that it is incumbent on this Committee to defer and fail to pass the provisions of this legislation and to send them back to the Government. That may well be done by the Senate. If it is done I hope that the Government will take considerable notice of the expressions of sentiments felt by honourable senators, irrespective of whether they vote for or against the proposal. </PARA>

People have to put up with Senator McLaren's insufferable boredom morning, noon and night. I hope that some people will take the view I am expressing, a view which I sincerely hold. I have concern for some of the elements of the sales tax measures being imposed. I hope that the Government will reconsider some of them. At the same time, I hope that this Committee will not take the step of trying to superimpose its views on the Government and the House of Representatives by way of an action such as the one proposed tonight. For those reasons, I shall oppose the amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Committee is exercising its rights in seeking to refer this sales tax legislation back to the House of Representatives. I do not see that approach as being inconsistent with the attitude that has been adopted by honourable senators, even by senators such as Senator Missen. Only two or three years ago we were discussing legislation which would affect the payment of funeral benefits. That legislation formed part of the Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Missen" NAMEID="YL7">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YL7">Senator Missen</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RG4">Senator GIETZELT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That legislation was part of the Budget. It was related to income. As a result of pressure being applied by Government back benchers, the Government decided to withdraw the proposal relating to funeral benefits. Of course, we recall that Senator Missen was one of the people who, in 1975, had some misgivings about the tactics being adopted by Mr Fraser in his grab for power. On several occasions in 1975 when not only the Budget but also Supply Bills were being debated in this chamber votes were cast by the then Opposition, which held a majority of seats in this chamber, for the delay and the non-passage of both the Budget and Supply Bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. What we are seeking to do here now is surely justified by the tremendous number of protests to which Senator Haines referred concerning the legislation. In the 10 years I have been a member of this chamber I have never received so much correspondence on an issue from such a wide variety of organisations, groups and people within the community. I suggest to Senator Missen and to the Government that part of our responsibility is to listen to the points of view coming from such a diverse variety of people within our society. They include small businessmen, consumer groups, manufacturers, distributors, suppliers and master builders of a whole range of products that will be affected by this Government's decision to increase and extend what can only be described as a widely based commodities tax. </PARA>
<PARA> I recall what the Treasurer, Mr Howard, said about this matter. Of course, this Government is becoming notorious for its double standards and its contradictory statements from one month to another. I remind the Committee, particularly Senator Missen, that on 12 March this year Mr Howard said that the Government did not wish to move towards placing a greater reliance upon indirect tax without providing a noticeable offset in personal income tax reductions. Of course, we know that the Government in these Bills has provided for the collection of $892m and there has been no offset in personal income tax. We know from representations that have been made to all honourable senators from both sides of the chamber that the low income groups will be affected, that the small producers in some of our manufacturing industries will be affected and that employment will be affected as a result of the increased charges when these wide-ranging taxes are applied. I find it particularly offensive that we should be increasing taxation in the home building materials area, that we should be increasing taxation on printed materials, clothing and the hundreds and hundreds of items that have been suggested in the Government's sales tax legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the Australian Democrats have had some difficulties in reconciling their position. I can understand that they are reflecting, as they should, the demands that have been made of them by many groups within the Australian community. In fact, if they had not responded I am sure that many people who supported them in the last election would have been disappointed. Many people on my side of politics also would have been disappointed because the Australian community believes that if the Democrats, Senator Harradine and the Labor Party combine the Government will be forced to re-examine its existing legislation. The Senate, as a House of review, is entitled to say that the Government should have a fresh look at this matter. I remind Senator Missen that the Budget which has not yet been passed by this place provides for a substantial domestic surplus. If we were to refuse to approve all of these Bills tonight or in the future the Budget considerations would in no way be affected. Such action would affect only the Government's strategy of taking money out of the Australian community in order to minimise the effect of capital inflow from overseas. It would in no way affect the income and expenditure aspects of the Budget which is still before the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> It is proper for us to look at these Bills in the way that has been suggested in the motion and not to see this proposal in the context of denying Supply. The proposal does not affect the Supply component of the Budget at all; in no way does it affect the Supply situation. The Supply Bills will pass. The Bills we are considering deal with the collection of a tax. They do not affect the Budget; they affect only the Budget strategy. The Government claims that it is concerned about inflation. However, it is conceded by the Government's own spokesman that the inflation rate will be affected by these sales tax provisions by anything up to one per cent. Government senators should be consistent when they look at the way in which the majority of members in this place seek to refer this matter back to the House of Representatives for further consideration. Even Senator Missen accepts that there is a case for some amendment to the sales tax legislation. He admits that and yet he suggests that we are acting improperly and wrongly by sending the matter back to the House of Representatives for further consideration. After all, no basic difference would be made to the overall Budget considerations if these decisions were arrived at. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not weary the Senate by referring to all the correspondence we have received from a variety of organisations. We have even received correspondence from Rotary clubs. Organisations that print small magazines have asked us in this place to exercise our power, not of veto but our power to re-examine the Government's legislation.We have had groups from Queensland. We have had organisations associated with printing, international public relations, master builders, suppliers of building materials and a whole number of manufacturers who have asked us to exercise, in some cases, a power of veto. That is not what is proposed by the Democrats in this motion. The motion is asking us to send the legislation back to the House of Representatives with a request that it have another look at the proposal which is repugnant to the Australian community, to the Australian Labor Party and, I hope, to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I make some points in relation to item 51, having spent most of my working life until now in education, having written books and having been, just shortly before I took my seat as a senator, a director of a publishing firm. I think this area which the Australian Democrats have taken as one of four areas of basic need within the community is one which will hit not simply those people who are engaged in the publication of books and not simply those who are currently involved with organisations. I read from the principal Act of 1935 which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Books, pamphlets, leaflets, periodicals or magazines issued or to be issued by or on behalf of an organization which is not carried on for the profit of individuals . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, what we are picking up here and taxing for the first time are all of those methods by which organisations, charities and a whole range of service organisations within the community carry out their work. They will, in fact, have an impost put on them by the Government. They will be taxed by the Government in carrying out their work, which is not for their profit. In most cases, given the wide range of organisations in our community, those organisations are specifically there for the benefit of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I make is this: This Government preaches an enormous amount about private enterprise, about people helping themselves, about people helping in the community and about people getting out and doing something for themselves. When people do that they are taxed. We have the most absurd context of taxing such individuals and such organisations. In fact, when people finally get off their backsides and do something we say: 'Well, jolly good on you, you are going to be taxed because of it'. Up to now they have not been taxed and that is as it should be. We hope that under the Constitution and by the quite legitimate means which the Democrats have adopted that is, a referral which is not a blocking which we have sworn that we will not do, they will not be taxed. I remind not only the government but also the Australian Labor Party which says that it will be in government in two years that we respect the Budgets of the Government in the lower House. </PARA>
<PARA> We are quite properly making requests. We presume that in two years we will probably be making requests on identical items, to a Labor Government because the Labor Party has not yet said that it will take all of these imposts off. We will be making requests, as it is the right of this chamber to do. We hope that if the House of Representatives respects this chamber it will deal with the requests on this item and on the other items that we will propose for consideration. I urge the Government to look again and make sure in whatever way it possibly can that it will stop taxing all of those areas of knowledge within the community and all of those services and support organisations which are so much the lifeblood of the community such as ours. They certainly should not be taxed in carrying out those types of service activities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to reply very briefly to Senator Missen's remarks. I must reply to Senator Missen's spurious arguments and his attempt to mislead the Senate and the public again. The Bills to which we are seeking to append requests are not Supply Bills. They do not affect the survival of the Government or the process of government. The only effect on the fiscal outcome, the final Budget outcome, would be to reduce the domestic surplus from $1,500m to $1,000m. In so doing they would also stimulate economic activity, the need for which is already becoming apparent and will become progressively more apparent as the year goes on. A close analogy to the rejection of all of these Bills is, of course, the situation involving the Medibank levy of 1974. In both cases-the Medibank levy and the whole package of Bills we are debating tonight-the Bills in question are Bills to raise revenue. There is this important exception: The Senate of 1974, dominated by the Liberal and National Country parties, stopped the government of the day from keeping its pre-election promises. What this request and the other action which will be taken on these Bills seek to do is to stop the Fraser Government from breaking its election promises. I also add in reply to another of Senator Missen's spurious arguments-strictly applied to these Bills only; that the passage is being held up and that that is important-the Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1A to 9A) do not become operative until 1 January 1982. That argument is even more spurious than the rest of the arguments he used.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very brief. I just indicate that I will be supporting the request proposed by Senator Haines. In respect of the proposed new section I direct the attention of the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) to the difficulty that could possibly arise were the proposal by the Government to be carried ultimately by the Parliament. Its proposal appears to cover newspapers. I am wondering what the situation is relating to free newspapers. There are quite a number of these throughout Australia and they are, of course, run by virtue of the advertisements in them. We could well have an interesting situation in which the daily newspapers, in fact, attract the 2 1/2 per cent sales tax as envisaged by the amendments proposed by the Government but the free newspapers-these newspapers are growing in popularity-are not affected. I just raise that question with the Minister for Finance, who is at the table, to ascertain how she responds to it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Furthermore, what is the definition of a newspaper as against, say, a catalogue? Would catalogues be subject to the new sales tax? What of the newspapers which are sent out to members of clubs and so on? Would they be covered by the proposed tax or would they not? I re-emphasise my position in respect of this matter: I oppose the imposition of this tax, small though it may be-2 1/2 per cent in the initial stages. But who is to say that in future years, once this precedent has been established, this may not be used as a weapon by a dictatorial government to suppress the freedom of the Press? I think that is a matter which should surely receive the consideration of the Committee and should surely influence honourable senators to vote for the request outlined by Senator Haines. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I point out to the Committee that the Opposition and the Australian Democrats are talking about opposing money Bills. No matter what they say, they are talking about opposing money Bills but they say they are not blocking Supply. I think it is about time they cut out this hypocrisy. They should openly admit that all the nonsense they have spoken since 1975 about whether the Senate has the power to oppose money Bills has been absolute hypocrisy. They have been mouthing shibboleths since 1976. I see Senator Evans making notes for more shibboleths. Of course, now they have the numbers. Now we are going to find out what they really think about whether the Senate has the power to block Supply. Why do they not come out and admit it?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us have a look at what they have said. Senator Button wrote to the Age about something which had never been heard of before. He said that this was a decision which did not threaten the Government's capacity to govern. What relevance has that to whether or not this is a money Bill? Senator Evans, in a personal explanation to the Senate, said the same sort of thing-that it is all right to oppose a money Bill so long as it does not prevent the Government from having the capacity to govern. My friend Senator Missen said to me that the situation is somewhat like the Chinese torture trick whereby we continue to cut off little bits of the person and when he drops dead we say: 'We did not mean him to drop dead. We were just applying a little bit of torture'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, just requesting him to die. These people lecture us with hypocrisy. They come into this chamber and mouth all these words which really mean nothing. The greatest power that this Senate has is the power to withhold Supply. Of course, since 1975 members of the Australian Labor Party and members of the Australian Democrats, since that party was formed, have tried to say that the Senate ought not to block Supply. Why do they not admit openly that, of course, the Senate has the power to block Supply? I hope that it is never exercised except at a time when the Senate itself goes to the people. It would be wrong and improper of the Senate to force the House of Representatives to an election without going to an election itself. Apart from that, of course the Senate has power to block Supply and it has always had power to block Supply. Those on the other side of the chamber have voted consistently against money Bills.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, I raise a point of order. I draw your attention to the fact that, fascinating as Senator Lewis's argument undoubtedly is, he is not addressing his argument to the particular clause of the Bill, which is appropriate for the Committee stage. Rather, he is making second reading stage points which we have heard a thousand times before and are not really in the business of listening to again at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Chairman. I have just about finished. I have told the Opposition precisely what it is doing. Obviously it has hurt, and no doubt in a few moments we will hear from Senator Evans some more hypocritical remarks about what the Senate can and cannot do. We have read his articles. He has beeen writing articles about the Senate's power since before he came into the Senate. Now he is saying that the Senate ought not to block Supply and that this is not really blocking Supply, it is just a request to cut off some of the Government's income. If that is not blocking Supply then I do not know what is, and neither do the people of Australia. It is about time the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats, with all due respect to the Democrats, stood up and said: 'Yes, certainly the Senate has power to block Supply'. When they do block Supply it will be up to them to face the people of Australia and explain why they did so. They have started it now. Why do they not stand up now and say that they have the power to block Supply? When they take this Government to the people, we will find out. They will have to justify their decision to force the Government to the people.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think there is only one person in this Committee whose thickheadedness and obduracy I find at the moment more difficult to endure than that of the Australian Democrats. I refer to Senator Lewis, who has just sat down. We have heard the argument before, we have dealt with it before, so I will not tire the Committee by dealing with it again. I refer Senator Lewis to the arguments set out in elaborate detail as to why this is not the kind of exercise he was talking about which is on page 569 of the Senate Hansard of 9 September. I will say no more about that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I did not rise to get into the substantive debate, other than to say in one sentence that I fully endorse all that has been said in favour of these requests by every speaker on this side of the chamber so far. The arguments speak for themselves and deserve the support of this Senate. I rose only for one purpose, and that is to make a mild procedural protest at the course the Australian Democrats have chosen to take on these Bills, Nos 1A to 9A. It seems that they are, as they are technically entitled to do, insisting upon raising by way of separate amendment and separate speeches, it seems on every last one of them, every single one of the items of necessity upon which they have chosen to make their Custer's last stand of principle. We have had books and we will have clothes, footwear, newspapers, wrapping materials, and no doubt we will have building materials for private dwellings. They are all admirable causes and we would be delighted to hear one catch-all speech from each one of them, if that were humanly possible, explaining and articulating the admirable position which they have on these matters, and which we share with them. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality of the matter is that they are not doing it in that way because they desire to drain every last ounce out of the particular procedure the Senate is involved in tonight. They know it is the only way they have, in the eyes of anybody, of achieving any credibility at all. As we all know, the reality of the matter is that on this issue of the Sales Tax Bills the Democrats have adopted more different positions over the last few weeks than the ferris wheel at the Melbourne showgrounds. It has been absolutely impossible to follow the flip-flop course they have carved out for themselves, if that is an appropriate description, as they have wandered from one Neanderthal, naive, incompetent position to another. It is absolutely beyond the bounds of tolerance for I think everyone in the Senate to have to put up with this nonsense any longer, although it seems we will have to put up with it longer if we are to get through these Bills tonight in order to be able to debate other substantial legislation which needs to be resolved this week. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply ask the Democrats, in a spirit of friendliness and co-operation, not to stretch any further than they strictly have to, the tolerance and understanding of the Committee, to confine their remarks to the particular matters briefly that we know that they feel strongly about-that we all on this side of the chamber feel strongly about-and then allow us to get on with the business of showing just how unprincipled and hopeless they are in the other remaining Bill to do with sales tax that we are due to deal with tonight. </PARA>

<PARA>In speaking to this request, I will make one or two points in answer to matters raised by Senator Evans and Senator Lewis. I remind Senator Evans that, however obdurate he seems to think we are, we are not sufficiently obdurate to have moved 63 of these amendments. We took into consideration the fact that Opposition members may not have quite the stamina that we have and therefore we did not extend it to quite that extent. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1H4">Senator HAINES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I heartily endorse that comment from my colleague Senator Mason. As far as the oddities expressed by Senator Lewis are concerned, I can only say that they were nothing if not redolent of an extreme case of fright at the possible pressure that these requests will put on the House of Representatives. This request aims to exempt newspapers from the 2 1/2 per cent sales tax. While I can understand, given the furore that has gone on over some columnists' rather forthright statements in the last couple of weeks, that some Government members would like to see some newspapers taxed out of existence, I consider this to be a rather devious way of applying that form of censorship. On a more specific note, however, I am concerned at the effect that this is likely to have on ethnic newspapers. I again refer to the letter from Vistula (SA) Pty Ltd which, as far as the tax on newspapers is concerned, states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This tax will have a very damaging effect on Australia's ethnic publishers and their distributors. As a result of Government policies, we have already had to face increases in general postage rates, increases in category 'B' postage rates, and increases in telephone and telecommunication charges. While the Government spends tens of millions of dollars on ethnic radio and television, it pays little attention to the ethnic press in Australia. This is a gross injustice and a strong discrimination against the ethnic press. </PARA>
<PARA>The last paragraph states:</PARA>
<PARA> The ethnic press is a vital communications source for many Australians, and we are certain the Government has not considered the effect of the introduction of sales tax on ethnic newspapers, magazines and books. </PARA>
<PARA>Because we, too, share the feeling of this group of people that the Government has not sufficiently considered the effects of its legislation, we are taking the steps that we are taking here to request the House of Representatives to make these amendments. These remarks endorse the matters raised by Senator Harradine about the whole problem of the proliferation of minor and free newspapers around the country. Unfortunately Senator Lewis has left the chamber, but I make the further point that these taxes will not come into effect until 1 January. How Senator Lewis can see a request for the House to amend something which does not come into effect until 1 January as a blocking move I do not know. I can only assume he does not know either what day it is or what month it is or that he is as bad at mathematics as he apparently is at English. </PARA>

<PARA>The intention of this amendment is to make exempt from the proposed 2 1/2 per cent sales tax building materials used in private dwellings. I refer briefly to one of a number of letters which I have received, and which I am sure other honourable senators have received, from organisations involved with the housing industry. The letter points out that this sales tax is likely to increase the cost of a private dwelling by anything up to $500. The point is made that the tax is completely unjustified and will add a minimum of $500 to the cost of any new home without any offsetting increase in the Government subsidy to first home purchasers. </PARA>
<PARA> I should not have to remind the Senate that on the second day of this parliamentary session I took steps to bring forward a Bill that would give some form of subsidy to first home purchasers. However, the Government is not inclined to lean our way on that proposal. Instead it is intent on increasing the cost of homes by $500, an amount which most struggling couples will not be able to accumulate. Therefore, the acquisition of a home will become even more difficult for a large number of Australians. I understand that the Opposition is intending, through Senator Walsh, to move an amendment to extend our amendment beyond building materials used in private dwellings. Quite frankly, since we have no great desire to cut the costs for multinational companies and so on which throw up office buildings in gay abandon in various cities around Australia, the Australian Democrats will not be supporting the Opposition's extension amendment to our amendment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to this matter because the Australian Democrats regard it as perhaps one of the most iniquitous of all of these impositions that the Government is trying to visit on a long suffering community. The point has been put that it is perfectly all right to add between $500 and $1,000 to the cost of a new house. We have to remember that, by the time people have paid off their mortgages, that $500 to $1,000 will probably add at least another $4,000 or $5,000 to the cost of a house because of the multiplier effect of heavy interest rates over a period. This will drag down a family into an even more advanced old age before it can even say that it owns its own home. It will make it even more impossible for young people who are trying to build or buy a house and who are already being seriously disadvantaged-I would like to put it in a much more rude way, Mr Chairman, but I will not do so because of my respect for the Chair-by the increasing rates of interest in this country, which the Government has thrown up its hands at and which it has said that it does not care about any further. I feel very strongly about this iniquitous, stupid, senseless tax on building materials. I appeal through you, Mr Chairman, to as many Australians as possible to go to their Liberal members of parliament and tell them they are doing something which is absolutely unacceptable, against any justice, reason or sense and which is actively damaging to the family life of this society.</PARA></TALK.START>

I deny it absolutely. I will refer to the more rational points he attempted to make at the beginning of his speech. He said that very big organisations might be put off by the fact that our amendment covers only building materials for dwellings. Very many major organisations and developers are concerned with the building of dwellings. In fact, they are far more concerned with dwellings than with anything else. That answers Senator Keeffe's first point adequately. We are concerned about multinationals and people of that kind who might want to come in and throw up a factory. We do not see any reason why sales tax should be taken from them and replaced from some battler's income tax.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> Page 2, clause 3, proposed new section 5, sub-section (2), paragraph (a), after ''120'' insert ''(except goods covered by that item which are clothing and footwear)''. </PARA>
<PARA>The intention of this proposed amendment is to remove the 2 1/2 per cent proposed sales tax on clothing and footwear. As far as I am concerned this is the worst of the sales tax amendments because it taxes something that people cannot legally be without. It goes beyond the point that Senator Harradine raised in his speech at the second reading stage. It may be interesting that Scotsmen's sporrans and barrister's wigs are being taxed; it is of more consequence to me that things which we have to wear-from babies nappies through to anybody else's knickers and outside clothing, at the risk of being thrown in gaol if we do not-are now to be taxed. I feel that this is one of the most contemptible of the Government's proposed tax measures and we oppose it entirely. </PARA>

<PARA>I am sure the Committee will be pleased to know that this is the final request that we will move. It is purely a machinery measure. It is consequential to those motions which have already been agreed to. I would like to make the point that the reason we elected to move motions in respect of each of the items covered in our requests independently one from the other is to make it perfectly clear what we are opposed to. In fact, they are the necessities of life, the items do not go beyond that. They refer to the things which the United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights asserts are the rights of all people including Australians under a Liberal Government-clothing, footwear--</PARA>

<PARA>This amendment would add a new section 38A to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill making a series of amendments to the First Schedule of the parent Act. The amendment which has been circulated is intended to be, as it were, the second leg of the double, the first leg of which was the series of requests which we have just passed. The subject matter of this amendment is directed at exactly the same result which the Australian Democrats have shown that they hold dear, namely, the exemption from sales tax of books, newspapers, wrapping materials, clothing, footwear and building materials for private dwellings. Whereas the requests to Sales Tax Amendment Bills (Nos 1A-9A) were designed to exempt these items by removing them from the ambit of the sales tax Bills, this amendment achieves the same result in a different way by removing them from the ambit of the sales tax Bills by way of redefining the content of the items referred to in those sales tax Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal that has been put to the Senate is in fact a development of a suggestion originally made in passing by Senator Harradine in his original widely circulated letter arguing for a split in the sales tax Bills so as to enable questions relating to exemptions and classifications to be dealt with separately. The proposal, if I may illustrate briefly with one example what I mean, runs something like this: In clause 5 of the sales tax Bills there is a reference to items in Schedule 1 of the exemptions and classifications Bill in respect of which the new tax imposed by Bills 1A-9A will bite. One such example of a Schedule item is item 54 which refers to 'newspapers'. What this amendment proposes in relation to that item is to take item 54 but to delete from item 54 the reference to the word 'newspapers'. That is to take it out of 54-to denude 54, as it were, of any content at all-and then to reinsert the subject matter, 'newspapers', in the First Schedule as in this case, new item 155. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason for this peculiar sounding exercise, which is technically complex on the face of it, is really quite simple although not all that simple at 10 minutes to midnight, I readily acknowledge. The object of the exercise is, by a different route, to accomplish the same result, I readily acknowledge, as has begun to be accomplished by the requests we previously passed. In this case it is getting there by reshaping the content of the particular schedule items. In the case of the sales tax Bill requests, it was getting there by removing those items themselves from the bite of the taxation there imposed. </PARA>
<PARA> What is to be said against these amendments? In the first place, I suppose it might be suggested that it is not technically within the competence of the Senate to amend, as distinct from requesting amendments of, the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill at all. This is a point that I would not have thought would be made tonight had I not heard the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) making much of it in the context of his earlier remarks in relation to Senator Harradine's motion. He did so notwithstanding the very long practice of this Senate, which dates back to at least 1960 and is the subject of a paragraph in Odgers, at page 390 of the current edition, explaining its basis. The Attorney-General made the point, the relevance of which, it must be acknowledged, did not quite seem to appreciate in the context of the present Bill, that the exemptions and classifications measure might properly be regarded as a money Bill to the extent that, whatever its form, it does in practice achieve the result, when one shuffles items in and out of the schedules, of determining the imposition of taxation. That is a fair point legally to make about the character of that Bill and I must confess that I have always been somewhat puzzled by the ready and apparently universal acceptance of exemptions and classifications Bills as being non-money Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge the force of that point and if anyone on either side of the chamber wants to insist upon it I indicate that the Opposition is perfectly happy to move exactly the same amendment in the form of a request or, if one wants to cover all possible contingencies and give Mr Odgers or his successors something to write about in the next edition, maybe one could move the amendment both technically in that form and also, in the alternative, in the form of a request to the House of Representatives. So let us not be deterred or deflected from the substantive issue before us by procedural questions of this kind. </PARA>

Therefore, I do not retract a thing but, once again, in a spirit of co-operation and friendliness I am nonetheless prepared to indicate to the honourable senator that if he does insist upon that particular view of these particular money Bills, or if Senator Durack, armed as he is with the enormously grave, influential and persuasive opinion of the Solicitor-General on this subject, insists on the view of these amendments, I will be perfectly happy, not wishing to prolong a messy procedural debate any more than necessary, to move the amendments in question in the form of requests, if the clerks can exercise themselves to tell me how this can be done in the alternative at this late stage.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am doing remarkably well without Senator Mason's help. It is true that technically speaking, as I have acknowledged from day one of this debate and day one of these endlessly prolonged and nauseating negotiations I have been conducting with the Democrats, the amendments are unnecessary. If the requests in question are accepted by the House of Representatives this amendment is not, technically speaking, needed. I know that it took Senator Mason an awfully long time to appreciate these technical points. I understand that he has now grasped them. I understand that he appreciates that there is a duplication involved. I understand that point; I acknowledge it; I accept it. But the real question is whether these amendments will be accepted across the other side of King's Hall. It may be that the Government needs just a little bit more incentive to enable it to accept the amendments than it is being given at the moment, particularly, of course, in the context of requests which are accompanied in an approach to bargaining, the only comparison of which I can think is the approach of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Treasurer (Mr Howard) in the conduct of Loan Council negotiations, an approach to bargaining in which the whole hand is displayed in advance. The Democrats' hand in this matter is one which says that ultimately, at the end of this particular path, the result is capitulation. Be that as it may, there is an extra incentive, even with that approach, which can be adopted in these matters and the extra incentive is to add another tract to the form of pressure that is being imposed upon the Government in the House of Representatives by the course of action I am proposing with this amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The anomalies Bill as it has been summarised, the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill, is not, in itself, an especially attractive piece of legislation as it presently stands, for reasons which Senator Walsh has articulated at the second reading stage and which he will spell out in more detail in the Committee stage when we move our series of amendments relating to Kit Kats, insecticides, windscreen wipers, safety belts, safety equipment, pet food and miscellaneous other matters of considerable importance, either to the pockets of the people of this nation or to the viability of significant size commercial enterprises. That is the basis of those amendments. We will get to that later. But the point, of course, about seeking to add these amendments--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has been hard enough trying to explain it to the Democrats. I will quite cheerfully add Senator Lewis to my tutorial class in the future if he promises to behave himself better than my other pupils have so far. But the incentive that we propose is the passage of the amendments that are proposed to this particular anomalies Bill, to attach these amendments which on the face of it are, at the moment anyway, unacceptable to the Government and to pose the Government across Kings Hall with a real problem, a problem not just confronting it so far as the sales tax Bills themselves are concerned, but a problem now added to insofar as its anomalies Bill is concerned. It is a problem which has revenue implications of $107m this year and $142m in a full year. I point out to Senator Lewis that that is not exactly enough to bring down the Government but, notwithstanding that, sufficient to cause it quite considerable embarrassment, particularly since these taxes, unlike the sales tax 1A to 9A changes, are operative from 19 August 1981. As Senator Jessop has so lucidly and capably explained to the nation, there are very real problems associated with the way in which this tax has been imposed, which we all know about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point is that what is necessary and what will be accomplished by these amendments is something which will concentrate the mind of the Government a little bit more carefully on its responsibilities than that mind is concentrated at the moment. As honourable senators will be well aware, Dr Johnson said:</PARA>
<PARA> Depend upon it, Sir, when a man knows he is to be hanged in a fortnight, it concentrates his mind wonderfully. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe that the Government's mind will be concentrated if the Democrats are able to screw their courage to the sticking-place and support this amendment. If they do not support it-regrettably its passage depends upon the support of this group in the Parliament-as they said they would just seven days ago, they will have lost any remaining shred of credibility that they have as a party in this country. They will continue on the downward electoral path which they so spectacularly embarked upon in the New South Wales election. One more change of heart of that kind will produce a situation of absolutely staggering incredulity on the part of the electorate. </PARA>
<PARA> This amendment, with all the things going for it that I have described, represents the first real chance that the Australian Democrats have had in the context of this legislation or in their time together in this Parliament 'to keep the bastards honest', to use their own overworked phrase. When the first opportunity arises to really do that, to really put the squeeze on the Government, to really ensure that the people they are concerned about will be protected and to really ensure that the sales taxes they are concerned about will be removed, what happens? They run for cover. It is not too late for them to reclaim something of their tattered reputation if they choose to take advantage of the opportunity that the Australian Labor Party, with the generosity for which the Australian Democrats no doubt will be grateful, has provided for them. We have provided them with a further opportunity, an opportunity the merits of which they accepted previously. It is an amendment that has been carefully designed, carefully tailored, to cope with every neurosis, every point of constitutional principle, every expression of concern for interest groups in the community. Every single point the Australian Democrats have been worried about we have set up and accommodated in the form of this amendment. There is no conceivable rational basis on which they can refuse to add an extra layer of leverage to the position they have taken with their earlier amendments. We have given them this opportunity. We will wait with fascination to see whether they take advantage of it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. We have no worries whatsoever about this Bill. This is a Bill which could be amended by this chamber. I suggest to Senator Evans that on our advice, a request cannot be made on this Bill. We understand that if a Bill can be amended by the Senate a request cannot be made in respect of it. That might be something that can be changed; I do not know.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let us get back to the Australian Labor Party's amendment. I suppose I should do that at this stage and put Senator Evans out of his misery. The Labor Party's motivations for moving its amendment to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill seem to the Australian Democrats obscure, to say the least. They become more so as time passes. At one time, prior to Wednesday, 16 September, the Labor Party was putting the view that the more separate initiatives that were made against the proposed new sales tax measures to be introduced on 1 January the better. As a result, it framed the amendment now before us, which Senator Evans has just described. That amendment appears to support the Democrats' requests concerning the basic Bills which were passed earlier today. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that this amendment does not strengthen the Democrat's position; it duplicates the Democrats' earlier requests to the extent that, as has been conceded, most of the wording is identical. It is not complementary, it is not necessary to the requests; it is merely a duplication of them. Yet, of course, prior to last Wednesday, 16 September, the Labor Party was putting the view that the more separate initiatives that were made against the proposed new sales tax measures to be introduced the better. On the night of 16 September the Labor Party changed its position dramatically. In that regard I quote directly the Hansard record of Senator Walsh's comments on why the Labor Party would not support the amendment I moved to the motion for the second reading of the sales tax Bills that night. Of course, that Democrat amendment was virtually identical to that which we moved today in the Committee stage. It would have been a reinforcement, indeed, to our Committee requests. In announcing a dramatic change in the Australian Labor Party viewpoint Senator Walsh said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . this amendment is completely superfluous insofar as opportunities to achieve precisely the same objectives will arise in the Committee stage when more specific amendments are, I understand, to be moved by the Australian Democrats and will be supported by the Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA>Indeed they were. I thank the Labor Party for so doing. It has shown its sincerity to that extent. This about face by Senator Walsh was followed by the ALP vote with the Government against our amendment. The honourable senator expressed then a view with which we must sympathise. The basic point that will motivate the Australian Democrats in voting against this amendment is that such duplication would be, indeed, not only senseless but actually counter-productive. I think it is important to examine why it is counter-productive in the light of what Senator Evans has said. There is no difference, other than a semantic one, between a request amendment and any other kind. I think Senator Evans has at long last conceded, in spite of his comment reported in yesterday's Sydney Morning Herald, that requests equally with amendments can be sent back to the House of Representatives again and again, as Senator Siddons has said and as we have decided. It becomes merely a matter of semantics. </PARA>
<PARA> As a constitutional lawyer Senator Evans knows very well, of course, that the words 'request' and 'amendment' do not do more in this context than really define the nature of the two types of Bills in constitutional terms. We would have thought that he would be more honest about this in his discussions with the Press. </PARA>

Senator Evans somehow got the poor gullible Australian Associated Press to swallow that from him. There is no way that these amendments can inject any further muscle into anything. If an analogy is, indeed, needed in this matter the Labor amendment represents blind flailing about with an unwieldly club. This is about what it amounts to. On the other hand our requests are using a good, sharply pointed sword to point exactly in the right direction. Why? Because we are requesting changes to a taxing Bill. I assure the House that that would be the most easily understood and most comprehensible way to proceed. I know the Labor Party agrees with that because it supported our requests.

The first effect would be that the public and the interest groups concerned, instead of having a clear, distinct, single action behind which they could rally, would be confused by a smokescreen of obscure and unnecessary duplications.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Evans, at the beginning of his speech, admitted this was a very difficult matter to understand, especially at 10 past 12 in the morning. There I think we have the first very valid point. We are dealing with a huge public reaction against these Bills. We do not want to confuse the public. We want to give it something real to come behind. The Government in a very real sense could have been got off the hook if it had been given the chance to dissimulate, delay and energetically cloud what the Labor Party had been proposing. We understand that if the request and the Labor Party's amendment went back at the same time the Government could choose which one it would deal with first. It could deal with the Labor Party's one first and it could play with it for years. </PARA>
<PARA> The position is quite clear; the Democrats requests will go to the House of Representatives. If the House of Representatives sends them back summarily without proper consideration and discussion then, with the concurrence of the Labor Party, those requests will be returned to the House of Representatives. This will give the chance of very full public input which will proceed over the next weeks and months. I assure the Government that what it has seen so far is only the very beginning. Certainly, the whole efforts of our organisation will be behind this protest. We are only a very small part of it. I believe that the whole efforts of the Labor Party will be behind it. </PARA>
<PARA> We think it is right and proper that the Government should be made to understand that it is doing something which is against the public interest, which is against the public inclination and which is an evil and a wrong precedent which should never have been thought of in the first place. It is not too late for the Government to withdraw with dignity and to concede that it has made a mistake. In the interests of the people it should withdraw these proposals. If it did so its stature would immediately increase. It would be regarded by the Australian people as a wide and prudent government. I am sure that is what we all want for it. We do not want elections or anything like that. We just want these provisions taken out of the sales tax law. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I believe we have reached a watershed in the consideration of this proposal. I am afraid, from what I have heard of this debate, that the amendments proposed by Senator Evans will be defeated tonight and with it the opportunity in effect to crush the attempt by the Government to impose sales tax on already exempted items. I refer to my letter to leaders of political parties-the Government, the Australian Labor Party and the Australian Democrats-in which I adverted to my proposal to divide the Bills. After outlining the value of that proposal as I see it I said this:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suggest also that the same objectives may be achieved through certain amendments to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill now before the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>I felt at that time that this could be regarded by the Government as a warning that in the final analysis when we came to the exemptions and classifications Bill, the Senate could exercise its rightful authority to do what it has been able to do since 1935, and that is to amend the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act. It was 1935 when, I understand, the first Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Bill was presented to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard a speech from Senator Evans and we have heard the response from Senator Mason. Senator Mason's response, as I understand him, was really to the effect that the Democrats could not at this stage support amendments to the exemptions and classifications Bill for two reasons. One is that if the requests to the 1A to 9A group of Bills went back to the House of Representatives along with amendments or requests to the exemptions and classifications Bill, the House of Representatives could play tactics and deal with the latter Bill first. For some reason which I could not quite follow, the Democrats believed that this would divert attention to the requests that this Senate has already made. The other and probably more legitimate point that was made by Senator Mason was that the Democrats at this stage could not support the proposition by reason of the fact that it was really putting a double barrel, although those were not the words he used, at the House of Representatives. I can see that point. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is true. If we want to provide the House of Representatives with the opportunity we are able to do this by the requests made to the 1A to 9A group of Bills. My concern at present is that the Labor Party has flagged its doubt about the proposal that I intend to put forward if the requests made to the 1A to 9A group of Bills are not acceded to by the House of Representatives and the Bill is returned to the Senate; in other words, the procedural motion that I have foreshadowed and I will seek leave to reinstate a notice of motion after all this is over. I do not consider there is any doubt about that. Nevertheless, because of some hangups I believe some people in the Labor Party have about the power of this Senate, there appears to be some doubt about that. However, as I understand it, there is no doubt in the minds of members of the Labor Party about the ultimate use of amendments to the exemptions and classifications Bill to achieve what we all want to achieve. But I believe that if we proceed to that question tonight, that proposal will be defeated and we will not have that opportunity again because the exemptions and classifications Bill will have been carried by the Senate and the Government will be laughing all the way to the bank. Under those circumstances, in light of what has been said by the Democrats and in light of what has been said by Senator Evans about the propriety or otherwise of the proposed amendments to the exemptions and classifications Bill and whether it would be more appropriate to have requests to that Bill, I believe it would be appropriate at this stage for me to move:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will explain for the record the course of events which has just occurred, which might otherwise defy explanation-other than by virtue of the fact that it is late at night. The situation, in brief, is that in the course of the debate, Senator Harradine, in rather impromptu style and without letting anyone know what he was proposing to do, moved that progress be reported. This was a position which the Australian Labor Party was unable, as a party, formally to support at this stage because there was some uncertainty, among other things, as to what agreement had, in fact, been reached with the Government, in fairness in the conduct of its business, as to what our attitude would be to any such motion depending on the circumstances in which it was moved. So under those circumstances it was not possible, without consultation, to reach a quick decision as to what should be done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The division which we found ourselves caught up in was called by Senator Harradine and the Australian Democrats, not by anyone on the Labor side. Bearing in mind that a motion to report progress could be moved again later, and there being some doubt about what the proper course might be, the view was taken that the division should be called off at that stage and, if necessary, a further motion to report progress be moved at some later stage this evening after there had, in fact, been a vote on the amendment that I had moved. But it was by then too late to call off the division, and confusion resulted. That was the situation. I fel sorry for those honourable senators coming into the chamber because it was, no doubt, very difficult to appreciate what was going on. Thank you for the indulgence, Mr Chairman. I hope that in the light of that explanation there will be some better appreciation on the part of honourable senators as to what, on the face of it, was something of a charade. But maybe we can now proceed to conclude the debate on the amendment and proceed to a vote on it after that debate is concluded. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Presumably we are returning to debate the motion moved by Senator Evans in relation to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill. The Government is opposed to the amendment for various reasons that have already been stated in this debate by Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, who is in charge of the Bill. I do not propose to go into that. I want to deal with the one point, which is the constitutional question of whether or not this is an amendable Bill. Senator Evans seems to be in some doubt as to whether he ought to have moved an amendment or a request. I think that uncertainty on the part of Senator Evans, and presumably the Australian Labor Party, is well founded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> However, a distinction of long standing has been accepted in this Senate between a Bill directly imposing taxation and a law which deals with the imposition of taxation. As I have said, traditionally the exemptions and classifications legislation has been treated as being in the second category and not as legislation which actually imposes taxation. I believe that is a very dubious attitude. In fact, as I said in the argument I presented to the Senate earlier this evening, it is probably not the better legal view. However it has been treated for many years in the way I have mentioned. The argument I advanced to the Senate earlier was of a rather different kind, namely, that the Government is entitled if it so wishes to combine the sales tax Bill and the exemptions and classifications Bill. That is perfectly constitutionally valid. Nevertheless, I think a very strong argument can be put forward that the exemptions and classifications Bill is also a Bill which imposes taxation and that really no logical distinction has been drawn in the past between these two classes of money Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government opposes this amendment in substance and trusts that it will be defeated, for whatever reason honourable senators see fit. I want to make it quite clear that the Government does not agree that, in point of strict law, this is an amendable Bill. </PARA>

<PARA>If any senator feels that he or she could support any one of those amendments but is unwilling to support the lot then, of course, he or she had the option of denying leave for them to be considered and put concurrently. For example, it is quite conceivable that some honourable senators might take very different views about the 17 1/2 per cent sales tax on pet food and the imposition of a similar tax on helmets used for safety reasons in sporting contests. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not intend to speak very long but for the record I should explain precisely the effect of the amendments which I have moved. The first one would exempt from sales tax cathode-ray tubes which are used in television sets and exempt that component of an assembled television set attributable to the cathode-ray tube. If the Government's Bill were passed unamended, the price of a normal television set would be increased by $80. The second amendment would continue the present exemption of sales tax for seat belts in motor vehicles. The third amendment would continue the present exemption of sales tax for pet food whereas the Government proposition would impose a tax of 17 1/2 per cent. One wonders what compassion, if any, this Government has when it seeks to impose a tax of that magnitude on food for pets which are very often the only companion which a number of people, particularly elderly people on social welfare benefits, have. The fourth amendment would continue the exempt status for glace, crystallised and drained fruit. The fifth amendment relates to certain types of near confectionary products which are extensively purchased by children. The sixth amendment relates to safety equipment used in sporting contests. </PARA>

Finally, the eighth amendment would continue the exemption on insecticides. I again want to put on record that this is an opportunity for all senators who claim to dissent from government policy on this question to do something effective about it-to exercise their vote to amend these Bills in a way which is most effective. Indeed, it is the next most effective method of expressing opposition to that which the Opposition preferred and consistently pursued, that is, that all of these Bills should have been entirely rejected at the second reading stage.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> 1. Page 1, after clause 5, insert the following new clause: ''Application</PARA>
<PARA> ''6. The amendments of items 119 and 119A in the First Schedule to the Principal Act made by this Act do not apply for the purpose of the application of the Sales Tax Act (No. 5) 1930 in respect of goods imported into Australia on or after 19 August 1981 by a taxpayer who purchased the goods before that date.''. </PARA>
<PARA>In the second reading debate the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) replied to my concerns at the way in which industry was expected to respond immediately to sales tax changes and at what I regard to be the retrospective nature of the proposed sales tax increases. She stated:</PARA>
<PARA> I must say that the Bills to come into effect upon 19 August are not only in accord with the traditional practice for sales tax rates and classification changes but also comply with the procedure adopted by Government when making amendments to the income tax law. </PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators will recall that in a letter which I incorporated in Hansard last week, the Treasurer (Mr Howard), detailed at great length sales tax changes over the last 20 years. Despite the statements by the Minister for Finance, I am not satisfied or convinced that past practices are necessarily relevant or applicable to modern business practices followed today. The traditional Government practices referred to by the Minister require business and industries to respond overnight to sales tax changes. Such responses require the scrapping of existing invoices which detail recommended retail prices and require the reprogramming of computers which are used by many businesses today to produce their invoices. These two changes are both expensive and time consuming. Even the Minister recognised that confusion resulted from sales tax changes, when she stated:</PARA>
<PARA> When major changes are made to a law such as the sales tax law, it is inevitable that some confusion will arise . . . The Government recognises that changes such as those announced will bring temporary dislocation while businesses alter systems to adjust for the changes. </PARA>
<PARA>I remind the Minister that such temporary dislocation is quite costly. She went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> That is an inevitable but traditional feature of the sales tax system. </PARA>
<PARA>It is an inevitable and traditional feature of sales tax changes because the Government has chosen to follow practices used for the last 50 years in implementing these changes. Fifty years ago business practices were quite different from what they are today and a great deal less complex. I hope that the Government will soon recognise that point. I will quote from an article that appeared in the Adelaide Advertiser on 22 August. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The S.A. Chamber of Commerce and Industry yesterday urged the Federal Government to delay the introduction of the increased sales tax announced in the Budget until January 1. </PARA>
<PARA> The Chamber's general manager, Mr A. C. Schrape, said if the Government could not delay the tax introduction, it should consider introducing the tax progressively. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision to introduce a sales tax of 17 1/2 % on 20 previously exempt items, and to increase the rate from zero to 30 % on one item, was causing confusion in the business community . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Mr. Schrape said that the chamber agreed the sales tax increases on the 21 items were justified on equity grounds but it condemned the heavy-handed manner in which they had been introduced. </PARA>
<PARA>Such is the concern, confusion and dislocation that the changes have caused. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard three letters. The first is a letter I wrote to the Treasurer following the receipt of a letter that I incorporated last week; the second is the Treasurer's reply; and the third is a letter which I have received from a Sydney sales tax discussion group which illustrates several other examples of losses that are incurred due to the lack of transition provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The letters read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>10 September 1981</PARA>
<PARA>Hon. John Howard, MP</PARA>
<PARA>Treasurer,</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House,</PARA>
<PARA>Canberra, ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>My dear Treasurer, I refer to your letter of 26 August 1981 concerning the current changes to the rates of sales tax applying to goods in Australia. I would like to comment on two matters contained in that letter. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, I am concerned about an apparent contradication contained in your letter and in some of your public statements relating to the date from which the increased rates take effect. You wrote at length of the past history of sales tax changes which came into effect from the night of the Budget statement. </PARA>
<PARA> Your reasoning for this was:</PARA>
<PARA> '. . . so that market forces operate as normally as possible both before and after an announcement concerning increases and decreases in rates of sales tax. You will appreciate that there would be little chance of market forces operating normally if taxpayers were forewarned of pending increases or decreases in rates of sales tax'. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet later in your letter, you refer to a different approach being taken in relation to the Government's decision to tax a wide range of presently exempt goods from the 1 January 1982. The delay in the introduction of these changes was to allow time to notify manufacturers and wholesalers of the changes and to ensure that adequate administrative arrangements were made by your department and the taxpayers. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus, we have on one hand, wholesalers being given no notice of changes and being expected to effect administrative changes immediately, while on the other hand wholesalers are being given time to gear up for the changes. Again, you reason that forewarning of tax changes would lead to frantic buying-up of affected goods, yet on the other hand you are forewarning consumers of expected changes which, according to your own suggestion could result in a run on these items. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an element of inconsistency involved in your thinking on this matter and I would greatly appreciate any comments you may care to make to clarify this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point I would refer to is the postscript to your letter of 26 August 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> In that sentence you state that the law gives a wholesaler the authority to subsequently recover any sales tax increase from his customers, but that this would seem more inconvenient than charging now at the increased level. </PARA>
<PARA> You will recall that you added this in respect to a situation that I had recounted to you whereby some Adelaide retailers had refused to process invoices from wholesalers who added the new rates, until the legislation was passed by Parliament. Such a course by retailers could seriously jeopardise a wholesaler's cash flow for up to six weeks. </PARA>
<PARA> Given this situation, I do not believe that the course you have selected is a real possibility as it doesn't recognise my major concern of a hold up in cash flow. Whilst some larger wholesalers may be able to cope with such a disruption to their payment, it has the potential to force smaller wholesalers, operating on tighter budgets, to close. Such a situation should not be allowed to arise and immediate action should be taken to overcome this problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Further, I believe that the course you have suggested does not take into account how the retailer is expected to recover these increases from his customers. Again many small businesses are not able to absorb the sales tax increases and are forced to pass them on to their customers. </PARA>
<PARA> I would appreciate your urgent consideration of these two matters and your comments on them at your earliest convenience. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely, DONALD S. JESSOP Senator for South Australia</PARA>
<PARA>Treasurer Parliament House Canberra 2600 16 September 1981 Senator D. S. Jessop</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House</PARA>
<PARA>Canberra, ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator Jessop I refer to your letter of 10 September 1981 relating to the sales tax changes in which you raised two points following my letter of 26 August 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> The first point refers to the date of effect of the changes to correct anomalies and inconsistencies and the increased rates which apply from 19 August 1981. As I said, the changes were made along traditional lines and there are innumerable precedents for this course of action. </PARA>
<PARA> There are good reasons for this traditional approach. These reasons include protection of the revenue against hoarding and other special arrangements for movement of stock past the taxing point. There is also a question of maintaining equity in the market place. To illustrate the last point, a wholesaler with access to large stocks could, with forewarning, undercut his competitors in the market place quite seriously if he was able to move those stocks through the taxing point prior to an announced change of rate taking effect. </PARA>
<PARA> This traditional approach is evidenced in the sales tax area and also in the customs area. A similar approach has been taken by the Government in relation to ACT Stamp Duties. There are devices available to people to protect themselves against changes in these laws if the changes are preannounced. Not only does the use of such devices adversely affect the revenue but people who choose to use them gain an unfair advantage in the market over their competitors. </PARA>
<PARA> Notwithstanding this traditional approach and the reasons for it, the Government recognised that both industry and the Taxation Office would require time to implement the proposals regarding the broadening of the tax base to come into effect from 1 January 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> Those considerations lead the Government to depart from the traditional method of implementation. I might add that the proposed rate of tax at 2.5 per cent does not provide a great deal of scope for abuse or for unfair competition and when this is taken into account I think you will agree that there were sound reasons for departing from the traditional method. </PARA>
<PARA> For these reasons I do not agree that there is any inconsistency in the Government's approach on the Sales Tax Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> You also queried the postscript to my letter of 26 August 1981. The points made in that postscript were that the Taxation Office would not be seeking to impose a 'fine' because the old rates of tax are charged until the Bills pass into law and that the sales tax law provides authority for the tax, at the new rates, to be recovered when those new rates become law. </PARA>
<PARA> I fail to see how these points have anything to do with liquidity of businesses. Until such time as the Bills become law the Commissioner of Taxation cannot and will not be taking any action to enforce payment of the increased rates of sales tax and the tax to be imposed on previously exempt goods. </PARA>
<PARA> As to your claim that certain retailers are refusing to pay invoices which include the new rates of sales tax, they are, of course, under no obligation to pay the increased sales tax covered by the present Bills but their obligations are to be found in the contractual arrangements between the parties. That is a matter upon which I should not comment other than to say again that I do not see how the Government's proposals adversely affect the cash flow of businesses, given that there is no obligation to pay the increased tax until the Bills become law. </PARA>
<PARA> I should add that changes such as those proposed by the Government inevitably cause concern and require adjustments in the business world. The Government well recognises this and seeks to mitigate these factors as much as possible. However, if we are to change the tax mix so as to place less emphasis on income tax, then changes to the sales tax law are inevitable and will have to be made. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely (John Howard)</PARA>
<PARA>17 September 1981 Senator D. Jessop,</PARA>
<PARA>1 King William Street,</PARA>
<PARA>Adelaide, S.A. 3000</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator Jessop,</PARA>
<PARA>Sales Tax Amendments</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Reference is made to the telephone conversation between your Mr B. O'Farrell and Mr S. Bladwell, Chairman, Sydney Sales Tax Discussion Group. Mr Bladwell has asked me as a member of the Group to respond on the Group's behalf. </PARA>
<PARA> I have listed some specific examples of taxpayers who have incurred losses or who face losses which did not exist and could not be anticipated when they entered into contracts to purchase goods which are to become taxable as a result of the Treasurer's announcement. These losses would not have occurred if the amendments included transitional provisions. (these examples are attached as Appendix A). </PARA>
<PARA> I have also given a couple of more general, but typical, examples of problems which have arisen purely as a result of the briefness of the Treasurer's speech and accompanying notes. As you are aware the bills were not available until a week later and it became obvious once they were read that the actual amendments are far more wide-reaching than the Treasurer's speech indicated. (These examples are attached as Appendix B). </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from these problems there is another serious consequence caused by the retrospectivity of these amendments. From 19 August 1981 until the bills receive royal assent the existing legislation still stands. Accordingly taxpayers who 'cover' themselves by charging the higher sales tax rates (here I should mention that the Commissioner of Taxation is actively encouraging this course of action) are in breach of s. 70D Sales Tax Assessment Act (No. 1). This section prohibits persons from charging a greater amount of sales tax than that which they are liable to pay under the provisions of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Even those taxpayers whose products only increased 2 1/2 percentage points have been inconvenienced by the suddenness of the announcement. These people had no time in which to alter their computer programs and invoicing procedures. Other taxpayers had goods invoiced and orders assembled but which were held up because of the recent Transport Workers Union strike only to find that the company's sales tax liability in respect of such goods had generally increased. Considerable difficulty is being experienced in obtaining the increased sales tax from retailers. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope the above is sufficient for your needs, if however, you need more examples or more information of a technical nature please do not hestitate to contact me. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours faithfully,  A. J. FIRMSTONE</PARA>
<PARA>APPENDIX A</PARA>
<PARA> Some examples of losses incurred due to the lack of transition provisions:</PARA>
<PARA> A boat charter service purchased a new boat overseas prior to the amendments which under the then legislation qualified for sales tax exemption. However the boat did not reach Australia until 2 days after the Treasurer's Budget speech and under the proposed amendments the owner is liable for 17 1/2 per cent sales tax of approximately $100,000. </PARA>
<PARA> Another company entering the charter boat business has had a boat under construction since May 1981 but which is still not completed. This company has made progress payments equal to $150,000 and has another $200,000 to pay. The amendments mean the company has to find another $61,250 for sales tax or else abandon the project. </PARA>
<PARA> An importer of fork lift trucks negotiated for the sale of trucks to the value of $1,000,000 to a stevedoring company. The trucks were ordered and shipped from the overseas supplier prior to 18th August, 1981 but are still 'on the water'. The stevedoring company has now cancelled the order as the additional 17 1/2 per cent sales tax imposed because of the amendments has now made other alternatives more attractive. </PARA>
<PARA> A manufacturer of frozen foods now has to pay an additional 17 1/2 per cent sales tax on 'freezer vans' ordered prior to the 18th August 1981. The bodies qualified for sales tax exemption as 'aids to manufacture' under the then existing legislation. The amendments exclude such bodies from exemption. </PARA>
<PARA> The furniture industry, amongst others, has orders outstanding for some time. These contracts are subject to an additional 2 1/2 per cent sales tax but retailers are committed to prices quoted prior to the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>APPENDIX B</PARA>
<PARA> Video cameras. The budget papers mentioned that domestic video cassette recorders were to increase from 15 per cent to 30 per cent. There was no mention of video cameras yet the amendments also catch these goods with the result that they too are taxable at 30 per cent. There is still some confusion in the area of professional type video cameras. </PARA>
<PARA> In his speech the Treasurer stated that dog food and dog shampoo would become subject to sales tax. However, the amendments have caused widespread confusion amongst sellers of livestock foods, veterinary products, etc. It seems that all pet foods, medicines and grooming aids are now taxable but there are numerous grey areas such as working dogs, greyhounds, racehorses, etc. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2G7">Senator JESSOP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. I urge the Government to give consideration to examining ways in which sales tax changes can be implemented without such disruption to business and ways which recognise the complex nature, and ever increasing complexities, of Australian business and industry. I hope the Minister will make some comment on such changes to the sales tax imposition during this debate. During the Minister's second reading speech she said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government well recognises the problems of certain persons who may have arranged to purchase goods which were previously exempt from tax but which are now to be taxed or goods which are to be taxed at a higher rate. This is a feature of changes in the sales tax law and also in the Customs tariff. The reverse applies to persons who purchase goods immediately before the rate reductions. Whilst the Government has some sympathy for persons who find themselves in these situations, the sales tax liability question arises on the date which the sale of goods takes place and not when the order is placed or when a deposit or part payment has been made. The question of when the goods are sold is a question of fact to be resolved in accordance with the law relating to the sale of goods. </PARA>
<PARA>This leads me to the major purpose of my speech. During my speech at the second reading stage I was critical of the quality of advice coming from departments to Ministers and, in particular, the wisdom of the advice presented to the Treasurer on the proposed sales tax increases. In that speech I characterised that advice as being short sighted and lacking thoroughness when it came to looking at the consequences of introducing these sales tax increases. An anomalous situation, which I will refer to in detail in a few moments, is further proof. In an attempt to overcome anomalies which the Treasury believes to be contained in the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act, other anomalies have arisen. I believe that they should not have arisen. The anomaly to which I refer relates to sections 119 and 119A of the First Schedule to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act. Both these sections are to be amended following the Treasurer's Budget announcement. These changes relate to the imposition of a 17 1/2 per cent sales tax upon certain vessels and boats for use principally in connection with pleasure, sport or recreation, and upon gliders, hang gliders and aircraft for private use. Both of these types of goods have not been previously taxed. </PARA>
<PARA> Following numerous representations that have been made to me, it has been brought to my attention that people who had entered into contracts for the purchase of these goods prior to the Budget were to be faced with a 17 1/2 per cent increase in cost. People who entered into a contract for these goods in Australia in May this year and took delivery prior to the Budget were not subject to the increase in sales tax. But if the same person while overseas in May had entered into a contract or had contracted with an overseas company for the construction or purchase of these goods which were not to be delivered until after the Budget, that person would have to pay the added sales tax. This is because the taxing point is deemed to be the point of delivery to Australia and not the time of entering into the contract. That situation is obviously unfair. It is particularly unfair when one considers that gliders are no longer constructed or manufactured in Australia but must be purchased from overseas. Whichever way one looks at it, the effect is certainly retrospective. I think it is unfair to a person who entered into a contract a number of months ago having worked out his financial arrangements. Not everyone involved in the purchase of a glider is an affluent character. I know two people who have jointly purchased a glider having made special arrangements to finance their purchase. Now they have discovered that they are up for an additional $3,000 in sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA> Where this situation discriminates against those individuals purchasing goods from overseas it is unfair and needs to be remedied. Therefore, I propose to add a sixth clause to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill 1981 which relates to the Bill's application. Before doing that I say that during my difficulties with respect to sales tax the Treasurer has been most helpful and considerate. He has recognised my concern. He has been willing to discuss the matter with me. I can say only that he has been very patient with me in this matter. In my conversation with him he said that perhaps in the future changes ought to be made to the way in which we introduce sales tax measures. He said also that perhaps those changes ought to relate to customs duty as well. I would like to think that before too long we will have an opportunity to give expression to suggestions in this chamber as to what sorts of changes ought to be made in order to avoid unnecessary dislocation and disruption to business in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I speak in support of the amendment. It relates to exempt goods which are to become taxable under this Bill. I take a fairly simplistic view about the whole thing.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why does not Senator McLaren wait a little? Every time I speak he interrupts me. I never get a fair go. I will get around to the point he made in a moment. If somebody has paid for and ordered, in a bona fide way, an item before the new sales tax is introduced I believe in fairness that the sales tax should not apply. The fact that this situation has prevailed for many years does not phase me one little bit. If something has been wrong for a long time I believe it was time it was changed. Individuals should not be penalised at any time because of Government inactivity. I believe quite simply that we must be fair. I do not think it is fair to drop an additional tax on a person who may not be able to arrange easily to pay that extra money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the reasons-probably the main reason-why I believe that is wrong is that such a tax is clearly retrospective. Every now and again over the last few years we have heard people talking about introducing retrospective taxation legislation. Usually this is done to clear up a matter that has escaped notice but I believe it is time there was a referendum to make it legal for governments to backdate legislation regarding taxation-</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8T7">Senator TOWNLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not going too far. If the honourable senator could make it retrospective not to kill whales, he would do so, and I would agree with him. If I could make retrospective something that he is interested in I would make it compulsory. Over the last few years we have seen the Government introduce legislation which has applied tax to income which had been earned before the legislation was introduced. In some cases like that perhaps the Government was justified. There is a big perhaps there. I believe that most people find it repugnant and immoral that a person can do something within the law today only to be told after the event by the Minister or the Government that it has now been decided that what they did was illegal. That is pretty simple and it is something that I think everybody understands. The implications of being able to apply retrospective taxation are indeed quite frightening. What would happen if somebody had bought something overseas and we applied a 300 per cent tax to it? Would more people be standing up in this place objecting to the legislation or is it the size that matters. In my book it is the principle that matters. I believe it is wrong for individuals, as I have said, to be penalised because of government inactivity. If I may just make an aside about personal taxation, it is my belief that it should be illegal, as I have said, to back date tax to have effect prior to the introduction of any relevant legislation. For instance, we could see a mini-Budget brought in in March by a government that was running out of money. I can imagine that happening if Labor were in power. A government could impose, say, a 10 per cent or a 50 per cent tax surcharge and back date its application to include the whole of the financial year. Many people have a great deal of trouble in finding that kind of money. I believe taxpayers should not have that kind of threat hanging over their heads, whether it be in respect of personal taxation or sales tax. Individuals need to be able to make long term plans with regard to how they will spend their income and if retrospectivity is allowed to be practised people will not be able to plan their affairs in a way in which I believe they should be able to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the United States, of course, the Supreme Court has held that it is unconstitutional for there to be retrospective legislation and, as I said earlier, I believe it is time a referendum was held in this country to place the same protection in our Constitution. That is one referendum that I believe would easily be agreed to by the people of Australia. I have voted against retrospective measures on previous occasions. Retrospectivity is something that the Liberal Party is against. In respect of the sales tax legislation I believe it is time we changed the situation. We have been told in our discussions that such a change will be made. I am waiting to see when that announcement is likely to come through. I feel that in a matter like this we can treat individuals differently from the way we treat regular importers. From the point of view and principle of retrospectivity there is really no reason to treat them differently provided they can guarantee that they have bona fide contracts which were signed in advance of the date of the change of taxation. Obviously we could empower the Commissioner of Taxation to decide in doubtful cases whether a contract was genuine and to disallow anything that he felt was not genuine. The contract date is, in my book, the important thing, not the date that an article arrives in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to deal with a matter that was raised earlier by my friend from South Australia, Senator Jessop. He referred to something which was ordered in Australia but which would not be delivered until some time after the introduction of the legislation. It might be interesting if I were to read most of a letter that I received from some lawyers in Hobart. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA> I am the solicitor for Morrison's Tourist Services Pty Ltd. This company is gravely disadvantaged by the proposal to remove the exemption contained in item 119 of the First Schedule to the above Act with effect from 19th August. </PARA>
<PARA> By a contract in writing made in December 1980 our client company agreed that boat builders at Tweed Heads, New South Wales should build a 19.9 metre catamaran tourist cruise vessel for use exclusively at Macquarie Harbour and Gordon River, West Tasmania for the tourist industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The contract price will exceed $230,000. The exact amount is not yet known owing to provision for extras and alteration. </PARA>
<PARA> It was clearly understood by our client company at the time of the contract that the vessel would be exempt from sales tax under item 119 of the first Schedule because it was a pleasure vessel. </PARA>
<PARA> A sales tax exemption certificate was obtained from the Australian Taxation Office, Hobart dated 19 March, 1981 which stated that the vessel 'will qualify for exemption under item 119 (1) in the first schedule . . .'</PARA>
<PARA> The financial planning of the company was geared to the sales tax exemption. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter states further:</PARA>
<PARA> There must be many similar cases throughout Australia where boats have been contracted to be contructed prior to the introduction of the Budget and where financial planning has taken into account the exemption under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter then goes on to ask:</PARA>
<PARA> Would you please endeavour to amend the Bill . . . </PARA>
<PARA>And so it goes on. It states also:</PARA>
<PARA> There is a clear distinction between a case where a boat is purchased after the introduction of the Budget in a completed state and a case such as that of our client where the boat was being built at the client's order under a contract made before the Budget. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that letter speaks pretty clearly about the situation. Where does somebody who may have stretched himself for nearly a quarter of a million dollars to the limit to buy something for the tourist industry in Tasmania-which is very important to Tasmania-find the extra 17 1/2 per cent? If a person has arranged finance what could he do about it? I would be very grateful if the Minister were able to say that what I have mentioned will not happen in this case but from the legal advice that I have been given, which I believe is good advice, it will happen. That is all I really need to say. It is all I have time to say. It is time that we changed the system to one that is fair. It is time that we got rid of the power to impose taxation retrospectively and we should do it now. If the Government intends to examine the situation perhaps it will present to the Senate and to this Parliament a paper about the benefits and perhaps the difficulties that such an alteration would cause. The Government could do that within a short time. That is what I believe should be done. There is one other matter that I think I should mention. As a pharmacist I believe that insecticides could add to the health of this community. Perhaps we do not get as many flies in Tasmania as in other parts of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have listened with interest to the case put forward by both Senator Jessop and Senator Townley. I was most interested to hear Senator Jessop putting forward a very strong case for articles to be exempt, as is set out in his amendment, which had been purchased and paid for overseas prior to the bringing down of the Budget. He made no mention of people who had entered into contracts in Australia to buy certain goods, although Senator Townley did make mention of it. I give him credit for that. What about people who have entered into contracts in Australia-perhaps they have saved for many years-to buy motor cars and who probably have stretched their finances to the limit? What about people getting near the retirement age who want to buy caravans or pleasure boats? Senator Jessop has no thought for those people. If he did, he would have supported the Labor Party in its second reading stage amendment which opposed the imposition of all sales tax.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I ask honourable senators to look at the situation of young couples who have entered into a contract with a builder to build a home. If the legislation is passed, a sales tax will be imposed on building materials after 1 January. Many people may have entered into contracts before the Budget was presented and stretched their finances to the limit. Perhaps they had made arrangements to borrow money. Even though that house might be in the course of construction now, many building materials will have to be purchased after 1 January to complete it. These materials include furnishings and carpets. Those people will find themselves in very great financial trouble. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators opposite, in particular Senator Jessop, have not shown any sympathy for those people. Those honourable senators could not care less about them. Senator Jessop in his speech placed great emphasis on the fact that some people have puchased a glider. He said he knew of a couple who have entered into a joint venture to purchase a glider. I wonder whether he is one of the co-purchasers of the glider and will be caught to pay the sales tax. I know he goes to Waikerie airfield quite a bit. Perhaps he might be going to use Waikerie airfield to fly his glider. Perhaps his pocket is starting to feel the pinch. </PARA>
<PARA> We cannot be selective. Some honourable senators on the government side have levelled some criticism at the Government. They have quoted from correspondence which all of us have received from many people. Those honourable senators should have been genuine in their endeavours and supported the Labor Party when it opposed the Bills at the second reading stage. If they had done that, there not have been this problem. Honourable senators opposite would not have to go back to their electors and say 'Here is my speech. I said in the Senate that I am opposed to the tax.' Perhaps they could be like Senator Missen and show their electors the part of the speech in which they oppose something and put forward all the good arguments against it but tear out that page of the Hansard on which the vote is taken. Senator Missen voted for the very thing he is opposed to. I know that this is going on. We have heard it so often. This is the sort of thing we have to put up with. We have to put up with the sanctimonious and pious statements of government senators who try to fool the people. They will not fool the people any longer. </PARA>
<PARA> The point is that after 18 August many people in this country will be hit with the extra sales tax. After 1 January many more will be hit with it, particularly on items of clothing, building materials, children's wear, books and all those sorts of things. What honourable senators on the Government side ought to have been doing is not putting a case for a few wealthy people who can afford to import gliders and such things. If they are people in business the tax will not cost them a red cent because it will be passed on to the purchaser. Contrary to what some honourable senators opposite have said, it will not cost the businessman anything. It will be the poor devil who has to fork out at the end of the line who will pay the final bill. He is the one who will pay the sales tax. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition will not support Senator Jessop's amendment. I will briefly state the reasons. Firstly, no notice was given of the amendment before tonight; there was no opportunity to discuss it and no attempt by Senator Jessop to explain previously whatever reasons he may have had for proposing the amendment. In other words, Senator Jessop is not serious. This is a cheap political stunt. It is nit picking. Having declined the opportunity to do something effective and knock out the sales tax Bills in their entirety or knock out substantive clauses of them. Senator Jessop sought cheap political glory by moving a silly amendment such as this at this time of night.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Insofar as Senator Jessop's argument has any validity at all, it rests on the proposition that if sales tax is increased we discriminate against the person who has goods on order. I suppose that is true. We also discriminate against everyone who did not buy the goods yesterday but buys them tomorrow, and that always applies when sales taxes are increased. Inversely-I recall this very well-when the Labor Government in 1975 abolished the licence fee for television receivers some of us were inundated with letters from people demanding that the licence they had paid the day before the fee was abolished be refunded. There is nothing new about that. Insofar as their argument has any validity, it is valid for any increase or decrease in taxation of this nature. It discriminates for or against people on the arbitrary basis whether they bought the item the day before or the day after. </PARA>
<PARA> As for Senator Townley, he had the audacity to suggest that this is tantamount to a breach of contract because people entered into a contract to buy something thinking that the sales tax would be zero when it will be 30 per cent or something. On 12 March-there have been numerous other instances of this, but most recently it was 12 March-the Treasurer (Mr Howard) committed the Government to a policy of not broadening the indirect taxation base without offsetting cuts in income tax. Five months later that same Treasurer introduced legislation to broaden massively the indirect taxation base and quantitatively increase it by almost $1 billion a year, accompanied not by commensurate reductions in income tax, as he had previously asserted was essential, but by a massive 22 per cent increase in pay-as-you-earn taxation. If Senator Townley's conscience can cope with that breach of faith, he should not have any trouble at all coping with these amendments which Senator Jessop seeks to modify. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the amendment moved by Senator Jessop and, in his words, it relates to goods imported into Australia. I think we canvass a matter a little wider than the amendment when we talk about Australian-manufactured goods. I listened with interest to the honourable senators who spoke on the amendment. If we were to consider the comments that have been made I think we would find the great difficulty there is in dealing with a matter of the kind raised by Senator Jessop. Senator Jessop raised this matter in his earlier speech on the Bills. He has had consultations with the Treasurer (Mr Howard), with me, and with the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Carrick). We are very conscious of the things he said with regard to the difficulties people find when there are changes. As Senator Walsh pointed out, there are changes in taxes one way or another. Whether it is income tax, customs duty or whatever, there are those who before the date and after the date find themselves in different circumstances.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact that needs to be stated, and Senator Jessop stated the application of the law quite clearly, is that liability under the Sales Tax Assessement Act arises at the time of importation of goods into Australia, and the tax is payable at the time those goods are entered at Customs for home consumption. The Sales Tax Assessment Act No. 5 applies to importers who are consumers or retailers. The Act does not apply to wholesalers who become liable for sales tax when they sell taxable goods in Australia to retailers. If such a sales tax is applied on or after 19 August of this year, then irrespective of when the goods were purchased overseas or imported into Australia they will be taxed at the rates effective from 19 August. The date of puchase of the goods by an importer is therefore irrelevant for the purpose of the sales tax law. Either the liablity arises on importation by the consumer or the retailer or upon sale in Australia by the wholesaler. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposed amendment has had our consideration, but it is contrary to the long-established practice in the sales tax law that applies in Australia. It is also contrary to established practice in the changes to, for instance, the Customs law. There is a long-standing policy that Customs duty is payable at the rate ruling at the time of entry of goods for home consumption. Liability at time of importation is certain, as is liability between parties to a sale in Australia. A number of honourable senators spoke quite thoughtfully on the matter and I am interested in their comments. When the Government was considering the matter it acknowledged the points made by Senator Jessop and Senator Townley. It is disposed to request the Commissioner of Taxation and the Comptroller-General of Customs to provide a paper dealing with the application of, and procedure for imposing, sales tax and customs and excise duties. If such a paper were prepared, it could be presented to the Parliament, debated and arouse public discussion on these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> We see, from even the three or four speeches that have been made on the subject tonight, that although we might feel that we are solving one person's problem we may be providing another source of inequity or anomaly somewhere else. It seems to me and to the Government that the best way to consider matters that have been quite properly and thoughtfully raised at this time would be to have a paper submitted by the Commissioner for Taxation and the Comptroller-General of Customs. We could then consider the problem as a whole. Recommendations and suggestions could be proposed. They may be acceptable by the Government. Certainly they would be considered by it. The Government is not able to accept the amendment moved by Senator Jessop in this instance and suggests that at some time soon such a paper be provided to allow us to discuss these matters in a broader context, rather than simply deal with the amendment concerned. I commend the Bills to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, I rise to explain to some extent the confusion that arose earlier when I moved that you do now leave the chair. I wish first to recapitulate just where we are in regard to this particular Bill. We are about to vote upon the Committee stage of the measure. Once that question has been decided-and, as has been indicated, it will be decided in the affirmative-the opportunity for this chamber to do ultimately what the majority of honourable senators set out originally to do will have been lost forever.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I quote from a letter that I wrote to the leaders of the parties on 4 September outlining a set of procedures that could be adopted to divide the Bills previously considered. My point is that I wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> The value of this procedure is that it might accommodate the common objectives of the majority of the Senate, all within the framework of the Constitution and the Standing Orders. Rather than requesting the House of Representatives to amend the Bills, this procedure would result in a separate Bill being presented to the House for it to either accept or reject. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the salient point:</PARA>
<PARA> I suggest also that the same objectives may be achieved through certain amendments to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill now before the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the very Bill that we are discussing. The Labor Party latched on to that and was off and running with those particular amendments. It had been indicated to me that the Labor Party was doing so because the Australian Democrats had indicated that they would support those amendments. In the event, tonight the Australian Democrats have stated that to do so would be, in effect, to divert attention from the other method that we have used tonight, the initial method-that of attaching requests to Bills 1A to 9A in respect of the extensions of sales tax to previously exempt necessities of life items. That was their decision. But it was clear to all concerned that if we were to proceed to finality in respect of this piece of legislation now, tonight, then the opportunity would have been lost forever to use this particular piece of legislation to achieve what I understand the majority of honourable senators desire to achieve; that is ultimately the rejection of the extension of the sales tax to previously exempt necessities of life items and to books, newspapers, et cetera. </PARA>
<PARA> We have reached the stage where the Government has stated quite categorically that it will fight tooth and nail my proposal to divide the Bills 1A to 9A if and when they come back to this place from the House of Representatives. The Labor Party has indicated some questioning about this particular aspect. Unless its members are able to get up and say right here and now that they will support that proposition then we must now report progress on this piece of legislation so that we do not lose ultimately the opportunity of doing what the majority of honourable senators want to do. Therefore, in accordance with Standing Orders, I again move:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Chairman do now leave the Chair and report progress. </PARA>
<PARA>By that I mean that we deal with these matters in the event that we receive back from the House of Representatives Bills 1A to 9A without the House of Representatives acceding to the request. </PARA>

He saw his motion as an opportunity of furthering that opposition. The Australian Democrats supported him, presumably because they want more time to prevaricate. The Opposition will oppose the third reading of these Bills by dividing.

<PARA> (1) At the tenth meeting of the Australian Fisheries Council in Darwin on 12 September 1980, the Queensland Minister for Maritime Services and Tourism, the Honourable M. D. Hooper, sought the approval of Council to the import of a few hundred Nile perch for research into their suitability for eventual release in Queensland waters as a food and sport fish. He offered to establish a research station with proper and adequate safeguards to enable research by Queensland scientists for two or three years to establish whether Nile perch should be allowed into Australian waters. At the end of the trial period the project will be evaluated by Standing Committee and Council before a final decision on release into Australian waters is made.</PARA>
<PARA> Council agreed to the importation by Queensland of a limited number of Nile perch, under adequate security to prevent their escape, for research into their suitability as a food and sport fish.</PARA>
