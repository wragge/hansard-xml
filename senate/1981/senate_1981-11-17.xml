<TITLE>Aboriginal Land Rights</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That the projected repeal by the Queensland State Government of the Aborigines Act 1971-1979 and the Torres Strait Islander Act 1971-1979 will almost certainly lead to the degazettal of all Aboriginal reserves in Queensland, as happened with Aurukun and Mornington Island.</PARA>
<PARA> That, if the Aboriginal communities from these reserves are placed under similar shire council legislation on fifty year leases, they will be exposed to serious encroachment on their land by mining and tourist interests.</PARA>
<PARA> That, on past evidence, these interests will clearly have the full backing of the Queensland Government and the rights of Aboriginal people to land rights and self-management will not be granted by that Government.</PARA>
<PARA> That the Commonwealth Government has the constitutional power to legislate and acquire land for Aboriginal people since the amendments to the Constitution in 1967, but it is your petitioner's sincere belief that it has already failed in its duty before the people of Aurukun and Mornington Island.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for National Development and Energy. Does he recall that on 7 April this year, in answer to a question from me, he said that a number of synthetic oil projects, including the Rheinbraun project in the Latrobe Valley, were 'starting to get into place and will aim to be in position by the 1990s and to supplement any decline that there may be in oil'? Was that statement made so as to imply that the Rheinbraun project, amongst others, would fill the gap left by the Rundle shale oil scheme, which had been so enthusiastically talked up by the Minister until April this year? Is it true, as reported in today's Australian Financial Review, that at present oil prices coal-to-oil projects such as the Rheinbraun project would not provide a sufficient rate of return to justify major commercial investment? If this is true, can the Minister now give the Senate his current assessment of the future viability of synthetic oil production in Australia? Does he now agree with the Australian Federation of Construction Contractors, which said in May this year that no oil-to-coal or shale-to-oil projects would go ahead in the foreseeable future?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yesterday in Australia there was unfolded the result of a two-year study by the Federal Republic of Germany and the Comomonwealth Government of Australia in which a number of the great coal chemists and coal enterprises of the world took part. That study was based upon an examination of Victorian brown coal and Queensland and New South Wales bituminous black coal. The papers and the information that were presented will become available; they have been featured in the Press. In fact, what was said was that the Germans, who looked at this both technically and from an economic viewpoint, believed that there could be put in position, commencing from 1984, the building of a plant-a plant functioning in 1989, five years later-which would be commercially viable. That is the viewpoint expressed by those who yesterday put forward their technical and economic facts. It is true that different answers can be arrived at from different bases. One of the main predictions has to be of the trend in Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries oil prices over the years. Nevertheless, the foundation of what was said yesterday was an indication that it was believed that this could be done. It was believed that it should be done with some degree of urgency because of the always perilous situation in the world. One of the companies participating in that survey was, in fact, Rheinbraun.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> These are the factual situations as presented yesterday. Therefore, it is suggested by those with high technical knowledge that coal to oil technology is available, both technically and at a cost feasibility. One needs to look at and examine this with great thoroughness. Our Government and the State governments will be looking at the assumptions made. That presentation was made yesterday. It was stressed that in a world running out of oil it is imperative that, as reasonably quickly as possible, syncrude should be produced either from coal or from shale. Amongst technical people and those who look at economic feasibility there is around the world an immense interest in getting those technologies into place as soon as possible. I can say only that we will examine this with great interest both at a State level and at the Commonwealth level. This was a very important study indeed. I cannot pronounce upon it because the bases will need expert examination. On the other hand, as I said, the report is promising, as to both its findings and its exposition.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Resources, relates to the preliminary report of the Uranium Advisory Council on its review of the Atomic Energy Act, contained in its annual report tabled in Parliament last week. In particular my question relates to its recommendation which calls for the deletion or changing of sections of Australia's nuclear legislation which restrict civil liberties or which require secrecy. The Minister may recall that I expressed similar concerns during debate in the Senate on the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill in May 1978. Does the Minister agree with the Council's claim that 'public confidence in the industry will not be achieved while it continues to be surrounded by apparent secrecy, such as section IV of the Act appears to require'? If so, I ask: Firstly, what action will be taken by the Government to bring legislation dealing with uranium and the nuclear industry into line with other Commonwealth legislation such as the freedom of information initiatives now being considered by the Parliament? Secondly, when can we expect to see before the Parliament legislation to remove those restrictions on civil liberties and the availability of information which appear inappropriate in the present context of a commercial uranium industry which is conducted for peaceful purposes within the ambit of the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has been aware for a very considerable time that the existing Atomic Energy Act is not wholly suitable or relevant to present and future circumstances. Honourable senators will recollect that the Minister for Trade and Resources and I announced in June that the Atomic Energy Act in its present form, since it did not provide the appropriate basis for the development, regulation and control of nuclear activities, should be urgently reviewed and that a new legal base should be established. Consequently a major review of the issues involved is now under way in close consultation with the States and the Northern Territory. I assure honourable senators that the views of the Uranium Advisory Council, expressed in the Council's annual report and referred to by Senator Missen, will be taken into account in the course of that review.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I expect that legislation will be developed as rapidly as possible, as appropriate, following the review and then brought before the Parliament. Nevertheless, this is a complex and highly technical undertaking and involves very considerable discussions with the States. The Government is conscious of the need for priority to be given to these matters. Clearly it is inappropriate for me to make specific commitments until the Government has received a report concerning the aspects which are under review. I will keep in mind Senator Missen's views, including the comments on freedom of information, and the specific comment made by the Uranium Advisory Council.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Can the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry advise whether the beef moguls of the United States of America and Japan, through their recent actions in cutting back Australian beef imports but at the same time lifting the imports of high quality beef between the United States and Japan, are endeavouring to protect their own high consumer priced beef at the expense of the Australian producer, who has supplied the bulk of the much lower priced beef to a considerable percentage of the population of those two nations? Is it possible to vary the export and abattoir regulations in Australia, particularly in areas such as the Northern Territory, Queensland and Western Australia, to encourage greater sales and the development of new overseas markets, including South East Asia in particular? With the considerable drop in Australia's beef population, can it be expected that Australia in the near future will be less dependent on the present American and Japanese markets?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2192" SPEAKER="Chaney Sen The Hon F.M." NAMEID="EF4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator has raised questions about the level of beef quotas in Japan. Decisions with respect to that are made, of course, by the Japanese Government. They take into account the domestic supply and demand situation for meats in that country. The beef and pork markets in Japan are regulated by price stabilisation schemes which set both maximum and minimum prices prior to the commencement of each year, in April. These prices play an important part in determining the level of retail prices in Japan. If I may use the honourable senator's expression 'beef moguls', my advice is that the United States beef moguls are not involved in the decisions which are taken by the Japanese Government in this area. However, the United States, as part of its overall efforts to increase exports to Japan, has been placing emphasis on exports of its beef to that country. These are drawn mainly from lot fed cattle, which is, of course, a very different sort of beef from that mainly exported by Australia. As to the United States market, the proposed restrictions to which Senator Kilgariff refers relate to health and not quantitative measures. Amendments have been proposed which, if implemented, could have serious implications for exporting countries' ability to supply beef to the United States. Currently a conference of House of Representatives and Senate members in Washington is examining the amendments, and the United States Administration, Australia and other suppliers to the United States are seeking changes which will reduce the impact of the proposed measures.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Kilgariff also asked about varying the regulations to encourage greater sales in other markets. There is in this country a uniform standard for export inspection. Overseas markets are continually upgrading their standards, and it would not be prudent to reduce Australian standards in this area. Markets in South East Asia have taken increased quantities from Australia this year. For the nine months to September, meat exports to Malaysia increased by 10 per cent, to Singapore by 20 per cent, to the Philippines by 59 per cent, to Taiwan by 65 per cent and to Korea by 570 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> The last part of the honourable senator's question related to the drop in Australia's beef population making Australia less dependent on the present American and Japanese markets. It remains a fact that the United States and Japanese markets are the best in terms of price, and that situation is expected to continue into the foreseeable future. Therefore, it is likely that Australian exporters will seek to sell on those markets where the price is best. Indeed, if the fall in beef numbers in this country is to have any influence at all it is, I suspect, likely to influence producers to wish to sell in those markets which give them the highest return.</PARA>

Is he further aware that the same report states that the United States policy of controlled escalation is not realistic since the destruction of communications facilities would make any attempt to reach a settlement of a nuclear war difficult, if not impossible, thus making total nuclear war the most likely result once the first missile is fired? Further, is he aware of reports that the United States now favours a policy of simultaneous retaliation? In this context, I ask whether he is aware of the following recent incredible statement by the President of the United States, in answer to the apparent contradictions between General Haig, who stated that North Atlantic Treaty Organisation policy now included a nuclear warning shot in Europe, and Secretary of Defence Weinberger, who made a denial on that issue:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not seen the study by the London International Institute of Strategic Studies. I will seek it out and read it. I will then be able to give further information on it. But let me deal with Senator Chipp's question first of all on the assumption that the first statement is as he quoted it. It is a sad fact that all defensive installations or weapons that exist in the world would be targets at the onset of war, and the more significant a defensive installation is the more prime the target would be. There is a tremendous dilemma, and it is this: Nations seek to have installations to ensure peace while realising that there is a risk in that regard. I take it that those who understand the functions of the North West Cape and Pine Gap installations would understand that they are in essence a part of the aim of the free world to maintain peace. Therefore of course there would be a vulnerability of any such installation or any such major weapons around the world. Senator Chipp would not journey along this path. Clearly therefore one does not simply take away one's installations or one's weapons because that would be the road to passive resistance and, therefore, overthrow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Chipp referred to a number of quotations of which I am not aware. I am not aware of the ones that he put in the subsequent parts of his question. Therefore all I can do is to undertake to refer them to my colleague the Minister for Foreign Affairs to check their substance and to seek from him a report upon them. As to the final part of his question about what Australia is doing, I point out that Australia has taken very vigorous steps, internationally and nationally, to give leadership in nuclear non-proliferation and, indeed, nuclear disarmament. Sadly for this world, there is no such thing as a nuclear free zone. All who understand the physical nature of what is called the cosmic mix know that the whole world is subject to the danger of substantial nuclear explosions anywhere in the world. I draw attention to the evidence that Australia gave before the World Court in terms of the Mururoa Atoll tests. Of course Australia is eager to produce nuclear disarmament in the world but the facts of the matter are, as I have mentioned in the Senate, that one nation, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, is increasing its armaments at a rate something like double that of the United States of America. Sadly, that has led to a building up of further armaments by the United States of America. I will bring the substance of the question to the attention of the Minister.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Crichton- Browne is correct when he says that the Isolated Patients Travel and Accommodation Assistance Scheme has brought benefit to people in non-metropolitan areas of Australia and that it does supply cash support for those people who need to travel for medical care and attention. I think the honourable senator may not have mentioned that Western Australia previously had a scheme operating but that its scheme has now been finished, so that many Western Australians who previously looked to the State for assistance are now looking to the Commonwealth and to the Commonwealth scheme. The main concern which I heard the honourable senator express is about delay in payment-that people who use the scheme may have to wait for some time to be repaid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will certainly make known to the Minister for Health the honourable senator's concern.

In particular, I will draw to my colleague's attention the suggestion by Senator Crichton-Browne that it may be possible to take up the offer of the State Government to advance money on the basis that that is repaid when the Commonwealth makes payment in due course. I think my colleague would want to look at all these matters.

Competitive tendering was used and that particular tenderer was successful. It is true that South Australia has one representative, out of a total of 47 positions, on the seven NERDDC technical standing committees and there are no South Australian representatives on the Technology of Synthetic Fuels Standing Committee. Representatives are chosen for their personal expertise and not as representatives of particular organisations or States. Fundamentally, the findings made are available to South Australia.

I am advised that for medical cover the figure for people who have basic private insurance, who are pensioners, who hold health care cards or who are in receipt of repatriation or defence care is a little under 89 per cent. The equivalent figure for hospital cover is about 93 per cent. I am advised that there is approximately another 2 per cent of people who cannot yet be accounted for in terms of figures available and that may well take the figures higher. But the figures available do not take into account two other matters. The first of these is that in Queensland a number of people are able to take account of arrangements for free hospital care which operate in that State. It is thought that many people in Queensland are covered under that scheme. Of course, a number of people have taken out cover through non-registered general insurance arrangements. It is thought that adding up all those types of cover it is very likely that the great majority of Australians-in fact almost all-have some kind of cover.

Their difficulty in dealing with the sort of situation with which they are faced is borne out by the 'Social Security Bulletin' which has been produced by the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association in recent days and which tells public servants how they ought to behave in a stand-down circumstance in a way which is designed to obstruct and to make difficult the carrying out of those duties. I would like to refer to the paper issued under the heading 'Social Security Bulletin' and over the signature of one David Bunn, Branch Secretary, which gives some very useful advice to public servants on how they should be behaving!

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I cannot think of anything that is more significant to South Australia and indeed to Australia generally than the construction of the pipeline from the Cooper Basin to Whyalla, a pipeline which will be finished by the end of next year or early 1983, a pipeline which basically normally would carry something like 40,000 barrels of liquids a day and under pressure 80,000 barrels of liquids a day-an enormous supplement to Bass Strait. Therefore, as to the latter part of the question, the Government regards it as having a very high priority.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The environmental impact statement prepared for the Cooper Basin liquids project has been examined by the Department of Home Affairs and Environment. The responsible Minister has advised me that sufficient information has been presented in the final environmental impact statement with respect to the port and terminal facilities at Stony Point to enable an adequate assessment of the proposal to be made. Under the administrative procedures of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act the environmental impact statement must cover a number of specific items and an assessment must be made as to whether they fall into acceptable guidelines. The Minister has advised that the object of the Act has been met and complied with in relation to the making of decisions by or on behalf of the Government on the proposal for the development of oil and gas deposits in the Cooper Basin, including the extraction, transportation and treatment of oil and gas from these deposits. In addition, the State may specify particular pollution standards which have to be met. At this moment I do not have information in respect of that part of the question which referred to leasing Crown land in the Stony Point area. I will seek out that information for Senator Jessop and let him have it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Minister for Social Security, concerns the not inconsiderable confusion and worry which is evident in some sections of the community regarding the future of the Office of Child Care. Can the Minister say whether it is true that the Office of Child Care is to be incorporated with the aged and disabled into a subsidies division within the Department of Social Security?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Usually people are pretty ready to pass on to me their areas of confusion and worry. I have not had too much communication on the point raised by the honourable senator. I may have had some, but I have not seen any representations about that matter, so it is not a matter on which I am able to give the honourable senator a final and definitive reply. The Government did, as part of its Review of Commonwealth Functions, seek a review of the Social Welfare Division of the Department of Social Security. That review was to be carried out by the Public Service Board. I understand that such a review has been carried out and that it is complete, although I have not seen the report on it. I understand also that the Director-General of the Department sought a widening of that review, but I have no details or particulars on that. It may pick up the Office of Child Care and other sections, including the subsidies section, of the Department but I have had no formal communication on that. I have an understanding, which I think flows from casual conversation, that there was a widening of the review beyond the Social Welfare Division.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No rearrangements of the Department would be made without their first being brought to the attention of the Government, so there is no prospect of that occurring without my first having seen what is to occur and having passed judgment on it. However, whatever administrative rearrangements are made within the Department, they would not be aimed at reducing the significance which is to be given to either the child care functions of my Department or its concern for the aged, the disabled and the handicapped. It may be that some administrative rearrangement would be sensible, but that is a matter on which I reserve judgment at this stage. However, I can assure the Senate that no rearrangement is in mind which would reduce the emphasis which the Government would wish to place on the child care functions of the Department.</PARA>

The Minister may recall that I tabled the one hundred and eighty-ninth report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts on airport fire tenders in this chamber on 17 October and drew his attention to the regrettable mismanagement of the Department of Transport, causing considerable waste of public money. Given that the original contractor for the 25 ultra-large fire tenders, the Walter Motor Truck Co. of the United States of America, went into liquidation on 31 October 1980 and an Australian agent now supplies parts and support services for these vehicles to the Department of Transport, I ask: Firstly, what was the reason for the recent overseas visit of two departmental officers to the Walter Motor Trust Co. of Canada? Secondly, is the Walter Motor Trust Co. of Canada managed by some former executives of the former Walter Motor Truck Co. of the United States of America? Thirdly, is or was a former Department of Transport fire services officer, William Charles Harris, in any way associated with the Walter Motor Trust Co. of Canada?

Arrangements have already been made for six officers from the Commonwealth Employment Service and three officers from my own Department to visit Castlemaine tomorrow in order to register people for employment, to register them for unemployment benefit, and to accept the various documents that have to be entered into to ensure that people are protected to the best possible extent. Action is being taken to publicise the visit in the local Press and on radio so that the people affected will be aware of the services which are being offered. With respect to what special arrangements can be made, nothing can be done in the immediate term which I would characterise as a special arrangement other than to ensure that the facilities which are open to people who do not have employment are made available to them.

As things stand at the moment, it looks as though France-socialist France, incidentally-has indicated that it finds virtue in such a peacekeeping force. The United Kingdom, Holland and Italy may well do so. The position of Canada is not clear.

The two members of the union have been offered the requested pay rise of $21 a week. There is no valid reason for them to continue to take this industrial action. Because the health area is a sensitive one the union is using the action of a few to affect many members of the community.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 29 October 1981 Senator Coates asked me a question concerning the building industry in Tasmania. I now have an answer for him. The timetable adopted by the Commonwealth for the Hobart law courts project provides for commencement of construction by Christmas 1981. This timetable remains unchanged. A total of 23 tenders were submitted for the building and nominated subcontract work. Of these, 14 included qualifications in respect of reimbursement of extra costs relating to reduced working hours or special allowances. Tenders are at present being evaluated. Policy applicable to Commonwealth projects provides that fixed prices apply to contracts of less than nine months duration. Contracts of longer duration include provision for adjustment of wages, allowance of wages, allowances and loadings on a formula basis which recognises variations to awards or other statutory prescriptions which are of general application throughout the industry and are not related exclusively to a particular contract, contractor or contract site. In those few instances where unique circumstances apply, such as special hazards for workers, specifications include provision for the reimbursement of special allowances awarded by an appropriate tribunal. Since the law courts project, located near the middle of Hobart, does not have special features, provision for reimbursement was not included in the advertised specification.

We have had before us the Polish Ambassador, the former Australian Ambassador in Poland and, on two occasions, officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs, to brief us on the matter. The subject must be viewed in light of the total world situation at the moment, particularly that in Europe at a time of increased tension between the super-powers. As we were reminded at Question Time today, we have had United States Government spokesmen talking about a limited winnable nuclear war in Europe. Obviously, their counterparts, the hawks in the Kremlin, would be planning a winnable conventional strike into Western Europe. What is happening in Western Europe at the moment is that a huge and genuine peace movement is present and growing. I know that people, including probably honourable senators on the Government side, will say that many of the peace movements in Europe have been sponsored by the Soviet Union. I do not deny that there is some Soviet influence in those peace movements but at the moment we are seing a huge and spontaneous gathering of Europeans who are worried that they might be placed in the middle of a nuclear war. It is a Europe in which each of the major cities is nuclear targeted with the equivalent of 2,000 Hiroshima-type atomic bombs, a Europe where the West German Government, because of statements by the President of the United States and pressure from President Brezhnev of the Soviet Union, could be destroyed and in its place we would get a hard line right wing government that would certainly not hesitate to deploy Cruise missiles in West Germany.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was reminded recently of a statement by Senator Church, the former Chairman of the United States Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who said in Canberra on 21 October:</PARA>
<PARA> There is no such thing as limited nuclear war. Any nuclear exchange would quickly escalate out of control. Any talk of limited nuclear war is unreal. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet at the moment we have just such talk taking place in Europe. There is also evidence of unrest in Eastern Europe outside of Poland. I refer to Romania. The distribution of dissident pamphlets coincided with two explosions in Ploiesti, the Romanian oil producing centre. The Romanian economy is under great strain at the moment. It has become an importer of oil from the Soviet Union, as opposed to its position a few years ago when it was an oil exporter. Romania faces a $2 billion repayment in Western loans this year alone. It is quite apparent that Romania's highly independent foreign policy in relation to the Soviet Union has led to a number of Romanians dreaming the Polish dream. Despite strict crackdowns on internal dissent in Romania at the moment, there are signs of unrest. Recently a trade union organisation calling itself Unity asked for a general strike to take place. This strike did not take place, but all of these things are evidence of unrest outside Poland. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it would be fair to say that there is a great deal of political unease throughout Europe, East and West, excluding the situation in Poland. In looking at the situation in Poland at the moment I think we have to remember that since World War II, as a result of food supply shortages and price increases, there have been revolts by the Polish people. Rigid communist regimes have been brought down and replaced. Now there is a liberalised Polish Government, and Solidarity is threatened because of food shortages and price increases. </PARA>
<PARA> Prime Ministe Jaruzelski and Deputy Prime Minister Rakowski are probably the last leaders in the Communist Party in Poland who are capable of pursuing a non-violent and non-confrontationist approach to the trade union movement. Jaruzelski is a Polish Army general. The Army is well regarded in Poland; it is a people's army. The large basis of that Army is still conscripted from among the Polish people. As I said, it is well regarded, as opposed to the police force in Poland which is not well regarded by the people. Deputy Prime Minister Rakowski is a moderate. Many members of the Australian Parliament will remember when he paid a visit here. I think it was in 1976 or 1977. I remember the then Chairman of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, Sir Magnus Cormack, remarking that he was perhaps one of the most open and most liberal people from Eastern Europe he ever had the pleasure of meeting. I know that he is highly regarded by the Australian Embassy in Warsaw. As I said previously, both these men are probably the last chance that the Communist Party in Poland has of pursuing a responsible approach to the trade union movement. </PARA>
<PARA> Solidarity is controlled by the moderates at the moment. It is a working class movement; it is not a movement of dissaffected intellectuals or students, but that is not to say that it will always remain such. Poland's economic situation at the moment is disastrous. It has a $27 billion deficit to the West. Poland has come close to defaulting on several occasions. Complex debt rescheduling has staved it off in the case of payments of $US4.4 billion due last financial year. Some 460 Western banks are involved in bankrolling its debt, and the implications of collapse for the Western banking system are monstrous. For example, in 1979, 83 per cent of its new borrowings were used in the repayment of existing debts. The problem of repayment of debt is largely a function of another feature of the Polish economy, and that is the collapse of the export earning industries. Most specifically this has occurred in the coal industry. In 1979, 41 million tonnes of coal were exported. The 1981 planned figure was 24 million. But even with this dramatic reduction it appears that only 2 million tonnes were sold in the first quarter of the year, so that target will not be reached. The problem is a product of inefficient organisation and industrial unrest. There is a massive requirement for importation of foodstuffs. In large measure this is a product of long term agricultural mismanagement. The impact requirement will be some 10 million tonnes, which will pose further problems for Poland's foreign indebtness. </PARA>
<PARA> I think a question that all of us have to ask ourselves is this: Will the Soviet Union intervene? The Soviets have historically allowed Poland a greater freedom of action than any of its other satellites. It has no common border with the West, therefore the Soviets argue that it is limited in outside influence. Evidence is emerging at the moment that the Soviets have tolerated the recent moves to include Solidarity and the church in a type of coalition government. That is a type of coalition they would not allow to exist anywhere else in Eastern Europe. I believe the Soviet Union will not invade unless there is a complete collapse of the Polish Communist Party, and I believe that is on the cards in the coming winter. </PARA>
<PARA> The cost to the Soviet Union of intervention would be the assumption of a $27 billion debt. If the Soviets defaulted, it would throw into chaos Western economic relationships with all of the other Eastern bloc countries. The probable conclusion of favourable detente-based trading relations with the West, including high technology imports from Japan and Germany in particular, would be at risk. An American blockade, and possibly even an invasion of Cuba, could take place if the Soviets invaded Poland. They would have to examine the military costs involved in fighting a well trained, substantial, if inferior, force in Poland. They would also have to look very carefully at the type of world reaction that followed the Soviet Union's incursion into Afghanistan. </PARA>
<PARA> In light of all these circumstances, Australia should provide unconditional food aid to Poland. Meat, sugar and grain immediately come to mind. On 7 August 1981 Mr Beazley, the honourable member for Swan in Western Australia, wrote to the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) along those lines. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the reply of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to Mr Beazley. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The letter read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Minister for Foreign Affairs Canberra  Dear Mr Beazley</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to your letter of 7 August 1981, in which you urge the Government to offer substantial food aid to Poland. I appreciate your interest in the Polish situation and agree entirely with your analysis of the relationship in Poland between the Government, the Solidarity leadership and the rank and file. It is clear that the economy continues to worsen, that shortages are becoming more acute, that strike action will not resolve these problems, and that the potential for serious social unrest and disorder is great while these economic difficulties persist. In those circumstances, the possibility of outside intervention cannot be discounted. The key to Polish economic revival lies in the rapid formulation and implementation of reform measures, which will probably include price rises and wage freezes. Solidarity's cooperation will be required if these measures are to be introduced with minimal public disorder. </PARA>
<PARA> Western economic assistance, in the form of debt rescheduling and food and financial aid, will play an important part in assisting Poland to weather the coming months until the economy is revitalised. In response to requests for assistance from the Polish Government, a number of West European governments, the EEC and the United States and Canadian governments have initiated steps to provide Poland with much-needed foodstuffs, medical supplies and other products. A meeting of Western bankers in Zurich in July formulated a proposal for the rescheduling of Poland's hard-currency debt and the Polish Government is considering this proposal at present. </PARA>
<PARA> The above facts demonstrate that Western governments appreciate Poland's need for assistance. The Australian Government also appreciates that need. It was for this reason that, in April of this year, the Government agreed to provide credit guarantees to facilitate the purchase, by Poland, of up to $A40m worth of wool and hides. </PARA>
<PARA> In response to your letter, and similar representations from the Polish community in Australia, departments have under preliminary study the question of what further aid Australia may be in a position to offer Poland in the event that a formal request is made to the Government. As you know, we have not received a request from Poland for further assistance. This makes it difficult for us to determine Poland's precise needs at this time and to know whether there is room for Australian action in the light of what others are contributing, including those countries better placed than Australia to respond urgently to the present crisis. It is also unprecedented for Australia to grant such aid to an East European country, and this is a further factor which needs to be taken into account. Nevertheless, we shall continue to examine the issue to determine what options, if any, are open to the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely A. A. STREET</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EJ4">Senator SIBRAA</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister said in his reply that it would be unprecedented for Australia to grant aid to an Eastern European country. I think we have to look at the facts and realise that the European Economic Community and the French Government have already delivered food aid to the Polish people. Australia has to learn to react as the need arises and to grant aid to countries which are in urgent need, even though they may not normally be included in our assistance program. Poland is facing an acute food and fuel shortage this winter. Widespread hunger and discomfort will undoubtedly force the Polish people to go to greater and riskier lengths to achieve a reasonable standard of living. However, the facts show that the Polish Government is not in a position to grant even the basic necessities because it does not have the food or fuel stocks available to meet the needs of the people. If the Australian Government wishes to see the great advances in democratic rights in Poland continued and strengthened, now more than ever Australia must take a constructive stand and make substantial grants of food aid to Poland. There can be no question that the substantial democratic gains made by the Polish people over the last year or so, mainly through trade union activity, are being threatened by Poland's serious economic crisis.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If Australia now fails to respond to Poland's great need for food aid and consequently the fragile links between Solidarity and the Polish Government are shattered, the repercussions would be felt world wide. Firstly, if Poland defaults on her debts this could well lead to a major collapse in the Western banking system, especially if problems appeared elsewhere in Eastern Europe. Secondly, if the United States decided on an economic boycott of the Soviet Union our trading relationships would be seriously damaged. Thirdly, Poland's attempts to befriend the West and loosen the grip of the Soviet Union would be smashed, perhaps for good. Australia has no legitimate reason to ignore Poland's plight, and if the Government is sincere in its support for Solidarity and the more liberal style Polish Government it should immediately take steps to grant massive amounts of food aid to the Polish Government. The time is fast running out for both Solidarity and Jaruzelski, and the opportunity for the Australian Government to offer assistance may not arrive again. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I would like to quote from an article on America's new foreign policy written by Senator Frank Church, who is a former Chairman of the United States Foreign Relations Committee, to which I referred earlier. In dealing in this article with the involvement of the United States with the Soviet Union, he states:</PARA>
<PARA> There is something schizophrenic about the Reagan Administration's obsession with the Soviet Union. On the one hand, we are led to believe that the Russians are out to dominate the world. On the other hand, in an American version of historical inevitability, Mr Reagan assures us that we are seeing not only in Poland but in 'the reports that are beginning to come out of Russia itself . . . an indication that Communism is an aberration . . . the beginning of the end.' In short, the Russian Empire is cracking up. Mr Haig endorses the President's verdict: 'I think we are witnessing a historic unraveling of Marxist-Leninism on the Soviet model.'</PARA>
<PARA> If this is the case, then why all the anxiety? I suggest it has less to do with an overblown fear that the Soviet Union will ever dominate the world than with a gnawing worry that the Russians, desperate to hold their crumbling empire together, will lash out with their immense military machine. </PARA>
<PARA>I happen to think that Senator Church is right. I believe that by not granting substantial food aid to Poland now we might bring about just such a situation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Sibraa has brought forward as a matter of public importance today the need for Australian food aid for Poland. I say at the outset that the Government is well aware of the very real humanitarian problems now facing the Polish nation as a whole in finding enough food, medicine and clothing. As the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) announced yesterday, he will make a brief visit to Poland next week in the course of a wider visit to the United States and Europe. The Minister for Foreign Affairs will be going at the invitation of the Polish Foreign Minister, whom he met at the United Nations in New York earlier this year. The Minister is looking forward to having further discussions with the Polish Foreign Minister and with others in the Polish Government about a range of international and bilateral matters. In the brief time available to the Minister in Warsaw it may also be possible for him to have contact with other representatives of Polish society. If that is the case he would then be able to form a better understanding of developments within Poland. Throughout their present difficulties the Polish authorities have maintained their relations with other countries including Western countries, a number of whose representatives have visited Warsaw in the past year. The visit of the Australian Foreign Minister will be the first by an Australian Government Minister since 1975 and the first visit by a Foreign Minister of Australia. In 1978 we were pleased to receive a visit to Australia by the then Polish Foreign Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been no easing of the serious economic decline which has accompanied the political crisis of the past year in Poland. The consequences of economic deprivation and hardship cannot be seen in isolation or separated from the political significance of what is occurring in Poland. There is a risk that extreme hardship could lead to a breakdown in public order, which in turn could provoke external intervention. I think these matters were mentioned by Senator Sibraa in the speech we have just heard. It is in the interests of all countries that every effort should be made to prevent such a catastrophe. It is for this reason that many countries have responded sympathetically to Poland's various requests for economic assistance during the past year. For example, a number of Western countries well placed to assist, such as the United States, Canada and the countries of the European Economic Community, have extended to Poland various forms of credit to enable Poland to continue buying essential supplies and commodities in spite of her lack of hard currency. Western banks and creditor governments have also responded favourably and generously to Poland's urgent request for credit assistance and a debt rescheduling. I should stress that the kind of assistance Western countries are giving to Poland is, as far as we are aware, substantially in various forms of credit and not in grant aid. It is encouraging that Poland has now sought to rejoin the International Monetary Fund, an act which, if successful, should further assist Poland to restore her economy. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also to be noted that the Soviet Union has provided additional aid and economic assistance to Poland in response to the current situation, as have other of Poland's allies in the Warsaw Pact. The Australian Government has no confirmation of recent suggestions appearing in the Australian Press that the Soviet Union has refused economic assistance to Poland or is planning a winter blockade. Such reports appear to be unfounded. </PARA>
<PARA> As honourable senators will be aware, Australia granted credit guarantee assistance to Poland in April of this year to the extent of $40m. The purpose of that credit was to enable Poland to continue buying, in the main, Australian wool as well as some other products with the primary purpose of keeping factories in key areas operating. To that extent Australia's assistance has had an important humanitarian aim. This form of assistance was unprecedented in Australia's relations with an Eastern European country but was agreed to by the Government in view of the important considerations we are now discussing. </PARA>
<PARA> I should emphasise that Australia's assistance was given in response to a direct request from the Polish authorities. I am happy to say that Polish importers have made very good use of the facility provided through this assistance that we were able to give them. The Government has not received any further requests for assistance from the Polish authorities. Were such requests to come I have no doubt that the Australian Government would examine them carefully. If we were able to meet those requests we would give to them the same sort of sympathetic consideration that we gave to the request with which we dealt earlier. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame MARGARET GUILFOYLE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. I think we would need to look at what requests were made and how we could respond to them. We were able to respond favourably to the request that was made and, as I have said, no further request has been made to this time. It should be understood that Australia is not as well placed as other countries to give Poland the kind of assistance she needs most urgently in the current circumstances. By that I mean that the most essential food commodities and medicines are more readily available from nearby European countries and from the United States. It is natural that for reasons of availability and transport convenience Poland should have turned first to those countries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have been speaking of Government assistance up to the present but I do not wish to overlook the very large amount of assistance which has been flowing to Poland in the past year from private sources. Those sources are numerous and wide. There has been a very ready response from a number of sources around the world. The Government understands that in Australia individuals and groups, particularly those of Polish origin, have mounted a very large effort in the past year and the value of their gifts of cash and kind can be measured in millions of dollars. I believe that that effort, which is continuing, deserves the very highest commendation. Similar private and community campaigns to assist Poland have been operating in many countries and we may imagine that this has resulted in a very large flow of essential commodities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is aware of reports that there is soon to be launched in Australia a nationwide appeal to co-ordinate private and community assistance to Poland. I understand that those reports are substantially correct but I am not yet in a position to provide any details of the manner in which the Government might respond to or associate itself with such an appeal. However, as I mentioned, the Minister for Foreign Affairs will be visiting Poland next week and as a result of that visit I am sure we will have a better understanding of the present situation in Poland and the needs of the Government and people of Poland. I feel sure that when the Minister returns a full and complete report will be available to the Australian Government for its consideration. In the meantime this nationwide appeal that we understand is to be launched soon, for community and private assistance, is one that would also have our consideration. At the appropriate time we will be able to respond to any appeal of that nature. </PARA>
<PARA> We welcome the opportunity to discuss this matter in the Senate today. I know that a number of honourable senators wish to speak on it, to put forward their own thoughts and perhaps provide information that is within their knowledge. If that is so then this is a matter that the Senate can very usefully discuss on this occasion. I thank those who will take part in the debate. I undertake to draw to the attention of the Minister for Foreign Affairs the comments that will be made during the debate this afternoon and, as I have said, as a result of the Government's consideration of further developments and further information resulting from the Minister's visit we may be in a position to announce any further action that the Government may feel it is appropriate to take. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The emergence of Solidarity-and its concern with the rights of workers and their families-has laid to rest the myth that workers are satisfied with how society is run and that discontent is limited to just a handful of misguided intellectuals. In Poland, practically an entire working class of people have demanded their basic rights. Solidarity has worked closely with the human rights committee KSS-KOR which emerged after the 1976 disturbances in central Poland. Six of the 14 original members of the Workers' Defence Committee-the KOR-were members of the pre-war Polish Socialist Party. The unofficial workers' journal, Robotnik, was also the name of the pre-war PSP newspaper.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The wave of strikes from Wroclaw to Warsaw to Gdansk in July-August 1980 led to the creation of independent trade unions, gathered in Solidarity. The old government unions, the Polish Trade Union Federation, virtually disintegrated as hundreds of thousands of workers went to Solidarity. Old officials did everything to stop the movement, reconstituted themselves as 'independent self-governing unions' and embraced the principles of Solidarity. Old unions did not challenge the Leninist conception of unions as 'transmission belts from the Party to the masses'. Edmund Baluka, chairman of the Szczecin Shipyards Strike Committee in 1970, pointed out:</PARA>
<PARA> The Statutes of the Polish United Workers' Party state that 'the party directs the political line of the trade unions', and the statutes of the trade unions in turn state that 'the trade unions carry out the correct line of the PUWP in the interests of the working class and the Polish nation. </PARA>
<PARA>Professor Rajkiewicz, neither a KOR nor a Solidarity member but rather a Government negotiator in the Gdansk talks of the summer of 1980, said of the pre-August unions:</PARA>
<PARA> Their first duty was (according to the Constitution) to co-operate with the authorities in plan fulfilment. The defence of employees' interests was secondary. Democracy disappeared altogether. </PARA>
<PARA>In 1978, the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions, to which the Australian Council of Trade Unions is affiliated, and the International Metalworkers Federation lodged a complaint against the Polish Government with the Committee on Freedom of Association of the International Organisation. The ICFTU contended that 'the defence of the workers' interests is no longer assured by the official trade unions, which are imposed upon the workers since only (registered unions) are allowed legally to exist'. The ILO Committee concluded that Poland had contravened ILO Convention 87 of 1948 on Freedom of Association, which Poland had voluntarily adopted. The Convention guarantees that 'workers, without distinction whatsoever, should have the right to establish organisations of their own choosing without previous authorisation'.</PARA>
<PARA> The right to strike was granted in 1956 after the Poznan riots but was rescinded in following years. In fact, old union officials are on record in Polish newspapers as admitting that 'we had no courage to reach for the most effective weapon-the strike'. Traditionally, the infamous Article 52 of the Labour Code effectively prohibited strikes, by defining them as 'serious violations' of a worker's 'obligations', for which he might be fired without notice. This is something that honourable senators opposite might like to reintroduce. The sackings after the June 1976 disturbances were based on it-a classic anti-strike law. Polish workers were repressed in three ways: Firstly, measures affecting the unemployed worker; secondly, measures affecting the dissident worker; thirdly, measures affecting general working conditions. Unemployment, and unemployment benefits, were ideologically non-existent. Harassment was the reward of workers out of step with the official unions. Safety and conditions were secondary to production requirements. Since August last year, Solidarity has established itself as the first free trade union movement to succeed in a communist country. Zbigniew Gryszkiewicz, a Solidarity lawyer who toured the United States of America earlier this year, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The vast majority of Solidarity members are extraordinarily responsible, and excessive demands will never be permitted to threaten our achievements. We want to be an ordinary trade union, which is perhaps rather difficult in a country like ours. But we are learning, the authorities are slowly learning, and I believe there is enough of a reservoir of goodwill and realism on both sides for our wishes to become reality. </PARA>
<PARA>This month has seen joint talks between the Polish United Workers Party-that is the Communist Party-the Catholic Church and the Solidarity trade union. These talks represent an unprecedented recognition by the current regime of the political and civic rights defended by the trade union movement. In a joint communique issued on 4 November the possibility of a 'Front of National Agreement' was canvassed. </PARA>
<PARA> This month has also seen talks directed towards the re-entry of Poland into the International Monetary Fund, as was mentioned by the previous speaker, the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle). Allegedly, Moscow has accepted IMF membership for Poland as the price of economic stability. After a decade of intensive industrial development, funded by over 400 Western banks, 64 of them in the United States, Poland has debts in the West of at least $20 billion and possibly $27 billion, as was mentioned earlier. The United States has extended $60m worth of grain credits to Poland and has proposed multi-billion dollar credits on a 50-50 East-West basis. The Soviet Union itself has extended over $3,600m in credit and deferred payments since August 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> What can Australia do? Gryszkiewicz suggests that Solidarity is not really interested in pious propaganda. Nor do we want any money, any dollars. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The US union council AFL-CIO has sent more than $200,000; the Scandinavian unions have helped with organisation, printing presses, typewriters, etc. </PARA>
<PARA> But what Solidarity needs above all is medical help. Medications, surgical instruments and the like. The State of our country's pharmacological industry is catastrophic. This has been officially admitted. Millions of people live on the edge of poverty, and in poor health. Our Ministry of Public Health is actually very much interested in Solidarity's efforts to secure more medications and parts for our hospitals, creches, rest homes, clinics and so on. This is my primary task here in the States-to obtain medical help for our 10 million members and their families-not an insignificant portion of the population, as you can imagine. </PARA>
<PARA>The Solidarity Association of Poles in Australia, based in Sydney, has organised a medicines for Poland appeal which in its first week received medicines worth $18,000 and $2,000 in donations. As the Minister for Finance has indicated, that organisation has been most successful in the months since its foundation. </PARA>
<PARA> Solidarity overall is the most significant development in communist countries since the first one came into existence in 1917. Its importance has spread far beyond the borders of Poland. For that reason alone I believe Australia has a responsibility to offer useful aid. Every effort should be made to defuse the tension between the state and the working class movement. Talk of confrontation may satisfy anti-Soviet egos but, as Lech Walesa was reported in Australian media on 11 November as saying, the intervention of Moscow could result in 'the slaughter of one third of the nation'. That horrible prospect would be a monstrous end to Solidarity. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is up to all Australian citizens to support food aid to Poland. We do not want to see a repeat of Budapest in 1956 or Prague in 1968. The threat of Soviet intervention in Poland will only be enhanced if the basic fabric of Polish society breaks down and if; in this coming winter, which will be the most crucial time, food and medical supplies are not available to the Polish people. In the last year we have seen the establishment of one of the biggest trade union or mass movements in world history. That union has grown from nothing to having 10 million members in 12 months. If we as Australian democrats do not support that movement, in my view all our speeches on the faults of the Soviet Union and everything else go to water. I commend the matter of public importance and urge the Government to take some action on it.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad that Senator Sibraa has brought forward this matter of public importance because it is very important. I think the Senate has to address itself to three issues: How did Poland get itself into such an economic mess; how can it get out of it; and what assistance, if any, should we provide to help it to do so? Let us look at the first question, namely, how it got into its present economic mess. There is no doubt that Poland is in an economic mess. Just as a few examples, meat, sugar, butter, flour and rice are among the foods now on ration. But even rationing has not been enough to ensure supplies. The meat ration these days is three kilograms per person per month. But still the queues at butchers' shops start 24 hours before opening time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not only meat that is desperately short. As usual the Poles have summed up the situation with one of their jokes. They define a Polish sandwich as being a meat coupon between two bread coupons. Everyone talks about the black market where meat and other foods fetch four or five times the official price. At the moment a husband coming off night shift will often take his wife's place in a queue and often whole families will queue at one shop. That may be the only time in days that the whole family can get together. In fact, absenteeism in order to queue is having a very serious effect on Polish production and some observers think it is a more serious cause of loss of production than are strikes. </PARA>
<PARA> Why are the Poles short of food? After all, Poland is a very fertile agricultural country and it should at least be self-supporting. I think there is no doubt that the catastrophic state of Polish agriculture is the result of communist dogma. In a way I wish that Senator Gietzelt were taking part in this debate. He could probably explain to the Senate how it is all the fault of America. I believe it is quite clearly the result of the application of the communist system under which very inefficient state farms have been established and there has been discrimination against private farmers. Foreign capital has been squandered on those state farms and of course the farmers have been denied the machinery and fertilisers they need. The price of meat has been so poor that it is no longer worth breeding pigs for the market. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4H4">Senator HAMER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it may well be, although I think all Eastern European countries or communist countries have deplorable productivity, and Poland, of course, is only one example of that. One thing that is happening is that Poland's one and a quarter million worker peasants are dividing their time between working in industry and farming. If they want to get more productivity they should certainly devote more of their time to agriculture. The other enormous problem for Poland is that it is $US27 billion in debt to the West, and the rolling over of this debt is one of the biggest problems facing both the West and Poland. Not only, of course, has Poland's problem been caused by the application of communist dogma but it has also been compounded by the reaction of the people to the communist dogma and their attempts to set up free institutions, the Solidarity trade union movement being the best publicised. This has made the problem worse in the short term, though it does, of course, hold out hopes for the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That really brings us to the second question-how can Poland get out of its present mess? One solution, I suppose, would be to go back to rigid communism. That would at least get people back to work and improve productivity a little. It would still be deplorable but it would improve it a little. I do not think that that is a solution that we would recommend or that the Polish people, having tried it once, would accept. The only way I think such a solution would happen would be if the Soviet Union imposed it. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had an exposition from Senator Sibraa, with which I agree, of why it is unlikely that the Soviet Union will intervene in Poland. Poland is not like Hungary or Czechoslovakia. There the Communist Party was still in control. All that the Soviet Union had to do was to exterminate the liberals who were running the Communist Party, impose its own people, and the party machine structure was still in place. If the Soviet Union moved now into Poland, it could take over the government, yes; but how could it impose the government's will on the trade union movement and the people of Poland? There would be fighting; there would be strikes; there would be an intolerable economic situation which would be worse than it is now and, moreover, the Soviet Union would have to take on the responsibility of financing Poland without any assistance from the West. I think that is a prospect that the Soviet Union is not prepared to face. </PARA>
<PARA> In considering how Poland can get out of its situation we must realise that Poland has a lot going for it. It has large coal resources; it is the biggest sulphur producer in the world; it has large reserves of iron ore; it has a highly efficient shipbuilding industry; it is expert in electronics; it has a young and skilled work force. It has, if properly managed, a very great deal going for it. What we must look for is some way in which we can assist it or try to prevent it from being stopped from sorting out its internal situation, getting people back to work, giving incentives, getting the highly inefficient government regulation system off the back of the Polish economy because, as I said, Poland has a lot going for it. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look at the sort of economic aid Poland needs from the West, we must avoid the mistakes of the attempts in the early 1970s to give it aid when Western loans underwrote the mismanaged and ill-founded schemes of the discredited Polish communist leader, Edward Gierek. This aid for Poland would come mostly from the European Economic Community and the United States, and what I hope will be achieved is that the loans will be conditional on the restructuring of the whole economic system in Poland and the jettisoning of the terribly anti-productivity government regulation system and its incentives and economic planning systems, which are totally destructive of any desire to produce any efficient production system. That, I think, would have to be encouraged by the way in which economic assistance is given to Poland. </PARA>
<PARA> We have already given Poland some assistance. As requested by the Polish Government, we made available to it $40m in credits for the purchases of wool in order to keep its wool mills going. That is what the Polish Government asked for and we provided it, and it is working. That is one type of assistance that is valuable. Poland has a very great and urgent need for food assistance. As Senator Guilfoyle said, because of convenience and availability the main providers of this assistance, will be Western Europe, the European Economic Community. But we can and should help where we can provide important assistance. So far, I am told, $5m has been given in personal aid, mainly through the churches, by people chiefly of Polish origin. I think this should be encouraged. There will, I understand, be a new appeal for food aid for Poland launched in a few weeks. I hope the Government will support this appeal and make a donation and encourage donations to the appeal by offering tax deductibility because I think it is important that the present ferment in Poland should not collapse and Russian involvement and invasion be encouraged through turmoil resulting from food shortages. I think what we can do, we should do. But the essential feature of Poland recovering from her present economic disaster is a total restructuring of its system of government and the harnessing of the enormous abilities and potential of the Polish people to serve the interests of freedom and prosperity in Poland. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On a bitterly cold day in January of this year a cluster of farmers came together and marched into the tiny village of Inowroclaw in Central Poland. It was a demonstration in support of Rural Solidarity, the peasants' union that the Government of that country had up to that moment been refusing to recognise. What was important was that the peasants who were then marching, the protesters there involved, carried their scythes fixed vertically on to the wooden shafts like giant bayonets and, as any Pole will tell us, that has quite a deal of symbolism to it. In 1794 under Kosciusko, the American revolutionary war hero who had returned to Poland to help his people in what turned out to be a doomed insurrection against the Russian and Prussian occupiers, that is how Kosciusko's troops armed themselves-with their scythes on wooden shafts. Our most noble and highest peak in Australia is called Kosciusko after that Polish revolutionary hero. I hope that links can be forged once again between the Australian and the Polish people, not of a merely symbolic or geographical kind but, as is commended to the Senate today, of a real humanitarian kind, of a kind which not only satisfies the hunger of the people of Poland in the coming severe winter but also satisfies their craving to establish a truly democratic society in which the lives of the industrial workers, the urban workers and the peasants are humanised.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that the Polish peasants should not be held responsible for the present dire shortage of foodstuffs for their countrymen. As we know, the Polish Government cannot afford to import food to any great extent. That is due to the catastrophic collapse of its export trade, particularly in coal. Whereas in 1979 some 41 million tonnes of Polish coal were sold abroad, it seems that in the coming year only some 2 million tonnes of coal will find their way to export markets. Honourable senators can imagine the catastrophic effect that has on the ability of the Polish Government to use hard currency earnings for the purchase of the meagre foodstuffs that are needed to sustain the people. </PARA>
<PARA> The farmers have been prevented from farming efficiently. That has been done by a system of selling to fixed and controlled markets; by a system which denies them fertiliser, tractors and such like unless they do indeed sell to those government-controlled markets; by a system which requires peasants to sell so much to the state market in order to guarantee their title to their land from year to year. Indeed, one of Rural Solidarity's claims-it asks that this be written into the Constitution-is that the farmers be given a title to their land. It is really a cry reminiscent of that of some of the Aboriginal people, of which we hear so much in this chamber. In fact, the Polish peasants are denied true title to their land. It is no wonder that there has been a catastrophic collapse of their ability to feed the nation, an ability which no one would deny could bring those lands to fruition if the farmers were allowed to gain access to the fertilisers, the pesticides and the equipment needed to make their lands flourish. But at the moment there is no doubt that as the winter approaches the Polish people will be hungry. It behoves us to try to alleviate that sheer human suffering. </PARA>
<PARA> Three years ago it was a severe winter which brought the regime of Edward Gierek to the brink. As Senator Sibraa so well pointed out, another severe winter without adequate food could prove the breaking point for Poland's last chance of staving off Russian-backed reassertion of hard-line Communist Party superiority. General Jaruzelski does appear to be negotiating with the new forces within the industrial working class, the peasants and the Catholic Church to provide a framework within which national decision making by Poles can take place. It may well be their last chance. There can be no doubt that the provision of food-the simple act of providing meat, wheat and sugar-will enable the Polish people to get through this winter without such crippling strikes or civic rioting as might precipitate that Soviet-backed reassertion of hard-line Communist Party authority. </PARA>
<PARA> In sending food we would not merely be alleviating distress of the body; I believe that we would indeed be succouring the Polish soul. We would be aiding a revolution, a revolution which has seen for the first time in Eastern Europe, on such a wide scale, the withdrawal of allegiance from the State and the Communist Party in favour of an organisation which, as Senator Robert Ray so well documented, was illegal a matter of months ago. It is a revolution which commands our support. It commands our support because of its evidently democratic basis. That it is democratic, that it is really based on the people, cannot be denied. The numbers, the tens of millions, who flocked to its banners are sufficient evidence of that. It should demand or require our support not only because it is a democratic movement but also because it has shown a non-violent character. I think that is something which has to be remarked upon and commended. </PARA>
<PARA> The people have formed free trade unions against the will of the party. They have exercised free speech against the will of the party. They have become free by courageously acting as a free people and they have done so non-violently and with tremendous courage. The party has been unable to grapple with this phenomenon because, indeed, this revolution by the people paradoxically proves one of Marx's hopes; namely, that the working people can take control of their destinies, can take control of their lives, can attempt to humanise their conditions of labour, within the industrial proletariat or as peasants on the land, and can humanise society as a whole. They can do that without the aid of the state, which has indeed withered away as far as the working people of Poland are concerned, and without the arrogant claims of the party to lead the proletariat into the future. These claims have been stripped bare by the courageous actions of the people of Poland so that the military and bureaucratic underpinning of the state has withered to an extent which now enables the coalition of forces-as I said, the industrial working class, the peasants, the Catholic Church and the Communist Party-to achieve some sort of national framework within which decisions can be made about Poland's future. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a fact though that as winter approaches, as the food queues grow longer, the constant strikes and civic unrest over food shortages which may occur could provide that context within which a reassertion of hard line Soviet-backed Communist Party authority could take place. Solidarity cannot be expected to control the cries of women wanting food for their children. The October and November Press of this year made that quite clear. For example, an article in the International Herald Tribune of 14 October, headed 'Some Sections Of Solidarity Go On Strike', reported that, whereas the presidium of Solidarity called for a moratorium on local strikes, it was disclosed that some regions after the presidium appeal decided to call off protests but others went ahead and about 10,000 workers in about 50 local plants in one area sat in to protest dwindling food supplies. In the first week of November about 12,000 women textile workers went on strike for more food despite the calls of Solidarity to restrain that sort of protest. It is quite clear that Solidarity will not be able to control this continuing disintegration, this continuing provocation to the hardliners within the Community Party in the absence of adequate food for the people during winter. For that reason, Australians must do what is possible to aid the Polish people to obtain that food. We are not talking about intervention by military means or about direct interference with the internal political affairs of that nation. We simply need to aid the people to eat and therefore to carry through their democratic revolution. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle mentioned that Mr Street, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, will be visiting Poland-I think she said next week-in the context of a wider European and United States of America tour. She made the point that it may be that Australia is not as advantageously placed as some other nations are to move aid into Poland expeditiously enough because of transport problems and such like. Surely it would not be beyond the wit of Mr Street and the Government to devise a means whereby Australian money can be used to purchase food from the European Economic Community, some minor fraction of the lake of milk and dairy products held by the Common Market, some minor hill within the mountain of meat which is held by the Common Market countries and some of the medical supplies which are so abundant in Western Europe. Surely the Australian Government could provide moneys directly for purchase of foodstuffs and medical supplies within Western Europe and move them by the shorter lines of transport directly into Poland. </PARA>
<PARA> On 7 August the French Socialist Government announced that it was rushing food aid-322,000 tonnes of grain, beef, sugar and fruit-to Poland with no political strings attached. If the new Socialist Government of France can respond with such alacrity and compassion, can we do less? On 28 October the United States Government announced it would supply Poland with $29m worth of surplus dairy products to help that country resolve its pressing difficulties peacefully and without foreign interference. Can we be any less realistic than the United States Government in that regard? After all, it is a fact that we trade extensively in foodstuffs with Warsaw Pact countries and with the Soviet Union, the potential oppressor of the Polish people. In the last year, 1980-81, we sent some $581m worth of food to the Soviet Union, of which $104m was in the area of meat or meat products and $486m in the area of cereal grains and preparations. One recalls the ill-conceived-and ill-dismantled-grain embargo of the Soviet Union after the Afghanistan invasion. Cannot we do something a little more constructive on this occasion? I believe the Australian people would want their Government to respond generously and expeditiously to the cries of the Polish people as they face a gruelling winter. </PARA>
<PARA> We have had a long association with the Polish people. As to my own State of Tasmania, as Senator Harradine may be about to remark, after the Second World War quite a few came to Tasmania to work on hydro-electric projects throughout the State. No doubt many other States have similar experience of the strength and hard work which the Polish people brought into Australia after the conflagration in Europe in the 1940s. We have historic links, symbolised by the naming of Mount Kosciusko, our most noble peak, after the revolutionary hero of Poland who was doomed to failure in his attempt to throw off the Russian yoke back in the 1790s. I hope that the link with the Polish people can be continued. As we see the changing colours of the trees and shrubs of Canberra next autumn, may we be able to be humbly grateful that, in part because of our support in the provision of basic foodstuffs, the Polish people will be entering their spring, a spring of the revival of nature and of a flowering of the Polish nation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the raising of the matter of the importance of the need for Australian food aid for Poland. I do so conscious of the fact that this is indeed an historic occasion in that it seems that honourable senators on both sides of the chamber are at one in their support for the Polish people. As far back as November last year I gave notice of a motion in these terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) views with alarm the possibility of the use of armed force and even Soviet intervention against Polish workers seeking bread, peace and that freedom of association enshrined in International Labour Organisation Convention No. 87 concerning Freedom of Association and Protection of the Right to Organise;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) notes that the Convention has been ratified by both the Soviet Union and Poland; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) calls on the Government-</PARA>
<PARA> (i) to warn the Polish and Soviet authorities of the dire and world-wide consequences of the use of armed force against Polish workers and their families;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) to raise the issue urgently, as a signatory to the Convention, with the International Labour Organisation and the United Nations; and</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) to organise an appropriate and effective response to the dangerous situation which confronts not only the Polish workers but the entire world. </PARA>
<PARA>That notice of motion is now General Business No. 9 on the Notice Paper. I hope and expect that the Government will see that notice of motion to be somewhat similar to the matter now before the House for discussion as a matter of public importance, in other words, to that part of it which deals with organising an appropriate and effective response to a dangerous situation, a response not only in a military sense but also, particularly at this time, in an economic sense. </PARA>
<PARA> As other senators have mentioned, the Polish people face a very hard winter indeed. I had the pleasure last Saturday night of being part of a very large crowd packed into the Polish Association's hall in Hobart to provide practical support for the appeal that is being made throughout Australia for the Polish people. The fact is that those people who were present were from a broad section of the community. As I understand it, they represented all the mainstream sections of the Australian community. Those people were prepared to show their civic courage in supporting the Polish people. </PARA>
<PARA> I was not on the list of speakers for this discussion so I do not propose to speak at length about the matter, of which I have spoken both outside and within this chamber on a number of occasions. However, I do wish to refer to the fact that the respected Professor George Zubrzycki, an Australian of Polish origin, recently referred to the fact that the Polish people want political freedom first, which would lead to economic recovery, and that the Soviet Union realised this and was attempting to strangle Poland economically. He was reported in the Canberra Times recently as saying that for a bloodless revolution to succeed, people outside Poland have to give moral and economic support. He said that we must show civic courage in supporting the Polish people. On 15 October I asked the Minister representing the Prime Minister what commitment the Government had made or would make in respect of economic aid to the Polish people and what form that aid would take. The Minister gave a sympathetic reply at the time and said that he would seek further detail. I followed up that question on 10 November this year, that is to say last week, and I feel that it is important in this discussion to remind the Government of what the Minister then said. In response to my question he said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is true that the Government has a very real and practical sympathy for the people of Poland in their present plight. The matter of the nature of support is under consideration by the Government in terms of aid generally and the nature of the aid. I am not able, as a matter of immediacy, to specify that support. I hope that that announcement can be made at an early date. I certainly have a sense of urgency about it, and so does the Government. As to the question of donations being tax deductible, I am aware that there are throughout the community in Australia a number of undertakings to raise money and materials. I will make sure that the Treasurer and the Cabinet give that matter consideration. I hope that at an early date I will be able to give more specific information to Senator Harradine. </PARA>
<PARA>I do feel that the discussion which has been put forward by Senator Sibraa is a most important one. I hope that the Government supporters and Ministers in the Senate in supporting this matter will impress upon the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Street) our combined wish to ensure that we play our part, that we do show civic courage and that we do make our contribution to the development of social justice with freedom in Poland. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply state finally that the position in Poland has been a most interesting one. Those who developed the formation of the free trade union movement, Solidarity, did so within the bounds of international convention and the International Labour Organisation. They knew that what they were doing was within those bounds. They also knew there could be no justification whatsoever for attempts to crush them for what they were doing. The foundations had been laid over a long period. It must have been disconcerting for those who believed in the free trade union movement to see free trade unions from the Western world sending visitors to the bogus trade unions in Poland prior to the free trade union movement coming into its own. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is important for us in the trade union movement in the Western world to realise that such visits are counter productive and against the best interests of trade unions and trade unionists not only in those countries but also in this country. In other words, I would like to see an end put to the reciprocal visits of trade unionists from Australia to bogus organisations within the communist countries where their presence gives some credence to the oft repeated phrases of their communist masters who say that these unions are free. The proof of the pudding in regard to what has happened in Poland is that those trade unions were not free. They did not take long to wither on the vine when the true free trade union came up from the rank and file. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is discussing the need for Australian food aid to Poland. Indeed, I am not surprised to find around the chamber that there is a general consensus that there is such a need. It is our obligation, along with all the other fortunate free countries in the world, to do something about it. When there has been genuine need around the world-wherever it may have been-I think Australia historically has played its part to a very real and large degree. Of course, in the passage of time perhaps we have concentrated most of our efforts in what one probably considers to be the traditional areas for Australian aid and development programs. There are all sorts of geographical, social and economic reasons for that to be so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the same time we have played, and continue to play, a significant role around the world in helping people confronted by emergency circumstances. This applies not necessarily just to the developing societies. Indeed, in the case of Poland we have a highly developed society which has run into extraordinarily difficult times for all sorts of reasons. One would hope and believe that this circumstance is not a continuing one. It certainly fits the description of being an emergency situation. In that sort of situation there are only a few limiting factors of which we as Australians must be aware. Of course, in the case of food, one factor would be our capacity to provide for the needs of the people concerned. There can be no doubt that Australia has a significant capacity in this field. In the fields of food production-of agriculture in particular-and of fibre production, Australia ranks as the most efficient, on a per capita basis, of any country in the world. Consequently, on those grounds it has a great capacity to lend aid. </PARA>
<PARA> Another factor to be considered is our financial capacity. I mention this only because one has, at all times, to relate the financial capacity-the burden of the Australian taxpayer-to the world of reality. Indeed, if we adopt conditions that in any significant way destroy the socio-economic level of Australians, equally we destroy our capacity to help those people in many places around the world who so urgently need help. I refer again to my earlier comment that we in Australia have a traditional area in which we have given significant aid and development over many decades. That significant area is South East Asia, the southern borders of the Asian continent itself, Africa, and, indeed, our near neighbours in the South Pacific. Whilst we give a significant priority to those parts of the mainly developing world, we are not unaware of our obligations wherever emergencies, such as the Polish situation arise. </PARA>
<PARA> One cannot discuss a matter such as the one we are talking of this afternoon without being aware of the tragedy there is when an old European country such as Poland is confronted with the sorts of problems that confront it today. The Polish people have a very proud record. They come from a productive and fertile land. Ironically they contributed very significantly, in the conflict of 1939-1945, to the survival of freedom in many parts of the world. Significantly, basically because of the imposition of a system which, in a sense, knows no freedom, they are today in the circumstance in which they find themselves and it is necessary for Australia and many other free societies around the world to come to their aid. Indeed, I believe there is something sad also in the fact that European countries have been, and remain, amongst the world's leaders in the field of temperate and sub-temperate agriculture, in the field of breeding of plants and stock, yet here we have a famous European country in significant danger of severe famine. Surely in this situation there must be considerable obligation on her Eastern neighbours to help. For indeed it is largely the political system and the socio-economic circumstances of those neighbours that Poland has adopted-probably without much opportunity to make a free decision. If that system is failing to produce the basic necessities of the Polish way of life then there is a massive obligation on her Eastern neighbours, as well as on the rest of the world, to come to her succour. As this food dilemma confronts the Polish people in particular-it is a dilemma that has gone far beyond food itself-it has to be asked whether in the Polish situation a totally inappropriate system of agriculture and pastoral development has been imposed. Bad seasons may well have played their part. As I understand it they have played their part in the circumstances of the Russian economy today. They may well have played a part in the circumstances in Poland. But I believe that the situation is more related to inappropriate systems of agriculture and pastoral development. Indeed, they perhaps relate to changes in the nature and traditions of the communities in Poland. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia makes a significant contribution to the supply of food around the world. Her contribution at the moment, measured in terms of percentage of gross domestic product, is 0.47 per cent. This is at a time when most countries around the world aim to reach 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product eventually. We must never forget that even though we retain our determination to reach that upper limit our capacity to do so is clearly related to the rate and enthusiasm of the development of our massive potential in the resources field. </PARA>
<PARA> I draw my remarks to a conclusion by saying once again that the Polish situation is a sad and serious one and that the Australian Government is aware of the problems and is making and will continue to make significant contributions to their solution. One measure has been mentioned here this afternoon; that is, the contribution of some $40m worth of credit. This has played a significant part in enabling Polish factories to keep moving, maintaining and developing a sense of achievement amongst Polish families and workers. It is esential that the world not only comes to the succour of Poland with the material needs that she has today but also that it helps, wherever necessary, to create circumstances in which the Polish people can establish once again the sort of society, objectives and values that they have built throughout their history.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was honoured to have the opportunity of being a member of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation which visited Pakistan and India during the period 19 July to 3 August this year. The delegation's prime purpose was to gather information about the countries it visited and observe at first hand the conditions currently prevailing, and to exchange views with as many of the people from all walks of life as possible. The delegation's other aim was to express the interest and good will of the Australian Parliament and people towards Pakistan and India. We were fortunate that the very full program provided adequate opportunities to meet and have wide ranging discussions with not only parliamentary and government officials but also representatives of industry, commerce and the professions. It was noteworthy that in both the countries visited we were made aware that Australia's increasing interest in the Asian region was welcomed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The delegation was also pleased to have had the opportunity during the tour to observe at first hand some Australian aid projects. We pay tribute to the dedication and enthusiasm of the Australian personnel working on these projects. In both countries we visited we noted that there was genuine appreciation of Australia's contribution in project and food aid. I wish to place on record our appreciation and gratitude for the assistance and guidance we received from the Australian Ambassador to Pakistan, the Australian High Commissioner to India and the Australian Consul-General in Bombay, together with their staffs. The delegation benefited greatly from their experience and background advice. </PARA>
<PARA> During our time in Pakistan we were received by the President, General Mohammad Zia-ul-Haq, the Governors of the Sind and Punjab provinces and a number of Ministers, government officials and leading representatives from commerce and industry. The visit included the Sind, Punjab and the north-west frontier provinces. We appreciate that Pakistan is facing many problems both externally and domestically. We found that active measures are being taken to overcome them. On the domestic scene much is being done to reduce the rate of population growth, to raise the level of agricultural productivity and to develop natural resources such as minerals, natural gas and oils. Steps are also being taken to improve the balance of payments situation. We as a delegation were most impressed with what we learnt of the manner in which the Pakistan Government is handling the very difficult Afghan refugee problem. The Government and all concerned deserve the highest praise for their efforts and as much assistance with their difficult task as is reasonably possible. </PARA>
<PARA> Internationally, Pakistan faces a number of difficulties. Not the least of these is the continuing strained relationship with India. We believe that while some progress has been made in this regard it still needs to be done. We trust that a normalisation of relationships can be achieved given time, patience and a better mutual understanding. Strained relations between Pakistan and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, which have existed for a considerable time, have been exacerbated by the invasion of Afghanistan and a spread of Russian influence in the area. We believe that this situation will not change in the short term and indeed cannot do so until the Russians withdraw and until a situation exists which will permit the return of the refugee population. </PARA>
<PARA> The program in India was a heavy one which involved a considerable amount of internal air travel. Nevertheless the delegation felt that despite the vastness of the country and the diversity of its people, customs and religions we were able to gain some appreciation of India's current problems and achievements, past and present. The delegation was honoured to be received by the Prime Minister, Mrs Indira Gandhi, Presiding Officers of the Union Parliament and Ministers, Government officials and a number of representatives of commerce and industry. We were impressed by the frankness and friendliness of our discussions with Ministers and their senior officials, and were particularly grateful for the opportunity of meeting the Prime Minister. During our visit we were able to gain some appreciation of India's current problems of unemployment, population growth and the movement of the population into urban areas. Nevertheless it was obvious that much had been done and was being done in an endeavour to overcome these and other problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The increase in food production as a result of agricultural research problems, the adoption of better farm management techniques and the development of better strains of food crops and livestock is but one example. The delegation considered that opportunities existed for Australia to expand its rural development aid projects and that consideration should be given to increasing parliamentary, scientific, technological, trade and cultural exchanges between the two countries. We had the opportunity of visiting a number of Australian aid projects which appear to be fully meeting the needs for which they were established. While there has been some question of the necessity for this type of aid this delegation strongly recommends that Australia should appreciably increase its level of aid to the development of Third World countries, such as India and Pakistan. In summary, we believe that our visit to these countries was an extremely worthwhile exercise and would hope that the recommendations listed in this report are given adequate consideration by those concerned. I commend this report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; When this debate was interrupted last Thursday night I had just begun to raise the matter of the proposed transfer of patients from what is known, in South Australia anyway, as the 'old folks' home at Magill to another nursing home at Windana in another section of the city of Adelaide. The matter is one of some contention in South Australia. It has emanated from a proposal by the State Minister of Health, Mrs Adamson, that the Federal Government should transfer its funding of 73 beds for the aged at the Magill nursing home to Windana and, in fact, extend the subsidy to apply to some 91 beds. The proposal to close the infirmary at the Magill home has caused some distress to the occupants. Recently I received a letter from some people associated with that home which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am writing on behalf of a group of independent concerned citizens to ask you to attend a Press conference on the Magill Home-Windana deadlock. My group has no political affiliations whatsoever but is concerned to find out the reason for the transfer of the infirmary patients from Magill to Windana psycho-geriatric home. </PARA>
<PARA>For reasons which have nothing to do with any lack of continuing concern, that Press conference was never held. However, the distress continues. </PARA>
<PARA> The infirmary under discussion is part of a multi-campus institution, if I may put it that way. It is, in fact, on the same grounds as those of the old folks home itself, and for some 60 years underprivileged people in the area have been used, when the time comes, to transfering from the home itself to the infirmary. They live in the home while they are able to care for themselves and are admitted to the infirmary when they are no longer able to do so. It is, in fact, a genuine geriatric wing. </PARA>
<PARA> The proposal to transfer Federal funding and patients to Windana would involve transferring people from a home that they have known, in some cases, for 25 or 30 years-from a familiar and pleasant environment to one that would be unfamiliar and not nearly so attractive. That in itself is bad enough. It is worsened by the fact that Windana is known to be a psycho-geriatric home. It is not surprising then, that these elderly people, susceptible as they are at their age to the effects of change, should also be concerned that they will be slighted in that they will be branded as being not just elderly, not just unable to care for themselves physically, but also mentally infirm. Of course, that is something that they do not want to happen. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been suggested by the Minister of Health in South Australia that the Magill home is sub-standard, that vast amounts of money would be required to bring it to standard and that it would be better all round if these people were moved to Windana. No one seems able to find out really why the Minister is placing such a high cost on the upkeep of Magill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I may have missed a little of what Senator Haines said while coming to the chamber from my office but I hope that the information I have with me will be of some use to her. In considering these appropriations the Commonwealth has a very limited compass within which to play a role or preserve an interest. I understand that what happens concerning the Magill home is a matter for the South Australian Government. The home is approved under the National Health Act for the receipt of nursing home benefits, so to that extent we do have an interest.

It is understood that the South Australian authorities have put a proposal to the Commonwealth-State Co-ordinating Committee in this regard. The requirement to submit proposals to that Committee has existed only since 1 September 1981 in respect of Government homes. Prior to that date the approvals for nursing home benefits for Government homes did not have to go to the Committee. They now have to. The proposal is based upon the Magill home and upon the wish, as I understand it, of the South Australian Government at least to vary the functions of Magill or vacate Magill, but I am not entirely certain as to what its goals are there. What I can tell the honourable senator is that Windana is situated in an area which in the past has been considered to have sufficient nursing home beds. Although one cannot say it is absolute that the population/bed ratio will be indeterminate, this is an area which has been considered to have sufficient nursing home beds.</PARA></TALK.START>

I take on board and note the expressions of concern by Senator Haines for the people who reside at Magill and who are expressing opposition to a change.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise a domiciliary care matter of which, unfortunately, I was not aware when I was at the Estimates Committee hearing. It applies to a household in which, perhaps, the wife is ill and has been hospitalised but, as a form of therapy and in the best interests of her health, she is returned home. Her husband is working and it is necessary for him to continue in that job. She nevertheless is being cared for by such organisations as the Silver Chain Nursing Association Inc. and a part time housekeeper has been called in to give as much domestic assistance as possible. He is not considered by the Department to be providing her with full time nursing care at home and therefore is not able to claim for domiciliary care. I would like some determination by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) as to whether perhaps a pro rata payment should not be made or at least considered by the Government in these cases which preclude people from becoming institutionalised. I think it provides people who could otherwise be institutionalised with a more stable and healthy life.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It puts great strains on the family budget, particularly when the other member of the family is perhaps undereducated or in a low income position. In this instance the wife does not need full time care in the home but she certainly does need some care. She is taken care of by the husband before he leaves for work, by the part time housekeeper when she comes in, and by the Silver Chain and other services which provide her with some company during the day. I recognise that it is difficult to single out individual cases. Nevertheless I think there is a great need in our community, unless we accept the proposition that all ill people should be hospitalised or institutionalised, for some form of relief for them. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Chairman, I seek your guidance in this matter. There are other matters which I wish to raise concerning the votes for the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. I seek your advice as to whether I should raise those matters now or whether the Minister would care to take them individually. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Chairman. Perhaps I could then raise the matter that Senator Giles raised on my behalf in regard to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. That matter concerned the provision of immediate services when they are required by Aboriginal communities. I cited the instance of the Nicholson Downs Station people who left their home on Nicholson Downs, with the exception of the pensioners as they referred to them, and set themselves up as a community on the outskirts of Halls Creek. At the time I arrived at Halls Creek-I have raised this matter on a number of occasions in the Senate-the community of some 30 or 40 people, including young children, had one canvas fly and were being provided by the Shire with a 44 gallon drum of fresh water each day. It was not until I sent an urgent telegram to the Director of the Department of Community Welfare in Western Australia that we were able to provide them with tents. I might mention once again the fact that the overnight ground temperature was down to 4 degrees at that time and I was concerned for health and welfare particularly of the children who were there.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other matter which arose at that same time was that of the payment of unemployment benefits to Aboriginal people who were working on stations as stockmen or station hands. I am led to believe that this is not an uncommon practice; a fairly large number of white pastoralists are in fact employing Aboriginal people as stockmen and stock hands. They are not being paid; it is not costing the stations any money. They provide them with accommodation but, quite frankly, from some of the accommodation I have seen, if a health inspector were to inspect it, they would not be allowed to live in it. But the matter still remains that there appears to be a large number of people who are being employed and who are not being paid but are in receipt of unemployment benefits. I raised this matter in relation to the Nicholson Downs Station, but it is not a unique circumstance. Officers of the Department, not those present when the estimates were being examined but other officers I have spoken to, have confirmed that it is not an unusual circumstance. </PARA>
<PARA> I have raised in this chamber the question of whether in fact the Government will institute an inquiry into this matter. I think it should be a relatively easy one to undertake. It is simply a case of establishing whether Aboriginal people who are working as stockmen or stock hands are actually receiving unemployment benefits. If this is so, surely the questions that have to be answered by the station owner are: What is he doing and how long has he been ripping off the Australian taxpayer? As I said, the provision of accommodation on stations is not generally of a very high standard. I think the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs would agree with me. He has seen, for instance, while the community was still there, the accommodation provided on such places as Gordon Downs which was an absolute disgrace. It is heartening to know that the members of the community have now been moved to a place where they find they can relate to the land and can provide their community with the necessary back-up system. But that is not an ideal situation even yet, and it will take some time before it is. However, the question that was raised on my behalf by Senator Giles at the Estimates Committee hearing still remains as to whether an estimation has ever been done by the Department of Social Security or, indeed, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs of how rife the practice is of employing people and not paying them wages but requesting that they receive unemployment benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> From that springs another problem, and that is the tendency on the part of white station owners to retain the unemployment benefit cheques and the sickness benefit cheques and to hold them at the store in payment of goods that may at some future time be received. The Minister would be aware that a large number of complaints have certainly been received by me and, I presume by his Department also, that the books never quite balance. The white station owners have been heard to say that the Aboriginals just do not understand the amounts of money that they have spent on such things as transistor radios and tape recorders. Nevertheless, the fact remains that complaints have been lodged, as I am sure they have been lodged with the Department on any number of occasions, and a proper answer has never been given by the Minister either in this chamber or at the Estimates committee hearings. Those were the questions that I asked Senator Giles to raise on my behalf. The response I got was a no-answer answer in that it did not pay attention to my suggestion that a large number of white station owners were claiming unemployment benefits while they were employing station hands. </PARA>

For reasons which Senator Coleman understands, it is not so clear cut. We would not want to see a community left with inadequate resources. Senator Coleman talked about one canvas fly.

If there are complaints I would like to learn of them in enough detail so that we can move in and act upon them. In the Kimberley either Mr Feldman or Mr Sheridan, may two area officers who look after the region, would be looking for any information. We certainly would undertake to investigate any instances-there is no worry about this-and to make known to my colleague, the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney), any instance which we would investigate. Like the honourable senator, we think that practice would be illegal and quite improper. I must say to Senator Coleman that while it is an ex parte matter, while I cannot hear of an instance which I can investigate and in which we can be fair to both sides, I do not know how to answer her in any satisfactory way. I appeal to her for some assistance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other matter of accounts at stores is a recurring problem. It seems that those communities whose stores operate best are those communities in which the stores do not give or take credit. The communities that have a strong rule of cash on the knocker are the ones that do well and in which this kind of discord is held to a minimum. That applies regardless of whether the store is operated by Aboriginal communities for themselves or by others for the Aboriginal communities. Again, if there are instances where there are disputes about the veracity or accuracy of accounts which people have run up at the stores, could we know about those? We undertake to investigate them. We can take up this matter and continue our examination of both these problms. I certainly will do that with the honourable senator. I cannot give her an answer at the moment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to raise a matter that concerns the Department of Social Security. It is a small matter. The Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) will recall that last Thursday I asked a question in relation to recovery action when alleged overpayments had been made. I asked recovery action continued while an appeal was before the Social Security Appeals Tribunal and whether it also continued if an appeal was before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. If there was a difference, I asked what was the reason for the difference. Naturally, I could not expand on the question during Question Time but I can now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I asked the question because I found that in the case of one person in Queensland while he had an appeal before the Social Security Appeals Tribunal no recovery action was taken for his alleged overpayment, but when that appeal was dismissed and he subsequently appealed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal recovery action continued even though that appeal was before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. It seemed strange to me that there was a difference in that while the appeal was before one body no recovery action was taken but while an appeal to another body was proceeding recovery action was being taken. I just ask the Minister at this stage whether he has any information and whether, in fact, what was occurring in Queensland was correct. If it was correct, what is the reason for a different type of action when an appeal is before a different tribunal?</PARA>

That is, are the 11 per cent and the 7 per cent or so of people who do not have any cover at all supposed to include people who have eligibility for health cards but who have not applied, or are they people who are not eligible for health cards and have not taken out any other form of health insurance?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When we were last dealing with the Appropriation Bills in Committee last Thursday Senator Coates raised another matter. Perhaps I should come back to that when I have dealt with the inquiry he has raised now. The latest advice I have from my Department, which takes us through to 6 November, is that there have been 118,511 claims for health cards. Of course, that does not mean that 118,511 individuals have health cards because a good number of those applications relate to the heads of families and hence cover the members of a family and not merely the individual who has applied for and received the card. Of the estimated three million people who are covered by the new health arrangements, about two million are existing holders of pensioner health benefit cards or are dependants of those card holders who are automatically covered by their existing cards. Of course, they have not been subjected to any change under the new system. They have continued to receive the cover which they had according to the cards which they have held for some time. Of the remaining one million or so people estimated to be eligible for the new health care cards, approximately half are registered unemployment and special beneficiaries or their dependants. Once again, those people do not have to apply for cards; they receive them automatically when they are issued by my Department every two weeks.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not relating to those percentage figures; the honourable senator will have to ping pong the ball back to this side. I am talking about the estimated cover of around three million people which was referred to by the Government. About half a million of those non-pensioner health benefit card holders are people who automatically get cover through the system because they are unemployment or special beneficiaries. The estimate-I emphasise that it has to be an estimate because it relates to the number of people who might be within the income limits that are prescribed-is that 200,000 or so individuals or heads of low income earning and migrant families might be able to apply for cards. We cannot put a precise figure on that but that is the Department's estimate. The actual number of cards issued, 118,000, is therefore a quite healthy figure in that it indicates that a quite high proportion of those people who are entitled have actually applied and received cards. About 60 per cent of those who qualify solely as low income earners or as migrants are thought to have applied. As I said before, that has to be an estimate. Of course there is still room for concern about the fact that that leaves about 40 per cent of that number not covered. I would simply refer again to the point made by my colleague Senator Peter Baume a few minutes ago, that those people are entitled to make retrospective claims and they do have a full 13 weeks in which to lodge claims after seeking treatment before their entitlement to a refund for the service performed lapses. There is that additional safeguard for them. To give one further point of detail, the number of low income claims is 104,408 and the number of immigrant claims is 14,103. I repeat that that is at 6 November 1981. Presumably there would have been some applications since that time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Last week Senator Coates raised the question of overseas students and referred to the fact that a number of circulars had gone out with respect to the eligibility of overseas students for health care. I have sought information from the Department on the matters he has raised. Initial instructions covering overseas students were sent to the State offices on 28 August. The new scheme applied from 1 September. Those instructions were amended on 30 September when the Department of Health advised that scholarship holders would be eligible for a card if the scholarship did not make specific provision for health costs. Detailed instructions incorporating that amendment were sent to all States on 21 November, the date referred to by Senator Coates last Thursday. On 29 October the Department of Health advised that it had been notified by the Australian Development Assistance Bureau and by the Department of Education that the health costs of dependants of sponsored students would not be covered by those authorities after 2 November 1981. The Department of Social Security State offices were then notified that subject to the residence, dependence and income tests such persons would be eligible for the health care card. I can understand that under those circumstances there would be some room for misunderstanding and confusion and therefore I have instructed my Department to prepare a statement specifically on the question of the entitlement of overseas students. I will table that in the Senate this week. </PARA>

<PARA> Identification and verification of insured nursing home patients is proceeding although some delays have been encountered. Amounts recovered to date total $47,371 with further amounts identified as $69,086. </PARA>

<PARA> The audit in this State has been completed. A total amount of $287,488 has been identified . . . of which $24,108 has been recovered. </PARA>
<PARA>Those answers to questions asked by senators on the Committee reveal a rather serious situation. As I have said, these matters may have been reported on by the Auditor-General but to date I have not seen any report on payments being incorrectly made. We now find that the rate of recovery of those substantial sums of money has not been very good at all. Why is that the case? I also want to know whether or not the Australian Federal Police have withdrawn from the area of collecting such sums. If so, why? If the Australian Federal Police have withdrawn from the area of collecting such overpayments, by way of summons or by any other means, who is doing this? Is there a problem because the Department of Health has not established any process for recovering debts? These overpayments are in fact debts which have to be recovered. These are not small amounts; they are substantial amounts. I take it that it is a continuing problem. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that the situation to which Senator Georges referred quite correctly was one that arose because of an incorrect procedure which was being followed by the proprietors of some nursing homes. That procedure has now been corrected. I am not saying that from time to time individual cases will not arise in which errors are discovered. But there was a widespread practice whereby the proprietors of nursing homes were claiming on the Commonwealth when they should have been claiming on funds in respect of certain patients. That matter has been brought to light. The procedures have been straightened out. That is why I have said that it is not a continuing problem. What is a problem is the process of checking and finding the extent of overpayments that were made. This is an ongoing process. The recovery of moneys is still going on. It is not a question requiring police intervention or court action at this stage. It is a question which has been taken up with proprietors and the funds. In fact, quite a large operation has been going on and is continuing, as Senator Georges pointed out, to recover the overpayments that were made. Claims are not being made any more because people have come to understand the correct procedure for sending accounts to the funds or to the Commonwealth. The Australian Federal Police are not involved. Unless something exceptional happens they would not have a role to play.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to obtain information from Senator Baume, who represents the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar). I refer to an article in the Sunday Telegraph of 1 November about the mothers of Down's syndrome children. I intervene because this matter seems to be inconclusive. I am fully aware, as my deputy leader, Senator Grimes, has pointed out, that certain treatment cannot be taken unless it has been supervised and we know what its repercussions might be. This matter concerns women who have taken their children to West Germany for treatment and who want such treatment used in this country. Mr MacKellar, the Minister for Health, has said that information on this treatment is inadequate and therefore we have to be careful. The spokesperson for the mothers of the Down's syndrome children refuted the Minister's statement and said that all of the evidence that the Minister needed had been supplied. Therefore I simply compress the requests into two questions. Firstly, what information is lacking on the West German treatment that is necessary before the Minister can approve of its use in Australia? The Minister may have good reason for taking this action. Secondly, what about the catch-22 situation in which these women and their children are involved? Apparently the Commonwealth Department of Health will not approve any Medibank reimbursement for the cost of two visits a year to West Germany. Perhaps the Minister can also indicate to me what the medical research world can offer in lieu of the alleged German cure?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that Senator Mulvihill is concerned that the children be treated with safety and efficacy. The very brief answer is that on the basis of information that is available at this time we are not able to say that the treatment is effective or safe. We have assisting the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee, which has certain roles to play. We have the National Biological Standards Laboratory, which has certain roles to play. We have the Minister and the Department which have to make a judgment as to the safety and the efficacy of the treatment. The information that is available to date indicates that the Siccacell products containing Lyophilised foetal or placental animal cells for use in the treatment of Down's syndrome should not be approved for importation or distribution in Australia. This is a very awkward situation. A number of products available around the world, particularly for cancer cures, simply do not work. The honourable senator will remember what Mr Brych did to people. I can make available to the honourable senator some of the information we have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In brief, we have sought, and not been able to obtain, appropriate documentation as to safety. We require that information before we can certify, as we are required to do, that the treatment should be introduced. We require some information that it works. We cannot get that information. This then leaves mothers of Down's syndrome children in a very difficult position. They would like to try anything, but if the treatment does not seem to be safe and if we do not know that it works the Department of Health can in honesty do nothing else but withhold permission at present. What the Department does say is that if some proof can be made available which by trial demonstrates the efficacy of the treatment, and if the same kind of safety information can be supplied as is required for any other medicine that can be used for injection, that would be a different picture. But at present we cannot get that information. It is solely on that basis that permission is being refused. I think that really explains why there has been this impasse. I would be grateful if the honourable senator could make that known to the mothers who are concerned. </PARA>

I suspect that the matters raised by Senator Mulvihill were in fact matters which relate to employment conditions, which probably are covered by State Acts.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In considering the estimates of the Department of Health I raise a matter which I raised in the Estimates committee hearings, namely, the hiring of computer consultants at a cost of some $250,000. We were told that they were needed to establish the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, a scheme which will be introduced over some three years. We were told at the time that outside consultants were needed to establish the new scheme and that these would cost $250,000 but that, in fact we had computers already in the Department and no new computers were to be introduced. There was some confusion in the Estimates Committee as to just what these consultants would do. I do not think the extra information which has been given to the Estimates Committee adds much to the situation. I ask the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume): Can we have clarification of just what these consulatants are going to do? The Department of Health has considerable automatic data processing facilities. We understand from answers given on 22 September that no new equipment will be introduced, in the near future at least; yet a considerable amount of money is being spent on consultants. I fail to understand, even with the extra information, why people have been introduced from outside to assist the departmental computer experts who will, in fact, be conducting the system in the future. Can we have, initially, clarification of what is going on in this area and why there is a need to bring in these outside people? Do the computer experts in the Department agree that it is necessary to bring them in?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am advised that the equipment presently used to process pharmaceutical benefit claims has reached the end of its economic life. It is more than 10 years old and has become outdated; a new generation of computer capability has emerged. The Department of Health has undertaken its own forward planning. It has examined the broad alternative methods which are now available for processing pharmaceutical benefit claims. The Department believes that it has identified a concept which will simplify the claim process for chemists. It also believes it can reduce the administrative costs to the Department. The Department is trying to develop that concept now. The strategy involves, however, the ongoing maintenance of the present system until such time as new equipment can be purchased for the replacement system and a range of new computer programs can be written to support the function.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That brings me to Senator Grime's question about the choice of consultants. It is government policy that, where practicable and economically feasible, new computer projects should be developed by the private sector and that departmental staff who actually are busy doing this should continue to undertake the ongoing maintenance of computer software. In this case it is practicable and economically feasible to use consultants for a range of new project work. While the majority of the departmental resources will be required for the ongoing maintenance of the existing system-we have to keep using that-some departmental officers will be working with the consultants so that the maintenance of that system when it is implemented will be practicable and economic as a result of an appropriate input from both departmental and external experts during planning processes. </PARA>

Is he saying that we need, first of all, the expertise of outside consultants, private consultants, whom, as the Minister said tonight and in the Estimates Committee, it is normal government policy to employ. The Minister is saying that the Government needs these people to set up the system and to get the system going, then it needs a separate group of people, namely the departmental experts on computer programming and computer maintenance, to maintain the system and that it is in fact economical to bring in someone to set it up and then hand it over to someone to maintain it. Does the Government have any evidence that it is in fact more economical to bring in outside people to set it up? Is it the view of the Department's computer experts that in fact it needs these outside people to come in to set up the thing? I would have thought that of the many departments in the Commonwealth Public Service the Department of Health, with its many changes in the health scheme in this country and its considerable computerisation, would have a large number of experts in this area who could set up a new system and then go on running it. Is it just that it happens to be Government policy that wherever possible it brings in outside experts and private enterprise experts, or is it that there is a demonstrable economic advantage in doing so? I think we should get answers to these questions on the record so that the people in the Department who are working on the computers will know exactly how the Government and the Department feels about them.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> If I may try to pick up the question by Senator Grimes, my understanding is that some departmental officers will be involved with the outside consultants in the development of the new system. But because they have to keep the present system operating the people who are at present employed in the computer area will have to continue in the jobs at which they are expert. I think the answer that I gave covered the other part of the question; that is, if we have to look for extra assistance the Government's policy is that we should look to the private sector if possible. </PARA>

I do not know whether we will find that to be a practical job to do. Can we have a look to see whether we can identify the nursing homes and the funds? It may be most of the nursing homes in Australia for all I know. Certainly any double claiming-that is, claims made both on the Commonwealth and on the funds-is criminal activity.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for his answer. I note that, as happened when he gave evidence to the Estimates Committee, the language changes frequently when giving the answer. I understood the Minister to say on that occasion that where necessary the Government's policy was to bring in outside consultants whereas previously the answer was that it was done where possible. I forget the other word used but the Minister said that as often as possible it is normal Government policy to bring in outside consultants. I hope the people who work in the automatic data processing section of the Department of Health note that they are incapable of introducing the new programs and introducing the new scheme over the next two or three years. It is not as though the thing is going to be introduced now and we are suddenly going to have new gear coming in; it will be introduced over the next three years. I note that it is said that the departmental affairs cannot handle it themselves and the Government has to bring in outside consultants where possible, where necessary or whatever words the Minister chooses to use at any time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I move on to the section of the estimates involving the grants for family planning organisations. As we know Mr Carroll, in giving answers before the Estimate Committee on 22 September, said that the figure used for the health program grants for family planning associations in Australia represented what he called a no-growth situation. In fact, if one takes into account inflation it is not a no-growth situation. In fact, the amount of money being spent in this area has been reduced. He said that reviews are going on whereby all the associations have been sent letters explaining why they should review their situations and stating that the Government would consider its future grants as a result of the investigations indulged in by the review committee. I just wonder what the Government's attitude is to the family planning associations and whether in future the Government will look at how the various associations spend the money that is given to them by the Federal Government. One understands, for instance, that in New South Wales because of a reduction in funds for family planning associations there will in future be no family planning assistance outside the metropolitan areas. I daresay that some of the members of the National Country Party believe that citizens who live outside metropolitan areas with their knowledge of the birds and bees and cows and sheep should not need family planning assistance. But that is not the view that is shared by the people of Wagga Wagga, Orange and Bathurst and other places which previously had family planning offices which were funded by the Commonwealth Government. </PARA>

If the Government is going to stay in that area, will it take a greater interest in how the various family planning associations distribute their funds?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) for his response, confirming my belief that the Department of Health will be undertaking the coding of prescriptions in respect of work previously done by pharmaceutical chemists. If this coding is to be done by departmental officials, where will we get our savings from? This was the whole purpose of putting in the computer. What we are doing is putting in a computer and transferring existing staff to new coding jobs. I wonder whether it is appropriate to introduce new technology if we are not really going to achieve staff savings? Should these people have been transferred to other areas of the Public Service? We are spending money on computers without getting any worthwhile benefit if we just transfer all these clerks. In other words, we are making work for the boys who would otherwise have been made redundant.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will answer Senator Watson first. I really have not spelt out the new process in sufficient detail for him to make the logical jump about what the final requirement will be for staffing. I think it is a non sequitur, from what I have said. In fairness, I think we have to wait to see how the system develops before we can say what the final staffing requirement is. It is not possible to say what people will be doing or whether it is a case of jobs for the boys who are there. Really, the planning must be allowed to go ahead. I would agree with the honourable senator if in fact in the final wash-up it was simply a matter of taking in more washing to make more work. That would be a fair enough criticism, but it has not got to that stage, and I think we have to wait a little longer. Senator Grimes asked about family planning. The honourable senator knows that this Government contributes to family planning in several ways, not least of which is through the contributions it makes to medical consultations, since most family planning, even today, is done through medical practitioners. Under the new arrangements there will be money from the national welfare fund for that. I simply say that the almost $2.5m and the $750,000 which together make up our contribution to family planning may not be as great as people want but they are still considerable amounts and really are an earnest of our commitment to this area.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is an earnest statement of the Government's intent. What I asked was whether the Government intends to keep a closer check in the future, in view of the review it has had, on how that money is spent by the various family planning associations? In particular I mentioned New South Wales, the State of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume), where as a result of reductions in expenditure it seems that there will be no family planning organisations outside the metropolitan area of Sydney. Some of us may say that people in those areas need it as much as anyone else.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If I could take up the point Senator Watson made, it is quite nonsensical for the Minister to say to us that we cannot ask any questions or look into the situation until the program has been developed. At least $250,000 has been appropriated for outside consultants for the establishment of this program. We are told that a new pharmaceutical benefits system is being developed for us all. Senator Watson asked who is going to do the coding? Are we to have coding or will the pharmacists do what they like? With due respect, the Minister in his reply said: 'You cannot ask that sort of question. We will wait until the system is set up and then you can ask us how it is going.' In my view, that is not a reasonable answer. That is not a reasonable answer from the point of view of the patients, the pharmacists, the doctors or anybody else. If we are going to approve the expenditure of that amount of money we ought to have some idea of what is going to happen. Surely the Department ought to have some idea of what is going to happen. Surely the Minister is not telling us that over the next three years the Government is going to move ahead step by step and work out each system as it goes, without some general view of what the end result will be. I do not think that answer is very satisfactory. I do not think the Minister should consider that answer to be very satisfactory, if it is the sort of answer his public servants give him when they present him with a new program. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish just briefly to discuss the vexed and still largely unresolved question of toxic shock syndrome. I think it is fair to say that most Australian women feel that this question has not been thoroughly aired and that the research done so far is totally inadequate. We believe that the incidence of toxic shock in Australia has been seriously understated, especially in view of the fact that it appears almost exclusively in previously healthy young women. Not all cases have been reported, and the rate so far reported has been based on very severe cases. As far as we can see, no consideration has been given to the fact that not all women of menstrual age are actually menstruating at any one time and that therefore the rate cited is totally invalid. I will quote from an article by Dr Stefania Siedlecky, Adviser in Family Planning and Women's Health, Commonwealth Department of Health. In the first quarter issue for 1981 of the publication Health, she stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Toxic Shock Syndrome was first reported from the United States in 1978, and its close association with Staphylococcal infection and tampon use during menstruation was recognised in 1980. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> While tampon use rather than the tampons themselves appears to be the predisposing factor in women, it is difficult to find any common pattern of use among the Australian cases, nor have there been any obvious changes in hygiene or in use patterns among the general population over the past decade. Increased absorbency in tampons may encourage women to leave tampons in for longer periods. </PARA>
<PARA>Much of the advice received so far by Australian women is that it is their own lack of caution in this regard which has led to the development of symptoms. Dr Siedlecky went on to ask:</PARA>
<PARA> What of the tampons themselves? The advent of the Toxic Shock Syndrome has revealed how little is known of the effect of tampon use in the vagina, and because tampons have been used so widely for so long, few questions have been asked. </PARA>
<PARA>. . . . </PARA>
<PARA> In the search for greater absorbency and market competitiveness, some manufacturers in the United States have added not only carboxy methyl cellulose, but also chemical deodorants to tampons. </PARA>
<PARA>Dr Siedlecky continued:</PARA>
<PARA> It should not be forgotten that discontinuing tampon use may reduce the incidence of toxic shock but does not guarantee that no further cases of toxic shock will occur. The role of the Staphylococcus aureus in producing TSS via the vaginal route remains to be further investigated. </PARA>
<PARA>Australian women would like to know whether that investigation is in fact proceeding. I wish to discuss one other small matter a little further, and that relates to the overseas visit by a departmental officer. I refer here to page 1 of the document containing written replies to Estimates Committee G, which was distributed today. Mr Nettle was unable to clarify this aspect during the Estimates Committee hearing. About half-way down the page the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) said:</PARA>
<PARA> In fact, the first reports of toxic shock syndrome appeared in the USA in May 1980, one month after Johnstone and Johnstone's invitation had been made and accepted. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) may recall that we queried the ethics of a visit funded by Johnstone and Johnstone during this period. The letter continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Investigations associating toxic shock syndrome and tampons, which led to the withdrawal of some tampons from the market, appeared in the USA in October 1980, the month Dr McKay travelled . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I will now briefly recount the chronology of events during that six months. I think that what I am about to say is correct. In April 1980 an invitation was made to a departmental officer by Johnstone and Johnstone to attend the company's conference on the sterilisation of medical devices. In May 1980 the first reported case of toxic shock syndrome in the United States-that is, associated with the use of tampons-was made public. In October 1980 some brands of tampons were withdrawn from the market. In October 1980 the departmental officer actually attended the conference in the United States of America. I think it would be fairly easy to conject that in that intervening period, between May and October, the Department might have had another look at the situation and taken some sort of mature reflection on whether the departmental officer was really observing the finest of medical and political ethics in attending a conference funded by one of the firms which was very clearly implicated in what would appear to be a very difficult problem. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise two matters. Last Thursday night I referred to the case of Ruby, a greyhound from Great Britain which spent a harrowing period at the animal quarantine station at Wallgrove. In view of the details which I gave, I wonder whether there has been any feedback on that case. I understand that since I raised the matter some legal action may have developed. In view of the interest which has been shown by a very few people and the fact that Wallgove was to be the millenium of animal quarantine, it seems disappointing that this had to happen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other matter to which I refer is another hardy annual as far as I am concerned. I know that the advisers will be anticipating my raising it. I ask whether there has been a diminishment in the ozone layer in the southern hemisphere. I refer to Australia in particular. Are there any readings to indicate that the layer is getting thinner and that, therefore, there is a corresponding increase in the incidence of skin cancer? As you know, Mr Chairman, the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia has put forward a log of claims, one of which seeks that employers provide a light working hat for people employed on the waterfront. Anyone who read the Sydney Morning Herald this morning would know that train examiners employed by the Commonwealth are asking, amongst other union requests, for a hat with a wider brim. There is a growing awareness of the problem. I suppose that the ancestors of people like myself who have fair skins should not have migrated to Australia. There is an awareness of this within the trade union movement. I wonder whether there is any factual information available regarding the ozone layer. When the matter was raised in northern hemisphere countries it was said that it did not matter. Probably it does not, but we know, as a result of the various chemical operations which have taken place in Australia, that there have been fears about whether the ozone layer has been tampered with. I wonder whether there is any information on that matter. </PARA>

Yet only $5,000 is being spent on the main problem. That was revealed when we discussed the estimates the other day. Let us get back to the question of exactly how much investigation is being carried out locally by the Department of Health on this very important problem. Surely it is not good enough to say that we are spending a few dollars in South Australia. That came out, if I recall correctly, as an afterthought.

I will obtain the details for Senator Georges. In relation to the question of tampons, I make the point again that a department of state is not an appropriate body to do research. It sponsors research through the National Health and Medical Research Council. As I have said, one project is being carried out in Adelaide. What is appropriate for the Department of Health-this is something I should have mentioned earlier to Senator Giles-is that at the request of the Department of Health the Standards Association of Australia is developing a standard for tampons. Tampons are not sterile goods and do not necessarily come under other forms of control. The Department of Health has a proper role to play.

The ozone layer, which Senator Mulvihill has mentioned, is itself now the subject of a joint investigation by the Australian Environment Council and the National Health and Medical Research Council.

<PARA>QUESTIONS ARISING DURING ESTIMATES DEBATE-SENATOR MULVIHILL</PARA>
<PARA> On Thursday, 12 November, during the Senate debate on Estimates Committee G, Senator Mulvihill tabled two letters published in the 'National Dog' concerning an imported greyhound 'Rugby' which died 13 days after its release from quarantine at Wallgrove animal quarantine station. </PARA>
<PARA> The first letter was a letter of complaint from the owner of the animal about quarantine and the second, a letter signed by Mr Doyle, Assistant Director-General of the Animal Quarantine Branch of the Department of Health, following detailed investigations of all aspects of the matter by that Department. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Mulvihill sought assurances that everything was done for the dog during its period of quarantine. </PARA>
<PARA> The facts emanating from the extensive Departmental investigation in this matter are set out in detail in Mr Doyle's letter which appeared in full at pages 2163-2164 of Hansard of 12 November 1981. However, the salient features are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Records at the quarantine station show that the animal entered quarantine on 24 January 1981 weighing 26 kilos and was released on 24 April 1981 weighing 28 kilos-a gain of two kilos. </PARA>
<PARA> While in quarantine the dog suffered diarrhoea on three occasions. On each occasion the animal was given routine treatment and the condition was rectified within 2-3 days. This is a common complaint for imported dogs who are subjected to heavy stress following the lengthy plane flight and the severe change in climatic conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> The owner visited the animal twice during the quarantine period and discussed the dog's condition and diet with the kennelman. She registered no complaint. </PARA>
<PARA> The dog was released to the owner in good condition and was, in fact, too boisterous for her to handle. He was loaded into Mrs Schelling's transport by the kennelman. A statement was signed by the owner stating that the dog was received in good condition. Again, no complaint was lodged and the staff were thanked for their efforts. </PARA>
<PARA> Veterinary reports and a pathology profile of the animal obtained from the veterinarian who treated the dog following its release from quarantine indicate that the dog's symptoms prior to its death were not inconsistent with the clinical patterns of acute parvovirus diseases. This view is shared almost unanimously by State, Commonwealth and private veterinarians who have examined the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Mulvihill can be assured that all steps were taken to care for the animal during quarantine. The case was thorougly investigated following receipt of Mrs Schelling's initial letter of complaint on 8 May. In the light of this investigation there is no suggestion of negligence by the staff of the animal quarantine station at Wallgrove. </PARA>
<PARA> The important feature in this case is that the animal, in fact, gained weight, some two kilos, during his period in quarantine and was released in a fit, indeed boisterous, condition. Attention is also drawn to the fact that experts advise that acute parvovirus was widespread in Australia at the time and that large numbers of dogs were affected and many died throughout the country. The quarantine station was in fact closed to visitors for a period during Rugby's time at the station to prevent the entry of the disease. Measures taken in this regard appear to have been successful. </PARA>
<PARA> The facilities at the Wallgrove station are by far the most up to date in Australia and have been constructed in line with the most modern concepts of disease security and animal welfare. Since its opening 744 cats and dogs have been imported through the facility with only two fatalities-an outstanding record in a facility of this kind. The quality of care provided at the Station is illustrated by the fact that one animal, an Afghan hound which has a long coat, recently won a show within two days of release after nine months quarantine at the Station. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I seek from the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) an up to date report for the Committee on the matter of contaminated bandages and other such imported products. Has the Government considered whether there is need for some form of certification system on the part of the exporting country regarding imported bandages, absorbent gauze and that sort of thing so that Australia would have a reliable indication of the quality and safety of the product? If the Government has not already done so, I ask it to consider that proposal. Such certification would apply to more than merely goods which are imported ready made up, packaged and labelled with the country of origin. I gather-perhaps the Minister could confirm it-that it is a requirement that if such goods are imported in their final, packaged state the country of origin must be stamped on them but if just the raw product is imported in bulk and it is packaged in Australia there is no such requirement. Does the Government propose to continue what I understand to be the current system of random testing of imports for bacterial and other contamination, or is the system to be changed in order to protect Australian consumers? I believe some reassurance in this regard is needed. People have assumed that well-known brands are made in Australia and-I do not know whether it is reasonable or not-assume that as a result the product is of higher quality and there is less chance of infection than had they been made in Taiwan, India or wherever these problem surgical dressings originated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another aspect is that of labelling. The question is whether, even if the products are not brought in in final, packaged form, the Government sees the need for the country of origin of the raw material to be stamped on the outside or an indication to be given that there will be certification on entry, either as a Customs or a health measure?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I hope I can give Senator Coates some information on the matter that will be helpful. I am advised that the standards require that wound dressings be sterile; that bacteria were first isolated from dressings manufactured by someone called Jayer Exports Ltd and included organisms which can cause gangrene and septicaemia-I suppose clostridium welchii organisms. The nature and levels suggested gross contamination, possibly from faecal sources and a very poor standard of hygiene in the factory. Recalls at the consumer level were made. I am aware of the concern expressed to Senator Coates by his constituents. I have a constituent who has a continuing need for dressings. He has discovered that it is very difficult to obtain supplies. Dressings from two other Indian companies were also found to be non-sterile and were recalled.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Bandages are not required to be sterile. However, the bandages from Jayer were also found to be contaminated with the same types of bacteria as were found in the wound dressings. Testing has been extended to other manufacturers in India and other countries. So far, unacceptable contamination has been detected in wound dressings and bandages from other companies in India, Taiwan and Thailand. Some products from some companies in England, West Germany, Taiwan and China did not yield any potentially harmful organisms. </PARA>
<PARA> The point is that in regard to dressings, which are required to be sterile, a testing procedure is employed which in fact has picked up some of these contaminations and has led to product recall taking place. I can certainly refer to the Minister the question whether further measures are needed, whether this episode reveals the need for additional changes to the procedures now followed. However, what emerges is that because of the testing that has been done through the National Biological Standards Laboratory it has been possible to pick up these levels of contamination and we do have a recall system which permits products to be removed from shops. Probably the honorary senator, as I am is receiving representations from people who are now finding it difficult to obtain these products. I will certainly convey to the Minister the honourable senator's concern that there may be a need for a further mechanism in this regard and will await his response. </PARA>

<PARA>The question I raise in this important area which refers to the eyesight of Aboriginal people and others is this: How, after all this time, do we still come to the conclusion that nothing can reasonably be achieved until the living conditions and standards of the Aboriginal people are raised? We established the Department of Aboriginal Affairs some years ago. I think we have expended over $100m every year. This year the appropriation was raised to $160m or a figure close to that amount. It is necessary for the Minister to explain just why there has not been substantial progress in this area. I wonder whether he can point out to the Committee just which are the areas of greatest problem. We have had some problems with the trachoma program. I would like to be assured by the Minister that the problems that were faced in Queensland in particular have been overcome and that the circumstances leading to stop and start resignations of important people in the program have been reconciled. I hope the Minister can understand how there can be concern in this chamber about the fact that the impression now is that in spite of the application of expertise and money we are very far from solving the problem of Aboriginal morbidity. </PARA>

<PARA> . . . the disease is unlikely to be eradicated in the areas where it is now prevalent until there is improvement in the living standards and conditions of the Aboriginal people, which may take considerable time to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA>What it does not say is that the social and health status is in fact improving. It has gone from disastrously bad to very bad, but it is improving. Take any measure we care to name. A large number of housing units have been completed; more are needed. Take the provision of clean water or power. In the Central Desert, for example, most of the communities I visit-from Amata to Warburton-now have a power generator and water. That means the people can get washing machines in. Some of them want washing machines, some do not. Washing machines mean that the women have a chance to get the kids' clothes clean. A whole series of things are interdependent. The need is enormous, and even the steady provision of resources will take some time to pick up the backlog. The population is increasing. The Aboriginal population growth rate is high. In spite of the high death rate the Aboriginal population is the fastest growing segment of Australian society. This is not to underestimate the enormity of the need and the fact that we need to proceed as rapidly as we can. </PARA>
<PARA> We have announced a $50m program designed to try to help the very kinds of things Senator Georges was talking about-water supplies and sewerage-but even in some communities we find that there is another job in terms of social education. We find sewerage systems which have been destroyed through vandalism. All right, that is part of the learning process we have to go through. We might be two steps forward and one step back. I think Senator Coleman, who has been to places like Balgo, will agree that much of the housing that has been provided there may not have been appropriate, but certainly it is a sad sight to see housing at Balgo at present and to realise the important need, under the trachoma program, for housing with elevated, ventilated, separated beds, if I may mention the catch phrase used by the trachoma team. We are confident that we can continue to make progress. We certainly do not underestimate the problem. It is not made any easier by the fact that clean water is one of the big issues. There are some parts of Australia where that simply is at a premium. It is very difficult to find clean water. Of course Aboriginal communities are quite often seeking to move out into the new areas, some of which are quite marginal. We are encouraging that where it seems appropriate and where that is their own desire. Queensland has a lesser trachoma problem; it has more rain and more water. Professor Hollows, for example, made it clear that it is the red heart where the trachoma problem is most acute. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not normally like to ask questions in the Committee stage because I think that is the sort of thing we do in Estimates committees; we come in here to discuss matters. There are a couple of comments I want to make in the broad general area of Aboriginal affairs. Perhaps the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume), rather than answering specific questions, might like to make just a general comment. I would like to look at four basic areas. The first one is employment. In the Estimates committees hearings concerning the various departments with which I was involved we asked how many Aboriginal people were involved in government enterprises or in actual straight-out government employment. I was able to get those figures only in relation to those areas in which I was particularly involved. I wonder whether the Minister would like to comment on, firstly, the actual numbers involved and, secondly those people who are receiving training of the apprenticeship type or skilled trade training. I am not looking for specific numbers but just a general comment on whether we have had any development in the last 12 months and that sort of thing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second area I would like to look at is the broad area of education, or what one should perhaps call schooling in this case. Can we have a broad picture of the development in the secondary education field of those students who are receiving Aboriginal secondary grants? Again, I am not looking for numbers but just growth. Can we have the numbers of students who have been assisted to go on to tertiary education, whether it be at technical and further education colleges, at university or at any other sort of training institution? I think the comment I would like in this area is on whether the field is growing at present. The third area on which I would like the Minister to comment-I realise there are some problems in this area-relates to what I call the Ford committee which investigated training 12 months ago. </PARA>

<PARA> The last general area on which I would like the Minister to comment-I am prompted by his reply just given-is the outstation movement and the sort of training going on there. I have always been concerned, as the Minister knows, to make sure that Aboriginal young people are given the alternative of either staying in the community, whether it be an outstation community or an Aboriginal community, or going into the regional town to work there. I think we want to make sure that Aboriginal young people are equipped with the skills to make that sort of choice. In my view they do not want to be forced into the situation where, because their elders have chosen for them to live in an outstation movement, they are not able to move away at a later stage. I am just looking to see whether the Minister has some comment to make on this general area of training in the community and at the outstations. The Minister might recall that I had some contribution to make a few years ago-I think he knows of that-when I made a suggestion about having visiting trainers and so on do this. Can I have a broad picture in those four areas?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Many of them have come from the Department. The Aboriginal Development Commission, which has been in operation for only 18 months now, has, I think, a staff comprising two-thirds Aboriginals and the number is increasing. What happened was that a number of my departmental officers went to the Commission on temporary attachment, and recruitment is picking up many Aboriginals. Again, some of them are coming from management positions in the Department. For example, I just mention that Mr Neville Perkins has recently become general manager of Aboriginal Hostels to replace a non-Aboriginal, Mr Roy Schuler. In the Aboriginal Development Commission we now have Colin Bourke, an Aboriginal, as general manager; we have Mr Charles Perkins as the chairman, and all the directors are Aboriginals. The land councils, many of the 800 or so organisations-I am not sure of the number-which, of course, we fund, have almost all Aboriginal employees. In addition, the National Aboriginal Conference has almost all Aboriginals on its secretariat.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In terms of the growth in the number of children in secondary school, I think the introduction of Aboriginal secondary grants coincided with an enormous increase in the numbers of Aboriginal children attending secondary school. I must say to Senator Robertson that the retention rate seems to be passable-not too bad-up to year 10 and to be very poor between year 10 and year 12. That is a problem we have to pick up at present. We are aware of it. We are trying to find ways of filling that gap. In 1971 the census revealed that nearly one-quarter of all Aboriginals not then attending school had never received any schooling. In 1981 we can say that more than 16,000 Aboriginal children are attending secondary schools. The figure in 1967 was, we think, about 2,500. It is now 16,000 children. If we look at the figures for Aboriginals in tertiary education-I think Senator Robertson asked for that figure-we see that 138 Aboriginals are at university under the Aboriginal Study Grants Scheme; 184 are undertaking teacher training; 681 are undertaking other tertiary studies; and 229 are completing technical studies. In the last decade 130 Aboriginals have graduated from tertiary institutions with Abstudy assistance, 125 of them since 1974. </PARA>

In terms of the outstation movement there is a real dilemma. Senator Robertson knows this. It is the dilemma he actually highlighted about the trade-off people make for the quarantine they get from alcohol, community violence and other things they may find unacceptable and the greater difficulty they face in getting for their children some of the negotiable skills they may require to give them a wider choice. Some of the communities I visited had teachers aids going out from those communities to try to incorporate the children in the outstations in the teaching programs. I think Senator Robertson has put his finger on a problem which remains really largely unresolved-that is, how one ensures that children do not miss out on the chance to pick up the skills they may need if they wish to choose a different kind of lifestyle for themselves 10 or 15 years down the track.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am interested in the response to the question by Senator Ryan on page 71 of the written replies to Estimates Committee G, which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> How many officers above class 7 (in the Department) are Aboriginal Women?</PARA>
<PARA>I am not surprised to find that there are only 13 non-Aboriginal women above clerk class 7, nor am I terribly surprised to find there is only one Aboriginal woman in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs above clerk class 7. I wonder now whether the Senate could be provided with the information relating to all Aboriginal employees in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, particularly in relation to female Aboriginals. As we already have the information for those above clerk class 7, perhaps we could have the information for those in grades below that. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to speak for a moment about Aboriginal hostels. In one of the suburbs of Perth there is a hostel known as the Elizabeth Hanson Memorial Hostel for Retired Aboriginals. It is a very small hostel; it is a home that has been taken over by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and presumably it is funded through the Department as a hostel for retired Aboriginals. It is a rather pleasant place to go because only a small number of Aboriginals live there, but the situation has developed in recent times where it has been required to take in people who are not necessarily retired Aboriginals. For instance, on a recent occasion a lass came down from the north of Western Australia to study at the Western Australian Institute of Technology and was unable to find suitable accommodation. Whilst accommodation was found for her through the guild, they had neglected to tell her prospective landlady that she was an Aboriginal. When she turned up to take advantage of the accommodation she was politely told that the accommodation had been let. Because she had nowhere else to go, for a few nights she was housed in the Elizabeth Hanson Memorial Hostel. This situation creates a problem. There does not appear to be anywhere in Perth a hostel for those people who wish to undertake studies or to take up employment on a transient basis or for a short time until they can find alternative accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA> The other rather sad situation is the reluctance of some hospitals to accept alcoholic Aboriginals, even where it is obvious that, in addition to their alcoholism, they are aged. Recently the same hostel found itself in a rather nasty position because it has no live-in staff. In fact, its entire staff number two, both of whom have their own homes to attend to and work at the hostel on a weekly basis. They were contacted by the police in the middle of the night when one of these elderly Aboriginals at the hostel passed away. I do not know what the answer is to that problem. I am more concerned with younger people having to take up accommodation in a hostel which is obviously designed for retired Aboriginals. I imagine it could be an extremely delicate situation for them suddenly to find themselves surrounded by elderly people, and in a strange city as well. </PARA>
<PARA> While I am on my feet I would like to raise the matter of the community which I understand is being moved very shortly to Violet Valley in the Kimberley area of Western Australia. I have spoken about this on a previous occasion. A matter has been brought to my attention which causes me some concern. I understand that the property is being handed over about now by a white leaseholder, or there is some arrangement by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs that it will take over the lease. I understand also that a surety figure in the order of $19,000 is to be forfeited in the event that the station property is not kept in a particular condition, that is, if it is not kept habitable and if the outsheds are not maintained with reasonable care. I have not been there so the matters I am raising at the moment are hearsay. It may be necessary for confirmation to be sought. I understand that the upkeep and maintenance of the accommodation have been sadly neglected. It means that the Aboriginal community will be going to the Violet Valley property already behind the 8-ball because they will not be able to work the property and be self-sufficient in the immediate future. They will have to endeavour not to maintain the accommodation but to repair it. There is also the problem of the road going into Violet Valley, which I understand is in a shocking condition. They will not be able to maintain contact with the community at Turkey Creek, which would not be a desirable situation as most of the Violet Valley people have been in fairly close contact with those at Turkey Creek for quite some time. </PARA>
<PARA> I was very interested to hear the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) say in relation to the trachoma-glaucoma program that it is necessary for the people to have proper accommodation and raised bedding. That brings me back once again to the matter I have raised in the chamber before in relation to Queenie McKenzie at Turkey Creek. I would be very interested to know whether there is any progress in the matter of Queenie McKenzie, who wishes only to have a proper house. As she has said to me: 'I do not want to live in a humpy all my life. I want to sleep in a house, in a proper bed.'</PARA>

I have recently written a follow-up letter to the Minister seeking his assistance. In relation to Violet Valley, I think that is probably a matter which the Aboriginal Development Commission has taken on. The honourable senator has raised the important point that in their purchases they would want to take on places which are not run down to start with. Of course, one of the difficulties is that the properties for sale are not always the best properties to be found. I think they are aware of that particular danger.

I agree that it is highly undesirable that a person should be placed in one inappropriately. I am not aware of the particular home the honourable senator mentioned. We will look into it and see whether it is a third party hostel or whether it is associated with Aboriginal Hostels in some way. We will see whether we have an interest and whether we should take any action in relation to the matters the honourable senator raised tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to staffing, the question we answered at page 71 of the written replies was the question asked. We can now go ahead without too much trouble and obtain for the honourable senator the other part of the information. I am aware of the Aboriginal woman who is a clerk class 9. </PARA>

It will not help anyone to over-promote people and it will not help anyone to hold people back. We find with the clerks at less senior levels that a number of people are coming through. It is a question of making sure that in their own interests they do not get landed in jobs before they are ready for them. Certainly we will obtain that information for the honourable senator.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I might add to the answer I gave to Senator Robertson that through Department of Aboriginal Affairs programs training this year will be given to about five and a half thousand people. That relates to the report by Martin Ford. We will fund the States to provide training for about 2,400 people this year. Through organisations by way of direct grants in aid there will be training for 2,800 people, and the Special Works Project Scheme will provide training for about 300 people. So some training is going on. I might also mention in relation to outstation education that we are providing $125,000 to assist in the Northern Territory to try to make some impact upon the problem to which Senator Robertson referred. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Could I just raise one more problem that came up at the time when the Elizabeth Hanson matter was raised with me, namely the employment of Aboriginal people under the National Employment Strategy for Aboriginals scheme. I think that most people on this side of the chamber have a trainee under that program. I was rather disturbed in my conversation with the people who are actually running the Elizabeth Hanson hostel to find that, as I explained earlier today, only two people do all of the cooking and cleaning and make sure that people get off to the doctors and that sort of thing. I spoke to the employment officer and I was very pleased to find that in fact there is the possibility of placement of NESA trainees at these types of hostels at which they could get some training in the very basic operations of a small hostel, which is to be desired, as against the much larger ones. I was rather surprised to find that the people at the hostel were not aware that in fact they could apply for a trainee under the NESA scheme. I wonder just how widely the Department is advertising the fact or alerting areas inside the Department as to the use of those trainees in its own organisations?</PARA></TALK.START>

It will sell the property and open another one. It is really very good in this respect. A third party arrangement is one way of extending its scope. I will have to take that up. I might say that I have another table which shows that the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in toto we have 66 Aboriginal men and 84 Aboriginal women employed.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise several matters under the heading of Aboriginal Affairs. The first concerns a matter about which I wrote to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) some time ago and in respect of which I have not yet received an answer. I wrote to the Minister supporting a request from the Murray Bridge District Council that continued funding be made available to the Woma program at a farm which caters for alcoholics on the Karoonda Road some five or six miles from Murray Bridge. My understanding is that some concern has been expressed by the Aboriginals in Murray Bridge that the intention is to have a rehabilitation home in the town of Murray Bridge. The people who run this rehabilitation farm are most concerned because such a move would make their job much more difficult. The people they deal with would have easy access to the cause of their problem. I would now like to know whether the Minister can give me an answer.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I cannot develop tonight the other matter which I wish to raise because I am not yet in receipt of the South Australian Hansard. I am given to understand over the telephone that a most unwarranted attack was made on me last week by Mr Lewis, the member for Mallee in the State House, because of my actions in trying to assist the Ralkon Agricultural Co. at Meningie. As soon as I can get a copy of the Hansard I will refer to this matter in the Parliament. I will be saying a few things about Mr Lewis which he might not appreciate. He will get a great shock when I mention them. He is just a babe in the woods. He is a newcomer to the problem. He has been in the Parliament for about only two years. He is one of those Johnny-come-latelys who is an instant expert. I just warn the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs that I will be saying a few things about this matter in the future because it comes within his ambit. If Mr Lewis is prepared to repeat in the public arena some of the statements he has made about the manager of Ralkon I am afraid he will need a very big bank account. However, I will leave that to a later date. What I am especially interested in tonight is whether the Minister has an answer for me about the Woma program, particularly as it applies to Murray Bridge in South Australia. </PARA>

<PARA> In relation to the Woma program, Senator McLaren might be interested to know that today I signed a response to him. I had actually waited to sign a response to the local government body in Murray Bridge. I have enclosed a copy of that response in my letter to the honourable senator. The letter should be with the honourable senator now. What we have said is that, as Senator McLaren knows, there has been a review of Woma programs generally throughout South Australia. A number of recommendations have been made which are being discussed. What we are seeking now is a response from each Woma program about the recommendations. There is yet another stage for us then; that is to look at those responses and to determine exactly how we should proceed-whether to continue our support of these programs as they are or as modified, or whether we continue with the State secretariat as it is or in a modified form. A number of things have come out of the review. The honourable senator may recall that Mr Miller, who is assisting me in the chamber, as the regional director in South Australia actually helped get that review under way. </PARA>
<PARA> There are two separate questions at Murray Bridge. The first concerns the Woma program itself. The second concerns the particular question of the farm as a tool which that program uses. I have made no decisions at all. However, I see the questions as separable. How the Woma program itself should be run is an important question. I might say that the review expressed some concerns about some improvements that could be made in the operation of the program. That is all right. If there are some improvements to be made we will look at those recommendations on their merits. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of the farm is one that will have to be considered on its own merits in terms of the costs involved in respect to maintenance and the kind of benefit that it will yield. I assure the honourable senator that no decisions have been made. My mind is not made up one way or the other on the whole matter. I am going to wait until we have responses from different Woma groups and then look at the whole thing in toto. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Despite the fact that the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) is not here, I raise initially the present problems in the Department of Social Security and the industrial dispute involving the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association, whose members are working in the Department of Social Security. I think the Committee should know that staff ceilings, which are at the bottom of these problems, have been a problem in the Department since 1976. The hardline resistance of the Government to increases-what are considered satisfactory increases by members of the ACOA and other employees of the Department-in staffing have been met with what now have become desperate devices to gain the Government's attention and the Government's understanding about what has been happening in various sections of the Department. At all times the ACOA, acting on behalf of Social Security officers, has tried to meet with the Minister for Social Security, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Public Service Board to explain the seriousness of the staffing situation in terms of services, efficiency and morale in the Department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some staffing improvements were made recognising that under the present Government unemployment benefit payments had risen by 50 per cent. This is a high figure but the staffing has changed very little in the last six years. The other staffing improvements which occurred came as a result of a move which coincided with the appointment of Mr Lanigan as Director-General of Social Services, when the policing of pensioners and beneficiaries became of greater concern than giving those people fast and accurate service. Increases in staffing were made in the Department to carry out Mr Lanigan's philosophy that the Department should restrict expenditure rather than support those in need in the community. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9V4">Senator GRIMES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Lanigan is not there any more. He has resigned and is in a very comfortable legal practice. I seek from the Minister an explanation of why he and the Government are so intractable in dealing with the staff of the Department and why the whole matter raises the Minister's ire, as it did in Question Time today. Officers of that Department have, over the years, maintained a high standard in the community and have a very good industrial relations record. In fact until the last couple of years industrial action in the Department was almost unheard of. The reputation of the Department of Social Security over the years has depended upon the efficiency and the good sense of these officers who are at the moment in dispute with the Minister and the Government. It seems to me that the Government and the Minister are giving every indication of being even less interested in what staff are needed to do the work required in the regional and other offices than in the people whom the Department is supposed to support.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The aim of the Social Services Act is to help those in need in this community and any dispute of this type must inevitably affect those in need. At the moment staff members of the Department are prepared to lose wages in order to bring home the principle that the provision of services to the poorest and the most dependent social service recipients in this community is a serious matter. The officers have been in dispute with the Government, the Minister and the senior echelons of the Department for over 12 months. The Minister and his top advisers are losing no pay, but the staff are in fact losing pay and they are showing more responsibility about delays and stress in the Department. As a result of this they are up for all the punitive actions that the Minister, the Government, the Public Service Board and others choose to take in this situation. </PARA>
<PARA> A joint Department of Social Security and ACOA committee examined the staffing setup in May 1980. In July 1981 it concluded that a minimum of 500 additional staff members were needed in Victoria alone for relief staffing. Departmental and Government inaction initially, and now the intransigent attitude of the Government, have led to the present situation. At Question Time today I brought to the Minister's attention the particularly provocative action of his senior administrators-I noted that in his answer he disclaimed responsibility for anything like this-in deliberately standing down people who were writing counter cheques; that is, senior administrators were demanding that officers stop writing hardship cheques and work on overpayments. When the officers refused to do this they were stood down. This is a pretty rough way of stopping essential services to the disadvantaged in order to impose departmental authority. At the time, Senator Chaney asked me for details about specific cases. I am not sure whether he did this because he did not believe I had such information or whether he was using the old ministerial procedure in this place of trying to deflect criticism on an important point without giving that criticism any consideration. Therefore, I take this fortuitous opportunity of the consideration of the Appropriation Bills to give the details. I give them in the hope that the Minister will not order further punitive action because these people had the temerity to report to their union what had occurred in their Social Security offices. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Redfern office of the Department of Social Security on 12 November, one David Cowell was preparing cheques in the unemployment and sickness benefits section. Although he was a pensions officer, he had been asked to do this work. He was ordered to stop writing the cheques and to work on overpayments. He refused and was stood down. In the same Redfern office Peter Law, Therese Traves, Glen Dwyer and Norm Haskell were all stood down because they refused to stop issuing hardship cheques and to work on overpayments. In the Camperdown office on 9 November, one Steven Bolt was stopped doing hardship payments and told to do overpayments. He refused and was stood down. At the Liverpool office, Ken Bernoth was working on the computer run for unemployment and sickness benefits cheques. He was told to do overpayments. He refused and he was stood down. In the Belmore office a pensions officer, Vincent Senat, was preparing an emergency cheque when he was told to do overpayments. He refused and was stood down. In the Marrickville office the manager was stood down for refusing to stop his staff working on hardship payments, stating that he believed their work was too important to stop and that he would rather be stood down himself. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Redfern, Camperdown and Marrickville offices are, as Senator Sibraa said, in areas of high unemployment and high migrant populations. They are areas where there are large numbers of disadvantaged people. In these offices people who were working on hardship cheques were asked to stop that work. When they refused to stop writing those cheques and to go on to the less urgent problem of overpayments, they were stood down. All this has occurred after a dispute which has lasted 12 months, yet at Question Time today the Minister had the temerity to complain bitterly. He talked about how disgusted he was with the activities of the officers in his Department who work in regional offices where they have to deal with the problems of the most disadvantaged people in this community. I know that the Minister is very disturbed at the situation. I know that he is disturbed at having to take the pigheaded attitude that he does take in this area. I know he is disturbed that in New South Wales some 29 offices have been closed, that 15 are providing collection services only and that 274 people have been stood down. But by his attitude at Question Time today he shows very little concern for those officers who in past years have worked very hard for the disadvantaged people in this community, who have worked under considerable difficulties without ever having taken industrial action and who only now after 12 months of trying to get some satisfactory response from the Department and the Minister are put in the desperate situation in which they have to take industrial action.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister and his Department quite callously concentrate on the area of unemployment and sickness benefits and deliberately do not put pressure on those officers in the pension area because they know that is politically undesirable. This is not proper industrial relations. This is cold, calculated, cynical, political action by the Minister and by those whom the Minister has immediately underneath him in the Department. I think it is a disgrace. I think it is a great problem that we have disputes like this in the Department of Social Security. But the people who are taking industrial action now are doing it only out of desperation. It is about time the Minister and the Government stopped their combative attitude, stopped their confrontationist approach and talked with the officers in the Department for the benefit of the disadvantaged people and indeed for the benefit of us all. Unless the social services legislation is administered in a reasonable and humane way we will not be acting in a civilised manner, but then I suppose this Government is not very interested in acting in a civilised manner. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Normally I would have waited for other honourable senators from the Opposition side and any other honourable senators who were interested in speaking on the estimates for the Department of Social Security before intervening in the debate but because it is proposed that the Committee should report progress shortly I thought I should make some very brief response to the points made in Committee by Senator Grimes. The first thing is that once again there appears to have been some exaggeration in what has been put down about the effects of this strike on the operations of my Department. The most recent advice I have is that within the State of New South Wales, where there are 58 regional offices, 39 are not affected at all. There is some effect in 19 of the offices, with four either being closed or with a mere trickle of work and 15 generally processing work but with some delays.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In any event I express my regret that the spokesman for the Opposition on social security matters should so uncritically support the position of the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association, which is a position not being supported by the majority of those people who work within the Department of Social Security, who are getting on with the job of serving the public, who are earning their pay and who have my admiration for that. I also appear to have made very little impact on Senator Grimes by directing his attention to some of the statements of the union with respect to the way in which it suggests that unionists should go about their work and the obstructionist tactics that it suggests they should adopt. What Senator Grimes seems to be saying to the Committee is that these Social Security officers are entitled to choose what work they shall do and to ignore the instructions of their senior officers when they are directed to work. Clearly that is a situation which is totally incompatible with the management of the Department and were--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Grimes" NAMEID="9V4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The examples cited by Senator Grimes related to people who apparently had been carrying on what they saw as the priority jobs of the office and were not prepared to take instructions and do the jobs which they were directed to do. In the event that Senator Grimes ever becomes a Minister I suggest that he will not find it compatible with his duties as a Minister of the Crown to have a situation in which the Department for which he is responsible does such work as is determined by individual officers at their discretion on their view as to what the client of the Department might require. I indicated at Question Time that any particular complaints that were raised would be examined, and of course they will be examined. But on the face of the complaints which have been made, we have a succession of complaints that officers have chosen to do the work which they see as priority and not to do the work that they are told to do by the Department. This whole dispute is being pursued in a manner which is aimed at trying to hide what is at the basis of it. The fact of the matter is that the union has raised areas of concern in three discrete ways. It has suggested that there are difficulties in the Department with respect to accommodation, that there are difficulties in the Department with respect to training and that there are difficulties in the Department with respect to staff ceilings. As I have previously indicated in this chamber, in all of those three areas the administration of the Department-the senior management of the Department-with the support of the Government has been assiduous in tackling those problems.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Looking at the area of accommodation-I visited offices which clearly were deficient in that respect-the Government made an allocation of over $2m within the last few months to ease some of the pressure points. Details have been given to the union and have been made public about the work which is being done to improve the training situation within the Department. The present position is that there is a substantial additional allocation for most of the rest of this financial year which will enable additional training to be undertaken. But with respect to the most critical aspect of the dispute, the question of the staff ceiling, the fact remains that this Department has had a very significant growth in its staff numbers under this Government, a growth which is not paralleled in any other department-going from the vicinity of 9,000 in 1976 to nearly 12,400 at the moment when one takes into account the temporary cover as well as the permanent ceiling of the Department. </PARA>
<PARA> It simply is not compatible with the facts to have the sort of action which is currently being taken in the Department particularly when one looks at the fact that for 12 months we have had bans being imposed by officers who believe they have the right to determine what work they will do, that the Department has patiently worked to improve the conditions which have been a matter of complaint, that bans have been lifted in all States except New South Wales and Victoria and that the union has shown that it is determined to maintain to itself the right to determine what work will be done and demands the right to determine what the staffing level of the Department will be. Those demands are simply not compatible with the proper management of the Public Service. </PARA>
<PARA> I give the clearest possible indication to this Committee that it is the Government's concern to see that the Department of Social Security is adequately trained and that it is adequately housed. I do not believe that anyone who examines the facts in this matter can in any sense justify the action of the union. Whatever the facts I do not believe the action of the union would be justified. When one looks at the reality of the position it certainly is not. </PARA>
<PARA> I referred this morning to the fact that this tiny band of people in the Department who see themselves as entitled to call the shots are actively suggesting to members of the Department that they should engage in behaviour which is obstructionist, which will delay the work of the Department and which will prevent people from getting benefits. Their main purpose in doing this is to try to avoid stand downs yet achieve the effect of not getting work done, of maintaining those bans. That is not acceptable, it is not reasonable, it is not fair and it is not just and it will not be acceded to by this Department or by this Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Initially I merely wish to reply to the remarks of Senator Chaney who tonight has taken the same tack as he took today. I reiterate for the Senate the actual history of this matter. There has been concern and difficulties over staff ceilings in the Department of Social Security for a long time. The present dispute has been going on for much longer than 12 months. Senator Chaney spoke about the problems I would have were I Minister for Social Security. The simple difference between Senator Chaney and me is that, if I were Minister for Social Security, I would do what people normally do when there is an industrial dispute; I would sit down and talk to the people involved in the dispute. That is what Senator Chaney has consistently refused to do. That is the first matter. He has consistently refused to sit down and talk to the union.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second objection I have-it is the objection that Senator Chaney continually skates around when he speaks on this matter-concerns the selective application of the Government's actions in this area. What has happened is that under instruction from the senior officers of the Department and, therefore, the Minister-Senator Chaney takes up the tack that the previous Minister used by saying it was the responsibility of the senior officers rather than himself-discriminatory and selective actions have been taken. Those people who are involved in writing out cheques for people who need emergency assistance have been asked, while doing that work, to do other work which in anybody's view is less urgent and in which in anybody's view would take them away from the proper work of the Department in assisting those in dire and immediate need. When these officers, including some managers, refuse to do that they are stood down. This is not done in other areas of the Department. It is a selective application of the stand-down procedures. It is a political act by the senior officers of the Department under the instructions of the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister is wrong if he thinks that he can get up in this place, as he did at Question Time today, and say: 'It is not me doing it. It is the Director-General and senior officers who are charged under the Social Services Act to do this'. If he thinks he can get away from the responsibility, as the Minister who preceded him in this job used to think, he is wrong. We will not allow him to do it. We will continue to point out the inconsistencies of his actions. If he wishes to have those on unemployment and sickness benefits in this community penalised by his heartless actions and the heartless actions of those who are responsible to him we will not stop pointing this out; we will continue to point it out to the community. We will persist in bringing this matter up in this Parliament when the Parliament is sitting and outside the Parliament when the Parliament is not sitting. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not take any joy in seeing industrial disputes in the Department of Social Security. I point out that until a couple of years ago, until this Government came to power, industrial disputes in this Department were unheard of because the officers of the Department are conscientious and decent people. They are not going to be trodden on and stood over by the likes of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) who is determined to create industrial disputes for his own political purposes. He is taking the line of his master, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). He will not succeed in the long run. He is not succeeding in the short run. We will continue to bring this matter up. His good and conscientious officers are no more impressed by his rhetoric than anybody else around the place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad that the Australian Labor Party has made it quite clear that it accepts the right of the trade union movement to determine staffing levels and what work shall be done in government departments. I have made it clear that neither I nor the Government accepts that. I make it quite clear also that on the inquiries I have made the Department of Social Security denies there has been any selective application of the sort indicated by Senator Grimes. I make it quite clear also that in pointing out what is a practical fact as well as a statutory fact the management of the Department is in the hands of the Director-General and his officers. I accept also that I am ministerially responsible for the actions of those officers. There is no doubt about that. The fact of the matter is that I am not physically participating in what occurs.

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has reconsidered its position in the light of the action taken by the Senate to amend the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill and the Australian National University Bill to delete the limited tuition fees provisions, and also to reject the Canberra College of Advanced Education Bill which dealt only with fees. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate has disagreed with the House in two important respects. It has not been prepared to endorse the provisions of the Bill passed by the House which authorise the limited reintroduction of student fees for selected second degree students, and it has also taken a contrary view to the Government as to the Senate's powers in respect of this legislation. During the debate in this chamber the Government argued that the Senate did not have the power to amend the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill, but it did not dispute the right of the Senate to request amendments to this legislation. The Senate, however, decided that it did have the power to make amendments and proceeded accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government regarded the Senate's action as contravening section 53 of the Constitution and it invited the House to set aside the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill in the form received from the Senate. The House has done so. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is now proposing a new measure which will provide for the program of grants to the States without the fees provisions to which the Senate objected. If the Senate approves this Bill, we will then introduce a separate Bill to amend the first Bill to restore the fees provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> In the case of the Australian National University, the House has accepted the Bill as received from the Senate, and it has also approved amendments to restore the fees provisions. The Senate will be asked to approve these amendments. The Government is not proposing to take any action for the present about the Canberra College of Advanced Education Bill which the Senate rejected. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has had to keep in mind that the principal purpose of the legislation is to appropriate funds totalling $1,725m for the universities, colleges of advanced education and TAFE institutions in the States and the Northern Territory for 1982 and further appropriations for some areas for 1983 and 1984 also. Provision has also to be made for cost adjustments in respect of the program for the 1979-81 triennium. Many institutions will be short of funds by late December unless this legislation is passed in sufficient time for the appropriate instalments of approximately $300m to be made available from the Commonwealth through the State Treasuries to the institutions. Their position will be made worse if further instalments of about $100m cannot be made in late January. </PARA>
<PARA> The grants reflect the Government's approval of the financial recommendations put forward by the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission in respect of State and Northern Territory institutions and in accordance with the guidelines announced by me on 4 June 1981. On 24 September I tabled Volume 2 of the Commission's Report which responded to the guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is in the form of the Bill amended by the Senate except for some minor differences to overcome technical defects in the amendments adopted by the Senate to remove the new tuition fees provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> In putting forward this Bill without the tuition fee provisions, the Government has recognised the urgent need to ensure that funds will be available to tertiary institutions in the States to proceed with their approved programs. Some funds are yet to be allocated for 1983 and 1984 and will be included in subsequent annual amendments. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Government will continue to press for the limited re-introduction of tuition fees for universities and colleges of advanced education. The Government accepts that fees should not be charged to first degree or diploma students, but it believes that students entering second diploma or degree courses or higher degree courses should pay tuition fees. These fees would be applied to a minority of students and would represent a small contribution to the cost of operating the institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> The inclusion of this tuition fees provision in a States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill as a condition to the grants for recurrent expenditure for universities and colleges of advanced education is the only mechanism open to the Commonwealth by which it can take legislative action. There is absolutely no question of the Government attempting to tack-on some extraneous matter to an Appropriation Bill. The Commonwealth has the sole responsibility for financing the universities and colleges of advanced education and has the authority to make a decision about fees and to attach that as a condition to its grants. It has been the practice since the grants for the 1974 academic year for the States Grants legislation for tertiary institutions to include a condition requiring the States to ensure that the universities, colleges of advanced education and TAFE colleges do not charge tuition fees. The Government has sought to continue that provision, except for second and higher degree students. </PARA>

<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the limited re-introduction of tuition fees in tertiary education institutions in the States and the Northern Territory. The Bill specifically excludes the charging of tuition fees for students undertaking courses leading to first degrees or diplomas. It also exempts students, who commenced second degree or diploma courses before 1982, from paying fees for those courses, and it sets a maximum fee of $1,000 per annum. Subject to these limitations the Bill contains a provision for the Minister to make determinations as to the circumstances in which students should be charged tuition fees or be exempt from such charges. The Bill provides as a condition of recurrent grants that institutions charge tuition fees in accordance with these arrangements and that they do not charge tuition fees in other circumstances. The Bill provides for recurrent grants scheduled in the States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) Bill 1981 to be offset by an amount equivalent to the money from tuition fees which those institutions will be required to charge. </PARA>

<PARA> (10) That the foregoing provisions of this Resolution, so far as they are inconsistent with the Standing Orders, have effect notwithstanding anything contained in the Standing Orders. </PARA>
<PARA>I thank the Senate for the opportunity of bringing on this matter before the end of the session. The motion I have moved provides for a standing committee of the Senate to be known as the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills. I have proceeded with this course because, after three years and a great deal of consideration, I believe that the time for this idea has come and it is desirable that the Senate should start to exercise this type of scrutiny. It will be recalled by honourable senators that two reports were presented to the Senate in November 1978, one on the scrutiny of Bills and the other on the delegation of parliamentary authority. The reports dealt with a connected subject, and the recommendations and proposals contained in them were for the establishment of a joint committee of both Houses to carry out the scrutiny that was found to be necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> It has proved impossible to have such a joint committee because the Government has not been prepared to accept that application. The course I am proposing I believe is the one which it is now desirable for the Senate to take. It is desirable because the Senate's review role is not adequately performed, yet that is the major and primary function which the Senate has been carrying out for many years. The initiative for this idea came from the Minister for Social Security, Senator Chaney. In his pre-ministerial days he put forward the idea, which was taken up by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, of which he was then a member. He may not have quite the same enthusiasm for the idea these days, but to him must go the credit for it. The purpose of the committee and the criteria for its establishment are set out in the motion. As a summary I will read the words I used when tabling the two reports of the Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. On 23 November 1978 I said:</PARA>
<PARA> In assessing the need for such a committee we noted that many Bills come before the Parliament which contain provisions that: Significantly interfere with personal rights and liberties; delegate powers which, arguably, should not be delegated at all; delegate powers to affect rights, liberties and obligations without providing an opportunity for the exercise of those powers to be reviewed either by the Parliament itself or by an independent body; or delegate powers to impose obligations without any clearly defined guidance as to who is to impose them, upon whom and in which circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> We commented in our scrutiny of Bills report that such provisions may well be the product of conscious and deliberate Government decision and, as a result, may have been extensively debated. But very often these provisions are not necessarily central to the policy objectives of the Government, do not as a result gain especial prominence, and in the rush of legislation tend to slip through the Parliament without full debate or any debate at all. There is, as a consequence, a need to maintain a watching brief in respect of these types of provisions. Whilst the Parliament can never hope to foresee and provide for every contingency, we believe that it can do a good deal to implement procedures to supervise the administrative decision-making process and to strengthen the position of the individual. The establishment of the joint committee on scrutiny of Bills would do just that. </PARA>
<PARA>Now that that possibility has escaped us for the present time, I believe that a Senate committee would do a task which would be nearly as good. A year later, on 22 November 1979, the Government made a response and rejected the proposal. It was rejected on most extraordinary grounds, and on arguments which were criticised heavily in the debate by honourable senators, including Senator Hamer and myself. Amongst other things, it was suggested that somehow this would cause delay in the passage of legislation. It was also suggested that this work was already done by the Cabinet and legislation committee, by back bench committees, and so forth, including the law and government committee of our parties, of which I was then deputy chairman. This was not so. We know that many of these proposals have gone through. It is important not to raise that argument, because it was unsound then, but to point out that since 1979 there has been no change in the situation; there is not a difference. In fact, this will be demonstrated by the examples I propose to place into the record of the Senate. The examples show that these provisions are going through without proper debate taking place in the Senate. The public response to the Committee's recommendations, in 1978 and 1979 was excellent, both in the Press and elsewhere. When the response of the Government came down Professor Gordon Reid, who I think everyone will agree is one of the eminent authorities on parliamentary affairs and the responsibility of government to the Parliament, had this to say at the Commonwealth Conference of Delegated Legislation Committees in September 1980:</PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Senate should now defy the Executive Government's negative reaction to the two reports of its Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee and establish its own committee of scrutiny over new delegated powers in legislation and matters of official discretions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Those were the words of Professor Gordon Reid, the Deputy Vice-Chancellor of the University of Western Australia. I say to Senator Chaney that he is an eminent authority. I believe that his words were correct. I must confess that I have followed what I believe is his good advice in introducing this motion. I point out to the Senate that there is a slight difference in the proposal I make from the proposal for a joint committee. The suggestion that there might be delay in the passage of legislation is taken away because the provision originally in the report was that if a Bill was to go through in less than four days then the Government would have to move for the suspension of Standing Orders. That provision is not contained in this proposal. It will be necessary for such a committee to move quickly and for its counsel to advise quickly if a government is moving at that sort of speed. It cannot be said that there are any elements of delay in the proposal I now make. However, there is need for action. There is a need for the appointment and creation of this committee so that it can be in active operation at the beginning of next year, have counsel appointed, and have the opportunity of a whole year of active operation. The major argument for this proposal is that the vital role of scrutiny is not adequately performed at the present time. That this is a review which needs to be made was evidenced by the Age on 16 December 1978 when it stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The committee would have no power to impede or disallow legislation, but its ability to scrutinise and publicise could have a persuasive influence of constraint on overweening government. The proposal is worthy of adoption-and not only by the Federal Parliament. It is probably even more needed in the States. </PARA>
<PARA>I will not go further into that area. I hope this might be of some help to the States when they are dealing with legislation. The Committee on Regulations and Ordinances is about to have its fiftieth anniversary, an achievement which is recognised throughout the world as being an excellent one. No doubt the critics thought in the first place that it should not be established. We now have a technical scrutiny in regard to subsidiary legislation which is undertaken by the Committee on Regulations and Ordinances. But we do not have such a situation and method when we come to the Bills that are the primary legislative purpose and work of this Parliament. Also, we do not have in this Parliament people who will sit down day after day and study Bills. For many years we had here Senator Sir Reginald Wright and Senator Jim Cavanagh, two people who did an enormous job in the areas in which they were interested. They were small scrutiny of Bills committees in themselves, but that work is not done now. They have not been replaced. None of us would claim that we fill the role that they filled. Of course, just more than one or two individuals are needed. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the Government rejected this proposal, I took the opportunity, when Chairman of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee, to ask the staff of the Parliament to go through all of the Bills passed in 1980 and test them against the same regulations and ordinances criteria that we are seeking to apply, by way of this motion, through a scrutiny of Bills committee. I asked them to study the Bills that we passed in that year, the last complete year of sittings of the Parliament, and ascertain whether there were clauses that ought to have been drawn to the attention of the Parliament and considered and debated in the same way as regulations which are drawn to the attention of the Parliament by the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. The resulting document, which I will seek to incorporate in Hansard, contains 79 examples of clauses in Bills passed in that year which ought to have been brought to the notice of the Parliament. No doubt some of them were mentioned. Some of them were raised in the Parliament but mostly they were not. I seek leave to incorporte in Hansard the list of Bills passed in 1980 and the comments made concerning them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. Many examples are provided in the document, which I believe has been distributed to honourable senators who will be able to study them. I am not saying, of course, that all or even the majority of those provisions should not have been passed but the attention of the Senate and of the people should be drawn to examples of reversals of onus of proof, or requirements that people answer questions that may incriminate them, and the like. Yet those provisions often went through without any comment whatsoever in the Committee stage in this Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Senate, or such a committee as I propose, would need expert advice of counsel, just as does the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. Counsel could draw the attention of the committee, which would be made up of busy people, to specific provisions and it in turn could take the matter further. I wish to refer to a classic case which I have raised in the Parliament. In fact, I raised it at Question Time today. It concerns the Atomic Energy Amendment Bill of 1978. Senator Georges and I raised certain questions concerning civil liberties in regard to it. However, they were not central to the main debate in the chamber at the time and were swept aside. Now it is proposed, as the Government indicated today, to try to repair the deficiencies in that legislation. That is the vital need. The Government, and others, have argued against my proposal. During the course of the whole debate various old arguments have been brought up. The arguments that I shall mention now were considered and rejected in the Senate committee reports. I have taken the opportunity of preparing a memorandum which has been distributed to the leaders of all parties and to Senator Harradine. It incorporates purposes of the proposed committee and the answers to various questions and queries raised. To save time I seek leave to incorporate the document in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>MEMORANDUM TO GOVERNMENT SENATORS CONCERNING A NOTICE OF MOTION GIVEN BY SENATOR ALAN MISSEN (19.8.81) FOR CREATION OF A STANDING COMMITTEE FOR THE SCRUTINY OF BILLS</PARA>
<PARA> This is a summary statement of issues raised in debate on this proposal and makes reference to the documents which should be read to appreciate the purposes of the Motion. </PARA>
<PARA>DOCUMENTS</PARA>
<PARA> (1) The Motion is designed to implement generally the unanimous recommendations of the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee Report (Parliamentary Paper No. 329/1978). (See also my tabling statement-Senate Hansard 23.11.78 page 2450 and following). Reference should also be made to the twin 'Report on Delegation of Parliamentary Authority' tabled the same day and proposing the same solution to the problem. There are necessary alterations in my Motion to accommodate a separate Senate Committee, rather than a Joint Committee, which was the favoured alternative solution of the Committee but which was rejected by the Government in its 'Response'. (See Senate Hansard 22.11.79 p. 2795 and following). The extraordinary arguments then advanced in that Response are criticized by me and by other Senators in the following pages of Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> The two Senate Committee Reports are relatively short documents and require to be read to appreciate the scope and intention of the proposed new Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>PURPOSE OF COMMITTEE</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Government is obviously unwilling to sponsor the creation of a Scrutiny Committee, which would bring both or either of the Houses into the work of regular scrutiny of the terms of proposed legislation, to ensure that Bills (a) do not interfere with personal rights and liberties, (b) provide adequate review of administrative powers and decisions, or (c) do not unduly delegate legislative powers without proper parliamentary scrutiny. In a similar way to the Regulations and Ordinances Committee (dealing with subordinate legislation), this new Committee would be advised by competent Counsel, develop a similar bipartisan approach to 'technical scrutiny' and consitute a valuable weapon for Senators in fulfilling their review role. The proposals of the Consitutional and Legal Affairs Committee were widely praised at the time the Report was presented (and since) and further investigations made by the staff of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee have revealed that, since the Reports came down, there have been many Bills where provisions appear to infringe the proposed guidelines or where the terms should at least have been drawn to the Senate's attention. Samples of this survey (or Bills passed in 1980 and 1981) will be detailed in my speech in support of the Motion. </PARA>
<PARA>QUESTIONS AND QUERIES</PARA>
<PARA> (3) A number of questions and queries have been raised. They are all dealt with in the Reports but the following are summary answers. </PARA>
<PARA> (a) Is this 'technical' scrutiny already adequately performed? No. Neither Parliamentary Counsel, nor Party Committees have sufficiently concentrated on the machinery provisions and many examples can be given. Existing Committees dwell mainly on major policy considerations. The Law and Government Committee, for example, deals with legal bills only and has never entered into 'civil liberty' aspects of other bills. Party committees confine themselves to bills in their allotted policy area. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) Should the Regulations and Ordinances Committee handle scrutiny as an additional task? No. That Committee is already fully committed with a massive agenda each week requiring extensive reading and study, nor could its Counsel be expected to absorb this further burdensome task. By imposing the burden on the same Senators (and a burden which would become demanding and tedious for them), we would threaten the continued operations of a most successful Committee of the Senate. It is worth bearing in mind that in New Zealand both bills and regulations are scrutinized by one Committee and in practice, regulations are hardly even considered by that Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) Should the Consitutional and Legal Affairs Committee be given this additional role of scrutiny? No. The constant and often urgent demands arising from scrutiny of all sorts of bills would ensure a depletion of reports from this Committee in its 'law reform' role. Indeed it has not at present the staff nor time to handle adequately the Annual Reports sent to it. Moreover, its members have no special knowledge outside the legal reform area that would make them uniquely fitted to perform the scrutiny task for all bills. </PARA>
<PARA> (d) Should the scrutiny of bills be done by each Standing Committee in its area of expertise? No. The task would be performed in a ragged fashion dependent on the other business before the Committee (preparation of reports, heawring of evidence, etc). There would be great disparities in the number of bills sent to each Committee and some other Committee or person would have to determine which committee would do the scrutiny (some bills are relevant to more than one policy area). Moreover, the appointed Counsel would have to consult with up to 8 separate Committees and report to them separately. Of course, a Scrutiny Committee, which would develop some expertise and methods of operation, would not replace the need for Senators, in their individual capacity or as Standing Committee members, to watch the terms of Bills close to their particular interest. It is an additional weapon to perform tasks not adequately done at present. </PARA>
<PARA>PRESENT NEED</PARA>
<PARA> (4) For these and other reasons, the recommendation to create a separate Standing Committee for the scrutiny of bills was made. It was an idea originally of Senator Chaney's, warmly welcomed, analysed and expanded by my Standing Committee and it can greatly enhance the effective operation of our review role. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many suggestions made for separate Select Committees to be set up by the Senate but, of course, there are limitations on the number of such Committees that can be properly manned and staffed by the Senate. However, I believe that we should consider, as a first priority, the setting up of any Committee necessary to complement the primary work of the Senate in its review process and it is with this in mind that I press this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA>ALAN MISSEN  16 October 1981 Senator for Victoria</PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YL7">Senator MISSEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. I will just mention certain of those arguments at this stage. I have referred to the argument that this work is already performed by Cabinet and Cabinet Committees, Parliamentary counsel and Parliamentary committees. We know that that is not so. Sometimes it is done but the party committees are looking at the essential policy considerations and often miss the detailed proposals in a Bill. It is said that the proposal would delay legislation. I point out that there is in the motion no provision that could result in the delaying of legislation. The Senate, or House of Representatives, of course, can delay legislation if that is its wish. At times it should do so, but that will not happen because of the existence of this committee. It is also said: If you want this done, let the Regulations and Ordinances Committee do it; there is already a committee available. To follow that course would be unfortunate and rather burdensome. Anyone who knows the type of work that the regulations and Ordinances Committee has to do each week, the hundreds of pages that have to be looked at by its members, would realise that to add this task would be unnecessarily burdensome.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We know that in New Zealand, where a Statutes Revisions Committee with somewhat similar powers considers both Bills and Regulations, as Professor Keith Jackson has pointed out in an article, the examination of regulations has died away and that course is hardly ever followed. Therefore, we do not want to do anything that would damage the great record of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. We are also told: 'Let each of the standing committees do this. Let each of them be a Scrutiny of Bills committee'. We can imagine how ragged would be such a performance. Some committees would be taking evidence. Some would be busy; others would not be. The whole eight committees would have to seek from time to time the advice of the counsel and I believe that would be an impossible achievement. I repeat, there is nothing in this proposal which suggests that existing standing committees ought not to look at Bills. Their attention ought be drawn to defects but we do need a committee that is charged with that duty. </PARA>
<PARA> It is also suggested that the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee might well undertake the task. I know that my colleague, Senator Hamer, intends to move an amendment to the effect that for the first six months that Committee would have the responsibility of carrying out the proposed function and reporting back to the Parliament. I am aware of his proposed amendment. I merely say that although I think it will be proven that there is need for a separate committee, I would be very happy that there be a trial period such as he suggests. I certainly will support the proposed amendment and hope that other honourable senators will do likewise. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not think that it can be said that there are in this Parliament too many committees already, but if there are the essential tasks ought to be ones pursued. The central task of review is the one that we are not performing sufficiently. If it is said that there is not enough work for such a committee, that the committee will not be busy all of the time, I draw attention to the fact that we have committes such as the Privileges Committee which are not always busy. However, very often one has to have such committees to ensure that a responsibility is accepted for a certain task. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that in this proposal we are providing a facility which is useful for both Houses of the Parliament. We cannot have a joint responsibility in such a committee but can, as senators, continue to exercise this particular power. I believe that we have to ensure that objections to Bills are drawn to the attention of the Senate. They need not be thrown out but we need to be shown, we need to be warned. We have even more need for that in Australia since in this country we do not have a Bill of rights. I am not one who presently advocates having such a Bill, but other senators do. However, because we do not have one it is all the more reason why parliamentary scrutiny is essential and should be undertaken more thoroughly. The onus is surely on us to ensure that civil liberties are protected, that Bills are not passed which damage them. We must ensure also that bipartisanship is protected and assisted in the Parliament. We know, regardless of what the public may sometimes think that most things in the Parliament are done in a bipartisan spirit. Therefore, I ask honorable senators to vote for the motion. I ask them to put their votes where their mouths have always been. We have maintained that we are proud of the record of this Senate as a house of review. Review is not adequately undertaken at present. This proposal gives us a chance to undertake review in a much more adequate fashion. For these reasons I urge that the motion be supported. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The key to Senator Missen's motion, which I welcome, and the call which entitles it to the support of the chamber, is the emphasis throughout that the task of the proposed committee is to report to the Senate, to maintain a watching brief. It would primarily carry out a task on our behalf. It would provide a watchdog service for senators. It may alert us to its opinion that such and such a proposed law might trespass unduly on personal rights and liberties, might make rights, liberties and obligations unduly dependent upon insufficiently defined administrative powers or non-reviewable administrative decisions or might inappropriately delegate legislative power or insufficiently subject its exercise to parliamentary scrunity. Having alerted us to that opinion, its warning task, its alerting task would be complete.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This chamber and the Parliament itself may not be convinced that the Bill, if enacted, would have the sort of impact which the committee claimed, the chamber may agree that there is some impact but not of a degree which should cause concern, or it may agree that the Bill would have a severe and detrimental impact but that some countervailing considerations persuade us as legislators that the Bill, on balance, would serve the good government of the people. But we would be doing so with open eyes. There would be proper debate as to the conflicting considerations. In other words, there ought to be no inadvertent trespassing unduly upon rights and liberties or unduly making rights, liberties and obligations dependent upon insufficiently defined administrative powers and so on in contravention of the criteria laid down. In the ministerial statement responding to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, which recommended such a mechanism on our behalf-a response, I might say, which was delivered some 12 months after the Senate Committee made its report-only two arguments really were mounted in opposition to the proposal, and they are both contained in the sixth paragraph of that ministerial response, which I shall read. Senator Durack made the response on behalf of the Government. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the present proposals amount to injecting a new element into the legislative process and one which we believe will distort, and may lengthen, the present arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the first argument. The second argument is:</PARA>
<PARA> We believe that every member of the Parliament should be concerned, when legislation is before the Parliament, with any questions of human rights and civil liberties which may arise. This proposal would tend to make this concern the responsibility of one small group only. </PARA>
<PARA>I understand and would imagine that Senator Chaney will adopt the same sort of argument on behalf of the Government. In other words, in two years he has had no reason to change the view of the Government, but I hope that the four counter arguments that I will put tonight may give him cause to reflect over the next couple of nights until Thursday night when the matter comes back into this chamber. To the first argument that the formation of such a committee may lengthen the present arrangements for the passage of Government legislation, or indeed any legislation, I think there are four answers. Firstly, the composition of the committee would be six senators, three of whom may constitute a quorum to enable the committee to discharge its function. It would be aided by legal counsel. It would have the ability to meet at any time, whether the Parliament is prorogued or whatever. Given the acceptance of Senator David Hamer's proposal that the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs members be the first members of the Senate to constitute that committee, its composition and the mechanism I have outlined would allow the quick discharge of its responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, as we made clear in paragraph 3.12 of the Committee report, clauses of the Bills are to be referred to the committee, not the Bills themselves. That would bring progress of the Bills through the chamber to a dead standstill. The clauses of the Bills would be referred to the committee, and that would allow contemporaneous consideration by the committee and by either chamber of the Parliament. Once again in that regard there would be no lengthening or distorting of the mechanism for getting the Bill through the Parliament. Thirdly, and of course this is related to that point, the process of scrutiny could begin before the Bill is introduced into this chamber. In other words, clause (1) (b) of the motion states:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Committee, for the purpose of reporting . . . when the Bill is introduced into the Senate, may consider any proposed law or other document or information available to it, notwithstanding that such proposed law, document or information has not been presented to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Or even earlier, and we could begin working on behalf of this chamber immediately, before the matter came into the Senate. But finally, and to make it quite clear that the process of the mechanism of scrutiny proposed would not impede the legislative process should the Government desire that a piece of legislation should have a very speedy passage through the Parliament, the committee would be empowered to report in respect of Acts of the Parliament. In other words, though the principal or invariable task of the committee would be to report on clauses of Bills coming into this chamber, should the Bill pass into law before the committee has had a chance to carry out its scrutiny and then report, it may report after the event. Then, of course, the onus would be on this chamber to consider very seriously, if the matter required it, whether some amending legislation ought to be brought forward to remedy the defect which had appeared.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the first of the Executive's arguments against Senator Missen's proposal, and indeed the Senate Committee's proposal, therefore fails. There is nothing in this proposal which would delay or distort the passage of legislation through the Parliament except, of course, for such delay as would enable this chamber properly to carry out its responsibility of deliberation with informed consideration. That surely answers the second argument within that paragraph in the ministerial response. Far from lifting responsibility from the shoulders of the other 58 senators within the chamber, I believe that lawmaking by senators would become that much more onerous and far more responsible because of the benefit that the other 58 senators may have given them by reason of the fact that they would have before them a report on the Bill from the scrutiny committee insofar as it may have an impact in the areas outlined in the criteria. That means that rather than having something slip through the surveillance of this chamber because of our concentration on some primary policy objective embodied in the Bill, our attention would be drawn to where it may unduly trespass on civil rights and liberties, and our decision making would be that much more responsible for the help of the committee. Of course this does not apply only to Government legislation. The benefit which this chamber would derive from the work of such a committee would apply to any Bill before it. We in the chamber are becoming quite conscious that that embraces not only Government Bills but also Bills emanating from individual senators from other groupings-the Opposition, the Australian Democrats or the Independent senator-and individual senators within the Government ranks. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I do not intend to elaborate on the criteria suggested in Senator Missen's motion. They are general rather than overly specific; they do not use itemised check lists. The Senate Committee felt it would be difficult in expressing criteria with a required degree of precision in a check list exhaustively to detail those matters which might indeed call for a remark by such a committee. It is better to leave general criteria rather than specific. In any case the members of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, constituting the interim committee of Senator David Hamer's construction, would have a chance to report to this chamber on whether the criteria, general as they are, are adequate to the task we ask of them.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe we are dealing here with a matter which is at the heart of our parliamentary democracy. Section 51 of the Constitution makes it clear that it is for the Parliament, subject to the Constitution, to have power to make laws for the peace, order and good government of the Commonwealth with respect to various matters. Section 61 reposes in the Executive the responsibility of carrying out and executing those laws, but we have the responsibility of being the creative law makers of this country, those who determine the legal structure and framework within which Australians can live as free people and prosper within a mixed economy. We have to create the laws. We have to create the legal framework and structure and it must be an enhancement of our task, our responsibility, and an aid to our carrying out of what we are burdened by the Constitution to do to have available to us the report of a scrutiny committee such as is proposed. Insofar as this proposal of Senator Missen deriving from the Senate Committee enables us more honestly and adequately to discharge that responsibility, I believe it is to be commended to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise a matter of concern relating to three departments of the Australian Government; The Department of Administrative Services, the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and the Australian Atomic Energy Commission within the Department of National Development and Energy. The matter of concern revolves around two computers-a secondhand 4Mb IBM 3031 model 4 processor and a new IBM 3033S processor. The Pacific Computer Weekly, in the issue dated 13 November 1981, a magazine circulating among data processing and computer people in Australia, New Zealand and other Pacific countries, identified a remarkable example of government incompetency. The magazine states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Second hand computer equipment being brought from IBM Australia for installation at the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in Canberra will cost conservatively $190,000 more than identical equipment available on the open market for used IBM equipment. </PARA>
<PARA> An Australian computer broker told Australian Computer Weekly he could have supplied identical equipment to that going into the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs-A 4Mb 3031 model 4 processor and two items of related equipment-to full current IBM specification, for $160,000 inclusive of installation and all other costs. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation apparently is that the computer to be purchased is currently installed under lease at the Atomic Energy Commission. The computer magazine has estimated, working from current IBM price figures available in the industry, that the secondhand computer available from IBM will cost slightly over $350,000-as I said, a difference of $190,000. The Atomic Energy Commission is contemplating up-grading its computer facilities to the twice as powerful 3033S processors. From a Government that never hesitates to broadcast its alleged commitment to free enterprise and the virtues of competition in the market-place, it is disturbing that both computer purchases were made without any public tenders. In both cases, the Department of Administrative Services issued certificates of inexpediency which allowed the purchases to proceed without going through any tendering process. </PARA>
<PARA> Two excuses may be put forward by the Government to explain its lack of consistency. The first is that the Immigration Department has an installation deadline of 1 December. However, the computer journal suggests that no approaches were made to used-computer brokers overseas or in Australia to see whether such a short deadline could be met. The second excuse might be that the Atomic Energy Commission, by having its lower grade computer sold to the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, has saved itself a penalty of about $120,000 forfeited through breaking its lease. So the situation is that the Immigration Department is paying an exorbitant price so that the Atomic Energy Commission, an authority within the Department of National Development and Energy, may avoid expenses. The question remains whether all this manoeuvring will in fact save Australia money or simply boost the profits of a large multinational corporation. To conclude, I again quote from the Pacific Computer Weekly. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The alternative possibility-whereby the Australian Atomic Energy Commission paid the $120,000 penalty and the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs sourced a used 3031 for around $160,000, would have saved around $70,000 to achieve the same results. In fact, it would probably have saved closer to $100,000 when transportation, installation and related costs built into the broker's $160,000 but additional charges with IBM are taken into account. </PARA>
<PARA>So much for a government supposedly committed to cutting costs!</PARA>
