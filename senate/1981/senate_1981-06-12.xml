<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs. It emanates from a conference held in New Delhi some months ago which was aimed at restricting or curbing the illegal, black market export of ivory tusks from various African countries. One of the recommendations appeared to be measures taken to ban this illegal traffic. Applying it to the Australian scene, what instructions, if any, have been given to our Customs authorities to check for illegal tusks? Alternatively, what role are we playing at the United Nations? I think the former area is where the responsibility of Customs officers of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs lies. Has any illegal traffic been detected and have any prosecutions been launched?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister representing the Treasurer. I preface my question by indicating that, on 29 May 1981, I asked the Attorney-General a question without notice concerning the initiation of a class action in the United States of America against Alcoa and Reynolds by the Conservation Council of Western Australia. I now ask: Is the Treasurer aware that the magazine Habitat is calling for donations which can be used to assist in the initiation of a class action in the United States of America by the Conservation Council of Western Australia against Alcoa and Reynolds? Is the Minister aware that the magazine is saying that any donations made are tax deductible? Is it a fact that these donations are tax deductible? If so, what is the rationale behind the donations being tax deductible particularly as the Government and the Opposition in this Parliament and in the Parli- ament of Western Australia have condemned this action? Will the Minister undertake to review this tax deductibility aspect? If the donations are not tax deductible, what action might the Treasurer be contemplating to alert both the magazine and its subscribers to the facts as they stand about the tax deductibility of donations?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame MARGARET GUILFOYLE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer is aware of the information that has been provided through the article that was mentioned by the honourable senator in his question. Gifts to organisations or funds conducting environmental campaigns do not generally qualify for deductions in terms of the specific provisions of the income tax law relating to gifts. However, the Australian Conservation Foundation is specifically named in the Income Tax Assessment Act as an organisation to which donations to the value of $2 and upwards may be made which can qualify as income tax deductions for the donors. The position is that, provided a gift is made to the Foundation, it is immaterial how the Council or the Foundation chooses to use the gift having regard to the objects and powers expressed in the Foundation's constitution. I understand that the terms of the constitution empower the Council to provide any kind of assistance to or to co-operate with, by any means, organisations for a purpose considered to further the objectives of the Foundation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question central to the issue for tax purposes is whether the gifts in question are made to the Australian Conservation Foundation in its own right or to another organisation with the Foundation merely acting as trustee or in a fiduciary capacity in respect of the donation. If the latter were the case, the donations would not qualify for deductions as the law now stands. This is a matter which will, as necessary, be kept under review by the Commissioner of Taxation in his administration of the income tax law.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Why don't you fellows listen to what I am saying? In the light of the facts surrounding the Telecom Australia dispute, the potential wages boom and the consequent inflation problems which may flow from the resolution of that dispute, does the Government accept that the wage fixing process of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission has been proved a failure and should now be scrapped in favour of collective bargaining so that the resources of the nation can be properly allocated?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3186" SPEAKER="Chaney Sen The Hon F.M." NAMEID="EF4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I start my answer by saying that I do not accept the apology of the honourable senator for putting the question at 10 past nine in the morning. The matters which he raised in the question-the possibility of a wages boom and the difficulties which would flow from that-are matters which are, of course, of concern to the Government. I do not think, however, that the agreement which was entered into and the decision of yesterday can be seen as failures of the wage fixing process. I think, rather, one might regret that the wage fixing process was not applied to the problems faced by Telecom. The fact is that an agreement was made without its being subject to the processes of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission-processes which have been designed by the Commission after a great deal of argument by the various parties in an attempt to find a fair method of fixing wages for the whole community. It is a problem which needs to be faced in a community in which there are not equal opportunities for bargaining, in which different groups do not have the same strength and in which there is a lot to be said for some uniformity of treatment of wage and salary earners in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fact is that the settlement which was entered into by Telecom was a direct agreement between Telecom and the union. It was not made subject to the approval of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and that, I think, is a matter which we might regret. For that reason I do not believe it can be held up as being something which proves that the wage fixing process is a failure. Rather, it points to a failure to use existing mechanisms, a failure which is regretted by the Government, and which the Government does not intend to have occur again with respect to its instrumentalities.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Acting Leader of the Government in the Senate and refers to the algebraic formulas contained in the report on tax sharing entitlements by the Commonwealth Grants Commission. Has he noted that the tariff protection factor is not included in the equations contained in the report? Is it a fact that Victoria and New South Wales receive per head of population almost twice as much money in tariff protection as Western Australia and Tasmania? Is it also a fact that this money which is paid to Victoria and New South Wales in part comes from revenue generated by the resources activities in the States of Western Australia, Tasmania and Queensland? How can this factor be incorporated in the equations for the purpose of revenue sharing?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3187" SPEAKER="Durack Sen The Hon P.D." NAMEID="8G4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="ATTORNEY GENERAL" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is certainly a fact that the Commonwealth Grants Commission report on relativities does not take into account the matter that Senator Harradine has raised in relation to the varying effects or the importance that the tariff obviously has in different States. The reason that does not appear in this report is that that question is not one which is within the Commission's powers or the matters that the Commission is asked to consider in a relativities report or indeed if it were considering an ordinary report by a claimant. That is why it is not there. It is not because this question is not a very important one.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I accept the matters Senator Harradine raised in relation to the effect of the tariff as being broadly the situation that presents itself. As I said yesterday, the Government has yet to give consideration to this report. It is a recommendation only, albeit a recommendation from a very distinguished body. The members of the Commission recognise, of course, that the implementation of the report is one for governments, not for them. It is a matter to which the Government will have to give very serious and deep consideration in the coming months, and in particular it will be a matter for discussion when the Premiers meet next Friday. An enormous number of problems arise in relation to the report, and in answer to questions yesterday I made some reference to them. I believe that the questions Senator Harradine raised and other questions that will be raised are all matters that will have to be considered by the respective governments in coming to final decisions in this matter.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. Having in mind that Australian motorists already are contributing in excess of $3.5 billion to the Federal Government in excise and crude oil levy payments, in addition to the fuel taxes and fixed motoring charges such as registration and licence fees imposed by State governments, is it a fact that the Federal Government is proposing to impose upon Australian motorists further increases in motor fuel excise when it brings down its next Budget?

I am not in a position to make any comment on them or to speculate in any way about what might be the provisions of the forthcoming Budget. I can say at this stage only that there will probably be many cases where suggestions will be included or excluded from the Budget.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No new commitments or new undertakings were given to Professor Hollows or to Mr Briscoe. I repeat what I think I told the Senate last week, that although Professor Hollows had said he would resign I understand there was never a resignation. It was nothing more than a stated intention. There was in fact no resignation to withdraw as the Professor had not offered any resignation to the Royal Australian College of Ophthalmologists.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Nevertheless, the fact is that there was no resignation and what was withdrawn was his intention. At the meeting which took place with the Prime Minister a number of points of clarification were sought. These included clarification of the fact that direct funding of Aboriginal medical services by the Commonwealth Government-that is direct funding from the Commonwealth Government to organisations and not through the States-would continue. This was a point on which there had been some unnecessary confusion and on which the two gentlemen wanted to have some confirmation. There was agreement that we would pursue further avenues for training of Aboriginal health workers in view of the need for more trained personnel in order to implement our policy. There was a request-I do not have the list in Bront of me-that the name of the environmental health program should be changed, that we should use a different form of words, since some Aboriginal people do not comprehend what the words 'environmental health program' mean. I think, from memory, the request was that we should use the term 'Aboriginal public health program'. We readily agreed to that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There was a request concerning the use of the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation as a resource organisation. On that point I made it clear that we had decided that the National Aboriginal Conference should be our adviser, but that it could turn to anyone it wished. It could turn to NAIHO for advice if it so wished. There was a request that the trachoma program be followed up. We had given that commitment, and arrangements were made for us to have discussions on bringing forward a conference to advance the trachoma program. That, of course, is a matter which involved my colleague, the Minister for Health.</PARA>
<PARA> I must say that subsequent to that meeting I had a further meeting with Professor Hollows, Mr Briscoe and my officers. At that stage an offer was made to Mr Briscoe that he might well join the Department of Aboriginal Affairs on a consultancy basis-the details to be worked out later- to examine some of the implementation aspects. I subsequently received a letter from Mr Briscoe indicating that he would not accept such a position as he thought that it would not be in the best interests of Aboriginal people if he took it. The letter dated 9 June 1981 which indicated that Mr Briscoe did not wish to be associated with the program which we had offered him is brief. I just read the relevant part of it. The letter states:</PARA>
<PARA> I met with both Mr Perkins and Mr Brownbil on Friday 5 June and I felt that the proposal, as a consultant, would not only render the tasks set down by myself and Professor Hollows unachievable but would also jeopardise the 'vigorous' pursuit of the Government's five-year program to improve Aboriginal health.</PARA>
<PARA>On that basis he turned down our offer, and we have accepted that he has the right so to do. It is not our job to press him to take a course of action which he does not wish. If Mr Briscoe does not join the Department, it is because he has decided not to do so. It might be appropriate to have incorporated in Hansard the text of Mr Briscoe's letter. I seek leave to do so.</PARA>

<PARA> Since Friday's meeting, I have mentioned that I supported the Task Force proposal to both Mr Brownbil and Mr Perkins. Mr Brownbil seemed to have been thinking along these lines as well.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I do not agree with the propositions put forward by the honourable senator in that question. It is a matter of some difficulty and one which did go before the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. It is interesting to note that the Australian Council of Trade Unions put forward a proposition to the Arbitration Commission. This was put by Mr Kelty and was quoted in the judgment of the Full Bench. Mr Kelty said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I make clear from the ACTU's position that it is not an agreement which, by itself, represents a reason for general award increases in the community. I also make it clear from the ACTU's position that we do not see it as a ground for increases in the public sector rates generally, and, except insofar as technical and related grades within Australia Post are concerned, we also make it clear that no union should be able to make it a claim for the restoration of their relative position with respect to the agreement.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the position as put forward by the ACTU. It suggests a clear corralling of the arrangement to the particular people who are involved. Clearly it is a matter of concern to the Government that whatever is said by the ACTU might be regarded by individual trade unions in a rather different light. I concede that this is a possibility and, therefore, that the fears expressed by the honourable senator are fears which are also of concern to the Government.</PARA>
<PARA> In the statement which was issued by Mr Ian Sinclair and Mr Wal Fife on behalf of the Government it was made clear that these are matters to which the Commonwealth did propose to give attention. I will quote briefly from parts of that statement. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the small number of technical and related grades in Australia Post, the Commonwealth will oppose any application to extend the agreement in other areas of Telecom, Australia Post, or other Commonwealth instrumentalities.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that is quite consistent with the view which was put forward on behalf of the ACTU by Mr Kelty. One might think, with the combination of both the Government and the ACTU singing the same song on this occasion, we might have some prospects of success. I think it is also important to draw the attention of the Senate to this fact which was mentioned in the statement by the Ministers on behalf of the Government:</PARA>
<PARA> In negotiating the Agreement, Telecom has acted contrary to standing Government instructions that where any Commonwealth authority is involved in the negotiation or settlement of significant industrial disputes, the terms of settlement should be fully consistent with the wage fixing principles of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and the Government's wages policy.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> In this respect, the actions by Telecom in completing the agreement cannot be condoned.</PARA>
<PARA> Those who have negotiated on its behalf have done so contrary to the instructions of the Minister for Communications as conveyed to the Acting Chairman of Telecom in his letter of 25 May.</PARA>
<PARA> The completion of the agreement was also contrary to a specific Cabinet instruction of 28 March, 1979, that the authority should consult with the Department of Industrial Relations, and the terms of settlement be subject to the agreement of the Department of Industrial Relations, and where appropriate, its Minister.</PARA>
<PARA>It is quite clear from the quotations which I have read to the Senate that Telecom was outside the authority which has been delegated to it and that this is a matter of great concern to the Government.

In view of the questions from Government senators and Senator Chaney's responses to those questions about the Telecom Australia dispute-I am sure they have created in the minds of many honourable senators uncertainty as to whether the Government now agrees to settle the dispute-is the Minister in a position to tell the Senate the official point of view of the Government as to whether it has agreed to the settlement as reported in the Press?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the position is quite clear.

<PARA> In these circumstances, the Government believes it has no alternative but to allow Telecom to honour its agreement, subject to all union bans being lifted and normal work resuming.</PARA>
<PARA>I think that is quite clear. On the other hand, I suppose those honourable senators who were up early enough either to listen to the radio news or indeed to read the newspapers-I must confess that I have seen very little of the newspapers myself but I know there have been some Press reports-would know that concern has been expressed about this settlement for the simple reason that it potentially affects the guidelines which I referred to in my first answer on this subject this morning. That is a matter which ought to be of concern to all honourable senators.</PARA>
<PARA> For that reason the Australian Council of Trade Unions saw fit to corral this in the statement of Mr Kelty which I referred to also in answer to a question this morning. I think the sorts of concerns about the wage fixing system are concerns which go to the position of all workers in Australia as well as to the general economic implications of the guidelines being generally breached.</PARA>
<PARA> The expressions of concern which have been evident in the questions asked-I think they have been evident in my reply-are based on the very real need to maintain a situation in Australia where we do not go through a repeat of what occurred in 1974 when there were massive rises in money wages which were not reflected in long term economic benefits but rather in a dislocation of the economy from which we have suffered for many years.</PARA>

Although it is said that it would cost $125m to move to a 50c flat rate, that would also need to be looked at in the context of what people who now pay less than the 50c rate would then pay-whether there would be any movement in that regard. The majority of taxpayers are presently at that lower level.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I am not aware of the prediction of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development referred to in the question raised by Senator Lewis, nor am I aware of the reports to which he referred of the massive dislocation of existing programs and further cuts and revision to Government policy. In response, I can say only that I think it is well known that quite central to the Government's economic policies at present is the containment of inflation to as low a level as possible. There is growth and development within the Australian economy. We will be seeking to sustain that growth and provide the opportunities that are within our reach for improvements in employment opportunities and services that are in many instances desirable in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not possible for me to comment at present on what will be policy decisions relating to the forthcoming Budget. I note the list that was mentioned by Senator Lewis. I think some of the things that have been suggested are quite contrary to the policies that the Government has shown in its support for income security measures, welfare matters and many other things that, even at the time it has been attempting to restrain expenditure, it has continued to support. The restraint that we will need to exercise will naturally be one of the things discussed with State governments at the forthcoming Premiers Conference and Loan Council meetings. I do not think there is anything that I can add, other than to say that, if anyone is suggesting that there ought to be restraint in government expenditure, this Government has shown and will continue to show that where this is achievable there will be restraint. It is expected that that restraint will be shared by the States as well as by the Commonwealth Government. That, of course, will be part of the context in which the forthcoming Budget will be framed.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Attorney-General. I remind him of his statement at the Estimates Committee A meeting on 27 April when he said, in relation to the shortfall in legal aid funding of nearly $1m that has emerged in Victoria for this financial year, that he will be monitoring the effect of the various administrative measures instituted to deal with this and that, as the end of the financial year approaches, he will assess 'the magnitude of the problem' and 'see whether the stockpile can be eliminated by the end of the year'. In view of the fact that, as he well knows from the pile of submissions he has received from the Victorian legal aid community-for the first time in living memory there seems to be a unity ticket between the Law Institute of Victoria, the Victorian Bar Council and the community legal centres in this respect-the situation has remained at crisis level now for almost three months and people are being denied legal aid or having legal aid postponed in situations of urgency, will he now reveal the results of that monitoring? Will he further give an undertaking that necessary funds will be made available this financial year so that the stockpile can be dealt with?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Evans mentioned statements that I made at Estimates committees and in answer to questions here that I was keeping the situation regarding legal aid in Victoria and Tasmania under very close review. We are taking measures to see whether we can deal with the situation administratively within the budget that we have for this year. I think it is very important for people in the whole legal aid area-that includes the Law Institute of Victoria, the Victorian Bar Association or legal groups in any other State-to realise that there are very strict budgetary limits and policies by this Government. Everybody must take the utmost steps to live within the budgets that are allocated in these areas.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame MARGARET GUILFOYLE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; I am aware of some Press speculation with regard to the level of foreign aid that will be provided in this Budget. I think that arises from relating last year's level of foreign aid to the percentage of gross domestic product and looking at what would be required at least to maintain that same percentage level of GDP. The Press reports that have been the basis of Senator MacGibbon's question are speculative. When I earlier answered a question on this subject I said that the level of foreign aid in the Budget has not yet been determined and certainly would not be announced before the Budget.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think it would be wrong for anyone to assume any direct relationship between the CHOGM meeting and the level of foreign aid because foreign aid goes to many countries. There is a continuing program of foreign aid and support for projects in many different countries. The determination of the level of foreign aid will be part of the Budget process. I think it is fair to say that Australia has a good reputation in respect of the foreign aid that it gives throughout the world in terms of grants to developing countries which enable many worthwhile projects to be undertaken.</PARA>
<PARA> It is suggested that our cost of administering foreign aid is the highest in the world. I cannot comment on that figure if we are talking about the terms or cost of administration. We are certainly not the highest givers of foreign aid in the world, but we have a very respectable record when compared with Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries. We do fairly well in regard to the level of gross domestic product that is directed to foreign aid. I detect support in many parts of Australia for foreign aid for worthwhile, essential and vital projects in many parts of the world. In the casting of the Budget, we will be seeing what can be provided in foreign aid that will enable us to do the things that we know will be useful in the world context.</PARA>
<PARA> The spending in Australia of funds earmarked for foreign aid is a matter on which I do not need to comment. Our foreign aid program is well known and well respected and will certainly be treated very seriously in the Budget context when we are casting these figures.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier, Senator Archer asked me a question in connection with the National Highway in Tasmania. I have now received a reply in respect of that matter. The Minister has advised that the National Highway in Tasmania is sealed throughout and, with the completion of major projects over recent years, provides a high level of service for motorists in the State. However, there is a need for significant upgrading between Burnie and Penguin, Ulverstone and Devonport and in the vicinity of Launceston. By-passes are also required for the towns along the highway including Bridgewater, Oatlands, Carrick, Deloraine and Burnie. Completion of the National Highway in Tasmania is estimated to cost more than $145m in 1980-81 prices to bring this link up to full national highway standards. The Minister expects that work on all major deficiencies on the National Highway as mentioned will have been completed by 1988, the year of the national bicentenary. However, there will be a continuing need for upgrading on other sections which will carry over into the 1990s.</PARA></TALK.START>

Some of the work that is done under this scheme is associated with homeland communities or outstations. The problem in getting the other detailed information for the honourable senator is that, because of the current Telecom problems, the extra information which would be available from the Northern Territory regional office is locked in there until we can make contact with the office. It is not possible to obtain this information this morning. We will give some follow-up information on that later.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As honourable senators are aware, it will be necessary for a re-arrangement of the Parliament House accommodation under my control to provide proper facilities for the Australian Democrats as a result of their increased representation in the Senate from 1 July 1981. I have been assisted in my deliberations by a very hard working, all party advisory committee of senators and I thank them for their efforts, particularly over the last six weeks. I regret that, in looking at the accommodation options on the Senate side of the building, we were unable, for the moment at least, to benefit from the review by generally providing improved accommodation for senators. However, I feel confident that the work undertaken by my advisory committee will greatly assist my successor in continuing to seek a re-arrangement to achieve this objective.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;After the recent demonstrations in King's Hall, instructions were given by the Presiding Officers to restrict the entry to the building of those involved so as to avoid the possibility of further disruption. These people are, however, able to enter the building if they seek and are granted an interview with a senator or member. I am informed by the Security Co-ordinator, however, that this arrangement was inadvertently extended to include persons from the so-called 'Atom Free Embassy'. As the result of this, an incident followed in which Mr Wright blocked an approach at the lower front entrance. He was removed by the police to outside the entrance. He became engaged in conversation with police, parliamentarians and the Press. As requested by Mr Wright contact was made with Senator Mason's office. When Mr Wright eventually returned to the entrance he was allowed into the building without delay.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am further informed that later that day the Security Co-ordinator had a discussion with Mr Wright and explained to him how the situation occurred. He apologised to Mr Wright for what had happened and for any inconvenience which it may have caused Mr Wright. A female who was present with Mr Wright when he first entered and who was stopped, requested to see a senator. The senator was contacted and she was admitted to the building to see the senator. Apart from the arrangements which I have stated being inadvertently extended to the 'Atom Free Embassy', the attendants did follow the procedure as laid down.</PARA>
<PARA> I must say that, normally, visitors to Parliament House are entitled to enter the public areas of the building without restriction. Should such a visitor wish to see a senator or member, the procedure is for a request to be made at the Senate or House of Representatives inquiry box, as appropriate. The wishes of the senator or member are then ascertained and arrangements made accordingly.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Mr President, in regard to the question of the accommodation I wish to say some of the things that you were too polite to put down in your report. I think the Senate should be aware that for six weeks senators worked hard and constantly to find the fat on this side of the building that could give senators decent accommodation. We recommended to you, Sir, that the Joint House Department should be moved from this building. We did not do that lightly. We considered the matter in great detail. We considered that the work and comfort of members of this place would not be affected in any way if that Department were moved. We were of the opinion that this would enable all members of the House of Representatives to have an individual office instead of sharing, as some of them still do. We were of the opinion that this would enable senators' accommodation to be upgraded to something like a decent standard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I agree utterly with what Senator Lewis said about the sorts of conditions in which people here have to work. Nevertheless, when we came down with this very reasonable report, which did not affect the workings of the Parliament, we got no co-operation from the House of Representatives. In fact, we got every indication that it had not looked at the matter seriously at all. Although the House of Representatives is demanding that more office space be made available, and although 13 members of the House of Representatives are accommodated on this side of the building, there was no evidence that it had looked at the matter seriously. Indeed, our recommendation was brushed aside in a most cavalier fashion. In fact, there were indications that those in authority on that side did not really believe that it was our business to allot space in this building. As I am leaving the Senate I would like honourable senators to be very aware that there is a move to take these sorts of considerations out of their hands and give them to other people in this place. I think that would be a very detrimental step. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I would also like to comment on the other matter you raised this morning, namely, security in this place. I can understand that after the events of the last two weeks in King's Hall certain people would be a little uneasy and a little edgy about what went on. However, in the last two days two lots of women who have come to Canberra as visitors asked to see me. They were not part of any demonstration, they just happened to be women. They were left waiting in the rain outside the downstairs entrance to Parliament House while the security officers decided whether or not they would be allowed into this building. Mr President, I think you should be aware that these sorts of moves are going on. I agree with you utterly that this place belongs to the people of Australia, and they should be allowed into King's Hall. Whether or not they are allowed through the doors into members' offices is another matter, but I believe we are taking a very detrimental step if, outside your authority or our authority, people can be told that they have to wait outside in the rain while some unknown people decide whether or not they are fit and proper people to come into Parliament House. </PARA>

If all the people from the other side of Parliament House had been evicted from this side of the building when the new wing was constructed in the early 1960s-this would have been before you came to this place, Mr President-we would not have had this problem.

<PARA> From my experience of negotiations, some of the Joint House Department people ought to be sent in the recess to either Mount Macedon Administrative Staff College or the Clyde Cameron College for some education. Quite candidly, the arrogance of some of these people had to be seen to be believed. It is regrettable that people in high places believed what they said. Officers of the Joint House Department blandly told me and other honourable senators that there was lots of room in the carpenter's shop, which housed machinery such as circular saws and band saws. All members of this group, including Government senators, were imbued with a sense of industrial safety, and we made it very clear that we were not going to be in that sort of rort. I simply want to say that you, Mr President, were much more temperate in this communique than Senator Chipp, Senator Melzer or I would have been. If we had drafted this statement we probably would have hammered home the shortcomings of the people across the way. We do not want anybody to distort the issue. We back to the hilt the views of every honourable senator about the need to retain the library in a state of maximum efficiency. It is not a question of nibbling at all.

However, as there is not sufficient time to have the report printed before the Senate rises for the winter recess, accordingly it is proposed to release it through the President of the Senate in approximately two weeks' time. It will, of course, be immediately distributed to honourable senators and members. Due to the rather specialised nature of the inquiry the Committee did not advertise in the national Press for submissions. Instead, direct approaches were made to organisations and individuals having a particular interest in, or involvement with, Parliament's appropriations and staffing. </PARA>
<PARA> The importance of the reference, and the interest the inquiry aroused, is underlined by what was the first ever appearance of a Speaker of the House of Representatives before a Senate Committee and the ready co-operation and assistance of acknowledged experts such as Mr Jim Odgers and Professor Gordon Reid, and a number of parliamentary and government departments. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, over many years now honourable senators, and more recently, honourable members on both sides of the chamber have been concerned for Parliament to make such arrangements as are necessary to achieve its proper constitutional relationship with the Executive in practice as well as in theory.

In view of the early start at 9 a.m. it was decided that the Senate should lift. However, that has left us a little behind with the program so extra pressure is on us today. I hope that we will have the co-operation of honourable senators in achieving our program today. I remind honourable senators that 12 of our colleagues are retiring. This will be their last day. Valedictory remarks are scheduled to be made before we rise, so we wish to complete our business so that satisfactory time is available for that purpose. As a result of discussions last evening it has been agreed that, to achieve today's program, we will if necessary continue to sit rather than suspend the sitting for lunch. At this stage I do not propose to move any motion in relation to that. If that does become necessary in order to achieve all our purposes today I signal that I will move a motion to enable the Senate to continue sitting.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before I was interrupted at 1.9 this morning I was refuting some of the assertions of Senator Puplick. In view of the fairly long day we have ahead of us I will simply summarise my points. I should like to illustrate the difference between the views held by Senator Puplick and me. Senator Puplick placed great stress on certain impact statements. He said that all was well. Quite frankly, when the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry second report-the Fox report-was brought down anybody who read page 289 would know that there was a note of warning there that there could not be any long-range prophesies that subsequent mining operations would not seriously impair the fragile environmental composition of the Alligator Rivers region. That is why my colleague, Senator Ryan, argued that if the government of the day allowed mining-the Opposition has well known views about uranium operations-and implemented a mining policy it should give total recognition to the fears of Mr Justice Fox. The implementation of such policies would have to be done in some sort of sequence.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With all due respect, the introduction of this legislation means that this Government is stepping up the demands on the Alligator Rivers system. I want to make this point: I was there recently with the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment. I asked the staff of the supervising scientist whether they were in a position to say that the river system will cope for the duration of the mining operations. They said they could not guarantee that. The operations of one of the existing mines, it is said, will be completed in eight to ten years. At that stage, of course, it will start packing in and covering over the tailings. With seepage and other environmental problems, no one knows whether it will be a success. I accept the fact that the mining companies have said that they are learning all the time, and they are. Do not forget that when the original safeguards were imposed by Mr Justice Fox the mining companies whinged that they were too excessive. Yet, if one looks at the recent report of the supervising scientist, minor breaches occurred. I do not say that these breaches occurred with evil intent, but they did indicate that the margin of safety has to be maximised. </PARA>
<PARA> The idea of a third mining operation will result in overloading the river system at a time when the Government does not know whether the rehabilitation methods to be used by one of the present operators when it closes its mine will be successful. There is no question about it. A monument of past errors was the Finniss River. It is not merely an environmental question. The fact is that the Australian taxpayer has been paying a pretty heavy burden for rehabilitation of that river. The same situation applies nearer home with the rehabilitation of the Molonglo River-the cost of which is being met by the New South Wales Government and the Commonweatlh Government. The cost has not been met by the discredited Lake George Mining Co. </PARA>
<PARA> We talk about emulating the United States in many areas. The United States Government, whether it be Republican or Democrat, is largely dominated by private enterprise concepts. When it came to cutting up Alaska, there were differences between the Republicans and the Democrats on the acreage that was to be forever off-limits to mining operations. They conceded the principle that some areas of Alaska would never be mined. The Secretary of the Interior, Mr Morton, in the Nixon Administration, was a man who had lots of ties no doubt with business interests and with various people who wanted to make a fast buck, but he went on record as saying that some areas in Alaska would never be touched. </PARA>
<PARA> Whatever the differences in relation to uranium mining, market forces and safety issues are, and whether some of the scientific reservations the Opposition has will be overcome, I cannot see why uranium mining cannot be carried out other than in what is a choice, prime environmental area. I cannot stress that point too much. My colleague from New South Wales Senator Mason will be well aware that a similar matter arose in New South Wales when it was said that the industry involved would not survive. We had a classic case in the middle 1960s of the Colong Caves which had limestone deposits. We were told that if we did not agree to the mining of the Colong Caves, New South Wales would lose its cement industry. I spoke to the Australian Workers Union about it. I said that no doubt alternative sites were available. Many of us ran through the streets of Sydney. We were well primed up seven weeks' before to get into condition. We carried banners proposing alternative sites. Alternative sites for limestone mining were found. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply say that this situation leaves me quite cold. What I fear is that over the years various prospecting will go on and a mining company will come in and say that it wants a few hectares. It is not a question of the area involved, it is a question of the principle of the matter. The Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) wants Kakadu National Park and one or two areas listed on the World Heritage List. I wrote to him twice and asked him for a pledge and I asked Senator Carrick at Question Time whether he could assure me that if any more uranium mining took place it would not go into the park area. He declined to give that assurance. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by emphasising that what is said at page 289 of the Ranger report No. 2 epitomises all of our fears and reservations about the need to hasten slowly. Secondly, in regard to the matter of precedent, if it has been good enough for the United States in drawing up its Alaska land policy to put some land permanently off-limits for mining, it can be done here also. That does not throttle activity elsewhere; it merely establishes a principle. I suggest that in three years or less the Government will be coming back with another request for another little nibble. I have coined the phrase that the Government wants to have the Kakadu National Park pockmarked with various mining venture. It is simply not good enough. The chief scientist cannot give an assurance concerning the protection of the environment and, obviously, until one of the first mining operations closes down we will not know what is in store for us. That is the crux of the argument that has been presented by Senator Ryan and by me. I have no doubt that Senator Mason, in his own clear-cut style, will more than strengthen it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats agree with the basic points about tampering with the national parks that Senator Mulvihill has raised. Both he and I have the honour to be members of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment and several times have been to inspect the park. We have been more fortunate than have been many Australians and know, perhaps better than most, what a tremendous asset this country has in the park and what enormous economic value it would have for Australia if indeed it were not pockmarked by mining operations. There is a demand in the world for wilderness areas, one that I believe in the next 20 years or 30 years will be of great economic importance. The Northern Territory and Australia are throwing away their heritage and economic asset, in the form of the Kakadu National Park, or are in grave danger of doing so, as a result of their supine yielding, at a moment's notice, to whatever a foreign-owned multinational uranium company may want. That is exactly what the Government is doing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Beyond that, the Bill represents a blatant act of piracy, in the course of which the Government is tearing up the law designed to protect the public interest in preserving the national parks. That is one of the most important and serious implications of this apparently minor Bill. The law to which I refer is enshrined in the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act 1975, section 7 (9) of which states that removal of land from a park or reserve or within a wilderness zone shall not be made except in accordance with a resolution passed by each House following the giving of at least 15 sitting days notice of such motion. Clauses 11 and 12 of the same section lay down machinery which ensures in the public interest that no proclamation may be made until the Executive Council has received a report from the Director of National Parks and Wildlife. This in turn allows interested organisations 60 days following publication of notice in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette.</PARA>
<PARA> These very proper and reasonable safeguards allow the community to have notice of this kind of tampering with its assets by a government. That is what is happening now. The Government has chickened out. It knows that, if it followed the proper procedures, it would be heavied by the public over this. It has tried to get the measure through by presenting it on the last sitting day of the Parliament. It hopes that it will sneak through the measure in that way. That is a dishonest trick by which the Government is taking away from the Australian people rights enshrined in law to ensure the protection of their most sacred assets, the national parks and wilderness areas of this country. The Australian Democrats condemn the Government unequivocally for that action. The Act has been blatantly and arrogantly disregarded. A most dangerous precedent has been set on behalf of a totally foreign mining interest, Dension Mines of Canada, which owns the Koongarra lease. I would like the Government to tell me what persuasions have been brought to bear on it by that foreign multinational in order to commit this blatant trick against the Australian people. </PARA>

<PARA> What will we lose if mining is permitted in this area? We are destroying, or at least marring, an area of unique scenic and ecological importance. There is not time today to stress sufficiently to Australians, who may be listening, what an enormous asset in world terms we have in Kakadu National Park and the degree to which it is being messed about already. In flying over the park now one can see pockmarks from old uranium mines all over it. We are destroying some of the most valuable historical Aboriginal sites in Australia-the actual land bridges which over the millenia Aboriginals have used to enter this country. We are destroying one of the few places where we can still go to see Australia as it was before European settlement. Of course, that is what we hope the Kakadu National Park will remain. </PARA>
<PARA> The Fox report states that the Koongarra deposit at the Nourlangie Creek catchment is upstream from the extremely valuable Woolwonga Wildlife Sanctuary-an area so valuable ecologically that the report opposed in principle any mining development upstream of it. Indeed, if we were to proceed with such mining we would be going against the Convention on Wetlands of International Importance and Australia's agreement with Japan for the Protection of Migratory Birds in Danger of Extinction. </PARA>
<PARA> Yesterday I received representations by telegram from the Gagudju Association, the traditional owners of Kakadu National Park protesting strongly about these changes to the boundaries of the Kakadu National Park. One of the main points the Association made to me was that it had only just received notice from the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) about this Bill being put through Parliament. The Minister may perhaps deal with that. I am not making any claims on that; that is what the Association said to me. The Association also said that one of the major features of the Kakadu National Park, the Nourlangi Rock area, will be affected by the mining operation if the park boundaries are altered. The Gagudju Association notes that the proposed mining area is upstream of one of the most important and best water-bird areas in Australia and no one can guarantee that this area will not be polluted or silted up if mining goes ahead. The Association also said that this mining would produce noise, very heavy traffic and a large population in the area. </PARA>
<PARA> It is interesting of course that the Gagudju Association feels that way because it is in a position to benefit financially from uranium mining. It is aware of this. I have had discussions with the Association. At the same time I think it is fair to say that these people are deeply concerned about the land. I do not believe that Australians generally understand the real feelings of Aboriginal people towards their land. I think that I have come to some understanding of that simply through listening to them for long enough speaking on that subject. These people obviously feel they will be forced to agree to the making of a grant of a mining interest with respect to this land. The telegram states:</PARA>
<PARA> It is all very well to say that the boundary will not be changed until or unless we reach agreement with Denison Mines. That is still holding the gun at our heads. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the view of the traditional owners of the land. The point which comes through most strongly in this representation from the Gagudju Association is that these people feel they need time to study the proposal and consider it fully before coming to a decision. They stated in the telegram:</PARA>
<PARA> This is our land and our father's land and the Federal Government agreed with this. We have lent our land freely to the people of Australia to make a great national park for the use of all people. To protect that land we therefore ask all Senators to defer this Bill until we have had a chance for discussions amongst ourselves. </PARA>
<PARA> So in all sincerity I convey that message to the Senate. It is of course the sort of thing that the original legislation that the Government is pirating had in mind-the opportunity for people to put forward their point of view. The Government, in forcing this Bill through today by using its numbers immorally again-as I said last night it is doing this immorally-is, of course, breaching that trust which I think it had made with the Gagudju people when it made the land available to the people of Australia for a national Park. </PARA>

That is too bad. I think it is totally wrong for the Minister to take a point of order on a senator who is speaking when the Minister has the right of reply in this place. It is true that senators may be tired, but on all the empirical evidence that is available to us, we regard this as a negation of the Government's responsibility. If honourable senators on the Government side want to interject they have to be prepared to get a rejoinder which they may not like. There is obviously a difference of opinion.

As I have said, it distresses me greatly to find that honourable senators apparently have not listened to that message which I attempted to convey from the Gagudja people about their feelings for the national park. They feel that they have given the Australian people this great park and that now the undertakings they have been given are not being properly carried out. I again turn to environmental aspects. I have had information -I think this is a point Senator Mulvihill raised earlier-that the pollution problems connected with sulphides of heavy metals evident at Rum Jungle and Finniss River are a very likely possibility at the Koongarra site. That is another reason for the concern of the traditional owners and, indeed, for all of us in this country who see a duty to the future to retain this great national park for the Australian people in an uncontaminated form.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In totally economic terms, opening this area to the mining of uranium is a completely bad proposition. We know now that all over the world nuclear power is becoming increasingly discredited. We had the dangerous situation earlier this week where a nuclear reactor became a target for a military attack. It has set a precedent which could lead to great harm to the world and to us, as a species, in the future. A nuclear reactor, wherever it is put, and for whatever purpose, will be regarded as a military target. That enforces the Australian Democrats' view that the Government is among the lemmings of this world who are helping us towards a mutually assured destruction because of their support of this dangerous, uneconomic and contaminative industry. I suggest that events near Baghdad earlier this week ought at least to have driven that lesson a little further home to anyone who has any spark of intelligence and imagination whatsoever. Beyond that, demand for uranium has dropped dramatically in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Financial Review recently reported that oversupply is so great that yellowcake is heavily stockpiled in the United States of America and the price has dropped from $US43 a pound in 1978 to $US25 a pound in 1981. It is not only stupid of us to go ahead with the Koongarra mine but also it is completely unjustified on any economic terms for this country. Any uranium mine there can create only a bad oversupply situation. In fact, such a mine would be against the interests of Australia's existing mines, such as Ranger. There is some sympathy for that view even amongst our present uranium miners. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats-I make this point quite plain-are utterly opposed to the mining of uranium anywhere in this country. I concede freely that our attitude in this debate is coloured and affected by that view, which we feel is thoroughly justified. We are extremely concerned at the massive problems of waste disposal, for which there is no sign of solution. We are worried about the security of plutonium, which is becoming worse as time goes on. We are concerned with the costing of such processes as long term waste disposal and the demolition of nuclear reactors. This has been instanced by the enormous costs, running to billions of dollars, and the length of time being required to clean up the Three Mile Island reactor. The world might have taken a warning from that incident. Luckily, we did not lose a lot of people as well. I take it some honourable senators would rather see us proceed with the industry to a stage where it killed thousands of people and contamined huge areas of civilised countryside. If that is what they want, so be it. The Australian Democrats will do their best to stop them. </PARA>
<PARA> If we dare to look at the mining of uranium without considering those factors, surely the uniqueness of the Kakadu National Park, the fact that this legislation would break faith with so many people both inside and outside Australia and the Government's blatant disregard for its own laws which are still on the statute book will convince honourable senators to vote against this legislation as I certainly shall be doing. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Koongarra Project Area Bill 1981, which is designed to alter an excision area within the Kakadu National Park.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps I have misquoted the honourable senator; it was at least partly based on his opposition to uranium mining. I am most disappointed in the fact that he failed to refer to some of the provisions in the Bill, or to some of the facts which should be well known to everyone in relation to the excision and to the truth of the situation. I remind the Senate once again of what Senator Chipp said to the Senate the other day when he read us a little morality lesson, a little homily about how the Australian Democrats went to the people with the slogan 'Keep the bastards honest'. With a slogan like that, when he is talking about a matter, it is necessary that he tells not only the truth but also the whole truth. On this occasion facts have been omitted from the honourable senator's speech which I think does no credit to the Australian Democrats or the case they are putting up. Last night we heard an excellent speech from Senator Puplick in which he did something that others have not done. He brought the environmental impact statement into the chamber and quoted directly from it. He set out the facts and reasons why this Bill is appropriate and sound in an envionmental context. Why was it not mentioned this morning that there has been an environmental impact statement and that the problems raised have been appropriately answered? Last night Senator Puplick made it clear--</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think Senator Mason was here for the speech last night. The environmental impact statement answers most of the questions which have been raised. Senator Puplick made one other point which Senator Mason has failed to comprehend. There is no more open way of proceeding. There is no better way to put matters into the public place for public scrutiny than to proceed by legislation. To proceed by bringing in a piece of legislation which is open to scrutiny and for debate in the Parliament is an appropriate way to move. For anyone to suggest that to proceed to achieve a legislative end by introducing a Bill, by coming into the Parliament and seeking legislation, is in some way sneaky, he must have the most topsy-turvy view of what the legislative process is all about. I think it illustrates that there are none so obtuse as those who do not want to understand. The procedural argument has absolutely no legs to run on. We are proceeding by legislation. We are doing it so that there can be open debate and of course that is obvious to anyone.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is one other matter which I would have thought that a man who wanted to preach honesty to the Senate, and a party that wanted to preach honesty as the Australian Democrats did, might have thought to mention. They might have thought to mention that there is an excision in the park now. They might have thought to mention that this Bill is not setting out to create an excision--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Kilgariff" NAMEID="8H7">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8H7">Senator Kilgariff</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because they don't know.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps they do not know. Another feature of the Australian Democrats is that their degree of knowledge leaves something to be desired. This Bill does not establish an excision where previously there was no excision. Yet to listen to those who wish to give us these moral homilies, one might have thought that that was the case. An excision has been there for some time. It has been there since 1979, I believe. Why was that not adverted to in the speech by the honourable senator? What is proposed is not to create an excision from the park. It is in fact to alter the shape of the excision and to reduce it in size, to let us end up with a larger Kakadu National Park than we have now. Why was that not mentioned by someone who says he wants to 'keep the bastards honest'? It was not mentioned because it is more convenient for the honourable senator in putting his case to be selective in his presentation to the Australian people and to leave out those facts which he might find inconvenient or which might weaken his case. There is an excision now and all that is being proposed is that we alter the boundaries of the excised area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It makes me sick to hear some of the arguments that have been put to us today. The new excision area is an improved excision area. It is environmentally more sound for the project, if the project goes ahead. I will refer to that in a moment. It takes the excision area which exists now away from some environmentally important and sensitive areas.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, on the point of order, I was here during Senator Puplick's speech and I did not notice the honourable senator. Of course I accept his assurance if he says he was here. I ask honourable senators: What will be the effect of failing to pass this Bill? An excision area will remain. Environmentally it will be a less satisfactory excision area. It will be an excision area that takes in more sensitive territory and will be an excision area that could allow for greater destruction of the park. Failure to pass this Bill would be foolish and would, in fact, fail to achieve the very ends which the honourable senator says he espouses and which other honourable senators say they espouse. Of course, one must come back to their total opposition to uranium mining and their desire to oppose any- thing to do with uranium mining to understand why they are taking the view that they are taking.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Someone says that we are behaving immorally. Someone says that he will come in here to keep us honest. This Bill has three clauses. The honourable senator failed to speak to one of them, the critical clause 2 of the Bill. Honourable senators would have thought that if he were going to tell us the whole truth that he might have adverted to clause 2 of the Bill. Clause 2 puts total control of this excision into the hands of the people of the Alligator Rivers region. We are of the view that this excision can take effect only if the Aboriginal people in the area give their consent. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Mason" NAMEID="YJ7">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YJ7">Senator Mason</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I quoted that.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. The honourable senator quoted from a Gagudju Association telex but totally failed, in his address, to acknowledge or pay attention to this clause. What does the clause provide? This clause is an earnest of this Government's good intentions and bona fides. We are not just making an assertion that we will go to the Aboriginal people; we are not just making a promise, by ministerial statement or Press release, that we will look to the provisional owners to give their permission; we are writing into the legislation the particular ways in which we shall require permission and approval from the traditional owners in the park. That gives to the traditional owners a power of veto over this whole excision and we are putting it into legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Has there ever been a more honourable, honest, proper and decent way to proceed on an excision? I will read part of clause 2 for honourable senators because those who spoke in opposition conveniently failed to address themselves to it. Clause 2 states:</PARA>
<PARA> Section 3 that is the excision-shall come into operation on a date to be fixed by Proclamation--</PARA>
<PARA>Not the date of royal assent but the date to be fixed by proclamation-</PARA>
<PARA>being a date not earlier than the date on which the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and the relevant Land Council have consented, in writing, for the purposes of sub-section 40 (1) of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976, to the making of a grant of a mining interest in respect of the relevant land . . . </PARA>
<PARA>So it goes on. The point is that it is within the control of the people of the region. If they consent in their good time, following the processes laid down in the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act, to the Koongarra project going ahead and if they advise me in writing and if I am satisfied, as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, in terms of that land rights Act and if I then consent in writing then, and only then, can the excision come into operation. It is a perfectly clear, perfectly straightforward proposition. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition expresses grave misgivings, as it did in the debate on the Koongarra Project Area Bill, about the support for the Lands Acquisition (Northern Territory Pastoral Leases) Bill perhaps on somewhat similar grounds because we believe that the Kakadu National Park ought to be inviolate and ought not to be changed in any way to suit the whims of those who wish to exploit the rich resources that exist. Whilst in some respects this legislation has a purpose which we regard as superficial-that of validating the Government's position in respect of the acquisition of these properties in the Northern Territory-it nevertheless shows that in due course the strategy of this Government will be to make them available for the purposes of uranium mining.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition doubts absolutely the integrity of this Government in respect of uranium mining and the rights of Aborigines in this region. We do not trust the Government. We have no faith in the Government's views and integrity, and the Aborigines have a similar view. In fact I believe the Australian people have a similar view. The fact is that the Government is totally immoral in seeking to force these Bills through the Senate in the dying hours of the session when it knows that the electors of this country have taken the very important step of changing the composition of the Senate. Because of some quirk those persons do not take their seats until 1 July. In fact, if the people who were elected in September last year as a direct result of the decisions of the electors had been able to vote the Government would not be able to ram through these pieces of legislation as though it has the moral right so to do. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the Democrats were correct when during the election of 1979 they used the phrase: 'Keep the bastards honest'. The fact that they were able to increase drastically their representation in this place, as indeed my party was able to increase its representation here, is an indication that the Australian people want the Senate to act as a brake upon the way in which this Government is operating, particularly in such sensitive areas as pastoral leases and other matters associated with Aboriginal land rights and Aboriginal rights, and the obvious conflict that exists in respect of mining companies which want to rip the guts out of our country without giving a continental about the basic views of the Australian people and the rights of the Aboriginals. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is taking extraordinary steps. Not within living memory has the Senate sat day after day, night after night, into the early hours of the morning in order to rush legislation through the Senate before the electors' views can be properly expressed in this place. We regard all of this as a sneaky process by the Fraser Government. We would not have been put in this position if the Government had any decency or integrity at all. Therefore let me throw back into the face of any Minister or any Government member the suggestion that it is the Opposition, the Labor Party, the Independent and the Democrats who are acting improperly. It is the Government-from the top to the bottom-which is responsible for the sort of situation in which the Senate is now placed. The Senate has lost temporarily its position as a House of review. It is a rubber stamp for the Fraser Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst it is true that we do not have any basic disagreement with some of the aspects of this legislation, because in essence it seeks to validate the compulsory acquisition made in June 1978 by the Commonwealth of the Mudginberri and Munmarlary pastoral leases in the Northern Territory, ostensibly to include them in stage 2 of the Kakadu National Park, the fact is that this Government has in the back of its mind, and is not saying so in this debate, to allow the Jabiluka uranium mining project ultimately to proceed. So, we test and challenge the sincerity of this Government. We say that the Government is not properly putting its basic position before the Parliament. As the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) has pointed out under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act the two areas are subject to a current Aboriginal land rights claim which is now being considered by Mr Justice Toohey. Of course, it is pretty clear that that issue before Mr Justice Toohey will take a considerable time to resolve. We have no compunction, no testing of our security or our conscience in this matter, in proposing this motion:</PARA>
<PARA> Leave out all words after 'that', insert:</PARA>
<PARA> 'the Bill be withdrawn and re-drafted to provide for the Munmarlary and Mudginberri Pastoral Leases to be included in their entirety in Stage II of Kakadu National Park without the excision of any portion of the leases for the purposes of uranium mining'. </PARA>
<PARA>The mining companies are fighting this Government every inch of the way. This Government, which claims to stand for small government, finds it necessary to introduce legislation in this place to establish public interest as far as these pastoral leases are concerned. This shows, of course, that we cannot operate on a principle of small government; government intervention is essential to protect the public interest. We are up against the powerful corporations which have influence with this Government and which use every opportunity to rip out and exploit the resources of this country. Even this Government, as much as it is a part of that process, is forced to act and to try at least to put up some semblance of protection of the public interest. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not opposed to the validation of Federal resumption of Mudginberri and Munmarlary leases to allow a successful conclusion to the land rights case and then for their inclusion in Kakadu National Park. But-this very important qualification was dealt with very adequately by the speakers on this side of the chamber in a previous debate-we are totally opposed to the mining of uranium ore from these or any other areas, and the Opposition therefore takes advantage of moving the amendment that it has. </PARA>
<PARA> The area in question includes Mudginberri and Munmarlary pastoral leases and vacant Crown land to the west of South Alligator Creek and almost to the East Alligator or the edge of Arnhem Land. Despite what Government spokesmen say, it is an area of environmentally sensitive wetlands which clearly must go into the Kakadu National Park forthwith without any recourse, without any pressure and without any suggestion that there should be uranium mining in the particular area. The pastoral leases, the subject of this Bill, are Munmarlary, held by the 2nd Pastoral Co. and Mudginberri, held by Mudginberri Station Pty Ltd. Both of these companies, as honourable senators ought to know, belong to the Northern Pastoral Services which in turn is a subsidiary of Pioneer Concrete owned by CSR. So we see the connection, the web, the network, which operates in these matters. It is clear that many of these companies are supporters of this Government. But in order to establish some defence of the principles involved in land rights, this Government is forced to bring down this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth and the companies concerned could not agree on compensation to be paid to the companies, so the properties were compulsorily acquired in June 1978. The properties were valued at $1.4m. The Commonwealth was prepared to offer $3m in compensation to these companies. We find that these companies, which are part of the big corporate sector which exercises too much economic and political power in this country, were not prepared to accept the Government's propositions and had the audacity, the temerity, the gall, to suggest that a sum of $10.5m ought to be the terms of settlement in respect to these areas. These companies which make gigantic profits at the expense of the Australian people and which will use every endeavour to take advantage of the natural resources which belong to the Australian people, seek a payment in excess of seven times the actual value of the land concerned. They have lodged challenges to the acquisition of the properties in the Northern Territory Supreme Court as late as seven or eight months ago. I think they were lodged in November 1980. Those challenges will take months or even years to determine. They have the effect, as a result of the greed and avarice of the companies concerned, of holding up the settlement of the Aboriginal land claims to the land in question. The companies are obviously more interested in collecting dollars and cents-as much money as possible-from the Commonwealth rather than retaining their leases. It is an indictment of the companies that they should take this shortsighted position. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is clearly worried that if these court challenges take too long, Jabiluka, the big uranium mining proposition requiring Aboriginal approval, will not proceed before Australia is shut out of the world uranium market. I give credit to the Government speakers who spoke during the previous debate on this legislation and who set out to say what was part of the overall strategy of the Fraser Government in these matters. I understand that these areas will not be included in the stage two development of the Kakadu National Park until the Aboriginal claims are settled. I suppose to that extent the Opposition will be grateful for the time that it will take to resolve these matters because we will have a much better Senate at that time. We will be able to exercise our powers of review. We will be able to listen to the views of the Aboriginal people. We will be able to protect the public interest in these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> We can assume that when the land is duly held in trust for the traditional land owners of the Kakadu Aboriginal Land Trust under the legislative arrangements contained in the National Park and Wildlife Conservation Act and the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act the area will be leased to the Director of the Australian Parks and Wildlife Service. Then we can expect the Jabiluka area with its 206,000 tonnes of yellowcake to be excluded from the park when the Governor-General proclaims stage two. The danger area, of course, will be excluded, that exclusion having occurred under stage one. No doubt the Government will ensure that, unlike Koongarra, the boundaries of the area set aside for uranium mining are those designated by Pancontinental Mining Ltd. No doubt the mistakes which led to the shameful retrospective alterations to the Koongarra boundaries will not be repeated this time because we will have a much more watchful and a stronger view being expressed in this chamber. The end result will be that Jabiluka will become, like Koongarra, a uranium mining enclave within the famous Kakadu National Park. </PARA>
<PARA> Nobody has done more in this area than the Opposition to establish those important principles in respect of one of the most wonderful areas not only in Australia but also in the world. Koongarra itself is a valley on the edge of the Arnhem Land plateau. Ranger is in the lowlands below the escarpment. Jabiluka is on the very edge of the flood plains of the Alligator Rivers region. All these areas are situated on the edge of the proposed boundaries of stages one and two of Kakadu National Park. All three should be part of the park. We make no apologies for stressing that, for defending it and for attacking the Government on any suggestion that there should be changes in this area. What nation, what government except the Fraser Government, would nominate an area for World Heritage listing and then proceed to allow uranium mining-the most environmentally devastating form of mining-to proceed in that park's most beautiful and sensitive area. </PARA>
<PARA> If Government senators were really interested in the issue they would be listening to the views that have been expressed by that section of the Australian population which does accept its responsibilities in respect of environmental matters and which has conducted a public campaign on this matter. I am talking of the Total Environment Centre and other groups in Australia that keep informing the Senate and the people of Australia of what is happening in these sensitive areas. I applaud their attempts, as well as deplore the failure of the Government to listen to these very important watchdogs. Citizens groups have set themselves up to act in defence of basic rights and preservation of not only the Aboriginal people but also the important environmental areas. The Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony), the Northern Territory Minister, Mr Tuxworth, and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Mr Everingham, are always interested only in the exploitation of mineral resources in the area. While they may not say so publicly, they have basically rejected the way in which the operations of the developers take place. Nevertheless, they are seen to be opposed to this area of the Kakadu National Park being part of the World Heritage listing. </PARA>

They are unable to comprehend national responsibility and are unable to understand what we are talking about. Even this Government from time to time is forced to take a position well to the left of the position taken by such people as the Premier of Queensland, the Premier of Western Australia and the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory. They are at least 50 years behind in their basic understanding of what the world in the latter part of the twentieth century is about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Again I want to make it clear to the Aborigines, as we have consistently in this place, that after winning this claim to the Mudginberri and Munmarlary pastoral leases under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act they will have a veto over uranium mining on any section of their land excised from the park for that purpose. They will have the buffer of the Senate from 1 July to assist them in that process. We will be doing everything we can to influence decisions in that area. When I say that, I do not disagree that there are Government members who have adopted a position of honesty with respect to protection of Aboriginal land rights. Some former Ministers-none of them in this place-have used their position to confuse Aboriginal land owners in various land councils in Australia. If my memory serves me right, a case arose in, I think, Oenpelli when the Minister took extraordinary steps to create a state of confusion about what was happening in respect of that claim.</PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the Opposition accepts that some of the subsequent Ministers displayed a certain amount of integrity the fact is, of course, that they are subject to the majority view, the overall philosophical view and to the ideological position of the conservatives in this Government who really make the decisions-the Minister does not really make the decisions-in respect of all these matters. In the long term the Minister is forced to accept the decisions that are made by the Frasers, the Anthonys and those way-out type State leaders who have no concepts about the rights of the original people in our country. They certainly have a very bad negative attitude about the whole environmental movement in our country. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 40 of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act gives such a veto except over the Ranger uranium area on Groote Eylandt and areas where petroleum leases were issued prior to the land becoming Aboriginal land. It is true that Jabiluka is not in these categories, so the Aborigines will have the right of veto. They will be able to stop mining at Jabiluka-the largest, most unacceptable and most environmentally damaging mine. Of course, the largest deposit of uranium in Australia and perhaps in the world is at Jabiluka. Of course, that area is owned 65 per cent by Pancontinental Mining Ltd and 35 per cent by Getty Oil Development Co. Ltd. They are two of the great transnational companies whose power and influence extend much further, in many cases, than even those of governments and parliaments. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst the Opposition concedes that there is some validity in the Government's intention, approach and legislation in these matters the Opposition wants to place on public record that it believes underneath the Government's intentions lies the very grave challenge to uranium mining and to all that that means in respect of the development of these areas so far as land rights, environment for Aborigines and maintenance of our basic environmental responsibilities in this area are concerned. Of course, the Opposition is concerned that an environmental statement has suggested that above-the-land development of this region would be detrimental. It has suggested, therefore, that we might have other options available to us and that we might be able to have underground mining in this region. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, the razor gang's proposition that these matters be handed back to the States ought to be referred to in this debate. God forbid if the Government hands back to those three States that I mentioned any responsibility in this particular matter. We should not abdicate our responsibility as a national parliament which accepts national responsibilities for the protection of the environment, land rights and for an even greater involvement in the whole uranium industry. </PARA>
<PARA> I could go on to confirm what honourable senators have said in the debate on the Koongarra Project Area Bill but I shall not labour the point. I merely re-emphasise the question: To whom are we to sell our uranium? Although that is part of the total strategy of this Government, the answer to that question is not clear. What happened in the Middle East this week has shown us how fragile is the whole uranium industry. I refer both to its decline and to the use of uranium in an increasingly unstable environment. Such are the conditions that exist, for example, in the Middle East, that apparently one country can bomb out of existence a nuclear plant in another. These problems confirm that it is important for the Opposition, as the protector of the national interests, to say: 'If we take steps which will facilitate the development of the uranium mining industry in Australia, how can we at the same time place any faith in this Government, which has an open-ended position in regard to uranium mining? To whom is it to allow the companies concerned to sell the product? Which countries are to be allowed to buy the uranium that in due course will be produced in these areas? What guarantees have we that those countries will adopt a responsible attitude in the use of the uranium, as indeed certain major powers have done?</PARA>
<PARA> We must be concerned about events in the Middle East, about the conflict between Pakistan and India, and about the unstable regimes in Latin American countries, some of which aspire to become nuclear powers. Surely, in such an international climate, such considerations ought to be the principal motivation for the actions of any government which claims to speak on behalf of the Australian people. That is why the Opposition believes that an amendment should be agreed to which will place on the public record the fact that we cannot give our approval to any proposal that may, in view of the Government's strategy, allow in this area uranium mining which can prove so disastrous, firstly, to world peace, secondly, to the environment and, thirdly, to land rights, the protection of which, thank God, as from 1 July the Senate will accord a higher place on its agenda. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Gietzelt for his speech. There is a genuine philosophical difference between the Government and the Opposition on the question of uranium mining and the honourable senator set out the case of his party with, I believe, care and moderation. The honourable senator knows that on this side the view is held that uranium mining, properly controlled, has caused no harm in the Northern Territory and will cause none. I wish to address my remarks on the Lands Acquisition (Northern Territory Pastoral Leases) Bill to the Aboriginal lands rights aspects. As Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, I have a particular interest in that aspect of the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remind honourable senators that we are awaiting a report following a hearing on the Alligator Rivers land claim. That claim, which is important to the Aboriginal people, was mentioned by Senator Gietzelt in his remarks. It is important to the local traditional owners and to those who wish to see the Kakadu National Park properly established. It is also of great importance to the communities which have been waiting for this land claim to be resolved. The Land Commissioner, Mr Justice Toohey, will report within the next month or six weeks-certainly fairly imminently. His report can be acted on only if the land concerning which he reports is available for claim. If not, no grant of land can be made. Under the Aboriginal Land Rights Act I am required, once the Land Commissioner has reported-and I note in the chamber a former Minister for Aboriginal Affairs-to certify certain things. I am required to make a decision and to recommend that the grant of land be made to an appropriate trust. I cannot make that grant of land if it is not properly available for claim. </PARA>
<PARA> Some doubt has been thrown upon the capacity of the Aboriginal Land Commissioner to make his report. In fact, recently there was an action in the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory which sought to enjoin me and other people from proceeding to act upon the recommendations of the Aboriginal Land Commissioner on the basis that the case was not determined. It has been held over. It was withdrawn but the action will be started again. It was done on the basis that the acquisition in June 1978 by the Commonwealth of the two pastoral leases, Mudgenberri and Munmalary, may have been improperly made. We believe that we would win an action in court. There is no action at the moment but there could well be an action by the Northern Pastoral Services company if the Land Commissioner reported and if we proceeded to try to do something about giving the land to Aboriginal people. If the report were favourable and if it seemed appropriate there could be some action to frustrate that intention. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill will put beyond doubt the capacity of the Land Commissioner to hear the claim and to make a report and the capacity of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to make an appropriate response in the light of that report. It will do that without removing from Northern Pastoral Services its rights as to compensation should in fact it take legal action and should it suggest that the June 1978 acquisition had not been properly made. The company's rights to proper compensation are not affected by this Bill. If the Bill were withdrawn and redrafted, as was suggested in the amendment, there is a real doubt as to the capacity of the Commissioner to do the things he needs to do or of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to respond as he might wish. The people who would be disadvantaged in that event are the traditional owners within the region who are waiting on the completion of this claim. When I was in the region they emphasised to me how serious and important this claim is to them. For those reasons I think it is inappropriate that we agree to the amendment because it would, in fact, impair or imperil the capacity of the Land Commissioner to do his job and of the people in the region to get the land which they wish to have. </PARA>
<PARA> I indicate to the Senate that I have had communications from Mr Eric Pratt, Q.C., counsel for the Northern Land Council, indicating that he believes that this Bill, as it has been drafted and amended, is appropriate to achieve the ends and he urges its early passage through the Parliament. I have also had a telex from Mr Eric Pratt, Q.C. which bears up, on the other matters raised by Senator Gietzelt. I will read from the telex because it will complete my argument and because I think it is important that it be in the record. The telex states:</PARA>
<PARA> Have seen Press statement issued today by Stuart West. </PARA>
<PARA>I take it he means the honourable member for Cunningham. The telex continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Statement contains major technical errors. </PARA>
<PARA> 1. The mining is justified environmentally and economically and will result in substantial economic benefits to Aboriginals. Environmental requirements have been established and agreed to by Government, the supervising authorities and the Northern Land Council, so as to ensure protection of the environment. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. Only one mine is proposed at Jabiluka-namely an underground mine to recover ore body No. 2. Our consultants agree with government and Pancontinental Consultants. Pancontinental Mining Ltd consultants that expected never to be exceeded maximum flood level is--</PARA>
<PARA>Here he uses a surveying term-</PARA>
<PARA>RL 10 metres. Mine portal will be at RL 26 metres and conveyor portal at RL 13 metres. There is no basis for the statement that due to water levels during the wet season that there is any threat of radioactivity leakage into the proposed park area. </PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate here that of course the traditional owners are concerned and of course the Northern Land Council is concerned that there should be an environmentally appropriate proposition before them. The telex goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Jabiluka proposal is designed on a no water release system with superior technology considered and approved by Northern Land Council's consultant engineers. After receipt of all reports from the Northern Land Council's three consultant engineers and its consultant environmental geologist, the Northern Land Council on . . . June 8, 1981, delivered the following letter to Pancontinental:</PARA>
<PARA>Within the telex he quotes the letter. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> 'The Northern Land Council has completed its technical examination of the Jabiluka project as generally described in the final environmental impact statement dated July 1979 and in documents made available to the Northern Land Council and consultants engaged on behalf of the Council, which documents are listed in the attachments to this letter . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The Northern Land Council has no objections to the technical aspects of the Jabiluka project as therein generally described.'</PARA>
<PARA>We have from the Northern Land Council, representing the traditional owners, its authority to say that the environmental impact statement is environmentally sound and that the project need not be held up on that basis. The final line in the telex reads:</PARA>
<PARA> This information is supplied to you for use in Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>I believe it is necessary for the successful and early conclusion of the land claim that this Bill be passed quickly. That is the reason it is before us now and not at some later time. It is before us now so that the Land Commissioner can report and we can act on his report. As I have indicated, we are not able to agree to the amendment moved by the Opposition. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This Bill is a clarification of legislation which was imposed upon the Australian National University in accordance with Government policy last year and which has caused some problem in its interpretation. As a result of the problems, both the Council of the Australian National University and the Australian National University Students Association obtained legal opinions. Those legal opinions differed as to the proper interpretation of the legislation. The question of how what was passed last year was to be implemented became a matter of some concern. The net result has been that the Government has decided to put beyond doubt-presumably it hopes that that will be the result-the way in which it expects the legislation which it passed last year in relation to the compulsory nature or otherwise of student fees will be applied. That should be clarified beyond doubt and this Bill does no more than that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not propose to participate in a division on this matter, should a division result, because as a Senate representative on the University Council, I would prefer to leave my position as one of interpretation. So far as is possible, I believe I should dissociate myself from the determination of the Parliament's will and, as a member of the Council, endeavour to interpret that once it has been clarified by legislation. I take the opportunity to say that it has been suggested sometimes that the University Council and the Students Association have acted other than with the best of good will and propriety--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make a few remarks at the Committee stage of the Bill. I endorse the remarks made by Senator Rae concerning the propriety of the behaviour of the Council of the Australian National University and the Australian National University Students Association. The reason that we have this Bill before us today is that the Government was unable to achieve, at its last legislative attempt, its true objective. Of course that objective has been to destroy the ANU Students Association. In 1979 the amendment was to ensure that membership of the Association be voluntary and, most importantly from the Government's point of view, that funds collected by the compulsory services and amenities fee would not be used for political activities and would not be expended on affiliation with the Australian National University. As Senator Rae has just suggested, the legislation was quite complicated. I believe the Council of the Australian National University tried in a most sincere fashion to understand how the legislation could be implemented.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GD5">Senator RYAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take note of Senator Rae's interjection that it spent an inordinate amount of time trying to do that. I understand that and the frustrations of the University Council when it had to spend weeks of its time on what is essentially a very trivial and rather petty piece of legislation. The Council of the Australian National University ought to have better things to do with its time than to have to waste enormous amounts of energy on what is really an ideological attack on student unionism by the Fraser Government, delivered in a form which is truly a sledgehammer set to crack a nut. Unfortunately from the Government's point of view, its 1979 legislation did not have the desired effect. The ANU Students Association had other sources of revenue which the Council, following legal advice, decided were not subject to the constraints imposed by the 1979 amendment. Following the May 1981 meeting of the University Council, the ANU Students Association transmitted its affiliation fee to AUS from funds it had derived from sources other than the compulsory fee. That was an entirely legitimate and proper decision for it to make. So the piece of legislation before the Committee today is an attempt to succeed where the 1979 legislation failed. It makes income in any way derived from compulsory student fees subject to the same restrictions as student fees, that is, it may be only for the provision of amenities and services and not to support socio-political activities. Honourable senators can see that we are dealing with an extremely petty piece of legislation in which a government, which professes to oppose excessive regulation, imposes a particularly detailed and cumbersome set of restrictions on a student organisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The political aim of the Bill is clear. It attempts to prevent students at ANU from engaging in any organised socio-political activity through their Student's Association and it attempts to prevent the ANU Students Association from affiliating with the Australian Union of Students. Of course it is not difficult to see why the Government wants to pursue this course of action at this time. The Fraser Government is committed to dismantling the education system established by the Labor Government which was based on access to education as a right of all Australians. The Fraser Government wishes to replace this system with an education system based on privilege. In doing this the Government does not want a strong united national student union which will fight tooth and nail erosion of the Labor education system. The role of the AUS, I remind honourable senators, is like that of other unions. It looks after the interests of its members. This is why the Government would like to ensure that the AUS-as indeed it would like to ensure with all other unions in Australia-is weak and ineffective. The students of the Australian National University made a democratic decision that their student association should affiliate with the AUS. The Government attempts to overturn that democratic decision through this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe the legislation represents an improper use of parliamentary power to interfere with the internal affairs of the Australian National University. It attempts to remove from the democratic processes of the Students Association, decisions as to how its income will be spent. The ANU Council has endorsed the view that student organisations should be free to make their own decisions and manage their own affairs. In the light of that endorsement the Government's action is an insult to the University Council whose advice will now be ignored and experience disregarded. Just before the May ANU Council meeting, the Minister for Education, Mr Fife, wrote to the Council advising it to disallow transmission of student association fees to the AUS. He threatened that if the Council decided otherwise legislation would follow. This legislation is the result of that piece of Government blackmail against the Council of the Australian National University. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GD5">Senator RYAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;By way of interjection Senator Rae suggests that something is not so. I repeat that Mr Fife wrote to the Council advising it that if fees were not disallowed then legislation would follow. If Senator Rae wishes to correct that, he will have the opportunity to do so. My advice is that there was a clear threat that the Council had to fulfil the Government's objectives regardless of the Council's interpretation of the legislation otherwise further legislation would be introduced to force the Council to carry out the objectives of the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Labor Party's objection to this is quite obvious. We are perfectly confident in the ability of the Council to manage the affairs of the Australian National University. We are absolutely committed to the concept of democratic decision making by student organisations. We do not accept that this legislation or the legislation which preceded it is an appropriate use of parliamentary power. I think many Liberal senators would profess that they believe universities ought to be autonomous institutions insofar as the communities of the universities can determine their own affairs. For some years there has been an increasing onslaught on the Australian National University by the Fraser Government and it seems to me that there has been a most inappropriate use of the Parliament. Either the Government has confidence in the Council of the ANU or it does not. If it does not, I think we are dealing with a much more serious matter than how students decide to allocate the funds that are available to them. It is really a very serious erosion of what one would have thought would have been a principle supported on a bipartisan basis in this community, that is, the university ought to be able to run its affairs particularly in dealing with such relatively trivial matters as the way in which students decide to use the very small sums which they have at their disposal. </PARA>
<PARA> An article published in the Daily Mirror yesterday referred to Mr Philip Ruddock attacking the Australian National University for being involved in the practice of laundering huge sums of money. This is the kind of melodramatic statement and exaggeration that the Fraser Government likes to engage in. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Sibraa has pointed out, this kind of extravagant and melodramatic attack is in keeping with Mr Ruddock's general behaviour. I simply place on record the Labor Party's rejection of that claim. The whole concept of laundering money is insulting. It suggests an improper transmission of funds. As Senator Rae himself has said, the decisions made by the students' representative council were made on the understanding of the Council of the ANU itself that it was acting within what was intended by the legislation currently in operation. So the whole matter has been blown out of all proportion. The whole purpose of the legislation, as I have said, is that the Government does not want to see a healthy independent students' organisation that can adopt various political or social stances. We of the Labor Party endorse the rights of students, as we endorse the rights of all Australians, to participate freely in union activities and to make their own democratic decisions. It really is an appalling state of affairs when, on the last sitting day of what has been an extraordinarily exhausting, controversial and serious session of the Parliament, senators should have to be engaged in debating what, as I have said, is a petty and ideologically very biased attempt to interfere in the way that a few students want to run their affairs. Of course the Labor Party opposes the whole of the legislation outright.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to raise a couple of points. I have listened to Senator Rae. I reinforce what Senator Rae has had to say. It has been an embarrassment to the Senate representatives on the Australian National University Council. I am one of the representatives. It has been embarassing over the past two years almost in which we have been required to spend an extraordinary length of time on debating the requirements of the Government in respect of the use of funds. The Government has endeavoured to do something which I consider to be impossible. In fact, the provisions in certain clauses of the Australian National University Amendment Bill cannot really be carried out without extraordinary and continual supervision. If the previous legislation has failed to the extent that we need further legislation, this legislation also will fail. What it means, of course, is that the Council of the ANU, which has very important matters that concern it and other grave difficulties which it faces, has to spend further time debating this matter. It will have to spend extraordinary amounts of time in supervising-or endeavouring to supervise-or to carry out the requirements of the new legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will vote against the legislation. I understand how difficult it is for Senator Rae and also for Senator Reid. Senator Reid also is a member of the ANU Council. She is, I think, the Governor-General's appointee to the Council. Three senators directly and indirectly represent this place on the Council. I do not doubt that Senator Reid fully realises the conflict of interest which arises from time to time. I do not know exactly what her views are. She may be given the opportunity to express them. It has been, according to the Chancellor, the Vice-Chancellor and the leading members of the Council, an unwarranted and unnecessary intrusion into the affairs of the University. Having spent a considerable amount of time endeavouring to carry out the wishes of the previous legislation, we are now faced with these amendments. Proposed new sub-section 3 states:</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Where an organisation of students receives prescribed moneys-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) it is the duty of the organisation-</PARA>
<PARA> (i) to apply those prescribed moneys and any moneys derived by that organisation from those prescribed moneys; and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) to take all reasonable steps to ensure that any moneys derived by that organisation from those prescribed moneys and received by any person on behalf of the organisation are applied,</PARA>
<PARA> only in respect of the provision, for students liable to pay the fees out of which those prescribed moneys were made available, whether members of the organisation or not, of amenities or services that are not of an academic nature and are--</PARA>
<PARA>So it continues. It is a tortuous, confused and impossible sub-section. What it means, of course, is that if an organisation or an association within the university receives certain moneys, as has been prescribed by previous legislation, it cannot use those moneys to raise further moneys, except for the express purpose of the previous legislation. In other words, that organisation cannot, using those moneys, hold a function which raises money. It prevents those further moneys being used by that organisation to carry out the rest of its program. In other words, it cannot, if it wishes, pay affiliation fees to the Australian Union of Students because it has used moneys which have been provided to raise further moneys. In other words, if it puts the money in a bank account for a time and earns interest, that interest cannot be used to go beyond the demands of the Government in the previous legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> That might mean that the interest cannot be used; that it is direct income. I think that is wrong. Supposing that organisation runs a function on property which has been erected using prescribed money. It cannot allow that area to be used for raising any other moneys which may be used contrary to the wishes of the Government. Nor can it do anything with any moneys of that sort. The Council and the administration of the University have to follow out step by step the use of prescribed moneys to make certain that no subsequent moneys which are raised by that money, even to the third, fourth, fifth or sixth degree--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, but he is also carrying out the initiative of the Government on the Council, to the embarrassment of the rest of us. It is an absolute disgrace. Anybody who has been to a university will appreciate how necessary it is to protect an environment that is free from government interference and intrusion. The Government's actions are foolish in that most students go through a time of intellectual debate, political and otherwise, which influences their development. This sort of legislation has the very opposite effect to the one the Government wishes. It does not reduce the militancy of various organisations, it increases it. It does not allow for the free flow of exchange between student and student. To me, it is an interference which is quite contrary to the tradition of universities in democratic countries, and that is why I object to what Mr Ruddock is doing. I object to the comments which Senator Withers has made by way of interjection. I also object to the remarks of Senator MacGibbon about laundering. In most instances laundering, in effect, is something of a semi-criminal nature. The honourable senator was actually saying that universities and student organisations are endeavouring by illegal means to use moneys in a way not prescribed by law. What we are doing is imposing a law-an extremely stupid law-which forces people to take what eventually people like Senator MacGibbon claim to be criminal actions. He has accused these people of using covert means to carry out their wishes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me get back to the tradition of allowing campuses to remain free. I will come back to the clause. I ask the Minister to explain the clause. I know his views. He may take some highly debative stance to point out the weaknesses of my arguments. His speech will have nothing to do with the substance of my remarks but merely the form in which I have made them. I am always open to attack on that basis. If he would like to go beyond the method in which I have made my presentation, possibly he will agree with what I have said. Will the Minister describe how the Council can possibly do what is described in proposed new sub-section 3 (b)? Proposed new sub-section 3 (b) states:</PARA>
<PARA>it is the duty of the Council to take all reasonable steps to ensure that those prescribed moneys and any moneys derived by that organisation from those prescribed moneys are applied only as mentioned in paragraph (a). </PARA>
<PARA>I want the Minister to apply himself to that part of the provision and explain how he expects the Council to carry out that function? What sort of supervision does he expect the Council to carry out? How can it possibly carry out that sort of function? To what extent must the supervision be maintained? How is this money to be followed around? Are the bills to be marked and followed around the university? What will the Council do? Will it follow every action of every organisation?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a very difficult task to follow a speech such as that. I want to tackle only one point. I should like Senator Georges to give a legally binding assurance that no student function has ever been held for the purpose of raising funds for the Australian Union of Students and a profit declared from that function and transmitted to the AUS when the cost of operating that function exceeded the takings from it. If Opposition senators choose to call that a criminal activity, so be it. But that is my point. The purpose of this Bill is to deny the compulsory levying of union fees for socio-political purposes. It in no way restricts the levying of fees for legitimate student union activities, such as the refectory, the expansion of library services or any one of a dozen things that student unions do for their members which are clearly beneficial to the welfare of the students at the time that they are on the campus. That should be very clearly understood. Least of all is it an ideological attack on the Australian Union of Students, as Senator Ryan suggested.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What has happened with the student unions on Australian campuses is perfectly simple. They have made unionism compulsory. They have levied fees. By the way, the fees levied are not $5 or $10; in many universities they are around the $100 to $120 mark. I know that because I have to pay fees for one of my daughters. Those fees are used for political purposes, to attack the Government of the day and for other nefarious practices. I have been a student protester myself. I would deny no one the right to protest about government actions. But they can do that without the support of a compulsory union fee. That is the only point I am making. That is the point, of course, that the Labor Party will not grasp. It sees the unions as its umbilical cord, to get it into power and to keep it in power. That is why it is holding itself in abeyance to them. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a travesty that we should have free tertiary education-in fact, free education-in this country, except for compulsory union fees. Students have to pay those fees. What a perversion of a system it is that one has to pay union fees to be a university student. Yet, all tuition fees are paid by the Australian taxpayer. That is the thing that sticks in my craw. That is the thing that I will not tolerate. The worst part about it is the way in which the university administrations around Australia support the unions' position. I find it intolerable that university administrations will say to students such as my own daughter: 'If you do not pay your compulsory union fees you cannot enter for university examinations and if you could enter for university examinations we would not award you a degree at the end'. I think that is intolerable. The intent of this Bill is to remedy that situation in respect of one university. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope in time that this Government will move to legislate that as a condition of all tertiary educational institutes in Australia receiving funding, either directly or indirectly-I refer not only to universities but also to colleges of advanced education and the rest of them-so they have to provide full services to students, and so that they can not turn around to students and say that because they have not paid their compulsory union fees therefore they cannot enter for university examinations. I hope that the Government legislates to do that. That, of course, was the intention of this Bill when it was brought in two years ago. We had hoped that by setting an example as to what we thought was a fair and equitable social system of education the other universities in Australia would have seen the light and followed course. To my great regret they have not done this. The other State universities, including to my eternal regret my own State of Queensland which professes to be a free enterprise State and has a non-Labor government, have shown a marked reluctance to do anything to get rid of compulsory union fees. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Rae very clearly stated the problem that the Australian National University and the Australian Union of Students found because of opposing legal views presented to them. That has been very clearly spelled out. The necessity for this legislation is encompassed in just that one sentence of Senator Rae. Senator Ryan considers that this Government is irresponsible in passing legislation to clarify the intention of this Parliament when it passed legislation last year. I am sick and tired of hearing from members of the Opposition lectures on the parliamentary system and the rights of people in this Parliament. Every day we receive lectures to the effect that we are putting through legislation faster than they think we should. They claim that senators have certain rights, but when a matter goes against what honourable senators opposite believe in, those rights suddenly disappear. We are told that the intention of the legislation which was passed in this place last year should not be given effect to. The Bill merely seeks to justify and clarify the intention of this Parliament. Honourable senators opposite are saying that the Committee should not agree to the Bill. Senator Ryan was not debating the rights or wrongs of the matter. She was debating the fact that legislation was passed and the Government was forcing the universities, by passing this Bill, to carry out certain things.</PARA></TALK.START>

In their true, socialistic fashion they say: 'We will say what is right. If it suits our policies people must pay'. Because the Students Union is very politically motivated, they are saying that every student must financially support that political motivation and we will say that this is enforceable. Senator MacGibbon spelled out very clearly the fact that there is indeed freedom of education in Australia, but at the moment there is in the universities a compulsion for students to pay for political activities of which they have no intention to be part. That is compulsion. We are merely removing that compulsion and allowing students who wish to be part of that political activity to finance it. Students who do not wish to be part of it should have the choice not to fund it. It is as clear as that, but it does not suit the Opposition that such freedom of choice should be extended.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has done very well. But he did not actually indicate in reply to the question I asked how this would be carried out. I would like to find out how much further we have to involve ourselves in legislation in order to carry out the wishes of the Government. I want to say that the Australian National University received legal advice and found that moneys raised and used as prescribed had been dealt with quite legally. Let us forget what Senator MacGibbon said about the Council running some function and paying more to the Australian Union of Students than it raised. It does not need to do that. Any function the Council wishes to organise to raise funds, for example by employing a band, raises three or four times the amount expended on the function. This is what it generally does to raise further moneys. This legislation will now make this impossible. The Council does not engage in any of those stupid propositions just outlined by the Minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That was the way in which many Liberal Party supported organisations used to run their functions. They used to get around the law by running a function for charity, the expenses for which would be about $5,000 and the amount that went to charity about $10. If honourable senators are talking about evading and getting around the laws and regulations of this country that is something that has been practiced in the past. I ask honourable senators not to start talking about a few students trying to raise a bit of money to carry out some of their activities. They will do it very well indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walters mentioned the matter of compulsion. I will answer that point. There are wide areas of compulsion which I have to accept. For a long period, one of these has been to pay tax. It is compulsory for me to pay tax in a variety of directions. I have no right and no control over where that money flows. I objected to our involvement in the Vietnam war but there was no way in which I could have said 'I refuse to pay that portion of my tax which supports the war'. There are certain areas where there is a certain compulsion that is acceptable and necessary. Certain fees that we have to pay in certain areas are subject to compulsion. Senator Walters argument does not hold. I will now come back to the fact that I would like the Minister to explain how it will be possible to carry out the legislation. Will he explain to me how the Australian National University administration will, without unnecessary expense, maintain the wishes of the Government?</PARA>

In that case it might be as much an earnest as possible of our desire to have the University Council involve itself in trying to answer that question.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Christmas Island Agreement Amendment Bill 1981 follows the report of the Sweetland Commission of Inquiry into the Viability of the Christmas Island Phosphate Industry. That report is an important one and stems largely from the activities of the workers on the island, who believe they have been ignored by governments over a considerable time-with the exception of the period of the Whitlam Administration. They have been acting correctly through their own union, the Union of Christmas Island Workers. These activities were born out of desperation in the face of the lack of concern shown by this Government for their plight and their future because of the limited nature of the industry. So in a very real sense this Bill is due to their efforts, not to the concern of the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill will rectify some of the problems on the island-but by no means all of them-that have emerged since the Australian Labor Party last held office in 1975. In the period from 1972 to 1975 we had many concerns about the island and its future. We were concerned about the continual attitude adopted by the conservatives in this country and about the colonialist and discriminatory policies being applied to those working for the Christmas Island Phosphate Commission. Of course, previous conservative administrations took advantage of certain disabilities arising out of the way in which the Christmas Island Phosphate Commission operated. They relied largely upon the difficulties relating to the administration because of the involvement of other countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides that the British Phosphate Commissioners will be replaced on the island as managing agents for the Christmas Island Phosphate Commission by an Australian Government owned and controlled company. We are very pleased that that step has finally been taken. It is something for which we have constantly pressed, as have the workers on the island. We have overcome this last vestige of colonialism and have established a much more effective administration. After 1 July this year there will be a Christmas Island Phosphate Company. Because the Bill seeks to set up such an administration, naturally the Opposition supports it. My party notes that the appointment of the Chairman has been announced. He will be a very distinguished former public servant, Mr George Warwick Smith, who has had a very long and distinguished career in the Australian Public Service. We do not quarrel with that appointment either. </PARA>
<PARA> The Christmas Island Phosphate Company will actually mine the phosphate on Christmas Island. This will be carried out basically on a non-profit basis, even though the company will act in accordance with basic commercial principles. We are pleased that occasionally some of our philosophical views come through as they are doing in this legislation. The Christmas Island Phosphate Commission is no longer required to have British Phosphate Commissioners as managing agents. Eventually, the Christmas Island Phosphate Commission itself will be wound up. This depends upon a final agreement with the New Zealand Government. Surely it has to be conceded that there has been a very unusual arrangement in respect of this area for very many years. Unlike the Government's action with the Australian Wool Testing Authority where a series of organisations seem to have been set up, in this instance there is evidence that the Government actually knows what it is doing. We applaud it for taking that positive step. Rather than opting out we are opting in. </PARA>
<PARA> The second thing the Bill does is to enable the Christmas Island Phosphate Commission to transfer stockpiles at the manufacturers' plants in Australia and New Zealand to the respective governments. Finally, the Bill reflects impending changes in purchasing and distribution arrangements for phosphate by removing the requirement on the Christmas Island Phosphate Commission to dispose of Christmas Island phosphate in conjunction with phosphate supplied from other sources by the British Phosphate Commissioners. As from 1 July the responsiblity of the BPC will be transferred to the Australian Phosphate Commission. Those are the positive aspects of the legislation. It appears that eventually we will have a Christmas Island phosphate company which will mine the phosphate and also look after the municipal type functions on the island. The Australian Phosphate Commision will assume responsibility for the purchasing and distribution of Australia's phosphate requirements. We are not quite at that step yet. There will still be a need for the Parliament of Australia to exercise some jurisdiction and supervision of the municipal functions which will be assumed. </PARA>
<PARA> The manufacturers will take over the shipping of the phosphate presently being undertaken by three ships of the Australian National Line under long term charter to the British Phosphate Commission. The Opposition believes that the new arrangements are sensible but we would expect the new organisation, owned and controlled by the Australian Government, to take decisive steps to look after the people on the island in a less paternal way than has occurred in the past. The Sweetland Report on the viability of the island's phosphate deposits brought these matters into full focus. Briefly, the report stated that Christmas Island is viable and that there are at least eight more years of rock on the island, even given the payment of workers at Australian federal minimum award wage rates. That is a very important recognition of a basic wage requirement by the Fraser Government. We have allowed the British Phosphate Commissioners to discriminate against workers on the island for all the years that the rock has been extracted from an Australian territory. We must all surely recognise that the island contains a multi-racial society. The Sweetland report stated that the British Phosphate Commissioners did not adapt to the passing of colonialism. I refer the Senate to page 3 of the report which stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The institutional framework within which Christmas Island operates is outmoded, discredited, and in many ways repugnant. </PARA>
<PARA>It is very difficult to overcome that criticism in 1981. The report continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Many of the Island's problems can be traced to this fact. The British Phosphate Commissioners (BPC) is an organisation which has not adapted quickly enough or willingly enough to the passing of the colonial era. Its shareholders, the governments of Britain, New Zealand and Australia, have not required it to adapt to these changes. Responsibilities ultimately rests with those governments and their servants. The structure of the Government Administration on the island and much of the law that is in force, is more appropriate to a colonial possession than it is to a remote multi-racial mining community on Australian territory. </PARA>
<PARA>If ever there is an indictment of conservative governments in this country, New Zealand and the United Kingdom it is that comment by the person appointed by this Government to inquire into the problems on the island. We know that some of the leaders of the union representing Christmas Island workers have been traduced, criticised and pressured into taking a less militant position in order to rectify the last vestige of colonialism within Australian territories. </PARA>
<PARA> My main criticism of the report was that apart from the wages issue it advocates major changes in the organisation of phosphate mining on Christmas Island. But nowhere in the report was it suggested that the members of the work force, who obviously will be greatly affected by the suggested changes, should in any way be consulted. One would have thought in this modern age, when there are moves taking place in most countries of the world about worker participation, worker control, worker consultation, that the Government would have consulted the work force in a much more consistent and proper way. </PARA>
<PARA> The weakness that exists in many government reports that come down from time is that the people most likely to be affected by any proposed changes are rarely given the opportunity to have their voices heard. They are rarely consulted. I think it is a matter to which this Government, conservative as it is, ought to be giving much more serious consideration. If it wants to stay contemporary it should take up a position that is now accepted by a wider variety of private organisations as well as many governments all over the world. If the workers' lifestyle, environment and future are to be affected by these changes-I am sure they will be; that is as sure as night follows day-a consultative process ought to be set in motion which at least will allow to be heard the views of those who will be affected by the change. After all this new company will take over the municipal responsibilities. That is important because it deals with a whole range of matters which we know are part of municipal charters of local government in our country. There ought to be some process by which the views of the people and the workers are noted. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst I accept the fact that the Sweetland report is a very good report, we should not be making recommendations without consulting those who are affected by them. More consideration should be given to avenues of consultation with those who will be affected by the very dramatic changes that will come about as a result of the passage of legislation. As from 1 July the changes not only will be noted in this place but also will be very much apparent on Christmas Island. However, it is generally the case in Public Service industries that those who will be affected by the considerable number of reports presented to the Parliament are rarely given an opportunity to present a view or to have their views incorporated in the report. Although broadly the Opposition agrees with the trend of the Bill there is no evidence that this Government is prepared to take that aspect into consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Minister: What arrangements are being made in these matters? I ask also about a whole number of other matters which he might very briefly refer to in his reply. What arrangements are being made to provide in the future for teachers on the island and other territories? I also ask about the health care of people on the island. Previously industrial awards on the island incorporated free health care provisions for what I understand to be quite long-standing historical reasons. So, given the Government's about face and the five changes it has made to medical arrangements in this country, I think those are relevant questions and I ask the Minister to give some consideration to them in his reply. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the most crucial matter is the long term future of the island and the island's industry. The security and stability of employment is naturally of the greatest concern for those who live on the island. I understand that Mr Sweetland, who wrote the report, is currently examining these matters. Of course we await his consideration of them because the livelihood of many people is at stake. I hope that the Government will not take the view that that is not an important consideration for the future. </PARA>

<PARA>Minister for Home Affairs and Environment Parliament House Canberra, A.C.T. 2600</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator Mulvihill,</PARA>
<PARA> I refer again to your letter of 9 April 1981 drawing my attention to your remarks in the Senate on 8 April 1981 concerning threats to Abbott's Booby on Christmas Island. </PARA>
<PARA> I note that on 9 April 1981, in his response to your remarks, Senator Baume pointed out that the moratorium on further jungle clearing in certain central and western areas of Christmas Island could be extended while results of the survey of Abbott's Booby are being considered. I am now able to advise you that the moratorium has been extended until 31 May 1981 to permit further consideration of options recommended by Professors J. D. Ovington and J. M. Cullen and Dr J. B. Nelson in their 'Appraisal and implications of a survey (1979-80) of Abbott's Booby on Christmas Island'. </PARA>

I put this in clear terms to Senator Baume: Will the decision be made by the board of the new phosphate company as to the ambit of its mining operations? Conversely, will the Honourable Ian Wilson, as the Minister responsible, decide that? Will it be a decision for the Cabinet of the Australian Government?

<PARA> Several queries have been raised by Senator Gietzelt. The whole question of reorganising in regard to Christmas Island has been a difficult one. There was a period in the early 1970s when Labor governments were in power in all three countries involved at the same time. It has been difficult-not just on the question of ideologies-to get the package put together. The honourable senator did ask me about union involvement. Christmas Island unions were involved in consultations on the implementation of the Sweetland report. I understand that the Australian Council of Trade Unions will have a representative on the board of the new Christmas Island Phosphate Company. So there will be very direct trade union input in the area which Senator Gietzelt mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter that was raised concerned medical care for workers on Christmas Island. It is a little early for me to give a response on that question. I understand that previously free medical care was obtained in Perth for the workers from Christmas Island. The honourable senator will be aware that the administrative details to put the new arrangements that have been announced into operation are presently being negotiated. Part of the negotiations will be the arrangements for medical care for Christmas Island workers. Negotiations and discussions are going on now to try to resolve that matter. It might be most appropriate if we take a record of the honourable senator's concern and as soon as we have some kind of an answer we will make the information available to him.

<PARA>ARTICLE III</PARA>
<PARA> For the purposes of this Convention:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. (a) 'Dumping' means:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) any deliberate disposal at sea of wastes or other matter from vessels, aircraft, platforms or other man-made structures at sea;</PARA>

<PARA> (c) The disposal of wastes or other matter directly arising from, or related to the exploration, exploitation and associated offshore processing of sea-bed mineral resources will not be covered by the provisions of this Convention. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OL7">Senator MELZER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It should be remembered that there has been an increasing inclination of late to dispose of waste by incineration at sea. A resolution made at the third consultation meeting in 1978 stated that incineration at sea was an interim measure for waste disposal pending the development of better solutions and that the intention of the adoption of mandatory provisions for the control of incineration at sea is not to increase the amount of waste incinerated at sea for which there are practical land-based methods of disposal. There has been increasing pressure from industry in Australia to allow for more disposal of waste at sea. Senators will recall the pressure to bring incineratorial ships to Australia for the disposal of toxic wastes. But we must never forget that the sea is not the ideal receptacle for waste. Pollution of the sea could affect the world's population far into future generations. The two opening paragraphs of the preamble to the Convention that we are ratifying state:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Recognizing that the marine environment and the living organisms which it supports are of vital importance to humanity, and all people have an interest in assuring that it is so managed that its quality and resources are not impaired;</PARA>
<PARA> Recognizing that the capacity of the sea to assimilate wastes and render them harmless, and its ability to regenerate natural resources, is not unlimited;</PARA>
<PARA>It is imperative that we look at the disposal of waste very carefully. We must make industry in Australia take full responsibility for disposing safely of the waste it produces, or we must look carefully at the part that that industry plays in our lives and whether the industry is necessary if it is to continue to need to pollute. Many industries will only look to their processes and the necessity for updating or changing to a safer method of processing if they are forced to by being held responsible for the wastes they produce which can endanger life on earth and can certainly endanger life in the sea. </PARA>
<PARA> Although there have not been many horror stories to date of the results of dumping of toxic chemicals into the sea from ships, there have been many examples of shore-based dumping into the ocean. The most notable was the dumping of mercury into the sea off Minamata Bay in Japan. The residents ate fish and other marine life that was heavily contaminated with mercury. As a result, the acute mercury poisoning they suffered became known as Minamata disease. By April 1977, 1,076 residents of Minamata were certified victims of the disease and 3,000 others were awaiting examination. Needless to say, mercury as well as cadmium, another environmental poison which became publicly prominent from massive health problems in Japanese waters, are both on Annex I and are totally prohibited from being disposed of in the ocean. Other metals, such as arsenic and zinc, are on Annex II and will require special permits for dumping. </PARA>
<PARA> It was the zinc contaminated oysters of the Derwent estuary in Tasmania which gained notoriety early in the 1970s when one was analysed and found to contain 26,000 parts per million of zinc. It should be noted that the Electrolytic Zinc Co. of Australia Ltd is the only company in Australia regularly to dump wastes into the sea. It does so in 1,500 metres of water south of Hobart. The company would like to move to shallower waters for cost reasons. Toxicity tests on the company's wastes are being carried out for the company in the United States of America on an American species of fish, not those normally found in the area where the company has dumped or hopes to dump. We feel that any research that is carried out to determine the suitability of the application for a dumping permit should logically be done under Australian conditions. Indeed, up until now we have had really precious little information about what has been dumped in Australian waters. We have precious little information about what amount has been dumped or where it has been dumped. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to quote from evidence given to the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment during its investigation into marine science. It was pointed out that the then Department of Science and the Environment was responsible for regulating marine dumping through a voluntary scheme in accordance with the London Dumping Convention. Of course, why we are debating this Bill today is so that it will no longer be wholly voluntary. Officers of the Department were asked a number of questions about dumping. The transcript of evidence stated:</PARA>

<PARA> Mr Fletcher-Normally we are approached by whoever is disposing of the wastes and we process the application in line with the London Dumping Convention provisions. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OL7">Senator MELZER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On what grounds are you approached by the people who are dumping the wastes?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Fletcher-They are aware that there is a voluntary scheme operating. It operated previously under the Department of Transport through its regional offices and was widely advertised through those offices. The former Department of Environment took over the scheme in about 1974. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OL7">Senator MELZER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly what does the voluntary scheme cover? What does it say and how does it attempt to bind people?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Fletcher-There is no binding legislation except what I have already mentioned. It is a voluntary scheme. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OL7">Senator MELZER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What does the voluntary scheme entail?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Fletcher-It entails dumping wastes in line with the provisions of the London Dumping Convention. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OL7">Senator MELZER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Does that mean, for instance, that people have to dump outside the 3-mile limit or outside the 200-mile limit? Are they expected not to dump in certain areas or to dump in certain areas?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Fletcher-It depends on what sorts of wastes are to be disposed of. For instance it may be a derelict vessel to be dumped near the Narrabeen Reef off Sydney, which is within a couple of kilometres of land. On the other hand it may be the dumping operation undertaken by Electrolytic Zinc Co. Ltd. That disposal takes place approximately 110 kilometres out to sea. It depends upon the type of waste. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OL7">Senator MELZER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;So under the voluntary scheme an industry which wants to dispose of some toxic waste approaches your Department and asks for your advice as to where it should dump that, does it?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Fletcher-Yes, and the conditions under which it should be dumped. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OL7">Senator MELZER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What might those conditions be? Are you talking about weather conditions, conditions of the sea or what?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OL7">Senator MELZER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Does that mean you do have dump sites?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Fletcher-No, we look at each individual waste and look at the proposed dump site for each of those wastes. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OL7">Senator MELZER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Who decides the dump site? Does the industry decide it or does your Department decide it?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Fletcher-The industry may put forward a site and we will then look at the proposal. If it does not, we will look at the kinds of sites which have been used for the purpose. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OL7">Senator MELZER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;How would an industry find a site? There is a big ocean and the industry is on land. How would it come upon a site?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Fletcher-The industries are often aware of the provisions in the London Dumping Convention. There are a number of annexes attached to the convention which talk about dump site characteristics. A number of industries look at that and look at possible sites in their vicinity which may meet those requirements. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OL7">Senator MELZER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The point I have been endeavouring to make is that we do not know what has been dumped, we do not know where it has been dumped, nor do we know in what amounts it has been dumped. It is at this point that the Opposition feels we should call a halt and be very sure that we know what is going into the sea and where it is going from now on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Annex I of the Convention covers the substances that are banned. It bans the dumping of substances such as mercury, cadmium, high level radioactive wastes, persistent plastics, crude oil and materials produced for biological chemical warfare. All these are materials which I feel we all agree should not be dumped in the sea. This legislation will allow special permits to be issued for the dumping of waste as listed in Annex II. This includes materials such as arsenic, lead, copper, zinc, and their compounds; pesticides and radioactive wastes. It is here that we believe Annex II is not tight enough. We do not believe that any radioactive waste should be dumped at sea. Increasingly, scientific work shows that any radioactivity is dangerous, that its effects are cumulative. Therefore we feel that in relation to Annex II the Government should have taken a firm stand to make sure that under no circumstances were any radioactive wastes allowed to be dumped at sea. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition welcomes at last the introduction of this legislation. We feel that the quicker the situation is brought under control, the better. However, the Bill as drafted contains a major omission. There is no power to control dumping on Australia's continental shelf by foreign vessels. Clauses 10, 11, 12 and 14 control dumping beyond Australia's territorial seas only by Australian vessels, aircraft, or platforms or by vessels or aircraft loaded in Australia. What about the 200 mile zone for which we have taken responsibility? This Bill does not assist Australian jurisdiction over dumping on the continental shelf by foreign vessels, and we ask why. Under this Bill it is possible for ships from Indonesia, Papua New Guinea or Japan to dump on Australia's continental shelf substances which Australia considers are harmful to its seabed resources. We know that Japan is still looking for a disposal site for its nuclear waste. What will happen if other countries begin to look for disposal sites for arsenic or zinc or the metals that may come in the future?</PARA>
<PARA> It is submitted that international law today clearly recognises the right of a coastal state to control dumping on its continental shelf. Article 210 (5) of the Draft Convention on the Law of the Sea provides:</PARA>
<PARA> Dumping within the territorial sea and the exclusive economic zone or onto the continental shelf shall not be carried out without the express prior approval of the coastal State, which has the right to permit, regulate and control such dumping after due consideration of the matter with other States which by reason of their geographical situation may be adversely affected thereby. </PARA>
<PARA>Article 216 (1) (a) provides:</PARA>
<PARA> Laws and regulations adopted in accordance with this Convention and applicable international rules and standards established through competent international organizations or diplomatic conference for the prevention, reduction and control of pollution of the marine environment by dumping shall be enforced:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) by the coastal State with regard to dumping within its territorial sea or its exclusive economic zone or onto its continental shelf. </PARA>
<PARA>These articles provide a clear indication of the rights of a coastal state in international law. While these provisions are not in force, they reflect widely accepted international agreement and are not controversial articles. </PARA>
<PARA> It would be proper, therefore, for Australia to assert jurisdiction over dumping on its continental shelf. In support of such a view, it may be useful to mention briefly some background to the enforcement provisions contained in the London Dumping Convention itself. Article VII (1) (c) provides for each party to apply the measures to implement the convention to vessels under its jurisdiction believed to be engaged in dumping. The extent of jurisdiction possessed by a coastal state was a hotly debated issue at the London conference in 1972. The compromise was to leave unspecified in the Convention itself the jurisdiction of the coastal state and to leave this for determination by reference to the developing law of the sea. </PARA>
<PARA> Article VII thus needs to be read with Article XIII of the International Control of Marine Pollution. But what is clear is that the jurisdiction provided for in Article VII (1) (c) is additional to that in Article VII (1) (a). The negotiating history of the provision clearly shows that it was intended to provide for coastal state jurisdiction in a zone adjacent to the coast. At the time, agreement could not be reached on the extent of this zone. Since then, however, international law has clearly established that a coastal state can control dumping on its continental shelf and in its economic zone. Australia has not yet established an economic zone having only asserted jurisdiction over fisheries resources in a 200-mile zone. Australia has, however, asserted sovereign rights over its continental shelf. Because of the delay in finalising the Law of the Sea Convention, no definition of the nature and extent of responsibility of the coastal state has been made under the provisions of Article XIII. The Opposition, however, maintains that this need not prevent Australia from asserting jurisdiction in a manner that has now clearly been accepted as consistent with international law. This view is reinforced by the consistent policy of Australia in this matter. Throughout the Law of the Sea Conference, Australia has strongly argued for recognition of the jurisdiction of the coastal state over dumping on the continental shelf. At the London Dumping Conference itself, Australia and New Zealand in a joint statement said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is the understanding of the delegations of Australia and New Zealand that this Convention in no way detracts from the rights of a coastal state to take action in areas under its jurisdiction, and in particular from the right of the coastal state to take action for the purpose of protecting the resources of its continental shelf. </PARA>
<PARA>For Australia now to legislate, almost 10 years since the Convention was drawn up, and not to assert jurisdiction over dumping on its continental shelf would represent not only a departure from a long held position expressed at the 1972 conference itself but also would fail to reflect developments in international law since that date. It may be argued that Australia should not, at this stage, assert jurisdiction over dumping on the continental shelf but that it should wait until it establishes a full economic zone with powers over all forms of pollution as provided for in the Draft Law of the Sea Convention. The Opposition maintains that the problem with this approach is that Australia already has rights over its continental shelf and it ought to act to the full extent permitted by international law to protect the resources of the shelf. It is likely to be a considerable time before Australia moves to establish a full economic zone. In the meantime there seems to be absolutely no justification for not asserting jurisdiction over all dumping on Australia's continental shelf. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is particularly concerned that the Government's attitude to dumping on the continental shelf will allow the Japanese to have a free hand in dumping radioactive waste off our coast. What attitude will the Government take to this? In a letter to my colleague, Mr West, in another place the Minister for Home Affairs and Environment (Mr Wilson) on 21 May said:</PARA>
<PARA> Officials advised the Japanese mission that Australia considered it essential that the disposal of nuclear waste in any environment, and in particular the Pacific Ocean, should be undertaken only in compliance with the strictest safety measures and in full accordance with the relevant international agreements on the subject. </PARA>
<PARA>But what are the strict safety measures? How safe are they? Do they mean this sort of material could be dumped five miles off the Great Barrier Reef or dumped in our fishing grounds on the east coast of Australia? The Opposition asks whether the Government intends to accept the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development decision on establishing a multilateral consultation and surveillance mechanism for sea dumping of radioactive waste? This decision would authorise dumping consistently with the convention but under international supervision. Is this what the Government has in mind? If it is, will it tell us? We would appreciate it if the Government would accept that decision. But we ask the Government to remember that all life on earth originated millions of years ago in the sea. In the last century there has been wholesale pollution on the basis that, because the sea is so vast, any waste would be diluted quietly, quickly and safely. We cannot go on saying that while we pour millions of tonnes of wastes of all kinds into the sea, as we have done in the last 100 years. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition supports the Bill in principle but asks the Senate to allow Australia to show the way to the world by amending the Act and thus producing a stronger, more purposeful Act. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats agree with the Australian Labor Party that the Bill is an approach in the right direction but does need improvement in a number of significant respects. We support substantially the amendments which the Labor Party is moving because they would appear to any conservationist or person interested in the future of the natural assets of this country to be necessary amendments to the legislation. We have a community of view in that regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like particularly to refer to clause 22 of the Bill, which relates to the disposal of radioactive waste. This provision, under some circumstances, permits radioactive waste dumping to take place off the Australian coast. We feel that this is wrong and should not be considered in any circumstances. I believe we are reinforced in this view by the recent quite heavy publicity in the United States, and to some extent in this country, about the effects that are now becoming apparent of the massive dumpings off the United States coast of drums of radioactive waste which resulted from the building of nuclear weapons in the 1950s. Undersea exploration craft operating in deep water have now found that many of those drums, which were dumped in huge numbers, have breached or rotted away and are now leaking, that sponges and other marine life are attached to them and that there is every indication that there is substantial contamination which will continue over the centuries and into the indefinite future. </PARA>
<PARA> The behaviour of any radioactive isotope in the marine environment, according to our research into United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation dissertations, probably will be different at different locations. Any amount of research which Australia could carry out into the effects of radioactive waste on our marine environment must therefore be considered to be vastly inadequate as a basis for allowing any dumping of radioactive waste material in our waters. One cannot lay down general standards on these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> We must also remember that the effect of radiation on living organisms is cumulative, that no individual organism will ever become immune to its effects. Unlike other forms of contamination, the effects of radioactivity become more pronounced with time rather than otherwise, and the time lapse involved where radioactive isotopes are concerned is vast compared with that of any other form of pollution. The half life of plutonium, for instance, is some 24,400 years, so we may expect contamination to continue for literally millenia. Even with low rates of radiation there is an increase in the rate of mutation of genes and, as each individual in the sea, as elsewhere, is after all a highly complex and integrated machine, any mutation is likely to be harmful rather than beneficial. That is basic to any genetic consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> Coastal waters, including the seas over the continental shelves such as the Coral Sea, are the most productive areas of the oceans. They are the sites of the highest biological activity in the oceans, where primary production of the organic material which forms the base of the food chain ending in fish, birds and marine mammals takes place. The end effects of pollution on the base of the food chain or indeed any organism in the food chain are dramatically shown by, as Senator Melzer pointed out, the classic example of the massive occurrence of neurological disease from mercury poisoning which was contracted by the residents of Minamata Bay in Japan as a result of eating fish and shellfish from that bay, which had accumulated mercury from the wastes from the production of vinyl chloride and formaldehyde consequent upon their being discharged into the water by the Chisso Corporation. We have there a classic case of the dangers of dumping which needs to be observed constantly. </PARA>
<PARA> The United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organisation from our research, agrees that the greatest danger of harmful effects from any radioactive pollution of the oceans would be in coastal waters, including the waters over the continental shelf. I believe that to be a matter of common sense. I will deal also with the matter of foreign vessels because as the Bill stands Australia has no power to control dumping on its own continental shelf by foreign vessels. As Henry Burmester of the Australian National University Law Department pointed out, this Bill makes it possible for an Indonesian, Papua New Guinean or Japanese vessel, for instance, to dump on Australia's continental shelf substances which Australia may consider harmful to its seabed resources. </PARA>

As a result of the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Miscellaneous Amendments Bill 1981 being passed we can expect drilling platforms to be very much in evidence over our continental shelf in future. Why should these platforms and those located in other parts of Australian territorial waters not also be subject to the same limitations as vessels and aircraft in relation to dumping?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The last point I want to raise concerns the matter of States passing similar legislation to this Bill and then being allowed to administer the legislation in regard to their own territorial waters. The Australian Democrats believe this would lead to inefficiency in the administration of the legislation. There is a remote possibility admittedly, but still a possibility, of one of the States not complying fully with the legislation. Our view is that the surrounding seas ought to be a national responsibility and be administered on a uniform basis. This is not a philosophical viewpoint. Indeed, our policy is for the devolution of power, but we believe in this case there is ample evidence that due to the very mobility of the seas, by the movement of the currents, effects will be felt in geographic locations quite remote from their point of origin. We believe that is a good reason for there to be a purely national standard in this regard. </PARA>

If people are reading this Bill and attempting to get some appreciation of the measures taken by Australia to prevent the dumping of noxious material in the oceans they undoubtedly would have had drawn to their attention the fact that this Bill does not really say anything about the discharge of oil into the sea.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I turn now specifically to the provisions of this Bill. The first provision I want to take up deals with the matter of the control of the continental shelf. Both Senator Melzer and Senator Mason have criticised this Bill on the basis that it does not give legislative power to the Australian Government to undertake proper protection of dumping on the continental shelf. Senator Mason is right in saying that the attention of honourable senators was drawn to this problem by a detailed submission from Mr Henry Burmester who is a lecturer in law at the Australian National University. He wrote an analysis of the Bill as it was first introduced into the House of Representatives. I seek leave to have Mr Burmester's analysis incorporated in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION (SEA DUMPING) BILL 1981</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill has been introduced to enable Australia to give effect to the London Dumping Convention. The Bill is a significant piece of environmental legislation and in general is worthy of strong support. There is however a major omission which, it is submitted, should be remedied. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. The Bill as drafted, contains a major omission-there is no power to control dumping on Australia's continental shelf by foreign vessels. Clauses 10, 11, 12 and 14 only control dumping beyond Australian territorial sea by Australian vessels, aircraft or platforms or by vessels or aircraft loaded in Australia. The Bill does not assert Australian jurisdiction over dumping on the continental shelf by foreign vessels. It would, therefore, be possible for an Indonesian, Papua New Guinean or Japanese vessel, for instance, to come and dump on Australia's continental shelf substances which Australia may consider harmful to its seabed resources. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. International law, it is submitted, today clearly recognises the right of a coastal State to control dumping on its continental shelf. Article 210 (5) of the Draft Convention on the Law of the Sea provides:</PARA>
<PARA> 5. Dumping within the territorial sea and the exclusive economic zone or onto the continental shelf shall not be carried out without the express prior approval of the coastal State, which has the right to permit, regulate and control such dumping after due consideration of the matter with other States which by reason of their geographical situation may be adversely affected thereby. </PARA>
<PARA>Article 216 (1) (a) provides:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Laws and regulations adopted in accordance with this Convention and applicable international rules and standards established through competent international organisations or diplimatic conference for the prevention, reduction and control of pollution of the marine environment by dumping shall be enforced:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) by the coastal State with regard to dumping within its territorial sea or its exclusive economic zone or onto its continental shelf;</PARA>
<PARA> 4. These Articles provide a clear indication of the rights of a coastal State in international law. While these provisions are not in force, they reflect widely accepted international agreement and are not controversial articles. It would be proper, therefore, for Australia to assert jurisdiction over dumping onto its continental shelf. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. In support of such a view, it may be useful to briefly mention some background to the enforcement provisions contained in the London Dumping Convention itself. Article VII (1) (c) provides for each Party to apply the measures to implement the Convention to 'vessels . . . under its jurisdiction believed to be engaged in dumping', (emphasis added). The extent of jurisdiction possessed by a coastal State was a hotly debated issue at the London Conference in 1972. The compromise was to leave unspecified in the Convention itself the jurisdiction of the coastal State and to leave this for determination by reference to the developing Law of the Sea. Article VII, thus needs to be read with Article XIII-see Timagenis, International Control of Marine Pollution I, 236 ff. (1980). </PARA>
<PARA> 6. What is clear is that the jurisdiction provided for in Article VII (1) (c) is additional to that in Article VII (1) (a). The negotiating history of the provision clearly shows that it was intended to provide for coastal State jurisdiction in a zone adjacent to the coast. At the time agreement could not be reached on the extent of this zone. Since then, however, international law has clearly established that a coastal State can control dumping onto its continental shelf and in its economic zone. Australia has not yet established an economic zone, having only asserted jurisdiction over fisheries resources in a 200 mile zone. Australia has however, asserted sovereign rights over its continental shelf. </PARA>
<PARA> 7. Because of the delay in finalising the Law of the Sea Convention, no definition of the nature and extent of responsibility of the coastal State has been made under the provisions of Article XIII. This need not, however, prevent Australia from asserting jurisdiction in a manner that has now clearly been accepted as consistent with international law: see Article VII (5). </PARA>
<PARA> 8. This view is reinforced by the consistent policy of Australia in this matter. Throughout the Law of the Sea Conference, Australia has strongly argued for recognition of the jurisdiction of the coastal State over dumping on the continental shelf. At the London Dumping Conference itself, Australia and New Zealand in a joint statement said:</PARA>
<PARA> 'It is the understanding of the delegations of Australia and New Zealand that this Convention in no way detracts from the rights of a coastal State to take action in areas under its jurisdiction, and in particular from the right of the coastal state to take action for the purpose of protecting the resources of its continental shelf.' (emphasis added)-see Timagenis, supra 248. </PARA>
<PARA> 9. For Australia now to legislate, almost 10 years since the Convention was drawn up, and not to assert jurisdiction over dumping on its continental shelf would represent not only a departure from a long held position expressed at the 1972 Conference itself but also would fail to reflect developments in international law since that date. </PARA>
<PARA> 10. It may be argued that Australia should not, at this stage, assert jurisdiction over dumping on the continental shelf but that it should wait until it establishes a full economic zone with powers over all forms of pollution as provided for in the Draft Law of the Sea Convention. The problem with this approach is that Australia already has rights over its continental shelf and it ought to act to the full extent permitted by international law to protect the resources of the shelf. It is likely to be a considerable time before Australia moves to establish a full economic zone. In the meantime there seems no justification for not asserting jurisdiction over all dumping on Australia's continental shelf. </PARA>
<PARA> 11. It is, therefore, strongly submitted that the Bill should be amended by the insertion in clause 10 (a) after the words 'Australian waters' of the words 'or into the sea above the continental shelf of Australia'. This would then reflect Australia's proper entitlement at international law and the position consistently taken by Australia since 1972. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Following that, the Government took the representations that were made by its own back bench committee on the Environment in conjunction with Mr Burmester's representations very seriously. The Minister for Home Affairs and Environment, Mr Wilson, in fact introduced in the House of Representatives an amendment to deal specifically with this matter. The definitions clause of the Bill reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> 'Australian waters' means-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the territorial sea of Australia and any sea that is on the landward side of the territorial sea of Australia, other than any part of the sea that is within the limits of a State or of the Northern Territory; or</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the territorial sea of an external Territory and any sea that is on the landward side of that territorial sea,</PARA>
<PARA>That was the definition given in the original Bill. That was amended in the House of Representatives. Added into that clause are the following words:</PARA>
<PARA>and includes any area of sea that is declared by the regulations to be included in Australian waters for the purposes of this Act;</PARA>
<PARA>In other words the Australian Government by regulation may proclaim the continental shelf or, indeed, any part of the 200-mile zone or whatever it happens to assert as jurisdiction under the London Dumping Convention for the purposes of this Act to be set by regulation as waters to which this Act applies. In other words, the amendment introduced in the House of Representatives by the Government added to the definition of the term 'Australian waters' a power to proclaim by regulation any other waters, including the continental shelf obviously, as waters to which this Act was to take application. </PARA>
<PARA> The time constraints of today's debate do not allow me to go into very great detail about this Bill. I will perhaps just highlight a couple of matters that are to be found within it. Clause 5 of the Bill provides an exemption in relation to dumping in the sea. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the disposal of wastes or other matter directly arising from, or relating to, the exploration, exploitation and associated off-shore processing, of seabed mineral resources. </PARA>
<PARA>It is one of the early steps in the development of an off-shore mining code. Clause 9 indicates the degree of co-operation which we seek to have with the States whereby, if they pass legislation which the Commonwealth regards as satisfactory, the Commonwealth will withdraw from that part of the seas around Australia over which State jurisdiction is asserted and allow the States to administer that Act with the safeguard that if the Act, in the first place, is subject to the Commonwealth's approval before it withdraws its legislative control over that area and if, in the administration or further amendments to the Act, the Commonwealth believes that the States are no longer taking their full share of responsibility or that their legislation does not accord with the principles that the Commonwealth has laid down, section 9 (3) allows the Minister, by publication in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette to revoke his original declaration that the matter should be under State jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 13 of the Bill establishes a fairly significant regime of penalties for breaches of the Act. We are talking about fines that range between $10,000 and $100,000. Clause 15 lists the possible defences. It is important to note that defences in that clause are that dumping can take place within certain limits, provided a permit has been granted by a country which is a signatory and a party to the London Dumping Convention. As far as Australia's own waters are concerned, it requires a permit from Australian authorities for that dumping to take place so that a permit-even a permit issued by another signatory to the London Dumping Convention-does not have effect in Australian waters without Australian consent. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 16 of the legislation goes on to deal with the question of the restoration of the environment. That and its related clauses through to clause 23 are important because they indicate that where dumping has taken place in a fashion which is not in accord with the legislation, then the Commonwealth may require the person who undertook the incineration or dumping to make good the restoration of the environment. The Minister may direct how the environment is to be restored. He may arrange for the work to be done to restore the environment and he may arrange to recover the costs so incurred from the guilty party. If necessary, he may hold and take possession of ships, vessels, platforms and various things, pending the settlement of the account due to the Commonwealth. It also provides that the Minister may order research to be done and may require the actual polluter to pay for the cost of research, for the cost of analysis which may be done and for matters related to that. The rest of the Bill goes on to deal, for instance, with the powers of inspectors along much the same lines as our other environment legislation such as the Whaling Act and the Antarctic Marine Living Resources Conservation Act. It lists a number of indictable offences; it provides for the appointment and the work of an analyst in conjunction with matters under this Bill and it provides for regulations to be made. As I have said, in the definition of Australian waters regulation becomes important because it allows the extension of the definition previously contained in the Bill as it was first introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> This regime will replace the previous voluntary code for dumping. In the period June 1975 to April 1981 there were some 91 inquiries for dumping permits in Australian waters. Twenty-nine of those related to chemical dumping-things like caustic soda, cyanide and sulphuric acid; seven to the dumping of explosives-things such as detonators and ammunition; seven to the dumping of scrap metal, including aircraft exhausts, valves and steel containers; 26 to the dumping of obsolete vessels such as barges, tugs, ferries and pontoons; and 22 to other things such as dredge spoils, rock and concrete. Of those 91 applications, 18 were withdrawn following advice being provided on possible alternative disposal methods, 14 were diverted to definitive alternative disposal or re-use methods and one was refused approval in line with the provision of the London Dumping Convention. Five applications, I understand, are undergoing review at present while the remining 53 applications resulted in approval being given to 25 organisations to dispose of material at sea. A number of these organisations made multiple applications in the period 1975 to 1981 to dispose of the same material at different times. I think it is important that we indicate that this voluntary regime will now be replaced with a more formal, more rigid and more enforceable regime. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already indicated by having incorporated in Hansard the exact nature of the materials specified in three Annexes. Therefore, I will turn only to the question of the dumping of radioactive material. Low level radioactive material may be dumped in accordance with part D of Annex II; high level radioactive waste, of course, may not be dumped at all under the provision of Annex I. Part D of Annex II draws particular attention to the recommendations of the appropriate international authority-that is, the International Atomic Energy Agency. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the document entitled 'International Atomic Energy Agency Information Circular, Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and other Material. The Definition Required by Annex I paragraph 6 to the Convention, and the Recommendations Required by Annex II section D'. </PARA>

<PARA>A. DEFINITION</PARA>
<PARA>A.1. Definition of High-Level Radioactive Wastages or Other High-Level Radioactive Matter Unsuitable for Dumping at Sea1</PARA>
<PARA>A.1.1. For the purposes of Annex I to the Convention, high-level radioactives wastes or other high-level radioactive matter unsuitable for dumping at sea means any waste or other matter with an activity per unit gross mass (in tonnes) exceeding:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) 1 Ci/t for *-emitters but limited to 10-1 Ci/t for 226Ra and supported 210Po;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) 102 Ci/t for */*-emitters with half-lives of at least 0.5 years (excluding tritium) and */*-emitters of unknown half-lives; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) 106 Ci/t for tritium and */*-emitters with half-lives of less than 0.5 years. </PARA>
<PARA>The above activity concentrations shall be averaged over a gross mass not exceeding 1,000 tonnes. </PARA>
<PARA>A.1.2. The Definition must not be taken to imply that material falling outside the Definition is thereby deemed to be suitable for dumping. </PARA>
<PARA>A.1.3. Materials of activity concentrations less than those in the above Definition shall not be dumped except in accordance with the provisions of the Convention, in particular Annexes II and III thereto, and the Recommendations set out in this Document, in particular Section B.1.2. </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> 1 The Definition is based on:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) An assumed upper limit to the mass dumping rate of 100 000 t per year at a single dumping site; and</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Calculated upper limits to activity release rates from all sources (other than natural sources) of</PARA>
<PARA> (a) 105 Ci/yr for *-emitters (but limited to 104 Ci/yr for 226Ra and supported 210Po);</PARA>
<PARA> (b) 107 Ci/yr for */*-emitters with half-lives of at least 0.5 years (excluding tritium) and */*-emitters of unknown half-lives; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) 1011 Ci/yr for tritium and */*-emitters with half-lives of less than 0.5 years</PARA>
<PARA> at a single dumping site and also in the case of *-emitters when released to an ocean basin of not less than 1017 m3. </PARA>
<PARA>B. THE RECOMMENDED BASIS FOR ISSUING SPECIAL PERMITS FOR RADIO-ACTIVE MATERIALS LISTED IN ANNEX II TO THE CONVENTION</PARA>
<PARA>B.1. Environmental Evaluation of Specific Dumping Applications</PARA>
<PARA>B.1.1. The appropriate national authorities shall not grant a special permit for dumping of radioactive waste unless a detailed environmental and ecological assessment gives a reasonable assurance that such dumping can be accomplished in accordance with the objectives and provisions of the Convention and the Recommendations set out in this Document. </PARA>
<PARA>B.1.2. When granting a special permit, the appropriate national authorities shall, to the extent practicable, ensure that the proposed dumping operation complies with the radiation protection requirements set forth in the IAEA Basic Safety Standards for Radiation Protection(2). These requirements are based upon the System of dose limitation of the International Commission on Radiological Protection (ICRP) which requires that:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) The operations should be justified by assessing their net benefits, taking into consideration the radiation consequences and the possibilities of alternative procedures;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The radiation protection aspects of the operation should be optimized, keeping the resulting collective doses (including their occupational and public components) as low as is reasonably achievable, economic and social factors being taken into account; and</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The doses to individual members of the public should not reach the appropriate dose limits, now or in the future. In estimating the doses, account must be taken of other practices which might expose the same critical population groups. </PARA>
<PARA>In particular, the upper limits to activity release rates from all sources (other than natural sources) when released into an ocean basin with a volume of not less than 1017 m3 shall not exceed:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) 105 Ci/year for *-emitters but only 104 Ci/year for 226Ra and supported 210Po;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) 108 Ci/year for */*-emitters with half-lives of at least 0.5 years (excluding tritium) and */*-emitters of unknown half-lives;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) 1012 Ci/year for tritium and */*-emitters with half-lives of less than 0.5 years. </PARA>
<PARA>No special permit should be issued which would cause these limits to be approached. </PARA>
<PARA>B.1.3. It is essential that a general policy of continued isolation and containment of radioactive waste after descent to the sea-bed should be pursued through the use of suitable packaging to minimize to the extent reasonably achievable the radioactivity which might ultimately be released, thereby preventing unnecessary contamination of the maritime environment. </PARA>

(This publication is under joint revision by the IAEA, the World Health Organisation and the Nuclear Energy Agency of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.)</PARA>
<PARA>*B.1.4. The environmental assessment shall include, in addition to the factors specified in Annex III to the Convention, consideration of:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) The justification for the proposed dumping operation when weighed against land-based alternatives, including the respective population dose commitments;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The total alpha, beta and gamma activities and the activity of any individual nuclide of special significance for the assessment;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Those factors likely to affect significantly the movement of radioactive materials from the dumping site to the human environment, including the nature of the sea-bed and the physical processes of mixing and transport in the sea at the dumping site;</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Dose commitments to individual members of the public and to the population via critical and other appropriate pathways;</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The risk to marine ecosystems resulting from the release of radioactivity from dumped packages;</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The degree to which it is practical to attempt to reduce dose commitments, either for normal dumping or in case of accidents, by techniques such as having the radioactive material in a relatively insoluble form or within a relatively insoluble matrix, by designing the containment to retain for a period of time radioactive material when it is on the sea-bed, or by selecting an area with characteristics that will facilitate the retention of the radioactive material in the vicinity of the dumping site;</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Operational methods to be used, including arrangements for dealing with accidents and emergencies and methods of verifying their correct execution. </PARA>
<PARA>**B.1.5. The IAEA is of the opinion that it is necessary that the reports to be submitted pursuant to Article VI.4 of the Convention, to the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organization (IMCO) include this environmental assessment in relation to an individual application for a special permit for dumping. </PARA>
<PARA>C.5. Escorting Officers</PARA>
<PARA>C.5.1 General</PARA>

<PARA>C.5.2 Duties and Responsibilities</PARA>
<PARA>C.5.2.1. The escorting officer shall have the following duties and responsibilities:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) He must ensure that the holder of the special permit complies with the requirements and conditions specified therein;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) In the execution of his duties he shall pay special attention to the following items:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) He must ensure that he is provided with a certified copy of the special permit with respect to each dumping operation. He must ensure that he is provided in advance with sufficient information about all containers and their contents to enable him to act appropriately in an emergency;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Before loading, he must be satisfied that all containers are:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) of an approved type and on visual inspection appear sound and not to be leaking;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) correctly identified and marked with the gross weight to show a specific gravity not less than 1.2; and</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) within the radiation and contamination limits laid down by the appropriate national authorities;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) The escorting officer must ensure that the master of the ship is provided with a loading sheet showing weights and volumes to be dumped;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) In conjunction with the master, the escorting officer shall ensure that the cargo is safely stowed. The consignment must be stowed and segregated to ensure that the levels of radiation measured at living quarters and regularly occupied working spaces do not expose the crew to doses exceeding those specified by the appropriate national authorities;</PARA>
<PARA> (e) He is responsible for the radiological safety and the individual dosimetry of all personnel engaged in the operation. For this purpose, he shall ensure that there is an adequate supply of personal dosimeters, protective clothing, monitoring and decontaminating equipment. He shall ensure that the crew is monitored and provided with protective clothing whenever necessary;</PARA>
<PARA> (f) The daily rate of dumping and the dumping hours must be approved by the escorting officer. Before dumping commences, the escorting officer must obtain from the master an assurance that the ship is at the approved dumping site and make arrangements for hourly fixes of the ship's position during dumping. He must also witness the dumping of all containers to satisfy himself that the drums and their contents sink;</PARA>
<PARA> (g) He must ensure that monitoring for radioactive contamination occurring on the ship is carried out and arrange for decontamination of the affected areas as necessary. Subject to his ultimate responsibility for the safety of the ship, the master must comply with any directions given by the escorting officer in this connection; and</PARA>
<PARA> (h) When the dumping operation is completed and after completion of any necessary decontamination, the escorting officer must provide the master with a Clearance Certificate of an approved type. He must also prepare, for the appropriate national authorities, a Certificate of Disposal confirming that the recorded cargo has been dumped at the designated site, with details of how the ship's position was fixed. This shall be accompanied by a certified copy of the ship's log for the duration of the voyage, including details of hourly fixes of the ship's position during the dumping period. </PARA>
<PARA>C.5.3. Powers</PARA>
<PARA>C.5.3.1. Without prejudice to the master's overall responsibility for the safety and control of the ship and the crew:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) The escorting officer must be empowered to refuse the loading or dumping of any container which, in his opinion, does not conform with the standards of packaging or have the documentation required by the special permit;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) He must be empowered to stop the dumping operation at any time if, in his judgment, the requirements for the operation cannot be met or the safety of the operation cannot be guaranteed;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) He must be empowered to prescribe, through the ship's officers or port officials, any protective measures which in his opinion are necessary for the radiological safety of the personnel engaged in the operation; and</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Subject to the requirements of the appropriate national authorities, he must be empowered to require that the ship or any part of it may not be used for other cargoes except in accordance with the terms of a Contamination Clearance Certificate. </PARA>
<PARA>ANNEX</PARA>
<PARA>I. INTRODUCTION</PARA>
<PARA>1.1. The London Dumping Convention of 1972</PARA>
<PARA>1.1.1. The Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter1 was adopted by an Intergovernmental Conference which met in London from 30 October to 13 November 1972, at the invitation of the Government of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The Convention was opened for signature by any State at London, Mexico City, Moscow and Washington from 29 December 1972 until 31 December 1973 and thereafter for accession by any State. After the entry into force of the Convention on 30 August 1975, a meeting of the Contracting Parties to decide on organizational matters, held in London from 17 to 19 December 1975, designated the Inter-Governmental Maritime Consultative Organization (IMCO) as the Organization responsible for Secretariat duties in relation to the Convention. The Convention provides for control of 'any deliberate disposal at sea of wastes or other matter from vessels, aircraft, platforms or other man-made structures at sea' and any deliberate disposal of such vessels, aircraft, etc. themselves. The prevention of marine pollution emanating from the normal operation of vessels, aircraft, etc. or directly arising from the exploration and exploitation of sea-bed mineral resources is excluded from the scope of the Convention (Article III. 1). </PARA>
<PARA>1.1.2. With respect to radioactive materials, the Convention entrusts the IAEA with specific responsibilities in the following provisions pursuant to Article IV:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) In Annex I on materials prohibited from dumping, item 6 states:</PARA>
<PARA> 'High-level radioactive wastes or other high-level radioactive matter, defined on public health, biological or other grounds, by the competent international body in this field, at present the International Atomic Energy Agency, as unsuitable for dumping at sea';</PARA>
<PARA> (2) In Annex II on materials requiring special care in dumping procedures, item D states:</PARA>
<PARA> 'Radioactive wastes or other radioactive matter not included in Annex I. In the issue of permits for the dumping of this matter, the Contracting Parties should take full account of the recommendations of the competent international body in this field, at present the International Atomic Energy Agency'. </PARA>
<PARA>1.1.3. Article IV.1 of the Convention makes a distinction between materials that may be dumped after the issue of a general permit and those that may be dumped only after the issue of a special permit. Annex II puts 'radioactive wastes or other radioactive matter' into the class requiring special permits without, however, defining such radioactive wastes or matter. </PARA>
<PARA>1.1.4. Article IV.3 of the Convention provides that no provision thereof is to be interpreted as preventing a Contracting Party from prohibiting, in so far as that Party is concerned, the dumping of wastes or other matter not listed in Annex I. Further, the content of the Annexes to the Convention will be kept under review by consultative meetings of the Contracting Parties, which will be convened not less frequently than once every two years, or by special meetings which may be convened at any time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This document sets out the definition of what constitutes low level radioactive waste and what constitutes high level radioactive waste. It sets out a regime as to the way in which these things are to be measured and to be monitored. It sets out a regime providing for inspectors, the power of inspectors and the rights of inspectors, including the rights of inspectors to supersede the rights of masters of vessels which are involved in this process. It specifies a number of other technical matters which, if read as a whole, will show the extent to which the dumping of low level radioactive waste is capable of the very strictest control under these provisions. As I said, the Bill requires regard to be had to the recommendations and the regime set down by the International Atomic Energy Agency.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Finally, the comments made about Australia's attitude towards Japan with regard to the dumping of waste have been misunderstood. I refer honourable senators to the letter that appears on page 2946 of the House of Representatives Hansard of 2 June, when this matter was debated. In that letter they will see quite clearly expressed the Australian Government's attitude towards the Japanese dumping of waste. I make the point at the beginning of my speech; that I think the most important thing for the Australian Government to do in this regard is to put pressure on the Japanese to become signatories to the London Dumping Convention. I think that ought to be a matter of the highest priority. I am happy to support this legislation. I believe it puts into effect a good, solid and dependable international regime in place of the voluntary regime. I believe that the safeguards provided by the London Dumping Convention, the annexes, and the regulations of the International Atomic Energy Agency will allow us to do this with purpose and effect. I believe that the amendment made in the House of Representatives to extend the definition of Australian waters under this Bill will allow us to protect not only our waters as we currently understand them but also the continental shelf and other areas as they become of significance to Australia in the immediate future. </PARA>

I also record my appreciation of the fact that all speakers, because of the tightness of the program, spent less time on the Bill than they might otherwise have done. Similarly, I will not reply at length. In response to the last point made by Senator Puplick, I am pleased to be able to say that within the last couple of months Japan has become a party to the Convention. This will be a matter of some satisfaction to honourable senators opposite as well as those on this side of the chamber. It will mean that the Convention will be more effective in an area of concern to this country. The purpose of the Bill is to control marine pollution through dumping and incineration by implementing the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Waste and Other Matter.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We oppose clause 9, lines 21 to 23. The Opposition feels that this clause shows the Government's betrayal of the historic decision of the High Court of Australia, which ruled that the Commonwealth had power over the seas and what lay beneath them from the low water mark to the edge of the continental shelf. The result was the sell-out to the State Premiers which culminated in the package of off-shore legislation which went through the Parliament on 1 May last year. This caused problems with the Premier of Queensland and the Great Barrier Reef. We envisage further problems. The Queensland Government is waiting for the Coastal Waters (State Powers) Act 1980 to be declared which provides for at least three miles out to sea from a given base line. How then will the Federal Minister prevent oil drilling on the reef? Why will this Government not take national responsibility? We are told by the Government speaker that some of the problems that we have with the Bill about the continental shelf will be covered by regulation. We find that to be entirely unsatisfactory. If the Government can really see the problem there, why can it not write a provision into the Bill rather than leave the matter to regulation. This does not mean that that jurisdiction must happen but that it can happen if the Minister desires.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We point out to the Government that this is one country, not a collection of States. We are here to ratify an international convention. Australia, as a country, is expected internationally to take full responsibility for the enforcement of the laws of an international convention. We have the inanity of this mirror legislation where six States rule the waves and what is beneath them for three miles around our coast, rather than the Federal Government taking responsibility. The Opposition opposes this clause. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I briefly respond to the point made by the honourable senator on behalf of the Opposition. The matter she raises is, of course, one of the points which is of fundamental difference between the Government and the Opposition. It is true that Australia is one country but it is also a collection of States and jurisdiction in many areas is divided between the Commonwealth and the States. In line with the general provisions of the off-shore constitutional settlement to give each State powers with respect to the adjacent territorial sea, it was agreed that Commonwealth legislation would apply in respect of dumping outside the territorial sea-that is the 3-mile limit-and also apply in respect of dumping inside the territorial sea where a State does not wish to legislate. I emphasise that this is not a case of leaving a vacuum or of having a situation where the convention would not be applied. Clause 9 sub-clause (1) states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Where the Minister is satisfied that the law of a State or of the Northern Territory will, on and after a particular date, make provision for giving effect to the Convention . . . the Minister shall, by notice published in the Gazette, declare that on and after that date, this Act does not apply . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In other words the Act applies to all of Australia's territorial waters unless and until the Minister is satisfied that the law of a State or of the Northern Territory gives effect to the convention. So there is total coverage. I think that the point made by Senator Melzer is essentially a point of philosophic difference. It is a very important point but it is one that I do not think needs long debate in this chamber for it to be understood both by honourable senators and the broader public which is familiar with the debate in this and other areas. </PARA>

The Opposition will move an amendment because the effects of the clause are as have been outlined in the debate to date. Ships of foreign nations which are signatories to the Convention on the Prevention of Marine Pollution by Dumping of Wastes and Other Matter need only an Australian permit from our designated authority to dump in territorial waters that is within 3 miles from the base line. Once they get outside that area they require only a permit from their own designated authority. That means that a ship from France, United States of America or any other nation could dump, according to its own permit system, four or five miles off the Australian coast. The situation is even worse for ships registered in a port of a foreign nation that is not a signatory to this convention because outside the 3-mile limit they do not need a permit from anyone.

<PARA>It was interesting that in the debate in another place on this Bill the responsible Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> The intention of the Bill is not to assert to the maximum permissible degree the right of Australia to control dumping and incineration by foreign vessels beyond our territorial waters. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition asks, why not? Clause 22 deals with radioactive wastes. We have already referred to the problems that could arise regarding signatory nations needing only their own permits to dump radioactive wastes within four miles of our shore and once dumped, I must point out to the Minister, this material cannot be recovered no matter how hard the Minister tries. Ships registered in a port of a foreign nation that is not a signatory to the Convention simply dump what they like outside the three mile limit. As they are not signatories to the Convention, they could dump high level radioactive wastes four miles from Sydney Heads and we could not do a thing about it. </PARA>
<PARA> Japan, which is not a signatory to the Convention, has indicated that it will dump 45,000 drums of low level and medium level wastes in the Pacific Ocean. The Opposition asks: Why has not Australia told the Japanese firmly that it has no right to dump any radioactive wastes at all in the ocean? Why was not this Bill expressly written to prevent the dumping of radioactive wastes on Australia's continental shelf? Scientists maintain that deep ocean currents and migratory marine life could spread accumulated radiation to Japan itself and to the islands of Micronesia, but we do not appear to care. Once it is dumped we cannot get it back; the problem is with us for a very long time-for generations into the future. We ask the Government to take the very logical step we have suggested so as to prevent this sort of thing from happening. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Bounty (Printed Fabrics) Bill and the Bounty (Textile Yarns) Bill are part of the program of TCF-textile clothing and footwear-assistance to which the Government has committed itself and to which program the Opposition, as we have made it clear on a number of occasions, is equally committed. As such, we do not oppose these Bills. We note only that the level of assistance is provided at considerable cost to the community at large, not so much in aggregate terms as far as the Bounty (Printed Fabrics) Bill is concerned as it is only $2.5m. That means, given that there are only something like 200 employees in the part of the industry affected, a subsidy per head of employees of approximately $12,500. When we turn to the Bounty (Textile Yarns) Bill the cost to the revenue is estimated by the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore) at $71m in a full year which represents in this case a subsidy of over $10,000 per worker involved in this part of the industry.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In August 1977, the Government stated that it regarded an efficient textile, clothing and footwear industry as an important and continuing part of the Australian manufacturing sector. Three years later, it reinforced this claim by essentially rejecting the thrust of Industries Assistance Report No. 240. But, despite this rejection, it did adopt certain features. The two bounty Bills before the Senate involving textile yarns and printed fabrics adopt some of these principles whereby a measure of the tariff and quota protection will be replaced by another protective measure such as a bounty. I believe that bounty protection can be justified if small amounts of public money is involved. But I cannot go along with the view that we should set aside large amounts out of the Budget for bounty purposes because I believe that costs should be borne by people who purchase goods which could attract a bounty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government gave an undertaking last year that it wished to provide seven years stability to enable the industries to invest, to become viable, to re-equip and above all to maintain a high measure of employment within those industries. But basically what the Government has set in train by subsequent statements and enactments has been of great assistance to the textile, clothing and footwear industry. However, I foreshadowed in a speech this year that there could be some problem areas, particularly in relation to certain textile yarns. Unfortunately, I regret to say at the moment that my prediction is all too true. We have now reached the stage where, the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) in his second reading speech, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> This bounty proposal is part of the Government's broader program designed to encourage--</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise the word 'encourage'-</PARA>
<PARA>the development of a more efficient industry structure for the textiles, clothing and footwear industries. </PARA>
<PARA>However, I take exception to the subsequent paragraph which states:</PARA>
<PARA> It will also provide substantial benefits for industries using bountiable yarns in manufacturing textiles or textile products. </PARA>
<PARA>At this point, I acknowledge the sympathetic hearing I have received from Sir Phillip Lynch on certain moves to improve what was previously a completely untenable situation so far as certain sectors of the industry were concerned. I find it very hard as a Government member to accept those words right across the board. In some sectors, yes, it is true but there are some significant sectors where it is far from true and far from accurate because the proposal will not provide substantial benefits for some of the industries. In some cases it could sound their death knell. This is the serious part of the legislation to which I want to refer. Unfortunately the words 'we are trying to encourage' mean different things to different people. Sure, we are putting pressure on them. In some areas we are applying so much pressure that I would not be surprised if some of them restructure downwards or closed their doors. What is going to happen to the promise of maintaining employment under such circumstances?</PARA>
<PARA> I do not think it does our side of politics any good at all to take an attitude and to say that from now on this situation is not further negotiable. I can see situations where there will be problems in this industry. It is a poor situation when the industry itself is now not prepared and come out and criticise because it has been threatened with a complete overview of the whole structure of protection towards these industries. If this is not a heavy-handed threat, I do not know what is. We talk about the union movement's attitude of standover tactics, but I have never seen the like of this sort of attitude. </PARA>
<PARA> I admit there have been some Cabinet changes since last year when they made this undertaking before the election. It is true that the views of new members of the Cabinet have to be reflected in legislation. But basically, if an undertaking is given before an election I think it must be seen through despite the fact that the amount of money involved might have been miscalculated. On the other hand, if there has been a miscalculation, if the IAC has given a brummy figure as it did with the 33 per cent so far as the cotton system was concerned, why not come out and acknowledge it? Why not say 'We've made a mistake, we are going to review it; we can't afford it', or some other such thing, and not come back and try to kid the community at large that the proposal will provide substantial benefits for industries? Why do we not say it will provide some substantial benefits or, in a measure, will provide substantial benefits. But those substantial benefits are not, I repeat, spread right across the board. </PARA>
<PARA> Further it does not do our side of politics any good if Federal Ministers say that decentralisation is not a Commonwealth Government responsibility at all. I believe that if we are going to maintain this Federal Government we have to have certain responsibilities so far as decentralisation is concerned. A large measure of the protection was designed to encourage employment in decentralised areas. It is the decentralised areas that will be hit most by this legislation. Some of the city-based areas could probably make money out of it. But in some of the decentralised areas there will be major problems. It is no good the Ministers saying that the industries will have to make commercial judgments based on the Government decisions. True, they will make those commercial decisions; but what will be the final result? It will be loss of employment and loss of dignity and trust as far as our Government is concerned. I believe that our Government has lost its ability to communicate with all sections of the industry, particularly with manufacturing industry. We seem to be concentrating on a few magnates at the moment and neglecting the rest because they have an imput and they have information that I believe we should be acting upon. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the lines of communication with industry are breaking down and breaking down very severely, and I am rather concerned that a lot of our credibility in the manufacturing sector is being lost. I recognise that there have been substantial Cabinet changes; but basically we have to continue to honour the undertakings that we have given in earlier days. I wonder what people will say if factory managers find that they are not in a position to continue their operations. I cite areas such as Bendigo, Bayswater, and a couple of centres in non-metropolitan New South Wales which would see their operations perhaps in jeopardy-not tomorrow, but within the next two or three years as they phase down. If companies close, there will be effects on employment. In other areas it would be no longer economic to conduct certain activities, and this affects the whole basis of fixed costs. So this will have an effect spreading further than just the States of New South Wales and Victoria and into South Australia. So Ministers from those States, I believe should be aware of the consequences. </PARA>
<PARA> It is fashionable within our party at the moment to preach the free trade ethic. Unfortunately, it has such a stranglehold and it is running so fast that we have lost sight of some of our basic tenets. We have lost sight of the need to provide a measure of protection and support across the nation. I regret this new-found fad. I believe it is not in the interests of our country to follow this free trade ethic. The attitude of these theoretical economists who probably base their theories on an island economy such as Hong Kong is not applicable to this twentieth century when we are concerned about people. Some of us have criticised the IAC for not taking the social consequences of its decisions into account. I maintain here today that we are not taking the social consequences; we are merely taking economic decisions, and not all those economic decisions will be of great help to people. If a person has been unemployed as a result of government attitude, he knows what it is like. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that in setting some of these bounty rates we have underestimated the value that the bounty will require. In other areas I can see industry coming back to government and if it continues to take this intransigent attitude of not listening and not caring, or not taking into account the social consequences, then I believe that we are in trouble. I believe that our Cabinet should have the moral fibre to honour its election undertakings to the full in this area. In other areas I can see industry coming back to government. If it continues to take this intransigent attitude of not listening, not caring, or not taking into account the social consequences, then I believe we are in trouble.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not without some symbolic significance that now, at last, we come back to the Freedom of Information Bill, the last Bill on the last day of the last week of the session. We have exactly minus four minutes available to debate it if the Senate observes its original intention to finish Government Business at 2.15 p.m. in order to enable valedictories to commence. In other words, we have minus four minutes in which to debate the remaining 20-odd clauses of the Bill that have yet to be considered, the 30-odd amendments that have been proposed by the Opposition, and the dozen or so amendments of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) that remain to be considered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government could hardly give a clearer demonstration of the extent of its commitment to this measure. It is about as committed, clearly, to freedom of information as the Politburo of the Soviet Union is committed to freedom of speech. This must now be a derisory exercise. I am very conscious indeed that every minute that is taken now on this debate will detract from the time available which all honourable senators in this chamber want to spend on farewelling their departing colleagues. The only reason we are going through this derisory exercise at all is that the Government knows that if the Bill is left to be dealt with in the Senate after next July it will emerge a very different proposition indeed from what it is at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the time now available-I imagine that realistically we can spend only about 20 minutes on the whole exercise-there is necessarily a ritualistic quality to the remainder of this debate. We all know what will be accepted and what will be rejected by the Government. We know that there will be no spontaneity, no fireworks, no unexpected happenings. The Opposition will co-operate in expediting the passage of the Bill in the last few minutes available to it, only because it believes that on balance the measure will emerge as a better proposition than having no Bill at all. However, at the outset we register our deep unhappiness at the way in which our rather carefully thought-out amendments, which were based on a Senate Standing committee's report, have been treated. </PARA>
<PARA> To do my last little bit of arithmetic, which I know irritates the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) so much, I calculate that at the end of this 20-minute period, after we have played out the rituals laid down for us, the result will have been that of the 80 amendments moved by the Opposition just 30 will have been accepted in whole or significant part by the Government, leaving the great majority, some 60 per cent, not accepted in any shape or form. Although we still have something better than what we started with we still have nothing that amounts to effective freedom of information legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that, technically, we have before the Committee at the moment the amendments that I have moved, to constitute a new Part IVB of the Bill, in relation to the position of the Ombudsman. I understand, following consultations with everybody, that it would expedite the completion of this debate if I were now to seek leave to withdraw, for the moment anyway, the amendments presently before the Committee. We will then return to a consideration of the Bill as a whole and thereafter three successive blocks of amendments will be moved. The first, which will be moved by the Attorney-the dozen or so amendments that currently stand in his name-are accepted, with one or two reservations, by the Opposition. I will then move, on behalf of the Opposition, three amendments which I understand will be accepted by the Government. Then I will move, as a third block of propositions, the remaining quite substantial list of amendments. I will move them together and will speak to them as briefly as time will demand. It is understood that at this late stage the Government is unlikely to accept those amendments, and on that block, if the Attorney persists in his present attitude, there will be a division. I formally seek leave to withdraw the amendments presently before the Committee and I suggest that the course of action which I have outlined be followed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of all of us on this side of the chamber I indicate that we have no quarrel at all with any of those proposed amendments, except those two clauses 23 and 58. Some of the other matters are essentially propositions which were suggested initially by the Opposition but which have been redrafted by the Government, some as recently as this morning; others of them amount in one way or another to improvements to the Bill. There is a remaining problem of a very significant kind in relation to clause 23-the catch-22 provision. Senator Mason will be articulating the basis of the Opposition's concern in relation to that clause.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other matter that gives us ground for expressing concern in clause 58 which sets out the contents of annual reports for the future and which very largely embodies the proposal put forward by the Opposition. However, it omits one vital component of the proposed annual reports which we have put very strongly ought to be included on this list. That is proposed new item (xi) on the list which requires the giving of particulars of the total number of administrative man-hours spent during the year dealing with requests when received. Regrettably I understand that the Government is not going to accept that. We simply put on record our concern and disappointment that that is so. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to address my remarks primarily to clause 23, as Senator Evans said. I agree with Senator Evans that this unsatisfactory Freedom of Information Bill is now passing through its final Committee stage not with a bang but with a whimper, and that is entirely appropriate. The Australian Democrats reject it as anything but a cosmetic window-dressing operation devised to place almost every conceivable obstacle in the way of anyone seeking information on the activities of government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Even though the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) has tinkered to some extent with clause 23 (2), I still think it preserves the spirit of the original clause in toto, that spirit being that an official can refuse to grant access to documents without having searched for or identified any of them if the nature of the documents as described in the request is such that they would be exempt. I suggest to honourable senators that this is a quite outrageous proposition and remains so in the amended sub-clause (2) that honourable senators have before them. It implies an omniscient capacity on the part of the agency that it is able to recall that all parts of a perhaps complex series of documents are exempt without having to search for them or even identify them. Granted the huge areas of exemption contained in the Bill as it now stands, this truly does add a catch-22 situation for the unfortunate applicant. </PARA>
<PARA> The nature of the documents described in the requests will frequently be vague. After all, the applicant is supposed to be seeking information, not giving it. He is like a man in a maze seeking guidance. We propose to confront him with a decision from the oracle in these terms: 'I am not quite sure what you want. It is probably impossible to know what you want until we have a look at what exists. But on my judgment what you probably want is certainly totally exempted material. Therefore, not only can you not have it but we don't propose to assist you even to the extent of trying to find out what it is'. If anything demonstrates the Kafkaesque qualities of this Bill which permeate it from end to end and a determination at all costs not to do the things it says it will, it is this clause and this sub-clause of the Bill. Moreover, it is a square-one situation which is well calculated to confuse, distress and confound the applicant right at the beginning of his or her inquiry. It also has the convenient quality of being unprovable and unappealable. No one, including the applicant, could know just what the truth was in any situation involving it. I must take it from the Government's attitude that this is precisely what it is looking for in the Bill. That is what it is all about. If honourable senators want to improve this Bill at some future time to give it a faint semblance of sincerity I urge them to look again at this ridiculous, cynical and dishonest clause. </PARA>

<PARA>These amendments represent all the remaining amendments on the list circulated to honourable senators, with the exception of the following amendment numbers which I mention for the record and which we are not now perservering with. They are amendment Nos 51, 52, 61, 63, 64, 66, 69 and 70. Each of those amendments are essentially matters that were consequential upon our earlier proposed clauses which, unfortunately, have been defeated in earlier votes in this chamber. Because I am extremely conscious of the time constraints, very briefly I say that the amendments I have just moved fall into three broad categories. The first category goes to the role and functions of the Commonwealth Ombudsman. The second class of amendments concerns the matter of costs of Tribunal proceedings. Those in the third group-there are some other smaller matters as well-are all aimed at the Schedule. I wish to say a quick word or two on each of those propositions. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the Ombudsman, these amendments are an absolutely central part of the Opposition's approach to this legislation and, indeed, are based on the recommendations of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. Under the existing Ombudsman Act and the modification proposed to it, which was adopted earlier this afternoon, the Ombudsman will have in respect of freedom of information his ordinary functions of investigation, conciliation and report. It is probable that this will be a very useful function in respect of freedom of information. The Senate Committee's recommendations which are now embodied in this first group of proposed amendments go much further than that. They contemplate a significantly expanded role for the Ombudsman, a central role in the actual on-the-ground practical administration of the whole Act. There are five elements in these proposals. Briefly, they are as follows: in the first place--</PARA>

The third element in the proposed equation is the giving to the Ombudsman of a role as general counsel for applicants appearing on their behalf before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The fourth element in the equation gives the Ombudsman a specific role as adviser to departments and agencies to assist them in working out the scope and extent of their obligations under the Bill. The fifth and last element in the proposal gives to the Ombudsman a specific power to monitor and criticise the way in which the legislation is operating and to report to the Parliament. The whole range of functions, both executive and legislative, that I have outlined is not able to be conducted by him, as at present. It is our belief that they ought to be.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I did have something which I proposed to say on the resource question in the Ombudsman's office which seems to be the basic reason for the Government's resistance to this. Taking into account the concern of other honourable senators-I am not worried about Senator Walters in this respect-I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a short paper on the administrative implications of the freedom of information legislation for the Ombudsman. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>ADMINISTRATIVE IMPLICATIONS OF FOI FOR THE OMBUDSMAN</PARA>
<PARA> One way of approaching the issue is to calculate roughly the cost of handling complaints. For instance, in the year ended 30 June 1980 2,544 written complaints were resolved; the expenditure of the office was roughly $1,214,000. Consequently, the average cost of resolving a written complaint was $477. (This figure is an approximation, as it includes roughly 700 complaints in which there was no investigation (out of jurisdiction etc), but does not include roughly 3,000 oral complaints resolved in the same period, nor the many thousand other oral and personal enquiries.) By contrast, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal resolved 248 cases in the same period, and its expenditure was $592,000. That is, the average cost of an AAT hearing was $2,387, or five times the cost of an Ombudsman investigation. </PARA>
<PARA> The impact of FOI can also be analysed in terms of the working methods of the office. The normal procedure with written complaints is to write to departments, obtain their comments, analyse these, go to both the complainant and the department for further comments, and so the process goes on. Because the complaints often raise novel issues, there is little streamlining in the complaint handling procedure, for instance by resort to standard letters on a word processor. (Though some streamlining does occur for instance, many investigation officers are specialists in particular areas, and routine complaints like delay in the issue of a tax assessment can often be handled over the telephone.) By contrast, FOI complaints should be easier to handle. The issue in each complaint is likely to be clearly defined; investigations are unlikely to be prolonged, and will likely be determined after comments have initially been received from a department and perhaps their records have been inspected; a body of relevant principles will be built up by the Ombudsman's office and by the AAT; and it should be possible to allocate all such complaints to a couple of officers, including a Deputy Ombudsman who is designated to handle FOI complaints. Moreover, in the handling of other complaints an inordinate amount of time can be taken up in soliciting the views of complainants and analysing these (since they often have first hand knowledge of the issue), and in preparing a section 15 report to a department and undertaking all the preliminary investigation that must precede this. Neither of these factors is likely to figure largely in investigation of FOI complaints. On the one hand, people seeking access to documents will not have first hand knowledge of the contents of those documents, and it would not be necessary to solicit their views on a continuing basis. Further, I think it unlikely that many section 15 reports would be prepared in this area: as soon as it was clear that a department refused to disclose, one assumes that the complainant would be advised to lodge an appeal with the AAT or the Ombudsman might choose to do this himself. Another factor that will affect the ease and speed of investigations is that, by the time a person complains to the Ombudsman, they will in most cases have already sought an internal review of an agency's refusal to disclose. Thus, the point in dispute will already have been clarified, an agency will have examined the issue twice, and on two occasions the agency will have given to the complainant a reasoned statement of the refusal to disclose. Consequently, there is little orignal analysis or research to be undertaken at the time the Ombudsman commences investigation. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary the following points can be made. First, Ombudsman investigations are relatively cheap, by comparison at least with other mechanisms for resolving grievances. Secondly, investigation of FOI complaints should be relatively simple, and certainly easier in general than the investigation of other complaints presently handled by the Ombudsman. Thirdly, the Commonwealth Ombudsman's office is, at least on world standards, relatively efficient-to quote the Ombudsman from page 58 of his Third Annual Report:</PARA>
<PARA> 'I am in no doubt, following my visit overseas last year to various Ombudsmen's offices, that no Ombudsman's office copes with a comparable volume of work with fewer staff, some have appreciably more and none have the additional, but essential, staffing handicap for a federal Ombudsman of maintaining branch offices in the States.'</PARA>
<PARA> Lastly, it seems certain that an increase in the Ombudsman's present staff ceiling would be needed to cope with FOI complaints, however there appears to be a generally accepted practice of increasing his ceiling in line with his work load. At a very rough guess perhaps two or three extra positions on top of the existing 45 would be needed to handle the FOI work load. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will deal with the remaining matters dealt with by these amendments in a sentence each. The first one concerns costs before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. It is not unprecedented now for costs to be able to be awarded, we believe for reasons that are amply set out in the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs report. The Tribunal ought to have a discretion to recommend costs for successful applicants so that it will be a reality and the departments will not simply exercise the muscle they can to stop matters being properly determined.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The final matter-I am trying now to summarise in one sentence the product of something like seven amendments and about 100 different line items in the Schedules, Parts I and II-is that the Opposition basically opposes all the Schedule items which list a whole series of agencies and classes of documents which are to be absolutely exempt from the operation of the Bill. They concern not only security agencies and other sensitive areas of this kind but areas of commercial competitive concern. We do not believe, again for reasons articulated in the report, that there is any justification for blanket exemptions of agencies and documents to the extent that is involved in that Schedule. I refer any honourable senator who is interested in a rather more reasoned approach to the explanation of these amendments than I am able to give in the time available, to the relevant sections of that report. I move for the adoption of those amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take the time of the Senate only to say that the passage of this Bill stands in very large measure as a tribute to the amount of work, dedication and attention to this legislation given by the Attorney-General (Senator Durack). Members of the Government parties are aware, as I think all honourable senators are aware, that the Attorney has taken this legislation through a prolonged procedure with his own colleagues and, in some areas, with members of the Opposition. I do not seek to detract from the amount of work done by any honourable senator in this place. I simply say that the amount of time and effort devoted to this legislation by Senator Durack and Mr Lindsay Curtis of his Department is extraordinary. The Bill is the better for that attention. People who eventually will find the Freedom of Information Act to be of great value to them will be permanently in the debt of the Attorney-General as honourable senators on this side of the chamber certainly are.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> That the Senate do now adjourn. </PARA>
<PARA>I take this opportunity to say a few words in regard to 12 of our colleagues who are retiring from the Senate at the end of this month. It is, in one sense, a pleasing opportunity, but it is tinged with sadness. It is pleasing because of the associations and friendships that we have formed with them, and sad, of course, because we are seeing them leave us. They are 12 in number-12 good men and true. In total they have served 170 years. Their length of service has ranged from 34 years to a little over one year. Two of them have been President of the Senate, three have been Ministers, two have been Whips, and of course all have served in their various ways with dedication and distinction, particularly in our committee system. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator O'Byrne, the father of not only the Senate but also the Parliament, has been with us 34 years. Indeed, somebody has observed that when he came into the Senate neither Senator Neal nor Senator Puplick had even been born. Senator O'Byrne had a distinguished war career, followed by a very long career in the Senate. He was President for nearly two years. Those of us who were here at the time were particularly impressed by the way he presided over us and were grateful for his fairness in that office. </PARA>
<PARA> Senators Cavanagh and Bishop are the next two longest serving senators who are retiring. They have both been here for the same length of time, 19 years. They both came from a distinguished background in the union movement in South Australia and both served as Ministers for three years in the Whitlam Government. I had an association with Senator Bishop for part of that time when I was shadowing him as Postmaster-General. I certainly enjoyed that association, it being my first opportunity of serving on the front bench, and I appreciated the help that he, as Minister, gave me. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Cavanagh, as I said, also served as a Minister in that Government, but the work for which I think he has acquired a reputation and for which he is better known amongst us is his work on Senate committees, particlarly the Standing Orders Committee and the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. It has been a pleasure of mine to serve with him on the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. Although I have never shared the fascinations he seems to have had for Standing Orders and the debates about them, I am sure that he has made a major contribution in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> The next two senators I wish to mention are also bracketed for various reasons. They are Senators Sim and Wheeldon. Both, of course are from my own State of Western Australia; they have both been in the Senate for almost the same length of time; and both of them are very long-standing personal friends of mine. Indeed, I have known Senator Wheeldon longer than I have known anybody else in this chamber. It was in 1947 or 1948 that we first met. I will not go into all the circumstances in which we met. The way in which we can agree and disagree and perhaps occasionally agree again-that is in some respects, I might say, especially in relation to foreign affairs-is a major tribute to the vigorous way in which we approach our political life. Both Senator Sim and Senator Wheeldon have had a major interest in foreign affairs and have made important contributions in this chamber, in the committees of this chamber and, indeed, in the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Davidson has been a member of the Senate for a little longer, I believe, than Senator Sim and Senator Wheeldon. He had a somewhat shaky start but settled down to 16 years continuous service from 1965. Senator Davidson has been a man of many parts in those years. He has been a great committee man-in fact, one of the pioneers of the committee system. The Senate Select Committee on Water Pollution on which he distinguished himself, of course, was one of the notable early select committees of the Senate. He has taken a great interest also in the National Library and has a very distinguished record of service in the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, having been on the executive of that body for a period. </PARA>
<PARA> Then, Mr President, in order of length of service, we come to you. You, Sir, have been our President now for five and a half years. We are all deeply indebted to you for your service in that capacity. You had earlier service in many capacities in the Senate. But it is your work as President that we acknowledge especially. The way in which you have been able to keep us all in order and to solve those little problems that arise from time to time in this chamber by some quiet way which I have never been able to quite understand is remarkable. It has been a most effective method of doing so. We all recognise it. I think the secret is simply that we all recognise what a basic sense of fairness you have in your treatment of all of us. You have been able to control us by that most effective method. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Maunsell has been a member of this Senate for 13 years. He has served for some six or seven of those years as the National Country Party Whip as well as serving on committees of the Senate. He has had a particular interest in matters relating to defence and occasionally has been on the offensive. He has been very effective as the Chairman of Committees over the last 18 months.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator McAuliffe came into the Senate at the same time as I did. He has shown a particular interest in financial matters and that, I have no doubt, befits a former businessman. He has been on committees with a bent in that direction and has contributed to them and in this chamber notably on those matters and, of course, on matters of sport. I think it is, perhaps, a salutary lesson for us to note that he is leaving us to take on a very major position in the sporting world in his major interest of rugby league. </PARA>
<PARA> Next I mention Senator Melzer who has been with us for nearly eight years. That seems to be a very short time. Senator Melzer has always shown a particularly live interest in matters affecting people; she has shown deep human interests. She has always had the interests of people primarily at heart. It is notable that her last contribution today was on a subject that she has been very concerned about. Her contribution demonstrated her concern for people, which I have always noticed. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Puplick has been with us for only a relatively short time-three years. In that period he has shown a remarkable range of interests and a tremendous capacity for work on our committee system and particularly in contributions to debates in this chamber. I am certain that Senator Puplick, who is leaving us for only a temporary period, will rejoin us either here or in another place; he is only just beginning his parliamentary career. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally Senator Neal, who is the shortest serving of our 12 colleagues who are leaving us, has in a short time made a mark because of his particular interests in education and government affairs. I almost said constitutional affairs. He has the distinction of being only the second person, I think, who has asked me a question of the Constitutional Convention. Senator Neal has been a hard working and earnest senator. He is a young man and I am sure that this is not by any means the end of his political career and that we will see him returning either here or in some other parliamentary political role. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, as I said at the beginning, it is a pleasant occasion tinged with sadness. However, I am sure that the friendships that have been made with our 12 retiring colleagues are ones that will endure. I trust that they will enjoy their period of retirement and that we will see them returning here from time to time. I can assure them that they will always be welcomed by their former colleagues. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to associate the Australian Labor Party with the good wishes and tributes to our retiring colleagues that have been put forward by the Attorney-General (Senator Durack). In a very short time we will have lost a considerable amount of talent and experience in this House, if we take into account the 12 people who leave us this month and add to them Ken Wriedt, Glen Sheil and the late John Knight, who left us only recently. As a relative newcomer, I have appreciated the assistance and the knowledge I have received from those who leave today. They are all good parliamentarians, they are all concerned for the welfare of their fellow citizens and they are all concerned for the maintenance of high standards of politics in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the Government side, Gordon Davidson is well known for his contributions to the various parliamentary committees-the Inter-parliamentary Union, the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and the Parliamentary Christian Fellowship. Peter Sim is known to all of us for his goodwill and his carefully considered and, I might say, independent views on foreign affairs. Ron Maunsell is known for his contribution as Whip and Deputy President and for his appreciation of seafood in this place. Chris Puplick is known for his prolific and carefully researched contributions on diverse subjects, and Laurie Neal is known for his quiet, thoughtful and careful contributions, particularly on education and rural affairs. Last, but not least, Mr President, is your own fair, impartial and, if I might say, gentle conduct in your occupancy of the presidency throughout what have sometimes been fairly turbulent times. I know my own somewhat irascible behaviour has at times not made your job easy, but I hope you hold no ill-will for that. We have appreciated your assistance in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> I now mention my own comrades, of whom we all have special memories. Reg Bishop, a former Minister for Repatriation and Postmaster-General, brought to this place the experience of years of activity in the trade union movement, in particular in the Australian Railways Union. As the son of a railway man, I claim some affinity. This experience and this desire for careful and conciliatory industrial relations came through only today in Question Time with his obvious desire to ensure that the differences in the present industrial dispute are settled in a calm, unemotional and non-combative atmosphere. I believe that his quiet and thoughtful contributions will be missed. </PARA>
<PARA> Jim Cavanagh represents in many ways the parliamentarian par excellence. His contribution as a Minister was considerable, but to many of us his unremitting defence of the rights of individual senators, both in this place and in the party room, his determination to ensure that legislation received proper scrutiny and, expecially, that regulations and ordinances did not impinge on civil rights, were great contributions. Many of us sought and still seek Jim's advice on legislative and procedural matters, and we will indeed miss him. </PARA>
<PARA> Ron McAuliffe is a colourful character. He is a fair and good-humoured chairman of our parliamentary caucus. I was first associated with him as Chairman of the Public Accounts Committee when he was a meticulous and very fair Chairman. His ability to defuse a tense situation with a joke, both in this Parliament and especially in the party room, will be sadly missed. As someone said the other night, our loss will be rugby league's gain. </PARA>
<PARA> Jean Melzer came into the Parliament with me. As innocents abroad, she moved and I seconded the adoption of the Address-in-Reply, and neither of us had a clue on what it was all about. She has contributed to this place a deeply felt concern for the disadvantaged in the community and particularly for the rights of women. In her prolific contributions in committee, she was always undaunted by so-called experts who had inflated ideas of their own importance. My association with Jean has led me to admire her determination and her sense of humanitarian concern. I am distressed that she will not be back and by the circumstances which have led to her not coming back, but I hope she will be back eventually. Jean probably knows more about me than is good for me, and I had better leave it at that. </PARA>
<PARA> John Wheeldon, whose ability as a speaker is the envy of everyone in this place, whose encyclopaedic knowledge of foreign affairs and defence has caused me and, I am sure, others much wonder, will also be missed. His vigorous and determined efforts to bring to the attention of this country the injustice and the futility of our Vietnam involvement is the thing for which I first knew him and for which I will always remember him. We wish John Wheeldon well. </PARA>
<PARA> Last, may I come to my friend and comrade Justin O'Byrne who, as many of you know, comes from the same town as I do. Some of you will never forgive him for the fact that I would not be here if it were not for Justin O'Byrne. He had a distinguished war service. He has had a distinguished parliamentary career. In his 35 years of service in this place I suggest that he has been vilified as much as anybody else has been. He has been condemned from the platform and from the soap box, and indeed he has been condemned from the pulpit. He still maintains his support for his beliefs and has never hesitated to take up unpopular causes, no matter what personal difficulties his support for those causes brought about. Some 35 years ago, when Justin O'Byrne was elected to this place, a distinguished conservative member of what I may call the Launceston establishment wrote a letter to the Launceston Examiner. The final words of that letter were, roughly: 'Senator O'Byrne will find that, with his views, Justin is soon just out.' Justin has been here a long time. The gentleman who wrote the letter is no longer with us. Justin will soon be just out, after 35 years of experience, and I personally wish to thank him for his assistance in various aspects over the years. </PARA>
<PARA> We wish all the retiring members well in their retirement. We hope they have a long retirement. We hope that those who wish to come back will return. On behalf of the Labor Party, I wish you all well. I hope that you do not forget us and that you use your abilities to get back here and see us or to bail us up as we come through your various cities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, what a pleasant place this is now that the dust of earlier today has settled. I want, briefly, to endorse the remarks of the previous two speakers and to add my own thoughts and those of my party, the National Country Party, on this occasion when we are losing a number of significant people from this chamber. Jean Melzer and the men who are going out have contributed a great deal to this chamber over many years, cumulatively and individually. They have served long terms in this Parliament. They represent, I am sure, a real cross-section of the community that they serve. Indeed, they represent a cross-section of this Parliament; perhaps the upper end of this Parliament. They will be a loss to us and a gain to the community and societies to which they return.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Very briefly let me say just a word about them as individuals. Justin O'Byrne is remarkable from many points of view. He was a fighter pilot, a prisoner-of-war, and a very distinguished ex-President of the Senate. As our leader said, he has been longer in this chamber than Senators Neal and Puplick have been on this planet, and that is a very significant achievement. Reg Bishop is an ex-Minister and a delightful companion with whom on one occasion I had the privilege to move around South East Asia and Korea. I found him not only a friend but also a great help in those circumstances. Jim Cavanagh is a strong South Australian like Reg Bishop. When I first came here very briefly 10 years or so ago I though Jim Cavanagh was a forbidding looking gentleman; but, as time goes by I find it is really only a mask, it is not true. He is not really a forbidding character but he is indeed the possessor of a fine mind. His capacity to analyse problems is sometimes, I find, rather amusingly a problem to those who are specifically qualified to do that sort of thing. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to John Wheeldon. I have enjoyed, as indeed all of us must have enjoyed, his great capacity to speak. We recognise his knowledge, appreciation and perspective of history. We are losing in John Wheeldon a great promoter of whatever it is he promotes from time to time. We are lucky to have been associated with Ron McAuliffe. He has been robust in delivery and in material in debate. I am sure that he will be missed here, but people in Queensland will be glad to have his putting more time into rugby league, something Tony Mulvihill is pretty worried about down south. I had the opportunity of attending a conference in Mauritius a few years ago with Jean Melzer. Jean established herself there, as she has in this chamber, as a very sincere and creditable performer-a good Australian. I believe Gordon Davidson has been an impeccable senator on almost any grounds-the voice, the manner, the clothing, the man. My friend Senator Sim-Mr Foreign Affairs and Defence-is a man of beetling brow and apparent anger, but he is not really that bad at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, you are indeed a gentleman, and we are fortunate to have had you in authority over these years. You are, besides being a distinguished parliamentarian, a miller, a producer of wines and, indeed, a connoisseur. From many points of view you are a legend in your own time. Senator Chris Puplick has a youthful enthusiasm such as I have never seen before and a capacity to express it such as I have never heard before. We are sure that Chris will be back, and it will be a pleasure to welcome him back. In my own corner I refer to my very distinguished friend Senator Ron Maunsell. Ron told me virtually everything I know about this place; I expect honourable senators are about to say 'Well, that's not much', and that is probably true. But I must say it is not his fault. Ron has what I would describe as a marvellous nose for what is going on. If he does not know, well, it certainly has not happened, and if he has not heard of it, it probably never will happen. Ron Maunsell has gone from fighter pilot to bulldozer operator and has been a distinguished and long-serving senator. We are sorry to see him leave us. Finally I refer to my friend Senator Neal. Laurie has been here too short a time but it has been time enough for us to recognise his qualities, his sincerity and his capacity. I think for an ex-lecturer in political science to come into this chamber and to see all the pages of his textbooks really shredded is quite an achievement; it takes a lot of courage to do that sort of thing. I asked Laurie a few weeks ago to act more or less as host to our new senator from Queensland, Senator Florence Bjelke-Petersen. He has done that job extremely well, althought I get the impression that conversationally he has not had to contribute very much. Finally, I give a thought for my old friend Glen Shiel who is not here now but whose presence in many senses will be missed in this chamber and particularly even more so on the tennis court when the Senate is battling with the House of Representatives. So, Mr President, it is with those very brief thoughts that I wish all these retiring senators the very best of health and good fortune. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, Senator Durack, Senator Grimes and Senator Scott, I am indeed thankful to you for the eulogies you have directed to me in particular but especially to the retiring senators with whom I have had the great honour of serving over various periods of years. Time will prevent me from reiterating many of the well-deserved tributes that have been paid to the honourable senators who are retiring, but I say on my own behalf that it has been a great privilege and a very rewarding experience for me to have spent half my lifetime in the Senate. It has been rewarding because I have had the honour of serving in two Labor governments from 1947 to 1949 and from 1972 to 1975. That period, as I have said, has given me tremendous pleasure and satisfaction.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The thrust and parry of politics I will miss very much, and I will miss the comradeship that flows right through the whole of the membership of the Senate. There have been times of great trauma and conflict but there have been times of great humour. I think it is that overall scene that has made it such an interesting place. I have found this to be a grand place to get to know and to learn the value of each individual person who comprises the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I pay a tribute to and thank the people of the Labor Party in Tasmania and the electors of Tasmania for paying me the great honour of representing them here over so many years. Now that I am relinquishing the mantle of the father of the Senate to the very capable hands of Senator Douglas McClelland I wish to say how much I appreciate the service that he has given to the Senate too. I might say, incidentally, that the new mother of the Senate is the very distinguished Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, and I welcome her into the motherhood. </PARA>
<PARA> I have seen a great improvement in the Senate in my time. When I first came here Dame Dorothy Tangney was feted and respected very highly. She was joined by Dame Annabelle Rankin in the 1946 to 1949 period. But we have seen in the Senate the number of members of the important side of the community lifted to nine, and I think any honourable senator who spends as much time as I have in the Senate will possibly see at the end of his or her career 50-50 representation of men and women in the Senate. Senator Grimes mentioned that it was said that I would be 'just in' and 'just out'. I was the youngest senator in this place when I was elected, and people would say to me: 'What do you expect to achieve in the Senate. How are things going there?' I would say: 'Well, one ambition I have among many others is to become the oldest senator'. Longevity and survival are among the secrets of parliamentary life and I have been very glad to have served those years. </PARA>
<PARA> People of varying philosophies have been sent here. Underlying our wish to come here has been the desire of us all to serve our country well and faithfully according to our convictions. If I can speak on behalf of the retiring senators I think they in particular have all made a splendid contribution and the country itself is richer for their contribution here. We learn to respect our opponents, and we also get to learn to like them. It is on an occasion such as this that one has the pleasure of recognising and recalling the goodness in men and women in the Senate with whom one has sometimes disagreed, but one also gives credit where credit is due. </PARA>
<PARA> Before I conclude-my time is limited-I would like to pay a tribute to you, Mr President, for the impartial and tolerant way in which you have presided over the Senate, and also to the officers of the Senate for the wonderful help that I have received personally and we all have received from them over the years. I pay tribute also to those devoted and dedicated people who have reported our speeches and made many of our speeches; some of my best speeches have been made by the Hansard reporters. I thank also the people who serve us so well in the Library, the attendants, the wonderful people who put up with us in the dining room and in the refreshment room, the Australian Broadcasting Commission staff who look after the presentation of our speeches and our image to the people outside, the transport drivers who have taken us to and from this place with great dedication, and the officers of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and the Inter-Parliamentary Union. I thank them personally for the wonderful, devoted service that they have given, not only to me but also to the institution of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish those who are retiring good health and happiness in the future. To those who remain in the Senate I say that the future is in their hands. Having seen the tremendous changes that have taken place in my lifetime-indeed we suffer from future shock; the scientists have got ahead of the humans-so many adjustments will have to be made that the future will have to be very delicately handled. I am sure it will be in very good hands. I say farewell to you and I thank you all for the friendship and the comradeship that I have enjoyed over the many years of my incumbency as a senator for Tasmania. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, Senator Durack, Senator Grimes and Senator Scott, like all of us who are leaving this place today, we are moving in something of a pattern of recollection. I am very grateful for the sentiments which have been expressed today and I would like to add my thanks for the many tokens, gestures, cards and personal references which have been made during these last few days. Public life, like all life, does not end simply because a certain date has been reached. The influence of years and the influence of achievements lives on. As we retire today we hope that any contributions that have been made will have their relationship to the things that will be done in the future. We are very grateful for so much that has been done for us. Senator Justin O'Byrne has outlined some of the friendships that we have with people who are part of this institution. I am glad that he has mentioned the people at the table, the attendants, the car drivers, the people in the dining and refreshment rooms and all others who have helped us in our duties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think especially of the number of Prime Ministers under whom it has been my privilege to serve. I think also of leaders in this place. I recall a series of Presidents and Whips and others who have all been part of one's life, part of one's public affairs and part of one's duties as one endeavours to carry out one's responsibilities as a senator. I had the privilege of being appointed to this place in September 1961 to replace the late Senator Rex Pearson of South Australia. In October 1961 I made my maiden speech. As everybody must surely know by now, it was all about River Murray water, a subject from which I seem to have been unable to escape ever since. In the course of my introductory remarks that day, Mr President, I said this:</PARA>
<PARA> Being a senator is a very great privilege which I value. I trust that . . . I may be able to exercise the appropriate measure of responsibility and serve as a senator should. </PARA>
<PARA>I shall always be grateful to Senator Don Willesee, who followed me that day, who made some very generous and very helpful remarks. I have stood by this line-to serve as a senator should-and it is not for me today to comment on that. Over the years it has been something of a maxim which, among others, has been in my mind as a kind of a guideline and help. When one has had the privilege of being a senator for this length of time there are a great number of activities with which one has been involved, and it would take too long to turn to them today. </PARA>
<PARA> There are three or four areas to which I would, if I may, like to refer. I want especially to refer to the Parliamentary Library because I have had the privilege of being a member of the Library Committee ever since I was appointed to the Senate. I recall the contributions of men like Sir Harold White, Alan Fleming, Leslie Moore and Harold Weir. I refer also to the way the Library has developed over the years and how it has upgraded its program, including the establishment of the Legislative Research Service. I pay my tribute to all those people who work sometimes under very difficult circumstances and who have been so good and have rendered assistance so many times. </PARA>
<PARA> The Attorney-General (Senator Durack) mentioned the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. That has been one of my interests, one of my pleasures and one of the areas in which I have had the opportunity to extend myself. Apart from that I want to pay tribute to men like John Ferguson and Alistair MacDonald. They are the flag carriers for this very important international and historic organisation which is involved in a great range of Commonwealth areas of importance and significance politically and in terms of parliament. I want to thank the Senate today for the very great privilege it bestowed upon me in electing me to be its representative on the Council of the National Library of Australia. This has been of the greatest personal pleasure and satisfaction. Since 1973 I have been a member and, if I may presume to say so, since 1976 I have been its Deputy Chairman. I had the privilege of presiding over the Commonwealth Immigration Advisory Council for six years, at a time when there was an extensive integration program going on and it had an involvement in Australia's population development. I have also been associated with the Parliamentary Christian Fellowship, to which reference has already been made. Reference was also made to its meaning to those who belong. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to thank you, sir, and your predecessors for the experience of being one of your Temporary Chairmen. Reference has been made to this already today. It is a very great privilege, if I may put it this way, to represent you or the Chairman of Committees and to preside, from time to time, over the deliberations of the chamber. This leads me to make special reference to you, Mr President, because you are not only my fellow South Australian, not only are you my colleague in public and political circles in South Australia, but also you are a man of great distinction. As others have said before me today, you have presided over our assemblies with a grace, courtesy and impartiality that we shall long remember. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the Senate committees are concerned, I mentioned them often and as late as yesterday. I have only to reiterate here my appreciation of their value and my counsel to the Senate is that it look after the Senate committee system because I believe that system is going to be one of the greatest strengths of this important house of parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> So, Sir, we take our leave, with a rich recollection of the Parliament and all that it represents. I trust that the Australian national Parliament will always preserve the rich fabric of its life and style. Parliament must be the place which gives full play to debate to argument and to comprise, while the tension is such that the sound is strong and definite yet where the final tone represents the blend of the voices of the people. Above all, the high court of Parliament-I use the term advisedly-whether in this chamber or in one of its committees, remains supreme. </PARA>
<PARA> May I take a moment as I close to remember the place where it all began-the Liberal Party in South Australia and the South Australian people who bestowed upon me the privilege of representing them here. May I remember my family home and the community of Strathalbyn in South Australia. There I started my career in public life, believe it or not, 40 years ago. There have been so many influences, so many opportunities. I am indeed profoundly grateful. I think also of what happened later in the Adelaide suburb of Glenelg, with more associates of value, in my own home and of the role played in my public life by my own wife over all these years. I thank her and I thank honourable senators for their references to her. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, the motto of the Davidson clan is sapienter si sincere-wisely if sincerely. On those occasions when I do call it to mind it has been a good guideline to help me to endeavour to remain close to that which I affirmed in this place and on this very spot 20 years ago, and that is to serve as a senator should. God bless you all, and my thanks for all that you have done. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I have a brief few minutes to thank those who have spoken in admiration of me and my work in the Senate. I particularly thank Senator Carrick for his statements yesterday and the letter he personally wrote to me and senator Button for his remarks last evening. Mr President, possibly the most cruel word in the English language is the word 'goodbye'. And now we have reached that stage where we get a few kind words, perhaps a parting glass and a hand that waves adieu, and from your sight I soon shall pass and from your memory too. Over the years I have become endeared to the Senate. When I first came here many remarked: 'If only he had a university education or if only he had studied law what a great man he would be'. I much liked this. I could not have found a nicer way or more diplomatic way of saying: 'You are no good as you are but there are possibilities for you'. But with all my limitations, Mr President, I have done my best through the campaign. If I had a forbidden face-or forbidding face, I think it was-it could well have been contributed to by my period on earth. I have lived through the most depressing time the world has known. I lived through the only two world wars we have experienced. I was a victim of the greatest depression the world has seen and I also suffered as a result of the greatest constitutional crisis Australia has seen. Mr President, we went through all those times and now, as I have said, it is time to say goodbye. I realise I fought politics hard; I was not at all times kind to my opponents in debate. The only thing I can say in conclusion, to use the words of Henry Lawson, is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I was human, only human, and if in days misspent,</PARA>
<PARA> I have injured man or woman, it was done without intent. </PARA>

<PARA> If I said a world unkindly, then I am sorry for it now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I have always believed in short speeches. I have been allotted five minutes but I will not take that long. Somebody said-I am not sure who it was, and I do not even know whether he said it!-words to the effect: Curse my enemies and bless my friends. I hope I leave this place without having to curse anyone and only to bless my friends on both sides of the chamber. I have enjoyed my nearly 17 years in this place; it has been a challenging and interesting experience. I have enjoyed the friendship of many people from all walks of life, but, above all, I mention my political opponents. I will not name them all, but I look across and see perhaps some of my closest friends sitting on the opposite side of the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I particularly enjoyed my long experience, as has been mentioned very kindly and generously by many people, with the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. This has been a concern which I have found tremendously challenging and tremendously interesting and in this, my last speech in the chamber, I pay tribute to those who, over some 10 years, have served on the Committee with me. They have all been my personal friends; their support and loyalty have always been given so freely. I am afraid that some of my present friends-as I look across the chamber I note that Cyril Primmer is not here at the moment, but I link him with Gordon McIntosh and Kerry Sibraa-have been through a tremendous experience over the last fortnight. I think we have had too much to eat-I will stop there-at the many farewells which my friends have been so generous to give me. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank Senator Primmer, the Deputy Chairman of that Committee for many years, for his great loyalty and his great support. I thank Kerry Sibraa who has spoken so generously about me in this place. I do appreciate the generosity of his remarks and support. Above all I mention my little Western Australian Scot, Senator Gordon McIntosh for his support. I look across and I see my old friend Reg Bishop. Reg and I have a pact; we say nothing. So, thank you so much for the generosity you have shown me and for all the friendships. I will miss them, but I shall remember everyone with kindness and generosity. I do not guarantee to listen to you. </PARA>
<PARA> To you, Mr President, may I say that I have enjoyed your long friendship and your continuing generosity. I pay tribute to you for that friendship, that generosity, and the work that you have done as the Presiding Officer in this chamber. You are a man of great impartiality. You are a gentleman in every sense of the word and a man of great tolerance. Perhaps some of us should learn to have the tolerance that you have. To Senator Carrick, to Senator Durack who is a friend of long standing from Western Australia, to my other Western Australian colleagues over many years and my other colleagues on my side of the House, I say thank you for your friendship and your support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, the Acting Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Durack), Senator Grimes, the Acting Leader of the Opposition and Senator Doug Scott, firstly, I say that I appreciate very much the comments which have been made, certainly under very special circumstances. Those who have spoken have had, I suppose, a good relationship with honourable senators on this side of the Senate. In particular may I remark on what Senator Sim has said today. What he has said highlights one of the advantages of the committee system of the Senate. His very brief remarks, and an occasional mistake, remind me of another occasion when Senator Button kept referring to Senator Sim as Senator Slim. The President at the time kept saying to Senator Button, 'You mean Senator Sim, senator', and he said, 'Yes, I said Senator Slim'. Some of the honourable senators in the place who must evoke that sort of comment from me about the advantages of the committee system are Senator Sim and also the ex-President, your predecessor, Mr President, Senator Sir Magnus Cormack.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Two very active conservative Liberal Party supporters in the Senate often disturbed this side of the chamber. If one got them on a committee one found that they were remarkable people in that they tried to reach agreement with the group. As a result of that, if one likes to read the recommendations which those committees made one will find they are remarkable for their unanimity of opinion. That is one of the things which the Senate can continue to do. The other thing, I suggest, is that governments have to be more aware of what the Senate committees recommend. I share with Senator Peter Sim and also with Sir Magnus those great moments in the committee where, although we might have differed, we were able to reach recommendations which were public, which became important, but which unfortunately did not always become the policies of the Government. I think we have to try to see-or those who are here have to-that the Senate performs a duty in that respect in the future. Of course, after 30 June that may happen. There will be a new Senate and a new power in the Senate, and we will be looking at the Senate to see whether it will perform its duties perhaps more than it has done in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> That brings me briefly to the role which most of us have played. I know the South Australians here, as Senator Scott has expressed the point, have always argued that we were strong South Australians, and so we were. We were also strong Australians and we were able to combine the appreciation of the State's performance. Many of us moved motions in support of our State on lots of matters, not only the Murray about which Senator Davidson talks but also about roads, railways and industry. We were able to do that and at the same time remember that the Commonwealth of Australia is a major consideration in this country. The Westminster system did not perform well or at least we did not use the system as well as we might have done. Let us hope that in the future we can reach the objective in a more classical way than we did in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> I share with those honourable senators who have spoken the appreciation of all the people who have supported us-Hansard, the Parliamentary Library, the people who service the place, the attendants, the drivers, the people in the Refreshment Rooms-they have been wonderful-the Senate staff and the parliamentary officers who do all the things for us. They are remarkable for doing all those things. Finally, I just want to say that of course not many people become or are able to become a Minister in a government. As Senator Grimes has said I am an ordinary railwayman who became a trades hall secretary. I never thought that I would become a Minister of the Crown. I was a Minister of the Crown. I worked with people like Lance Barnard, who was the Minister for Defence, and I was his assistant. As Senator Durack has said I was able to do an important job in the Postmaster General's area, which made a remarkable change in communications in Australia. I want to thank firstly my party, for having allowed me to come here. A senator whom honourable senators might remember, Senator Clem Ridley, was the person who first reminded me that it was about time that I moved from the trade union movement to the Senate. So that is how I came into the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Without one's family it is not possible to do anything. I have been in that sort of job for nearly 40 years now and if it were not for our wives and family it would not have been possible to do the sort of things we have done. I wish all honourable senators well and I hope, Mr President, that we can share your hospitality in other areas and that we might be able to taste again that very wonderful beverage that you are going to market in the near future. Thank you, senators, for your thoughts. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Acting Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Durack, the Acting Leader of the Opposition, Senator Grimes, Senator Doug Scott of the National Country Party and honourable senators, many thoughts crowd on my mind this afternoon. I consider myself a most fortunate man to have sought to serve in this place with you all. It has been a magnificent experience with a magnificent body of men and women. I have listened to the tributes you have paid to those good colleagues who are retiring, and I thank you for reference to my own humble efforts. There is something about this place and moments such as this typify the marvellous spirit of which I speak. All I can say is thank you very much to all of you. I am deeply mindful of the splendid co-operation that I have received from my personal staff, the leaders of the parties in this place, the Ministers, the Whips and the members of the Senate as a whole.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I pay warm tribute to the dedicated and tireless services of all personnel within the Department of the Senate, from the Clerks office through the whole gamut of service in the Department. In the service departments of Hansard, Library and Joint House that same degree of splendid service and co-operation has prevailed. The ramifications of service go outside the immediate building to the gardeners, the police force, our transport officers and drivers and so on. I thank them all most heartily. </PARA>
<PARA> I have said before in this chamber that the institution of Parliament-the institution of the Senate-is at all times greater than any member of it. It matters not what we are in the scheme of things here; we are all custodians of the system pro tem, even though some of us have been privileged to be members of parliament for quite a long while. For instance, Senator Justin O'Byrne, my friend, the father of the Senate and the Parliament, has served here for some 35 years, half of the allotted span of three score years and ten. I pay tribute to him for his great service, as I do in like measure to all my retiring colleagues. For the time being and in a long progression we are all incumbents of a system which is basically the Westminster system as it has stood for some 700 years and, in our institution here, since the turn of the century. </PARA>
<PARA> In wise councils of generations of senators we have achieved a great progress in the effectiveness of this chamber. In the past decade magnificent benefits have accrued to the chamber, the parliament, the state and the nation through the development of our committee system. May this place ever respect the past, but build on it to meet the challenges of a progressive society. May it never weaken but ever strengthen the democratic institution. Again may I thank you all for your many kindnesses and wish each of you well indeed for the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I join with my colleagues in thanking for their kind words those who have spoken so well of us. I also thank all those who have been of assistance to me and other senators while we have been members of the Senate. I have shared their experience of fine treatment from the parliamentary staff, the Library and others. The only aspect of parliamentary life in which I have not shared is that which has been referred to by Senator Davidson, that is, the Federal Parliamentary Christian Fellowship. I must confess that so far I have not attended any of its gatherings, and indeed after today it will be too late in any case. Many of us who for conscientious or other reasons felt that we were unable to join that organisation heard about the good times they had together and were envious of them. In fact, His Honour Mr Justice Murphy, while a member of this Senate, and I engaged in a quite serious endeavour to establish a Federal parliamentary fellowship of atheists, agnostics, Jews and scientologists to cater for those of us who felt excluded.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When I first came into the Parliament, like most of us I suppose, being human, I used to achieve a certain small measure of ecstasy at seeing my photograph in a newspaper, even if the story which appeared alongside it consisted of a garbled account of something I had said or an allegation that I had been at a secret meeting plotting the overthrow of the leadership of the Labor Party when I had been in a different city from that in which the meeting took place. In fact, one often achieved a certain thrill at seeing one's face on a television screen while one was being asked silly questions by a disc jockey with ideas above his station. But as the years pass the charm of that tends to wear off. I remember that at the height of one great controversy, when I think I was being accused of being an agent of the Chinese Communist Party-which some suggest I still am-a near neighbour, a prominent businessman, asked me whether I could take up some matter with Sir Charles Court because he knew that I was a Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly and would undoubtedly have great influence on him. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I think one should stay in the Parliament only if one feels either that one is accomplishing something of very great significance, or is about to accomplish something of very great significance, or if one is in a position to struggle better inside the Parliament than outside the Parliament for some cause in which one believes. In my own case, I do not feel that any of those three things apply and I intend to undertake activities elsewhere. However, this is not because I do not believe in and respect the institution of Parliament. Whatever faults it may have, whatever misfortunes we may have experienced, I do not believe there is any better system of government anywhere in the world than the parliamentary system of a freely elected democratic parliament in which the members are representatives of the people who elect them. </PARA>
<PARA> Certain things have happened recently and I do not want to discuss again the merits of the matter that happened in 1975, which rightly or wrongly have caused a number of Australians to have some doubts about the efficacy of the parliamentary system. Some of the attacks on Parliament-very minor ones compared with what has happened in other parts of the world-I think are a result of what happened at that time. I do not think that those of us on this side of the House or anybody else should belabour those matters but should endeavour to see that respect for Parliament is restored. For as long as there are gerrymandered electorates, for as long as there is violent personal abuse and constant criticism of the bona fides of people with whom one politically disagrees, I do not believe that there will be respect for Parliament. With only a very small number of parliamentary democracies throughout the world, I think that this would be a most serious matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I have tended to be more interested, I suppose, in foreign affairs than in other matters since I have been in this Parliament, and this has been so because I believe that an interest in foreign affairs is not something which should be just a side issue. We cannot have a successful domestic policy unless we have a successful foreign policy. Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Norway and Holland were all admirable countries in the 1930s, in many respects leading the world in social reforms and a long way ahead of where most of the world is now. It did them no good when they were conquered by nazism, and I believe that, however excellent our policies may be on social welfare finance, agriculture or anything else if our country is under serious threat from some other source then it is all to no avail whatsoever. </PARA>
<PARA> I spent the first half of my period in the Parliament-a period of eight years-involved in the struggle about the participation in the Vietnam war. I took that position because I was opposed to anybody's imperialism, to anybody invading another country, and I believed that the Americans had no business inside Vietnam. At that time, and at the time when I first became interested in politics, one tends to forget, I suppose, that a very large part of the world was still in Western colonialist hands. Even countries such as India, which is now a mighty country, were part of the British Empire. Most of Africa, large parts of Asia, and the Caribbean were foreign colonies. This is no longer the case. I believe that the menace now comes from another area. I believe that there is a foreign power which has shown by its actions that it is a colonialist power, that it is determined upon the destruction of the institutions which are represented by this Parliament. I think that this calls for solidarity among democratic countries throughout the world. </PARA>
<PARA> So far as detente is concerned, insofar as it means that there is a relaxation of military tensions I believe it is desirable, but I think that a number of Western leaders have had a mistaken approach to this matter. They should have noted what Mr Brezhnev has said-that military tension should be coupled with a continuation of the ideological struggle. If one continues the ideological struggle then one is doing only what Mr Brezhnev has invited us to do. If I may comment on one passing side issue which may give us an opportunity to do that sort of thing, I notice that a delegation of the World Council of Churches will shortly be visiting Australia. Even the most fervent admirer of the World Council of Churches would acknowledge it is much more of a political than an ecclesiastical organisation. One of its members is a clerical gentleman from East Germany-the German Democratic Republic-who is coming to this country to inquire into Aborigines. I do not think that one needs to be either malicious or psychic to know precisely what sort of report he will be bringing down. I do not believe that he should not be allowed to come here. I think that people like that should be welcomed, but I believe that when he does come here he ought to be asked questions. If he is so interested in civil liberties in this country, he ought to be asked what he has done about the rights of Uniat Catholics, the rights of Jews, the rights of Baptists, the rights of Lutherans within the Soviet Union, why it is that he has a wall around his country which nobody is allowed to leap, why it is that within his country and other associated countries political parties such as the fraternal parties of the Australian Labor Party are illegal. </PARA>
<PARA> These are the great issues which confront this country, and I do not mention them lightly. I believe that the appropriate place for them to be dealt with is in a Parliament such as this. I believe that there are people in this Parliament who are capable of dealing with them, and I wish them well in the future. </PARA>

I also thank the two leaders who spoke earlier in the week and the many friends in this place who have delivered their kind wishes personally. My time is limited, so I will confine myself to speaking about what I regard as the most important thing I have experienced in this place, and that is the many friendships I have made not only on both sides of the House but also among the people who are associated with the Senate. I refer to the staff Justin O'Byrne mentioned-the staff of the Parliamentary Refreshment Rooms, the drivers, the Clerks, every one of them. They have always been helpful and willing to do what they can to make life here as pleasant as possible, despite the circumstances that long hours and heavy debates have brought upon us from time to time. I will certainly remember the many kindnesses extended to me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That goes even a little further than has been mentioned here. I have made many friends in the Press Gallery. Whilst they have not always been helpful-my friend John Wheeldon has mentioned a few instances-I have certainly made some friends among them. When I come back to this place again and see you all working long hours and getting very serious at different times in debate about different matters I will be able to sit on the sidelines with my other colleagues and say: 'I still have many friends here and it is always a pleasure to come back and see them'. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the Senate will continue its role as a House of Review, not as a States' House. It has only operated as a States' House when the South Australians, the Tasmanians or even the Queenslanders have raised specific issues, but they have never been in agreement; they have always been against one another. I believe that the Senate has a role to play as a House of review and I believe that it has to improve its review of legislation. I would hope to see the day when the House of government and the House of the people, as I regard the other House, brings down the legislation and this House really puts a fine toothcomb through it so that the legislation which results is to the benefit of this nation. </PARA>
<PARA> I thank everyone here for the great friendship I have experienced over the years. It is one of the things that I will miss. If anyone here gets a bit tired of the climate in the southern areas and decides to go to that beautiful place called Cairns I will make him welcome. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Having seen the very aggressive curtailment of debate on the Freedom of Information Bill, having heard an expose on the direction in which we should be going in relation to foreign affairs, and having in mind that there are another 18 senators' names on the list of speakers to take part in the debate before the Parliament rises at 4.30 p.m., I say that there may be some merit in what the late Eddie Ward once said to a former Prime Minister, Sir Robert Menzies, when tributes were being made to a deceased comrade. After hearing six or seven speeches he leant across the table and said: 'All I want you to say about me when I'm gone is that he was loved by all'.</PARA></TALK.START>

During my period in the Senate I have made some good friends, and I will cherish those warm friendships for the rest of my life. I value highly the experiences I have gained here. I suppose I share the same inward ambitions or thoughts of all the retiring senators who hope that, as a result of their service in and their contributions to this Parliament, they have made a small scratch on the mirror of time. That is all I hope that I have achieved. By way of final word I wish my colleagues who are also retiring a long, useful and happy retirement. </PARA>

<PARA> I thank my party colleagues in New South Wales. They took a risk with a young 29-year-old Liberal radical. They have supported me, they have worked with and for me. I have had particular support from my general secretary, Greg Bartels, and my State President, David Patten. I hope that they have been satisfied with my performance, and that if they have judged me they have not found me wanting. </PARA>
<PARA> It is an invidious task to try to thank one's own colleagues. I mention a few, but I do not mean to exclude any: You, Mr President, for your courtesy and kindness; Ministers and Whips; Neville Bonner whom I single out because he more than any one signifies the strength and the decency of our political system, who with all the cards stacked against him, but with personal courage and integrity entered a political and parliamentary system that was open enough and free enough to see him today starting his second decade of service here; two South Australians Gordon Davidson and Harold Young who are friends, whose treatment of me is delightfully paternal without ever being paternalistic, two Victorians, Austin Lewis, as good a travelling companion as one could want, and Alan Missen whom I use as a touchstone when I am tempted to stray from the paths of genuine liberalism; my leader, John Carrick, for his advice and guidance; my Whips and old friends Bernie Kilgariff and Andrew Thomas; but perhaps above all my occasional flatmate, former employer, sometime physician and always friend, Peter Baume. Friendship is not capable of verbal expression. It simply is. </PARA>
<PARA> I was not the youngest senator to enter this place, only the second. That in itself is an exceptional honour. I am, however, the youngest to leave it. Like all those who come here, I leave with more undone than done. What I have done I hope has been well done. At least on whales, broadcasting, films, freedom of information, human rights, patents, education and environment, I hope that my intervention has been successful and has been to the real benefit of the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> For Parliament the road ahead is not easy. I understand it was not meant to be. I draw attention to the words of Reinhold Niebuhr:</PARA>
<PARA> The temper and integrity with which the political fight is waged is more important for the health of a society than any particular policy. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope that temper and integrity which do exist here will be maintained. The democracy we have in Australia is not perfect. No scheme designed by man or indeed by woman can be. Compared with the alternatives in this sorry world however it is worth fighting for and certainly still worth dying for. From my side of the chamber I venture to say only this: Solutions lie not in tempering true liberalism with even heavier doses of crude pragmatism but rather in watering down that pragmatism with ever greater doses of true, caring, intelligent liberalism; accepting the principle of compromise but rejecting the compromise of principle; accepting that like Christianity liberalism has not failed, it has simply never really been tried. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by paying tribute to the unsung heroines of this place-our wives. I was married after I became a senator. To that extent I have not had a conventional married life; I have never had the full degree of personal privacy--</PARA>

I have never had the degree of personal privacy enjoyed by other Australians; I have never been free of the telephone or the strains of public life. Let me simply say that in such circumstances one manages to stay sane and human, one can be an effective parliamentarian and an effective servant of the public only if one is supported by an exceptional woman whose love and understanding seem without limit. I have been more than fortunate. Of all the things that have blessed me during my life, the greatest is to have had a partner Francesca to whom, on the public record, I pay, without embarrassment or shame, my tribute and express my reciprocal love and gratitude. So thank you honourable senators. When you re-assemble on 18 August for the Budget I will lift my glass to you all from a hotel balcony in Rome, and you will know that some little part of me will be here.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I feel at a complete loss now. I knew that what I needed all this time was a good woman at home. Perhaps if I had had a woman at home I would not have been leaving at this stage in my career. I learnt early that there was a lot more to politics than just this place and I learnt early-despite what some of my colleagues have said about the fine and fiery debates that have gone on in this place-that it did not really matter what I said in here and that if I stood up and made a speech that Disraeli would have been proud of it would not have won one vote on the other side of this chamber. So I learnt that if one was going to express fine sentiments one ought to express them outside this place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At one stage I was pulled up short by Kathy Martin, I hope my friend, when she said in a debate here 'There's one thing about Senator Melzer-you could set her speeches to music'. I realised what I was doing. It was all fine flowery purple prose, and that was not what this place was about either. But then my colleague from Victoria pulled me up the other night and said that, in his opinion, Melzer tried to solve all the problems with money. I must say that either I was very lacking in the ability to express my opinions or that he, as usual, was not listening properly. I am very well aware that one cannot solve the problems by throwing money around, but I feel very deeply that one can spread the money in quite different directions sometimes from the direction it is being spread at the moment. I looked with Don Grimes the other day at the first speech I ever made here. I realised that much has happened in that seven years. One of the things I said was that I believed the function of government was to protect the weak and the disadvantaged and to foresee future needs and problems. I still believe that very deeply. It is not a matter of just throwing money at problems; it is a matter of governing. In my opinion it is a matter of using the resources of a country for the people of that country. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the groups in the community very close to my heart is the women of Australia. I believe that in many ways Parliament has passed their problems by. This has not always been because parliamentarians are uncaring male chauvinist pigs but because parliaments of Australia in the main are male dominated and are not always in a position to appreciate the problems of women because the members are not women. I think, as I watch parliament progress I will find more women in Parliament. As I travel around Australia I find that the women of Australia are on the move. More and more of them are seeing themselves now as people who can be public people and people who can make decisions. They see themselves as parliamentarians, and once they never ever saw themselves in that role. So I look forward to the day, which I do not think is so far away, when at least half of the senators of Australia will be women. </PARA>
<PARA> I go out of here to find a job. I suspect that I will be back in the position I was 10 years ago, doing the ironing and furiously interjecting on some incompetent senator who is not taking up a matter properly. I can see myself again making magnificent political speeches to the kitchen sink as I listen to what senators are saying. I will remember the people I have met here with a great deal of warmth and pleasure. I will remember my comrades on this side of the House who are, I must say, as close to me as my family is in many respects because of the support, warmth and comradeship that has flowed. But I must say that I have discovered that some honourable senators opposite, who I always imagined had two heads or horns and a tail, underneath are warm, caring human beings. They are a little misguided and take the wrong path at times. Nonetheless, I treasure the friendships that I have made in this place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, Senator Durack, Senator Grimes, Senator Scott, thank you for your kind and generous remarks this afternoon. Mine has been a lightning-like term in the Senate, and I go back to shred textbooks and to rethink a lot of the thoughts that I had before I joined this illustrious institution. Collectively, those who depart today have served almost 170 years. What an immense achievement this is. However, during my time here I have gained an immense experience, a tremendous appreciation of differing human values and experiences, ideals that I will look to in the years ahead. My stay has indeed been short, but while visibility in the chamber, I believe, is the high point of the parliamentary experience, I have gained great satisfaction from working in the committees. The committees have a great bipartisan nature, and I think it is in those areas that the Senate's strength in the years to come will ever increase.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr President, I am mindful of the time. I thank all senators, and especially you for the kindness, generosity and indulgence shown to a newcomer to this place. Whilst my stay has been short, I have gained much. I thank especially my National Country Party colleagues for their help and assistance, and the Liberal senators for their guidance as well. Today is a significant point in the history of the National Party in Victoria. My party has had an unbroken representation in this place since the early 1920s. Victoria has been represented by National Country Party senators since the 1920s when Senator David Andrew joined the Senate in 1925. Today I will be the last National Country Party senator for Victoria to address the Senate. However, let us hope that this will not be for too long and that the party in Victoria will again strive to gain representation in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> I express my thanks especially to the people who made this Senate work; to the parliamentary officers, the attendants, the clerical staff, the drivers, the Library people, Hansard-in fact everyone who works in and around this building. We depend so much on them. I thank the National Party of Victoria for having confidence in me as a young person to represent it and the people of Victoria in this place. It has been a daunting challenge. I hope I have managed to contribute something. I thank also, my family for their trust, guidance and confidence in me. In conclusion, I trust that my fellow senators, those retiring and those continuing, will enjoy very good health-a necessary requisite for duty in this place-and happiness. I think it is from serving the nation that true happiness can be achieved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, at the outset I have been asked by a number of my colleagues to say that, had time allowed, they would have very much liked to place on record their affection for those who are leaving us today. Further, I should say that last night the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Button, advised us that our former colleague, former Senator Pat Kennelly, rang to wish all of his colleagues well.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Sir, at the dinner held by senators last Wednesday week I had the honour as the pro tem father of the Senate, soon to take that mantle from my colleague Justin O'Byrne, of saying farewell to our retiring colleagues. Might I say again, as I said then, that the Parliament is losing 12 great Australians-eleven great men, very fine men, and a lovely, charming lady. Because I am restricted to some minutes, I want to pay a tribute to my three former ministerial colleagues of the Labor Government. I do it in a completely apolitical way and merely because of their humility and modesty. I do so with no slight in any way to you, Sir, as a distinguished President, to my illustrious colleague, Senator O'Byrne, or to all of our other esteemed colleagues who are retiring. You have all given great service to the Parliament and in so doing have brought great credit to yourselves in your service to your party, to the Parliament and to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, I particularly want to place on record my knowledge of what Senator Bishop, Senator Cavanagh and Senator Wheeldon achieved, or set out to achieve, in the short time that they were Ministers of the Crown in the Labor Government. Reg Bishop, Jim Cavanagh and I entered the Parliament together in 1962. We became Ministers in 1972. The three of us have always been very good mates. Amongst other portfolios that Senator Bishop held, he was the Postmaster-General in the Labor Government. Naturally, I, as the Minister for the Media at that time, worked very closely with him. Senator Bishop was responsible for the establishment of Australia Post and Telecom Australia, two very successful and highly profitable public enterprises. Reg Bishop worked with me in the establishment of ethnic broadcasting and public broadcasting in Australia. Between us, we achieved the introduction of frequency modulation broadcasting in Australia. He was able to persuade his Cabinet colleagues at the time to abolish television viewers' and radio listeners' licence fees. </PARA>
<PARA> Jim Cavanagh, like Reg Bishop, is the old trade unionist. He was a most compassionate, warm, human and understanding Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. He had a most sympathetic understanding of underprivilege and deprivation. He worked night and day at that portfolio. As Minister for Police and Customs, he proposed the amalgamation of all Commonwealth police forces. The fact that that has since come about is to Senator Cavanagh's great credit. If I might say so, the late Senator Dame Ivy Wedgwood once described Jim Cavanagh to me as the closest being she has ever seen to Ben Chifley. That is the greatest compliment that can be paid to any Labor man. </PARA>
<PARA> But for Senator Mulvihill and Senator Gietzelt, I have known Senator John Wheeldon longer than I have known anyone else in this chamber. He and I became friends in the mid-1950s when we were both young men in the Labor movement. In the 18 months that he was Minister for Repatriation and Compensation he was a very successful Minister. His proposal for a national compensation scheme was one of the most visionary proposals of the Labor Government. On repatriation matters, he fought keenly for the rights of Australian ex-servicemen, becoming affectionately known by his Cabinet and ministerial colleagues as 'the little digger'. </PARA>
<PARA> All of the senators who are retiring have made great contributions to Australia's political life. All of them have served their country with honour, credit and distinction. The whole nation, particularly those who remain in this Senate, will miss them very much indeed. On behalf of everyone, I wish them good health and a long, enjoyable and satisfying retirement. </PARA>

Also because of the limitations of time it will not be possible to deal with the 12 retiring senators as we would like to do on this occasion. Amongst those 12 honourable senators we have some most distinguished people who have given great service to this Senate chamber and the Parliament and we have the longest serving senator, and also the baby of the Senate, if I might say so when I refer to Senator Puplick. I appreciate very much that many of our colleagues have to catch the aircraft shortly but I do wish to say to those who are retiring: 'Thank you very much for your friendship. Thank you for your contributions. We all trust that you will have a happy and rewarding retirement'.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator Durack</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Science and Technology has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) NEPSC was established in 1978 in accordance with the Commonwealth Government's policy on employee participation. Its functions were to:</PARA>
<PARA> develop and recommend policies appropriate to Government, employers and trade unions, designed to develop a greater understanding of concepts of employee participation and to encourage their implementation;</PARA>
<PARA> identify and develop measures for stimulating action in both the public and private sectors;</PARA>
<PARA> identify and develop guidelines for appropriate training, research and dissemination of specific ideas, information and programs.</PARA>
<PARA>More specifically, the Committee has worked on identifying major barriers to employee participation; publishing information appropriate to organisations interested in developing participative practices; developing means for bringing together key individuals and organisations; and advising the Government on a range of programs.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Committee has performed its functions in a most satisfactory way. Its work has demonstrated the advantages to be gained from a tripartite consensus approach and its impact has been significant.</PARA>
<PARA> Of particular note has been its production of 2 booklets-'Employee Participation: A Broad View' and 'Employee Participation: Ways and Means' as significant joint statements by Government, employers and trade unions in an area where there has previously been little consensus.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The abolition of the Committee is part of a move to rationalise the Government's activities in this field. Accordingly, the activities of the Human Relations Branch, which has prime responsibility for this subject area, are to be reduced and transferred from the Department of Science and Technology to the Department of Industrial Relations. Consideration is being given to having the work of NEPSC handled by a sub-committee of the National Labour Consultative Council.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) As part of the rationalisation program already referred to, a review is to be undertaken by the Public Service Board of the functions of the Human Relations Branch and this will include the work it has carried out in conjunction with NEPSC.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) This will depend on results of the review (see 5 above) and subsequent decisions to be made by the Minister for Industrial Relations in association with NLCC.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) The Human Relations Branch currently responds to a large number of requests from the industrial and commercial community for advice and assistance and acts in concert with the States, as a national clearing house for information in the subject area. While there will be a reduction in these activities, the extent to which they will continue will depend on the decisions taken in respect to the reduced functional areas (see response to question (5) above).</PARA>
<PARA> (8) The disbanding of NEPSC and its possible re-establishment within the NLCC framework will make for an effective and comprehensive approach to the general issue of employer/employee relations. It is difficult to quantify in any precise way the effect of such an arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) Because of its tripartite, consensus approach, NEPSC has made a significant contribution to the development of employee participation in this country. The quality of Government programs and services to the community would suffer without this approach. Accordingly, and as stated above, the intention is to continue to develop this tripartite, consensus approach under the auspices of NLCC.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Industry and Commerce has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) At this stage the Government has decided only to offer the Australian Government Clothing Factory for lease or sale as a going concern. The decision was taken in implementation of the Government's policies of restraining public sector outlays, of placing greater reliance on private industry for the production of stores for the Armed Services, and of not being involved in activities which are capable of being performed adequately by the private sector. Formal registrations of interest are currently being invited for the lease or purchase of the Factory as a going concern. A final decision will not be taken until offers have been evaluated.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Government will be seeking a fair return for the Factory which should reflect not only its assets, but also its performance and capabilities. An independent valuation of the Factory as a going concern is to be obtained and offers received will be examined against that valuation.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) and (4) The Government's decision on whether to lease of sell the Factory, and when any such arrangement should commence, will depend on the offers received and careful evaluation of the details.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) and (6) The Factory currently supplies about 50 percent of the Armed Services' needs for clothing items, the rest being supplied by private industry. There is therefore a good knowledge of existing industry prices. Any new arrangement would require the Factory to continue to be competitive in terms of prices, quality and delivery.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) The main function of the Australian Government Clothing Factory has been to provide a wide range of clothing and accoutrements for defence and other Government customers; this function is already shared with industry. I would not envisage any deterioration in the Factory's services.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) With the modern facilities already in operation at the Factory, private enterprise should be in an excellent position to introduce private sector expertise and further improve output and efficiency.</PARA>

<PARA> (7) The Ordnance Factory Bendigo has for many years provided support to private industry and overseas customers in heavy engineering and fabrication work. The Factory has developed special skills and has proved that it is capable of meeting stringent requirements in precision engineering at competitive prices. I therefore have every confidence that the Factory will continue to provide important services to customers requiring heavy engineering products. Moreover, with the current and potential large-scale mineral development projects, there will be opportunities for a private sector owner to use the Bendigo facilities to greatly expand activity in support of such projects. The factory will also have continuing opportunities to engage in defence work.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) It is expected that a private sector owner should be in an excellent position to make more efficient use of the Factory's currently under-utilized facilities so increasing the efficiency of the factory.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The so called 'Fleming Report' is a compilation of extracts from scientific and other articles which were obtained from Mr John Evans of Melbourne, an adviser to the Vietnam Veterans Association, and which, in his opinion, supported the Association's claims. Subsequent independent evaluation of the compilation indicated that the compilation did not present an adequate up to date and comprehensive coverage of the Scientific literature on the subject. However, copies of the full texts of the reports and articles quoted by Mr John Evans together with a number of other scientific reports have been distributed to Departmental Medical Officers dealing with claims of health effects from contact with toxic chemicals in Vietnam.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The facts are that the Department has been gathering information on the long-term effects of herbicides on human health since well before December 1979 when the herbicides controversy arose in Australia and has been circulating this information thoughout the Repatriation system. My Department seeks to ensure that all relevant scientific evidence is taken into account by Departmental Medical Officers when giving opinions under the terms of section 48 of the Repatriation Act, by providing them with copies of published articles dealing with the possible toxic effects of herbicides and other toxic chemicals. Repatriation Boards and delegates of the Commission are well aware and have been reminded that all of this material is available to them whenever they think it could be relevant to a particular claim.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 5 June 1981 (Hansard, page 886) Senator Douglas McClelland asked me without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is it a fact that, because of the shortage of available repatriation boards in New South Wales, a number of the applications for war widows' pensions that have been lodged in my State have had to be sent to Western Australia for determination? Has this process been holding up consideration of applications for war widows' pensions in New South Wales? Why is it that boards are not available to handle the work in New South Wales? Will the Minister take early action to see that the position is rectified?</PARA>
<PARA> The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> There are delays in the determination of claims by Repatriation Boards in Sydney but these have arisen because of processing problems.</PARA>
<PARA> There are normally four Repatriation Boards operating in New South Wales but a fifth Board has been operating for some time to assist with the backlog of cases. The fifth Board is normally programmed to assist in relief work on other Boards but is being used full time at present to assist with the New South Wales workload. In addition, the Governor-General has recently approved the establishment of three additional Boards throughout Australia for a short term to provide additional resources. Most of these will be applied in New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA> The transmission of cases interstate is a normal procedure and is done not only to assist Boards in the larger States but to supplement the work of the Boards in States such as Western Australia, where the local work level is not sufficient to sustain a full time Board. The transmission of these cases interstate will continue, therefore, even after the present problem is resolved in New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned about delays being encountered in the Repatriation determining system and I have discussed the problem with the Repatriation Commission. The Commission is taking action to improve the workflow, particularly in New South Wales, and will continue to monitor the situation.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Is it the case that more than six months have now elapsed since the Australian Federal Police completed its report on aspects of the activities of Asia Dairy Industries (H.K.) Ltd., the Australian Dairy Corporation and its Chairman, Mr Webster, and forwarded that report to the Minister for Primary Industry?</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Is it the case that that report was subsequently forwarded to the Attorney-General's Department for comment as to the possibility of a prosecution being launched?</PARA>
<PARA> (3) When did the Attorney-General's Department complete its consideration of that report?</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Is there any justification of which the Attorney-General is aware for further police investigations of the kind to which (Mr Nixon) referred yesterday in the House of Representatives to justify his failure to make a promised statement on this matter?</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Finally, will there ever be an 'appropriate time', to use (Mr Nixon's) own words, for the making of a statement and the tabling of documents in this matter?</PARA>
<PARA>The answers to the honourable senator's questions are:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) No. I understand that the Australian Federal Police reported to the Department of Primary Industry the virtual completion of its investigations on the matters to which Senator Evans has referred on 11 March 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes, on 13 March 1981. On 27 April 1981 my Department asked the Australian Federal Police to undertake certain further enquiries in relation to these matters and to provide certain additional material. The additional material requested by my Department was provided on or about 8 May 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) On 22 May 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) I understand that in the last few days the Australian Federal Police advised the Department of Primary Industry that, contrary to Department's earlier belief, there remain aspects of one matter to be investigated. This matter is in the hands of the Police and it is, therefore, a matter for them to determine whether there is any justification for the further investigation they propose to undertake. I think it is proper that a statement on this matter should be deferred until the investigation is complete.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The Minister for Primary Industry has announced that when all investigations have been completed he will make a detailed statement and table relevant papers. I understand that that remains the Minister's intention.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Some employees of financial and other institutions would receive such assistance but the number is not known.</PARA>
<PARA> As far as I am aware no civilian employees directly employed by the Commonwealth Government receive such assistance by virtue of their employee status. However, serving Defence forces personnel are eligible, subject to certain qualifying requirements, to borrow for housing purposes under the Defence Service Homes Scheme at the standard rates of interest applicable to such loans.</PARA>
<PARA> I am advised that employees of three Commonwealth authorities within my portfolio-the Reserve Bank of Australia, Commonwealth Banking Corporation and the Australian Industry Development Corporation-are eligible, subject to certain qualifying requirements, for housing loans at concessional interest rates that are in line with rates charged to bank employees generally for such loans.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator Messner</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The specific basis for duties on kilts and authentic clan tartan fabrics is specified in the Australian Custom Tariff, and is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Scottish kilts are subject to a tariff quota which limits the volume of goods imported at quota rates of duty before additional duty is payable. Tariff quotas were introduced for these goods following Government consideration of the Industries Assistance Commission report of 29 January 1975 titled 'Textiles Authority-Apparel-Section 2'. Accordingly, for certain outer garments including kilts, a ceiling level of 5,558,400 garments may be imported between 1 March 1981 and 31 December 1981 by quota holders at the duty rate of 51.5 per cent. Any goods imported other than by quota holders, or in excess of the ceiling level are dutiable at the rate of 39 per cent and $12 per kilogram.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Woollen fabrics, including authentic clan tartan fabrics, are also subject to a tariff quota which limits the volume of goods imported at quota rates of duty before additional duty is payable, Tariff quotas were introduced for these fabrics following Government consideration of the Industries Assistance Commission report of 19 July 1977 on 'Certain Spun Yarns and Wool Textiles and Other Goods'. For woollen fabrics and wool fabrics containing silk or polyester, a ceiling level of 2,000,000 square metres may be imported between 1 March 1981 and 31 December 1981 at the duty rate of 34 per cent, or, if higher $0.50 per square metre if having a weight exceeding 153 grams per square metre, or 34 per cent for fabric up to and including 153 grams per square metre. For any of these fabrics imported other than by quota holders or in excess of the ceiling level the respective duty rates are 34 per cent plus $2.50 per square metre or, if higher, $3 per square metre for fabrics exceeding 153 grams per square metre or 34 per cent plus $2.50 per square metre for fabrics up to and including 153 grams per square metre.</PARA>
<PARA> On 15 August 1980 the Government announced new assistance arrangements for the textiles clothing and footwear industries following the Industries Assistance Commission's reports of April 1980 on those industries. From 1 January 1982 clothing subject to quota, including kilts, will be dutiable at 50 per cent within quota and new quota arrangements will apply so that a proportion of the quota will be sold by the Government at a premium. Clothing imported outside of quota will attract an additional duty of $15 per garment. Wool fabrics, including authentic clan tartan fabrics, will be dutiable at 50 per cent for two years from 1 January 1982 and 45 per cent thereafter, and be free of quota.</PARA>
<PARA> The duties applicable to imports are fixed by an Act of Parliament and must be levied on all imports unless some legal basis exists which permits an exemption or reduction.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes: tariff quotas which limit imports at quota rates of duty have applied to a wide range of clothing and textiles, including kilts and woollen and worsted fabric for kilts, for some time. These quotas are allocated to importers on the basis of historical import performance during a specified base period, to enable an equitable allocation to be made within the limits determined by the Government. Imports in excess of the levels determined involve the payment of an additional penalty duty.</PARA>
<PARA> However, provision does exist for the relief from the payment of the penalty duty and the 12.5 per cent special additional customs duty in the case of private importations having a value for duty not exceeding $50 which are imported in the one consignment and are not to be used for any commercial purposes.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Australian manufacture of garments, including kilts, and Australian manufacture of woollen and worsted woven fabrics.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The Department of Business and Consumer Affairs recently enquired into the commercial production of Scottish kilts and authentic clan tartan fabrics in Australia and has established that they are available from several local manufacturers.</PARA>
<PARA> Both locally made and imported fabrics are used by kiltmakers. Local producers of authentic clan tartan fabrics have indicated their ability and, subject to receiving orders for reasonable quantities, their willingness to provide any recognised clan tartan fabric within a reasonable period and at a price comparable to that for which similar fabrics may be imported.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Associated General Contractors Insurance Company Limited was not granted an authority under the Insurance Act 1973 and did not breach that Act. A company was authorised under the Act under the name of Palmdale-AGCI Limited which acquired the insurance business of Associated General Contractors Insurance Company Limited. This company subsequently changed its name to Palmdale Insurance Limited under which name it breached the solvency requirements of the Act. This led to the Insurance Commissioner and the Treasurer taking action as prescribed by the Act.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The action taken by the Insurance Commissioner was to request Palmdale Insurance Limited pursuant to section 52 of the Act to show cause why he should not recommend to the Treasurer that an Inspector be appointed in respect of Palmdale Insurance Limited. Following replies from the company the Treasurer appointed an Inspector in respect of the company on 7 August 1979.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Act does not have penalty provisions for breaches of the solvency provisions of the Act. As Palmdale Insurance Limited complied with the directions issued by the Treasurer pursuant to section 62 of the Act and ceased writing insurance business the need did not arise to consider the penalty provisions provided by section 62.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The financial circumstances of parents are not relevant in the case of a severely handicapped child. In cases where the child is substantially handicapped, the parent's circumstances are reviewed annually.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The number of terminations of handicapped child's allowance between 14 June 1980 and 14 December 1980 is estimated to be 1700.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) and (4) Certain statistics of handicapped child's allowance have been collected on a manual basis but they are not considered to be accurate. In particular, reliable statistics showing reason for termination are not currently available. It is expected that comprehensive statistics of grants and terminations of handicapped child's allowance will become available towards the end of 1981 following the introduction of a computer based collection.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Parents are advised of their right to appeal when advised of any adverse decision on entitlements.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The Social Services Act provides that a handicapped child's allowance may be granted in respect of a substantially handicapped child if the Director-General of Social Services is satisfied that the person providing care and attention for the child is, by reason of the provision of that care and attention, subjected to 'severe financial hardship'.</PARA>
<PARA> A person is accepted as being subjected to 'severe financial hardship' if the family's gross weekly income, after deducting expenses associated with the child's disability is less than $210 (increased by $6 for each child in the family after the first).</PARA>
<PARA> The amount of $210 is the sum (rounded to the nearest dollar) of the weighted average minimum weekly award wage payable to adult males for a full week's work (excluding overtime) as at 31 December 1980 ($186.65) and the maximum rate of handicapped child's allowance (616.85), plus $6. This income limit is reviewed each March and September.</PARA>
<PARA> The rate of handicapped child's allowance payable in respect of a substantially handicapped child is the lesser of:</PARA>
<PARA> the difference between the income limit applicable to the family and the family's gross income after deducting the expenses associated with the child's disability;</PARA>
<PARA> the expenses associated with the child's disability; and</PARA>
<PARA> the maximum rate of the allowance ($73 a month)</PARA>
<PARA> While the income limit, expenses for the child and family income are generally expressed as weekly amounts for convenience, they are converted to monthly figures for the assessment and payment of the allowance.</PARA>
<PARA> The criteria for assessing the rate of handicapped child's allowance in these cases have the effect of re-imbursing the family by the amount, up to the maximum rate of the allowance by which the family's income is below the income limit because of the expenses associated with the child's disability.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) Information on the income test in relation to substantially handicapped children is not included in present publications. Arrangements will be made to have information included in future publications.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) In common with other areas of Commonwealth employment, the Trade Commissioner Service is required to operate within an approved staff ceiling which has recently been reduced.

<PARA> (2) Cabinet has approved the opening of a new trade commissioner post.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The post will be established in the southern region of the United States.</PARA>

Many new factories are being built along with related infrastructure and urban development to accommodate the companies and people moving to the region from the northern states. The region has a high level of energy and mineral development. Population of the area is in the vicinity of 54 million and foreign imports amount to more than $46,000m.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Education has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2)-As I said in my statement to the Parliament of 4 June concerning Commonwealth education policy and financial guidelines to the Commonwealth education commissions, the Government, in its efforts to alleviate the problems faced by young people, is concerned to ensure that there is an adequate system of financial support for those undertaking education and training. The Government has under review the payment of unemployment benefits to 16 and 17 year olds. The Government's position is that no adverse changes to unemployment benefit will be made unless better alternatives are available to the young people affected and the Government is satisfied that the interests of low income families and other disadvantaged groups would be protected. We will be giving further consideration to the range of allowances for young people in the Budget context.</PARA>
<PARA> (3)-The Government would not expect additional enrolments of this order in the schools system as a result of its transition policies which make substantial provisions for the technical and further education sector as well as schools. In addition, despite the Government's expressed hopes for greater retention in secondary schools and the enrolment pressures in the non-government sector, we expect that there will be a continued decline in overall school enrolments due to demographic factors. The Government is confident under these circumstances that the schools systems in the States will have the capacity to accommodate increased numbers of students wishing to undertake transition programs which are developing as a result of the Commonwealth's own efforts and those of the States.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) to (4) The Education Program for Infants and Children (EPIC) conducted at the Preston Institute of Technology is one of a number of early intervention programs for handicapped children being assisted with subsidies under the Children's Services Program. The Schonell Education and Research Centre has been contracted to conduct a nationwide evaluation of all early intervention programs, including EPIC. The report on this evaluation project has recently been submitted. Following consideration of this report, and a review of the Children's Services Program which will be completed within the next few weeks, my department will be developing guidelines on the assessment and funding of programs of this type, taking into account the quite complex interaction of State and Commonwealth responsibilities in the area of early intervention programs. The EPIC project was originally approved in 1975 as a three-year pilot program. However, pending resolution of the complex issues involved, I have recently approved an extension of funding under the Children's Services Program until 31 December 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> I consider that money spent on the national advertising campaign for the International Year of Disabled Persons is of great practical value as it seeks to raise community awareness of the needs of the disabled.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Carrick</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Education has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> No joint statement of the kind referred to was issued in November last year. However, in a statement issued by the Minister for Employment and Youth Affairs and myself on 16 January 1981 announcing the Government's review of opportunities for youth, it was noted that Australia has lower retention rates in secondary schools than most other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, and that many early school leavers find it difficult to gain employment.</PARA>
<PARA> We stated the Commonwealth's belief that further efforts are called for by both the Federal and State Governments to improve opportunities for youth and that this should be done in two ways. First, by seeing that the economy grows so that more long term sustainable jobs will become available. Second, by ensuring that government and non-government schools and training institutions provide more suitable courses and training effectively the needs of young Australians who now leave school early and who find it difficult to make the transition from school to work.</PARA>
<PARA> The availability of employment for young people varies from one location to another, as do retention rates in secondary education. That the ACT is a typical in respect of both employment and school retention rates does not affect the fact that early school leavers experience substantially greater problems in the transition to working life than those who continue their education and that further improvement in education and training for young people is possible. If school retention rates in the ACT were lower, it would be reasonable to expect a higher level of youth unemployment than currently is the case.</PARA>
<PARA> As I announced to Parliament on 4 June, the Government is taking special action to increase significantly the resources devoted to transition activities in schools. It wishes to accelerate the development of appropriate transition courses in secondary schools with emphasis on basic changes in curricula relevant particularly to the needs of low achievers. Through these changes the Commonwealth hopes to see more young people who may be 'at risk' in the transition process staying on to complete their secondary education. We are endeavouring to assist the education system to do a better job in serving the needs of all children and in maintaining their interest in formal education. The objective is to improve the basic skills and employment prospects of young people as they leave the education system particularly in the face of a decline in the number of unskilled jobs in the community.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Yes. The unemployment benefit claim form has been subjected to tests which could be described as educational tests. This was a part of a broader program to ensure that the Department of Social Security's forms, leaflets, automated advices and other written communications with clients are as comprehensible as possible.</PARA>
<PARA> One method used by education researchers to establish the educational standard needed to comprehend a written communication is to measure its 'readability'. With the aid of an expert consultant, readability assessment techniques have been adapted to provide some measure of the reading skills required for comprehending the department's client communications.</PARA>
<PARA> Readability testing of sample materials indicated that leaflets required reading skills of up to fourth year of secondary school and a computer advice series up to the final year of secondary school. Insofar as such techniques can be applied to the non-continuous text of forms, the present Unemployment Benefit claim form has an average readability level of around the fourth year of secondary school.</PARA>
<PARA> This form is currently being re-worked for the next re-print and it is expected that it will be possible to devise a form with an average readability level of about the first year of secondary school. The leaflets and the advices now have levels between the last year of primary school and the second year of secondary school.</PARA>
<PARA> I would emphasise there are factors other than readability which effect comprehension of written media, and particularly forms-such as layout, type styles and sizes and use of colour.</PARA>

<PARA> With reference to the pending amendments to tax legislation which will give a substantial and very much welcomed incentive for investment in the Australian film industry. When will that legislation be introdcuced in the Parliament?

<PARA> The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Amendments to give effect to the new concessions for investment in Australian films are contained in the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill 1981 which was introduced in the House of Representatives on 27 May 1981.</PARA>

In his question Senator Hamer asked me whether I could consult with my colleagues about encouraging at least one of our manufacturers to design and produce cars which would be more suitable for our climate and which would not require air conditioning.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Industry and Commerce has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> There are no official statistics collected on the number of new motor vehicles sold with air conditioning equipment fitted nor are statistics available on the after-sale fitment of such units. Accordingly I am not in a position to comment on the extent of installation of air conditioning in new cars or the vehicle population generally.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia's climatic conditions are not unique. Most of the vehicle designs sold in Australia are also sold in countries which experience similar or even wider temperature ranges.</PARA>
<PARA> Provision of air conditioning has become more common under the influence of industrial awards in vehicles purchased primarily for commercial use. As consumers have become more affluent they have been more able, and more prepared, to meet the cost of extra fittings such as air conditioning which would add to the comfort and enjoyment of motoring.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 29 April 1981 (Hansard, page 1454) Senator Young asked me, as the Minister representing the Minister for Transport, a question without notice, concerning proposals to introduce aircraft movement charges for general aviation at major Commonwealth airports.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Transport has provided me with the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The proposal to introduce aircraft movement charges for general aviation at major Commonwealth airports is one of a number of recommendations contained in the report of the General Aviation Study, which was recently released by the Government. The Government has no commitment at this stage to any of its recommendations, and industry has been invited to submit comments on the proposals before they are considered by Government.</PARA>
<PARA> For some time the Government has been concerned about the low level of recovery of the costs of airport and airway facilities used by general aviation. Although the Government has had a long standing objective of full recovery of costs attributable to civil aviation, it recognises that any rapid move towards full recovery would cause severe disruption to the industry.</PARA>
<PARA> Thus the charges proposed in the Study are aimed at recovering some one third of facility costs attributable to general aviation, and specific account was taken of operators' ability to pay in recommending charging levels.</PARA>
<PARA> The recommended charging levels range from $20 per aircraft movement at primary capital city airports such as Sydney or Adelaide, to $4 per aircraft movement at major general aviation aerodromes such as Bankstown or Parafield. In all some 27 capital city and regional airports would be affected if the proposal is adopted.</PARA>
<PARA> It was recognised that flying training operations at these aerodromes could be particularly affected by the movement charges. While it is not suggested that trainee pilots would be exempt from paying the charges, the Committee considered some measure of relief through the treatment of 'touch and go' operations as a single movement.</PARA>
<PARA> The Study report identifies the extent to which flying training and other general aviation activities would be suppressed by the cost recovery proposals. Of course the implications of such suppression in general aviation activity will be considered by Government when it addresses the Study's recommendations.</PARA>

<PARA> The amendments to the Currency Act 1965 effected by the Currency Amendment Act 1981 provide, inter alia, for the issue of coins without the need for additional legislation. The Act now provides for new denominations of coins and their standard compositions to be prescribed by regulation and authorises the Treasurer to cause any such coins to be made and issued. The Act currently empowers the Treasurer to issue a $10 silver coin to commemorate the 1982 Commonwealth Games in Brisbane. In respect of other possible issues, it has been longstanding policy that commemorative coin issues should be confined to occasions of national interest and importance.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 28 April 1981 (Hansard, page 1383) Senator Sibraa asked me a question, without notice, in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Defence in the Senate. His question concerned the presence of Soviet bombers at Cam Ranh Bay in Vietnam.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> I am aware of newspaper articles which make a number of claims about an intelligence report on Soviet 'Backfire' Bombers at Cam Ranh Bay in Vietnam. These articles are speculative and I am not prepared to confirm or deny the existence of such a report. When asked over a weekend about the presence of Soviet aircraft at Cam Ranh Bay I based my answer on my knowledge of the Soviet aircraft that I knew to be there, knowledge shared by many of the public. If on this occasion confusion between Tu95 'Bears' and Tu22m 'Backfires' arose from an informal telephone query, then so be it.</PARA>
<PARA> What is indisputable is the fact that the USSR is using military bases in Vietnam and that Soviet aircraft are based there. The USSR has used military facilities in Vietnam-including Cam Ranh Bay-since the Sino-Vietnamese conflict of early 1979, and usage of Cam Ranh Bay in particular by Soviet naval and air forces continues. What is therefore of importance regarding this issue is not what specific aircraft types the USSR has stationed in Vietnam, but rather the fact that the USSR is developing its strength and influence there. This continuing and increasing presence in Vietnam provides a factor of uncertainty in the East and South East Asian regions and as such is a matter of concern to the Government. It continues to be monitored carefully by our intelligence agencies.</PARA>

<PARA> My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Communications and refers to an advertisement that appeared in several newspapers last week headed 'Long distance for less'. The advertisement suggests that there will be a 20 to 25 per cent reduction in long distance telephone call rates over certain distances. Is the Minister aware that this large reduction in rates will apply between Melbourne and Sydney, Sydney and Brisbane and Melbourne and Adelaide, amongst other places, but not between Melbourne and Hobart? In other words, the reduction will apply between all adjacent capital cities in the east of Australia, except between Melbourne and Hobart. Obviously I ask: Will the Government examine or ask Telecom Australia to examine the situation to see whether the reduction can apply between Melbourne and Hobart?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> I am advised by Telecom Australia that the advertisement referred to was in connection with the introduction on 26 April 1981 of a new STD rate (day rate of $2.16 for three minutes) for calls made over distances between 645 km and 1,145 km. Previously, all calls over 645 km were charged at the day rate of $2.70 for three minutes. As well as the examples quoted by the honourable senator, the new rate also applies to calls between Hobart and Sydney. The new rate represents a further stage in Telecom's program of reducing long distance trunk rates. The honourable senator would be aware that Hobart callers to Melbourne have already benefited from an earlier step in this program under which calls between Hobart and Melbourne-which fall in the 325 km to 645 km distance charging category-were reduced from $2.02 to $1.80 for three minutes as from May 1980.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answers to the honourable senator's questions are as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There have been difficulties in establishing a common approach to the general matter raised in this question between the Australian Legal Aid Office (ALAO) and State and Territory legal aid commissions that have absorbed the ALAO.</PARA>
<PARA> A person seeking legal aid from the Australian Legal Aid Office may obtain assistance from the Office, subject to the Office means and needs test guidelines, provided the assistance relates to a proceeding in a court or tribunal in a State or Territory in which the Office is located.</PARA>
<PARA> Where an applicant resident in a State or Territory where the ALAO still operates seeks legal aid in relation to proceedings in that State or Territory, he may apply at any ALAO Office in that State or Territory.</PARA>
<PARA> Where an applicant seeks legal aid in relation to proceedings in another State or Territory where the ALAO operates, he may apply to any ALAO Office in his State or Territory of residence or in the State or Territory where the proceedings are to be heard.</PARA>
<PARA> If a person resident in a State or Territory where the ALAO still operates requires legal aid for proceedings in a State or Territory where a legal aid commission has commenced operations and has absorbed the functions of the ALAO, he should apply to the appropriate commission in that State or Territory. If that person attends the ALAO in his State or Territory of residence, the office will endeavour to assist him to establish his eligibility for legal aid from the Commission in the other State or Territory.</PARA>
<PARA> The practical effect of the above arrangements is, for example, that a resident of Victoria suffering a motor vehicle accident in New South Wales may apply for legal aid to the ALAO Office most convenient to him in Victoria or to an Office in New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA> I am informed that an agreement has been entered into between the commissions in Western Australia, South Australia and Victoria covering the general matter raised in the question. I am informed that a person may obtain legal aid from a commission in New South Wales, Queensland or the Australian Capital Territory only in relation to a proceeding in a court or tribunal in the State or Territory in which the commission is located.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator Durack</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's questions are as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) As to information described in (a) and (b), I am advised that the Public Service Board does not keep records of the number of persons refused appointments or affected by adverse or qualified security assessments. At paragraph 85 and Appendix 2 (b) of the Second Report of the Royal Commission on Security and Intelligence (Parliamentary Paper 247/1979), Mr Justice Hope set out certain information regarding the number of security checks for access to classified matter in the years 1970-1974.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the opinions described in (c), this is understood to refer to opinions by the law officers. Those opinions have not been published. Legal advice given to the Government is not generally made available to the public during the closed archives period. Access to such advice may be given for particular reasons or in particular circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA> The 'reports' referred to in (d) and (e) appear to be parts of a paper prepared by the First Assistant Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department to assist the then Attorney-General's Department to assist the then Attorney-General in his consideration of the Law Council of Australia's Draft Criminal Code for the Australian Territories (Parliamentary Paper 44/1969). The purpose of the paper was to set out the then current position of the law in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory and the changes that would be involved if the Law Council's recommendations were adopted. I am advised that the paper has not been published nor has it otherwise been made available. I would be prepared to make the paper available if requested to do so.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the information in (f), I refer the honourable senator to my remarks during the debate on the Australian Security Intelligence Bill 1979 setting out the Government's policy on this matter (Hansard, Senate, 10 May 1979, page 1876). This policy is consistent with long-standing practice.</PARA>
<PARA> As to the documents in (g), the document which in 1972 was known as the 'Protective Security Handbook' has not been officially published or otherwise officially made available to the public. The Handbook consists of 11 chapters and 2 appendices and I consider that Chapters 1, 2, 3, 4, 8 and 11 may be made available upon request. The remaining chapters and the 2 appendices deal with measures for the protection of information relating to the national security. To make this information available publicly could reasonably be expected to cause damage to the national security in that it would provide an officially confirmed insight into the protective measures adopted to protect sensitive material and provide organisations or persons hostile to Australia's national interests with material which could assist their circumvention of those protective measures. The current Protective Security Handbook has been made available publicly and is published as Appendix 3 to the Report on the Freedom of Information Bill 1978 by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs (Parliamentary Paper 272/1979).</PARA>
<PARA> In his answer to Question No. 257 (Senate Hansard, 27 May 1981, page 2222), the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs indicated that I would provide an answer in respect of document No. 19-Commonwealth Solicitor-General's report on Aboriginal land rights. The reference appears to be to a paper entitled 'Recognition of Aboriginal Land Claims on Reserves in the Northern Territory', prepared by the then Solicitor-General, Mr R. J. Ellicott, Q.C. (now Mr Justice Ellicott), and submitted to the then Prime Minister, Sir William McMahon. The paper was subsequently made available by the Solicitor-General to Mr Whitlam after he became Prime Minister. The paper has not been made available publicly. Any request for access to the paper made to myself or my Department would be dealt with in accordance with the principles of the Freedom of Information Bill 1981.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's questions are as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) From 1 April 1980 (when the social security jurisdiction conferred by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (Social Services Act) Regulations came into force) to 28 February 1981, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal sat on 16 days hearing applications for the review of social security decisions. The Tribunal was constituted in each case by three members. In addition, 8 preliminary conferences, presided over by a single member of the Tribunal, were held during that period.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Payment received by each member in respect of social security cases alone is not readily available. Presidential members of the Tribunal are all Judges of the Federal Court of Australia and are remunerated in that capacity.Full time senior non-presidential members are paid on annual salary, at present $45,899. Part time members of the Tribunal are paid sitting fees as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Senior members  $200 per day  Members  $180 per day</PARA>
<PARA> Part time members of the Tribunal who sit on social security cases may also sit on other cases, and may be involved in both social security and other matters in any one day. Consequently the fees paid to part time members who sit on social security cases do not always relate solely to the work on these cases.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Three cases were decided by the Tribunal after a hearing. Fifty-four cases were disposed of by directions of the President without the Tribunal proceeding to make a decision.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Of the three applications decided after a hearing:</PARA>
<PARA> in one case the Tribunal set aside the decision of the Director-General of Social Services and granted a widow's pension</PARA>
<PARA> in one case the Tribunal affirmed the Director-General's decision</PARA>
<PARA> in one case the Tribunal held that there was no reviewable decision.</PARA>
<PARA> Of the 54 applications disposed of by directions of the President:</PARA>
<PARA> in 11 cases the applicants' claims were conceded by the Director-General</PARA>
<PARA> 38 cases were not within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal</PARA>
<PARA> in five cases the applications were withdrawn.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Seventy-six applications remained to be determined by the Tribunal at 28 February 1981.

In refusing the adjournment, the trial judge had taken into account other considerations including the interests of the prosecutrix, the witnesses and the Crown.

When last seen by the Senior Medical Officer RAAF Darwin on 16 November 1980, the drivers were free from any symptoms of effects from the exposure.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (a) Yes. This statement was made by Group Captain L. D. Wilkinson in the interest of reminding RAAF personnel of the requirement for the correct handling procedures for insecticides. However, I am advised that although Malathion is capable of causing mortality through ingestion or long periods of inhalation of vapours in confined areas it is one of the least toxic of the organophosphate pesticides. The Time-Weighted Average (TWA) value used by the National Health and Medical Research Council is 10 milligrams per cubic metre for occupational exposure. That is, a person is not likely to suffer ill effect if breathing 10 milligrams per cubic metre of Malathion for eight hours a day, forty hours per week. For comparison purposes the TWA for Diazinon (another approved pesticide for use by the RAAF) is only 0.1 milligrams per cubic metre.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Yes. Although the drivers were briefed on the load they were carrying, no specific briefing was given on the properties of the insecticide that formed part of the load. The RAAF Headquarters Support Command investigation into the incident determined that the Dangerous Cargo Handling Data and Preparation Certificate was not prepared for this consignment; nor was it separately manifested. However, 'Toxic' labels were affixed to the drums.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) As the incident in question involved RAAF personnel and because there are over 4,000 chemical compounds in use by the RAAF alone, the information provided will be confined to the subject of pesticides currently approved for use in the RAAF. They are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Insecticides</PARA>
<PARA> Pyrethrins (liquid and aerosol)</PARA>
<PARA> DDT (liquid and dust)</PARA>
<PARA> Dieldrin (liquid)</PARA>
<PARA> Ficam (dust and powder)</PARA>
<PARA> Diazinon (liquid)</PARA>
<PARA> Malathion (liquid)</PARA>
<PARA> Baygon (liquid and dust)</PARA>
<PARA> Mesurol (liquid and powder)</PARA>
<PARA> Abate (crystals)</PARA>
<PARA> Di-phenothrin (aerosol)</PARA>
<PARA>Rodenticides</PARA>
<PARA> Warfarin (granules)</PARA>
<PARA> Racumin (granules)</PARA>
<PARA>Repellants</PARA>
<PARA> Di-Butyl-phthalate (liquid, gel stick)</PARA>
<PARA> MEK 1941 (liquid)</PARA>
<PARA> Coumophos (liquid)</PARA>
<PARA>Fungicide</PARA>
<PARA> Sodium Dichloroisocyanurate</PARA>
<PARA>Herbicides</PARA>
<PARA> Chloropon (powder)</PARA>
<PARA> Weedozol Total (powder)</PARA>
<PARA> Erase (granules)</PARA>
<PARA> Weedon (liquid)</PARA>
<PARA> Bromacil (powder)</PARA>
<PARA> Tandone (powder)</PARA>
<PARA> Residone (powder)</PARA>
<PARA> Atrazine (granules)</PARA>
<PARA> Roundup (liquid)</PARA>
<PARA> These pesticides are used for the specific purposes of the control of insects, rodents, fungal growths and weeds on RAAF bases. The repellents are used by individuals as required.</PARA>
<PARA> The RAAF limits the use of all pesticides (except repellents) to Hygiene Inspectors who receive specific training in the handling and application of these chemicals. These officers have available to them a wide range of personal protective and safety equipment for wear during pesticide use. The general matter of pesticide use in the Defence Force is monitored by the Pesticides Sub-Committee of the Medical Services Advisory Committee. A comprehensive Joint Service Manual on the handling and use of pesticides is being produced by the Sub-Committee.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Following the incident, a Faulty Packaging Report was raised by RAAF Base Darwin and this was investigated by specialist officers at RAAF Headquarters Support Command. As a result all RAAF personnel involved with the handling of dangerous and toxic substances have been reminded to observe the appropriate regulations for the storage, handling, packaging and transport of dangerous goods. Additionally, drums of Malathion of similar age to those involved in the incident are being further inspected for possible corrosion.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) No. Incidents of this nature are not normally reported to the Commonwealth Department of Health. However, full details of the incident are recorded on each serving member's RAAF medical documents.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Both drivers are presently employed in their normal service duties. Neither of the drivers has any symptoms of ill effects resulting from this incident.</PARA>

<PARA> It is not possible to accurately estimate for 1980-81 the cost of paying unemployment, sickness and special benefits during the five-day waiting period. Statistics on grants of unemployment, sickness and special benefits classified by the nature of the waiting period which is served are not available.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) to (3) In my statement to the Parliament of 30 April 1981 on the outcome of the Review of Commonwealth Functions I indicated that compared with the costs of continuing programs on the basis of existing policies and arrangements, the estimated overall effect of all RCF measures would be an eventual on-going saving in Budget outlays of the order of $560 million. Government revenue would also be boosted from the sale of assets and from a broad ranging reduction in various forms of assistance to industry through the tax system, saving some $130 million.</PARA>
<PARA> In reaching its decisions on individual items the Government took into account the financial, staffing and other implications for each measure. However, the Review was not primarily an exercise in cutting costs or containing expenditure programs, although this has been one desirable outcome of the Review.</PARA>
<PARA> Many of the decisions, while clearly leading to savings, were not of a kind where the savings could be stated at that time. In many cases precise amounts saved will only become clear as implementation proceeds. Other measures are of a general kind designed to contribute over time to efficiency of government and to provide increased opportunity for the private sector. These will lead to diffuse but widespread savings or benefits which, even if not directly measurable, will still be quite significant.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Since 1974 the Natural Disasters Organisation (NDO), which absorbed the functions of the earlier Directorate of Civil Defence, together with that State and Territory Emergency Service organisations have made up a core civil defence structure.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honour- able senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) The honourable senator will be aware that the Office of Child Care, within my Department, in conjuction with the Australian Bureau of Statistics and responsible State and Territory administrative authorities, has been developing an annual statistical census of licensed and/or supervised pre-school and child care services.</PARA>
<PARA> The first such census was held late last year and the second is scheduled for September/October of this year.</PARA>
<PARA> The data from the 1980 census is currently being processed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, and a public document containing much of the information requested by the honourable senator in parts (1) and (2) of his question will be available later this year.</PARA>
<PARA> The information presented will not delineate between full day care and community child care centres, but will be presented on the following basis:</PARA>
<PARA> pre-school services;</PARA>
<PARA> occasional care services;</PARA>
<PARA> child care centres;</PARA>
<PARA> pre-school and child care centres;</PARA>
<PARA> individuals providing family based care not through a scheme; and</PARA>
<PARA> family day care schemes.</PARA>
<PARA> Within these divisions, services will be classified according to their type of operation, as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> government services (e.g. Education Department run pre-schools);</PARA>
<PARA> community or local government services receiving Government support;</PARA>
<PARA> community or local government services not receiving Government support;</PARA>
<PARA> commercial services; and</PARA>
<PARA> other</PARA>
<PARA> I can however provide preliminary estimates in answer to part (1) of the honourable senator's question. These figures, shown in the table below, were provided by State/Territory authorities prior to the 1980 census as estimates of the number of services as estimates of the number of services from which data would be collected:</PARA>
<PARA>Estimated Number of Services to be Included in the 1980 Census of Pre-school and Child Care Services</PARA>

<PARA>NSW Vic Qld SA WA Tas NT ACT Total</PARA>
<PARA>Pre-school  800 1,200 *730 400 670 197 111 75 4,183 Child Care</PARA>

<PARA> * Queensland pre-school and centre based care services were not included in the 1980 collection.</PARA>
<PARA> * 'Other services' largely includes 'for profit' child care centres, except in Tasmania where there are 70 play centres.</PARA>
<PARA> * Includes 14 Commonwealth supported schemes and 4 State support schemes.</PARA>
<PARA> * Includes 1 private scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Office of Child Care only holds information on the recipients and sponsors of Commonwealth supported child care services. No information is held on the recipients or sponsors of pre-schools receiving Commonwealth block grant funds.</PARA>
<PARA> However as a product of the 1980 census of services, it is expected that State and Territory licensing authorities will provide information for a directory of all pre-school and child care services in their State/Territory. This will be produced either through an existing mechanism (eg. a State Council of Social Service directory) or through a new publication.</PARA>
<PARA> In relation to all Children's Services Program supported projects (exluding pre-school and vacation care services), the majority (89 per cent) are sponsored by a community (43 per cent), local government (26 per cent) or charitable/religious body (20 per cent). Of the remaining services, the majority are sponsored by an educational/student group or by a State Government. In April 1981 I sent the honourable senator a preliminary listing of such projects and of their sponsors.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Finance Direction 2/1 which applies to all Government departments and those statutory authorities operating through the Commonwealth Public Account states:</PARA>
<PARA> 'Accounts shall be kept with the Reserve Bank or, where that is not practicable, with the most convenient Bank. Where it is practicable to use a branch of the Reserve Bank but nevertheless a Department desires to open or retain an official account with another bank, the full circumstances shall be reported to the Department of Finance for decision'.</PARA>
<PARA> My Department can find no record of a need to make a decision required by the latter part of that Direction.</PARA>
<PARA> Some statutory authorities not required to keep their accounts in accordance with commercial practice are required by their enabling legislation to open and maintain one or more bank accounts with an 'approved bank' or 'approved banks'. In these cases an approved bank is generally defined to mean the Reserve Bank of Australia or another bank approved by the Treasurer.</PARA>
<PARA> The Reserve Bank has a limited number of branches at which departments and statutory authorities can conduct their banking business and those branches are not always conveniently located. In most cases where departments and statutory authorities do not conduct their banking business with the Reserve Bank, they conduct it with the Commonwealth Trading Bank. In the bulk of the remaining cases they have accounts with branches of other Australian banks in localities where neither the Reserve Bank nor the Commonwealth Trading Bank has a branch, or with foreign banks in overseas countries in which they need to make transactions.</PARA>
<PARA> Statutory authorities required by their enabling legislation to keep their accounts in accordance with commercial practice are required by that legislation to open and maintain one or more bank accounts with an 'approved bank' or 'approved banks'. An approved bank in this regard means a trading bank as defined in sub-section 5 (1) of the Banking Act 1959 or another bank approved by the Treasurer. The choice of the bank or banks with which accounts are held is a matter for the authority's commercial judgement (subject to the Treasurer's approval in respect of banks other than those subject to the Banking Act) in the light of, for example, location and service considerations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 30 April 1981 (Hansard, page 1548) Senator Button addressed the following question to the Minister for Finance:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is the Government planning later this year to sell 15 per cent of the quotas controlling the import into Australia of textiles, clothing and footwear? Will the sale of 15 per cent of the quotas give a few importers, notably the larger retail chains, the chance to tie up quotas? Will it also enable these importers to determine the real tariff level that the market will bear and to mark up their imported goods to that level at a potential profit of millions of dollars?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's questions:</PARA>
<PARA> On 15 August 1980, the Government announced that the import quota available on a range of textile, clothing and footwear products will be allocated annually in the following manner from 1 January 1982:</PARA>
<PARA> 85 per cent of the initially established quota ceiling in each category will be allocated to importers based on their import performance in the relevant categories during 1 July 1978 to 30 June 1980;</PARA>
<PARA> the remaining 15 per cent of the quota plus any increase to the total quota ceiling due to a predetermined liberalisation factor and assessed market growth, will be allocated by tender.</PARA>
<PARA>The allocation of a proportion of quota by tender will provide easier access to quota by new importers and importers wishing to expand their market shares.</PARA>
<PARA> Under a tender scheme, quota will be offered to the highest tenderers until the quota available is exhausted. All successful tenderers will pay the lowest tender rate at which quota is allocated in that particular category. The scheme as envisaged is not seen as favouring any one section of the importing community.</PARA>
<PARA> Legislation given royal assent on 14 May 1981 to give effect to the Government's decision to allocate quota by tender, provides penalties for importers who have been allocated tender quota and have not fully utilised their allocation. This should discourage speculators or persons lodging frivolous bids and ensure that the quota is available to people who have a genuine need for it.</PARA>
<PARA> The sale of some quota will provide an indication of the tariff level equivalent to the assistance afforded by the quota. However, it will not provide an incentive for importers to mark-up goods by a greater amount than they would, if the quota were allocated by some other means. Ultimately, the goods imported against tender quota must compete with domestically produced goods and goods imported by base quota holders.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 6 May 1981 (Hansard, page 1641), Senator Robertson asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Has his attention been drawn to an article in today's Australian concerning the use of Darwin Airport by American B52 bombers? I ask the Minister whether he noted one sentence which reads:</PARA>
<PARA> 'Two of the planes will fly continuous missions above the Indian Ocean while one remains in Darwin.'</PARA>
<PARA>Will the Minister not agree that this marks the first contravention of the agreement which speaks of the bombers staging in Darwin and of the accompanying statement which suggests that the bombers will remain in Darwin overnight to allow crews to rest? Is it a fact that there will be a total of 34 landings a month, again contrary to the Minister's statement which implied much less usage and interference?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> I have noted the sentence referred to by the honourable senator. I do not agree with Senator Robertson's assertion that the sentence, which reflects accurately the planned concept of operations, marks a contravention of the Exchange of Notes of 11 March 1981 or the Prime Minister's accompanying statement of the same date.</PARA>
<PARA> All three B52s will stage through Darwin and the requirement for crew rest is the predominant requirement and applies to crews of all the B52s. It is a standard and well understood practice for the US to have one of the three B52 aircraft on standby ready to take over if one of the other two were to develop a mechanical problem early in the sea surveillance mission.</PARA>
<PARA> It is obvious that the standby crew would need to be fully rested and prepared for a long surveillance flight. If it does not need to take over the surveillance mission the standby aircraft will take off for the return flight to Guam within a few hours of the take off of the sea surveillance mission B52s.</PARA>
<PARA> I reject the honourable senator's contention that any particular level of usage was implied in Ministerial statements on the agreement. The Prime Minister's statement and the diplomatic note of 11 March 1981 refer to 'periodic deployments'. For Senator Robertson's information, the number of B52 landings in the first few months at least of operations will be five each month.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 12 May 1981 (Hansard, page 1813) Senator Hearn asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Health, a question without notice, concerning the appointment of women as members of the Medical Benefits Advisory Committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Health has provided the following information:</PARA>
<PARA> No women are members of the Medical Benefits Advisory Committee. I am unable to say if and when a woman will be appointed.</PARA>
<PARA> The Health Insurance Act provides that the Committee consist of eight members, including at least five medical practitioners. Four of those five members may be appointed only after consultation between the Minister and the Australian Medical Association (AMA). The AMA has yet to nominate a woman to the Committee. Nominees of the Commonwealth have always been selected because of their expertise in the medical benefits area.</PARA>
<PARA> Currently there are no women occupying senior positions in that area. I would add that there is a majority of medically qualified persons on the Committee including a specialist obstetrician and gynaecologist. Such expertise would ensure that medical matters considered by the Committee, including those peculiar to females, are adequately represented.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 13 May 1981 (Hansard, page 1879) Senator Chipp asked the Leader of the Government in the Senate the following question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Is it true that no adequate Federal plans exist to meet a nuclear attack and that State schemes are patchy and ineffective?</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Is it also true that civil defence against a nuclear attack has been downgraded in Australia over the past several years compared with defence against natural disasters?</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Does he accept the assessment of the Department of Defence that the possibility of a nuclear attack against Australia cannot be ruled out, and is he satisfied that our capacity to cope with a nuclear attack is adequate?</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Carrick undertook to seek the information from the relevant Minister. The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) It is not true that no adequate plans exist to meet a nuclear attack. The Australian Government's policy is that basic civil defence capabilities should be maintained which can be readily enhanced if necessary. Australia's current and prospective strategic situation does not call for a high level of readiness to meet an imminent nuclear attack. It is this government's policy that defence resources should be directed primarily to the development of defence capabilities to deter and, if need be, to deal with a range of more realistic contingencies of conventional conflict in which Australia might need to defend itself.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) It is not true that civil defence against a nuclear attack has been downgraded. The basis of our civil defence capabilities resides in the various counter disasters resources in each State and Territory, in the Commonwealth's own resources, and in the Natural Disasters Organisation, and their civil defence capabilities have been enhanced over the last few years. The total active membership of State and Territory organisations is some 35,000 people, although relatively few permanent staff are employed at present. The Commonwealth support programs recognise that there are many similarities between organisations, techniques and equipment required for civil defence purposes and those necessary for mitigating the effects of natural disasters.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Government has endorsed the consolidated judgment of its advisers that the prospect of global nuclear conflict is remote so long as the United States and Union of Soviet Socialist Republics continue to be deterred by the enormous risks of nuclear warfare. Should nuclear war between the super-powers occur-and it is recognised that potential for miscalculation remains-the possibility that Australia, along with a lot of other countries, might be subject to nuclear attack cannot be discounted. But-and I emphasise this-the risk is remote and it is this Goverment's policy to support those elements of US deterrent capabilities that ensure it remains so.</PARA>

<PARA> Has the attention of the Minister been drawn to reports of a recent defence seminar in Darwin at which leading citizens, including the Police Commissioner, claimed that northern coastal surveillance was inadequate? Has he been told that illegal landings, drug running and illegal fishing were claimed to be the major problems and that the introduction of pastoral and agricultural diseases was a real threat? What action does the Government intend to take? Will the Minister not accept that defence of our country in peacetime is a proper role for his Department and not a civilian or coastguard activity?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> I am aware of the reports referred to by the honourable senator. A major review of the arrangements for civil coastal surveillance is now being undertaken by the standing inter-departmental committee on coastal surveillance, chaired by the Department of Transport and on which Defence is represented. The report of that review is expected to be submitted to the Government shortly. The review will be comprehensive, addressing amongst other issues, the concerns expressed about arrangements for surveillance of the northern Australian coastline, and also the appropriate level of participation by the Defence Force in future civil coastal surveillance operations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 9 June 1981, (Hansard, page 2795), Senator Melzer asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Resources, the following question, without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Resources. The Melbourne Age of 5 June carried an item stating that Energy Resources of Australia had signed a contract to sell 1,429 tonnes of uranium to a private Belgian company, Synatom. When did Australia sign a safeguards agreement with Belgium? What guarantees has this Government that this material will not be used to produce weapons grade uranium or plutonium or will not be sold to other people who are not a party to any safeguards agreement?</PARA>
<PARA> The Acting Minister for Trade and Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Negotiations between Australia and the European Atomic Energy Community (EURATOM) on a nuclear safeguards agreement concluded on 27 March 1981. The results of the negotiations were approved by the Council of Ministers of the European Community on 19 May. A statement issued by the Ministers for Trade and Resources and Foreign Affairs on 21 May welcomed this development and said that the agreement will be signed as soon as the necessary formal procedures on both sides have been completed.</PARA>
<PARA> Entry into force of the Australia/EURATOM agreement will open the way for exports of Australian uranium under new contracts to Member States of the European Community, including Belgium. The uranium to be supplied to the Belgian company SYNATOM by Energy Resources of Australia will be subject to the Australian/EURATOM agreement. No deliveries of Australian uranium to the European Community under the Energy Resources of Australia/SYNATOM contract approved on 27 May 1981, or any other new contract, can take place until that agreement has entered into force.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australia/EURATOM agreement meets all the requirements of the Government's stringent nuclear safeguards policy announceed by the Prime Minister on 24 May 1977. The agreement provides that Australian uranium which may be sold to Member States of the European Community for peaceful purposes will not be retransferred for end-use to any country which does not itself have a safeguards agreement in force with Australia. The agreement also provides that Australian uranium may not be enriched beyond 20 per cent in the isotope U235 without the prior consent of Australia. It also incorporates agreed conditions on reprocessing of spent fuel of Australian origin, in accordance with the Government's policy on conditions for Australian consent for reprocessing, as announced in Parliament by the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 27 November 1980.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 5 June 1981 (Hansard, page 2196) Senator Robertson asked me a question, without notice, in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry in the Senate. His question concerned export of live cattle from Australia and the closure of abattoirs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Primary Industry has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question.</PARA>
<PARA> In 1979-80 72,933 head of cattle were exported from Australia and 80,830 head were exported for the 10 months to 30 April 1981. The composition of those exports, by port, is set out in Tables 1 and 2 attached.</PARA>
<PARA> I draw the honourable senator's attention to the fact that 73 per cent in 1979-80 and 68 per cent in 1980-81 of slaughter cattle exports were exported from the northern Australian ports of Townsville, Darwin and Wyndham.</PARA>
<PARA> In the past 18 months abattoir operators have advised the Department of Primary Industry of the closure of 12 export registered abattoirs; a further 4 were closed during the period but have re-opened again. The Department has no information on closure of domestic only registered abattoirs and smaller slaughterhouses.</PARA>
