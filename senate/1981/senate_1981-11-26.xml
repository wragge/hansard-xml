<PARA>To the honourable the President and Members of the Senate, in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that your petitioners are gravely concerned at proposed future hydro-electric developments in South West Tasmania. As this area is on the Register of the National Estate it is therefore of national concern and your petitioners humbly call upon the Senate to conduct a Senate Inquiry into South West Tasmania. A Federal Inquiry has been recommended by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly call upon the Federal Parliament not to allocate funds or allow funds to be raised for development of roads or dams in the South West of Tasmania but rather to provide such funds as would enable the preservation of this area. This is a national issue and therefore Tasmanians should not be made to bear any financial burden resulting from its preservation.</PARA>
<PARA> And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray.</PARA>

<TITLE>Pensioner Benefits</TITLE>
<PARA>To the President of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That it is clearly apparent that Australian society is becoming more polarised-that the rich at home and abroad are becoming richer, profiting from Australia's mineral wealth, whilst pensioners and the disadvantaged, some three million people, are becoming a race apart.</PARA>
<PARA> That, of necessity, the Federal Government take action that all Australians share the wealth of their country by the transfer of resources to income security, health care and housing. Therefore, your petitioners urge that:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) All pensions and benefits be raised to at least 30 per cent of the National Average Male Earnings seasonally adjusted</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Removal of the means/income test on the Pensioner Health Benefit imposed by Federal legislation 1973.</PARA>
<PARA> Reintroduction of Medibank; in so doing restore all Australians to equality of citizenship.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) To alleviate Australia's shortage in housing stock within the capacity of people to pay (rental and ownership) the Federal Government immediately inject $200 million into State Housing Authorities, which will, in addition, alleviate unemployment.</PARA>

<PARA> 1. The decision by the Australia Council to discontinue the General Grant of $20,000 (which is in the nature of recurrent funding) to La Boite Theatre, Brisbane, will jeopardise the continued viability of the theatre, and in particular, the Main House Theatre; Adult Theatre Workshops; Youth Theatre activities and the existence of the professional core of the theatre.</PARA>

<PARA> (2) That safeguards taken against the uncontrolled dispersal into the environment of toxic elements and radioactive material have already been proven to be totally inadequate.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The effect of this Ordinance is to exempt building and credit societies from provisions of the Money Lenders Ordinance governing contracts for loans at an interest rate above 12 per cent per annum, with retrospective application to 1 December 1980. The explanatory statement attached to the Ordinance indicated that its purpose was to remove the duplication of the regulation of building and credit societies in the Australian Capital Territory, which are regulated by the Co-operative Societies Ordinance 1939.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Attorney-General (Senator Durack) advised the Committee that, while certain provisions of the Money Lenders Ordinance remained legally applicable to the societies, until December 1980 the provisions had no practical application to them. He explained to the Committee that, with the sudden increase in the general level of interest rates at the end of last year, the societies were found to be in technical breach of the applicable provisions and could have been placed in a difficult financial position if the situation had not been remedied by the Ordinance. The Committee had entertained some misgivings concerning the retrospective operation of the Ordinance, the adequacy of the explanatory statement initially provided with the Ordinance, and the administrative delays which occurred in remedying the situation. The Committee was also concerned, under its principle (B), that the legal rights of borrowers from building and credit societies were being diminished, while the rights of borrowers from other lending institutions were not similarly affected. Following detailed explanations from the Attorney-General and, in particular, in view of the consequences that could arise for building and credit societies if the Ordinance were now to be disallowed, the Committee decided not to proceed with the notice of disallowance given by the Chairman on 10 November 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> On behalf of Senator Lewis, and in accordance with notice of intention given yesterday, I now withdraw business of the Senate, Notice of Motion No. 1, standing in his name and relating to the disallowance of the Money Lenders (Amendment) Ordinance 1981. Notwithstanding the decision to withdraw the Ordinance, the Committee reports that it was not completely satisfied with the reasons given for the delay in making the Ordinance, and with the adequacy of the explanatory statement provided with the Ordinance. </PARA>

In view of the food shortages prevailing in Poland and the Australian Government's decision to provide monetary assistance, will the Government further consider providing assistance in the form of beef shipments that will not only alleviate the food difficulties of Poland but also provide jobs for abattoir workers and steady the alarming falling saleyard stock prices around Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Recent statements by the Prime Minister and by the Minister for Foreign Affairs made plain Australia's concern about the situation in Poland and our desire to be of assistance to that country. I suspect that that view would be shared in most corners of this Parliament. The Prime Minister announced some contribution to relief assistance. I think individual members of this Parliament also have received requests for assistance from organisations which are concerned with providing medical assistance to Poland. The matter is very much on the agenda at the moment. It has been the main practice, I understand, for Australia to provide aid in an untied form. This is unusual in most countries. Our aid has tended to be provided in terms of money which has been available for use as the recipient country thinks fit. However, there is, of course, plenty of precedent around the world for food aid to be provided. I will refer Senator Watson's suggestion to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister for Primary Industry for consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister and is similar to the question I asked yesterday. I refer to Australia's conditional decision to participate in the Sinai peace monitoring force. Australian participation is conditional upon there being a significant European involvement in Sinai such as is proposed on the part of the United Kingdom, France, the Netherlands and Italy. I wish to ask about the additional Australian condition that there be a significant prospect of Israel and the Palestinians progressing with autonomy talks. Is this Australian condition not tantamount to the European view expressed in the European Economic Community's Venice declaration which calls for Palestinian participation in the peace process? In those circumstances, is it not true that if Israel does not accept the European countries' participation along with their Venice declaration then Israel at the same time would not be accepting Australia's participation along with our Palestinian condition? Finally, when does the Australian Government expect the Israeli response to be concluded in respect of European and Australian involvement in the Sinai force?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Teague's question raises several important issues. As the Prime Minister made clear in his Press statement on 24 November, the most important condition on which Australia's participation in the Sinai peacekeeping force depended has now been met; that is, the announcement to participate by Britain, France, Italy and the Netherlands meets the Government's requirement for a balanced multinational force and makes it possible for Australia also to participate. I table the Prime Minister's Press statement for the convenience of honourable senators. I should point out that the Prime Minister's statement to the Parliament on 22 October did not set progress with the autonomy talks as a condition of Australian participation. Rather, the Prime Minister noted that a solution to the Palestinian issue was clearly central to the future stability and peace of the Middle East and he looked to further progress on this matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Australian and European policies on this matter are not identical. Notwithstanding the European Community's support for Palestinian self-determination and recognition of the importance of the Palestinian Liberation Organisation's being involved in negotiations, the four European participants have not made these factors conditions for their participation. Australia's policy on the Middle East dispute is based on Security Council Resolution 242 which recognises the right of all states in the region, including Israel, to live in peace within secure and recognised boundaries and calls on Israel to withdraw from territories occupied in 1967, and on the legitimate rights of the Palestinians including their right to a homeland alongside Israel. Australia does not, and will not, recognise the Palestine Liberation Organisation until it recognises Israel's right to exist. While the Government has no firm indication of the timing of Israel's response to the offer to participate by the four European countries we understand that the Israeli Cabinet will consider the matter on Sunday next, 29 November.</PARA>

There is no prize for guessing what the prizes are. I witnessed one such game last week in which nearly all the participants were young women, some of whom were pregnant and almost all of whom were accompanied by small children.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is fair to say that there is no health issue in Australia which is so clear cut as the association between cigarette smoking and health. Senator Giles has raised a matter which is probably the best proven association known today. It is said that smoking is the single greatest preventable health hazard facing Australians. This Government, in responding to a Senate standing committee report, has actually made a commitment as a matter of government policy to seek a reduction in tobacco consumption in Australia. That is a firm Government commitment which obviously is directly contrary to the interests of the cigarette industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I must acknowledge that this is an area of unresolved tension. The Government has taken some actions which include the encouragement of debate to bring out the information to which Senator Giles has referred; it has assisted with the dissemination of accurate information and it has utilised the excise as a tool to control the consumption of tobacco. I am not certain that one can take administrative action to force anyone to address moral issues. But to the extent that the Government does take action, for example to insist on the labelling of packets with warnings and information on tar and nicotine contents, that is further action to try to ensure that we have an informed community which is in possession of the facts regarding cigarette smoking. In the end the resolution of this problem will rest with people. It involves action by the whole community, not just governments. However, I must add that it is distressing if promotional activities by anyone are directed at people who are not yet old enough to make mature judgments. Since cigarette smoking is an addictive and harmful practice, any such promotional action directed at those not yet able to make mature decisions is to be deplored.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I need to know which preparations are being talked about before I can give a comprehensive answer but I can advise Senator Elstob that the Minister has to receive a recommendation from an expert committee that medications be placed on the benefits list. That committee is called the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. In the absence of a recommendation from that Committee, the Minister has no power to include any item on the pharmaceutical benefits list. The obvious reason for this is that it is a matter which requires some expert input. The Minister has a fairly broad based committee which gives him advice. He then has the option of either accepting or rejecting that advice. But he cannot include items which have not been recommended by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee. That Committee also has a capacity to vary its recommendations from time to time. It is therefore possible that particular items may be taken off the list if the Advisory Committee so recommends or if it removes its endorsement of a medication remaining on the list.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those drugs which cost less than the patient contribution automatically come off the list. It could be that as a result of movement in the patient contribution, certain drugs are no longer on the list of pharmaceutical benefits. It sometimes follows that it is different for those holding pensioner cards. There is a separate list for pensioners; it is slightly more extensive but, again, the Minister can act only on the recommendations he receives. It might be helpful if Senator Elstob could make known the medications which are in dispute and about which he is concerned. I can then make specific inquiries in relation to his patient and those medications.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware that Australian Telecommunications Employees Association technical officers have been taking industrial action at the Haymarket telex exchange and that bans have been applied against the remedying of any faults in equipment. I understand the basis of the dispute is that the union is seeking to have the exchange staffed 24 hours a day whereas at present it is staffed for two shifts-16 hours a day-and has been unstaffed between 11 p.m. and 7 a.m. The union has claimed that there is a need for an additional 25 staff.

I understand that Telecom Australia has been negotiating over this issue and that it has offered to undertake a staff review.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A great deal of research has been done here and elsewhere in the world into the use of methane for a variety of purposes. For example, we hope to tap methane from coal mines for use in addition to the ordinary gas supplied as town gas. The various uses of methane from sewage are of particular interest throughout the world. To take one significant example, in China at this moment something like 90 million people derive the energy needs of their villages and towns from the use of methane made from sewage. So it does have a wide use. If we in Australia were to use methane produced from sewage it would not be able to compete as an automotive fuel with either petrol or liquefied petroleum gas because the modifications required for methane use are similar to those for LPG use. For instance, methanol is not compatible with plastic and to use it we would have to make all sorts of alterations to motor car design.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A more logical use for methane derived from sewage is as a source of power, particularly for the treatment plants themselves. That is taking place already in Australia-in Adelaide, at Carrum near Melbourne, and at Bondi. After meeting the plants' own power requirements there is limited surplus gas, if any, for other uses. Apart from sewage, the utilisation of methane from the treatment of industrial and agricultural wastes as a fuel supplement for industry could result in useful energy and cost savings. The National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Council is currently considering proposals in this area. I will look to see whether there are any more technical details regarding automotive use. It is fair to say that one of the more significant uses of methane gas would be in any crisis to turn it into methanol to run automotive vehicles.

<PARA> The Department of National Development and Energy has no greater knowledge of electricity contracts in the various States than is available to the general public.</PARA>
<PARA>With the knowledge that the general public knows very little about this issue because of the secrecy of relevant authorities, including State governments, is the Minister concerned by this situation? I ask the Minister about that part of the report which questions the need and the desirability for special incentives from governments in order to attract more of the aluminium industry to Australia. Given this information, is the Minister concerned that at this very moment the Federal Government may be considering granting additional loan funds to the State Electricity Commission of Victoria to cover any shortfall should Alcoa of Australia Ltd insist on a lower electricity tariff for its smelter at Portland in Victoria? Does the Minister agree in the light of these facts that the Government would need overwhelming reasons for making a decision to force Australian and Victorian taxpayers to subsidise further this impoverished multinational corporation?</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The question of the overall establishment of electric power and power stations in Australia is one that directly concerns my Department and me as a Minister. It is fundamental to whether Australia is to have sufficient electric power to be able to expand its industries for the indefinite future, whatever they may be. To that extent I have said, and I repeat, that I believe the major problem for Australian resource development for the future will not be getting an energy balance in petroleum or hydrocarbons but maintaining sufficient electric power to expand. I say that as a rider. I add that water for the development of electricity is an element of primary importance.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having said that, I say that my Department has been keenly interested in the general question of the financing of electric power stations, for the very good reason that the tariffs charged go towards the repayment of the capital commitments and therefore, depending on the rate of repayment, can facilitate or restrict the forward development of power stations. To that extent my Department has collected of its own accord and by seeking a considerable amount of information-whether it could have more knowledge than the general public is a matter for dispute--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that. The Department has not portrayed itself as having any expert knowledge. It has said, as I would say, that the States have kept tariff charges close to their chests, and that, as they regard commerical and industrial tariffs as being confidential as between the client and the generating authority, they do not release that information. But it is fair to say that we have a keen interest in this matter because, when it comes to Loan Council matters and infrastructure borrowing, of course the Commonwealth has a very real interest indeed. Although I have not read the report I am very conscious of what my Department would have told the Committee. It is true that my Department would be keenly interested to have the maximum amount of expert knowledge on this matter and it has been in continuous discussion with the States on the matter. So that is the basis of the first half of the question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am not aware of any proposition at this moment that Victoria is seeking additional infrastructure borrowing funds as an offset to the problem with Alcoa. That may be one of its suggested approaches for the future, but I am not aware of it at the moment. It therefore follows that I cannot respond to a hypothetical question in that regard. The problem with the generation of electricity in the past has been a fundamental one in that the various State authorities have sought to keep the lowest possible tariffs and to have only a minimum excess of their generating capacity so that they can cope with financing. When it comes to a period in which there is a need to expand, the calculation of my Department is that--</PARA>

That is the one that is facing Victoria. It is the one that is facing many Australian States. I will look at the report of the Senate Standing Committee, especially at page 23.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To date there has been no interference with the payment of pensions in New South Wales or indeed in any other State. There has been some delay in the payment of some benefits, the unemployment and sickness benefits, because of the need for the payment of those to be activated on a fortnightly basis by the beneficiaries. However, the most recent position is that with respect to the cheque run which is almost completed, about 250,000 pension cheques which were due to be printed over recent days have not been printed. They have not been printed and they are not being printed today in Sydney because the officers from the computer centre who are responsible for the work have not reported for duty this morning. Apparently that is at the direction of the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association. It is a very significant fact because, of course, the public statements of the ACOA have been that it is seeking to maintain the payments of pensions and benefits. It is very interesting to look at what was said jointly last week by Barry Cotter, the New South Wales branch secretary, and David Bunn, the Victorian branch secretary. In a Press release last week they stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> ACOA has tried throughout this dispute to minimise hardship to clients. This is in stark contrast to the behaviour of the Department which has carried on its confrontationist policy and stood down substantial numbers of staff.</PARA>
<PARA>As to difficulties with respect to pensions, which in fact were non-existent at that time, they further stated:</PARA>
<PARA> These difficulties have been caused by the standing down of staff who administer pension payments and answer pension enquiries on pension payday.</PARA>
<PARA>That is in stark contrast to the situation where officers who have not been stood down have, at the request or direction of ACOA, not fronted to do the computer run which will produce that quarter of a million cheques. It is a further indication of the total lack of consistency between the statements of the ACOA and the actions of the ACOA. The tactics which are being adopted to disrupt the operations of the Department are disgraceful and are an abrogation of their duties as public servants. In the latest bulletin I have seen, which is dated 23 November, under the heading 'Management rattled as ACOA members stand firm' one finds the marvellous sentence:</PARA>
<PARA> The unpredictable and imaginative nature of the action is keeping Management on the run and minimising stand downs.</PARA>
<PARA>The fact of the matter is that at the moment there is a delay with respect to that run. Of course, consistent with the view I have always expressed that the Government will do everything possible to ensure that payments are maintained to pensioners and beneficiaries, alternative plans are under way which will ensure that pensioners will receive their payments with the minimum possible disruption. These may well become ongoing arrangements as there is no evidence to suggest that the ACOA will cease using pensioners as the innocent pawns for industrial blackmail.</PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate, in the context of this latest ACOA action, that it was Mr Cotter who said last June: 'Do we have to starve pensioners to get wage justice?' It appears to me that the position of the ACOA is now exposed. I challenge it to declare its position on the delay of pension cheques by the holding up of computer runs. I think it is disgraceful behaviour. It will not succeed. I believe that it should be condemned by every member of this Parliament.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have received reports via my Department in the terms which were raised by the honourable senator in his question. The matter has been the subject of consideration by the State Department in New South Wales, which is involved with us in the program under which this refuge and others are funded. At present I have a recommendation from the State Minister not to meet the request of the organisation. I am considering the recommendation of the State Minister, Mr Stewart. If I can get to speak with Mr Stewart today I propose to discuss that matter with him.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I understand it, the position is that the shelter has very substantially increased its outgoings by very substantially raising the salaries of the people who are employed in the shelter. I will not attempt to reproduce the rises from memory, but I can tell the Senate that they are very substantial rises which in no sense relate to the level of funding which was agreed for the balance of this financial year. The shelter has put itself in a situation where it cannot meet or it has not got the funds to meet the increased salaries it has agreed to pay. I have little doubt that the State Department and the State Minister have given the matter careful consideration, as have the officers of my own Department who have forwarded a recommendation to me which I have yet to consider. The matter involves two governments. I hope the fact that they are of different political colours illustrates that it is not a partisan matter. There is a problem. We have had problems aired in this chamber recently of organisations which receive funding at a set level and then proceed to spend at a level which is greatly in excess of that funding. At this stage I can say to the Senate only that I have not made a decision on the request that has been made but I am considering the view that has been put to me. I had a request some time ago to visit the refuge concerned. I find it physically impossible in this portfolio to see all those who request to see me. In this case I suggested that the people concerned should see officers of my Department and I believe contact has been made between the officers and the organisation. I think I am in possession of all of the basic facts and I will be examining them over the next few days. I will also examine the request made by the honourable senator. I understand that the refuge wants an answer by 27 November and I will certainly endeavour to give it consideration within the time requested.</PARA>

It is entirely within the province of a State Government to order its own priorities. In determining funding for this year and when the new health arrangements were made, account was taken of the needs for community health services. Arrangements were made for the amounts which were attributed to community health services to be increased by 10 per cent when the formula was drawn up for the amounts which should be received by the States. Adequate money has been provided for the continuation of community health services. It is entirely a matter for the government of a particular State to determine how it will order its priorities. If the Government of Tasmania has determined that it will set aside a domiciliary nursing service to the detriment of the people of Tasmania that is something for which the Government of Mr Holgate will have to answer; it is not something which is properly referrable to this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 10 November, Senator Sibraa asked me a question about the form of advice received from the Zambian authorities in relation to the death of the Australian Broadcasting Commission journalist Tony Joyce in Zambia. Senator Button asked me a related question. Senator Sibraa reminded me of these questions yesterday when he asked a supplementary question. I can confirm what I said in reply to Senator Sibraa yesterday. The advice received from the Zambian authorities is in fact the letter received by the Prime Minister from President Kaunda. There is no separate report.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The letter cannot be tabled in the Senate for the reasons I have already explained. But it is clear from what the Prime Minister said in the Parliament on 17 September that there are different versions of the facts in relation to the shooting. I confirm to Senator Button that one of the accounts the Government has received is that Tony Joyce was shot while sitting in the back of a Zambian police car. Communications from Australian Foreign Affairs officers overseas are confidential, but in any case in this instance no Australian Foreign Affairs officer was present at the time of the shooting or indeed in Zambia at the time. Therefore, the Prime Minister has commented that it is unlikely that the issue will be fully resolved. Regrettably, that is so. I share that view.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During Question Time, Senator Thomas, in an extraordinary intervention, stated that he had restrained himself while I was asking a question and that he wanted to make it clear that the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources had not recommended the imposition of a national resources tax. As there is a clear implication that I had misled the Senate and suggested that the Committee had so recommended, I wish to make two comments. Firstly, my question asked whether the Minister had noted the plea of the Committee that fresh consideration be given to the imposition of such a tax on behalf of all Australians. Secondly, I quote the one and only paragraph in the report dealing with a national resources tax:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Committee believes that any review of the current taxation applying to resources based industries should include consideration of the use of resource rent tax or other variable tax on profit. Where an industry's profitabality provides a return on its investment significantly greater than that necessary to call forth the investment in the first place then there are valid reasons for considering a higher rate of tax on that 'excess' return on investment. This is particularly the case where, in the provision of services such as electricity to industry, there is some justification for believing that the full value of the resources used to provide that service are not being recovered from the purchaser. In evidence to the Committee the Secretary of the Treasury acknowledged, in an appropriately qualified answer, that in the circumstances outlined above, a resource rent tax would be a suitable mechanism for 'picking up' any excess profit resulting from under pricing of resources and services supplied to industry. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr President, I thank the Senate for allowing me to make it clear that I, in asking my question, really merely repeated the terms of that paragraph within the Senate Committee report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 29 October 1981, Senator Robertson asked me a question concerning funds for the Department of the Parliamentary Library and recommendations of the management review of the departments of the Parliamentary Library, Parliamentary Reporting Staff and Joint House. Funds for the Parliamentary Library and any matters relating to its funds come under the jurisdiction and control of Mr Speaker and me and the Parliamentary Librarian. The Joint House Department has no authority over or responsibility for internal matters of the Parliamentary Library or any other parliamentary department.

No recommendations in connection with amalgamation of functions of the departments have been effected, and, in fact, since my becoming President, certain positions which were proposed to be implemented have not been proceeded with.

The diaries for 1981 and 1982 were manufactured in Hong Kong to that company's specifications. Since 1978, the Department of the Senate has purchased desk diaries from a Canberra firm, which selects an Australian company to supply the diaries on the basis of the lowest available price.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During the hearings of Estimates Committee A, I undertook, in reply to questions from Senator Evans, to consider making a statement to the Senate on the present situation of the staffing of the Department of the Senate and the implementation of the management consultancy review conducted by P.A. Consulting Services Pty Ltd. I now table that statement and, with the concurrence of the Senate, incorporate it in Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The consultant's report was given to my predecessor, Sir Condor Laucke, in July 1980. In accordance with one of the recommendations of the report, he established an implementation committee, consisting of senior officers of the Department of the Senate, which has considered the report and made recommendations, some of which I am in the process of considering.</PARA>
<PARA> A number of the recommendations have already been implemented with success. For example, a procedure section has been established under the control of a principal parliamentary officer (procedure) who also advises non-government Senators on procedural matters. I believe that this arrangement is working most satisfactorily. The previous records and table offices have been amalgamated and restructured as a single unit. It is now a central and more convenient point of contact for the provision of many of the services available for senators and their staff. The amalgamation has also permitted the introduction of improved administrative and staffing practices, with consequent advantages to the Department.</PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with the report of the consultant, there has been some re-arrangement of the responsibilities of certain senior officers. Also, the number of attendant positions has been reduced and the functioning of the attendant staff is being kept under constant review. In addition, many of the minor administrative changes recommended by the consultant have been implemented. I might add that, after the new arrangements have been operating for twelve months, a further review is to be carried out to evaluate their success.</PARA>
<PARA> In the committee secretariat it has not been found possible to implement the recommendations of the consultant. In accordance with the review, the implementation committee held discussions, first with the committee chairmen and, at a later stage, with committee chairmen and Opposition representatives from the committees. It was the unanimous view of these meetings that the consultant's recommendations for the committee secretariat be rejected.</PARA>
<PARA> The consultant did remark, in relation to the Department as a whole, that the existing grades in the Department make career path planning, with desirable interchange and rostering, more difficult and stated that there was a need to devise a means to enable the classifications of the positions in active use to be varied from time to time to meet work and staffing requirements. The consultant also stated that there was a particular need to increase flexibility within the committee secretariat to cope with the inevitable loss of staff, and within the Department as a whole to permit better use of resources.</PARA>
<PARA> The implementation committee has had discussions with the committee chairmen and Opposition representatives on this matter and discussions are to be held with officers of the Public Service Board to try to resolve the difficulties inherent in the inflexible staff structure currently existing in the Department.</PARA>
<PARA> Discussions with officers of the Public Service Board will also cover two other areas within the departmental structure which either the implementation committee considers that the consultant's review has not adequately covered or to which, because of changing circumstances, it cannot agree. These areas are-relief staff, and the secretarial services available to senators and to the Department, including increased and new uses of word processors. It is anticipated that these problems will be overcome satisfactorily in due course.</PARA>
<PARA> Staffing problems associated with the establishment by the Senate of three select committees have been resolved. A number of temporary positions have been created to staff these committees and a temporary increase in the Senate staff ceiling has been approved for the duration of the inquiries.</PARA>
<PARA> Since the consultant presented the report in 1980, demands on the Senate staff have altered and, in certain areas, have increased. This has been caused by a number of factors, not the least of which, has been the change in composition of the Senate since July 1981. I have instructed my officers to keep Senate staffing under a constant review and to advise me immediately any problems arise. In this way I hope to ensure that all the services currently provided to the Senate and to senators are not only maintained at their present level but, if possible, are improved. To this end, to my knowledge and observation, all Senate staff are co-operating to the full extent in instituting and developing the changed staffing and functional arrangements.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The topic of this matter of public importance has just been read to the Senate. I must say right at the outset that in the terminology used-'the consistent incompetence and impropriety of the Fraser Government'-there is perhaps a slight error. This matter of public importance was drafted in the early hours of the morning in circumstances which might be described as less than favourable for the most lucid expression of what one intended to say. I think I should have said 'the inconsistent incompetence and inconsistent impropriety of the Fraser Government' rather than using the word 'consistent'. When one moves about this country talking to people in the electorate, one learns that one of the great concerns which they have, whether they be in business or employees of business, or whatever walk of life they come from, is a growing concern about the inconsistencies in the Government's policies. They are asking: 'Where is it all going? What on earth is going to happen next under this Government?'</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, in a sense, if I may borrow an expression from Sir Charles Court, it would be almost a state of excitement were it not so tragic in terms of what this Government's policies are doing to the economy, to business confidence, to the social fabric of Australian society and to the poorer sections of the Australian community by massive transfers of wealth in one form or another from the poorer to the wealthier sections of society. The notion of incompetence and impropriety is, in a sense, not entirely mine. I think the point I wish to make on that issue is very well illustrated by a statement released last week not by some radical fringe group in Australian society but by the Confederation of Australian Industry. It expressed concern that its commitments were in jeopardy because of changes of policy by the Fraser Government. In that statement the Confederation of Australian Industry said:</PARA>
<PARA> What is even more disturbing is that these about-face decisions are usually preceded not by an announcement by the responsible Minister but by what is now a recognisable pattern of rumours and leaks which in turn mostly end up being correct. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that statement contains every element of an allegation of inconsistency and change in the Government's policy. This tragic level of performance by what even the least charitable of us would describe as a once great party is sad. It is sad that we have to raise these issues on the last sitting day of the Senate before Christmas. We would have liked to send honourable senators opposite away with a cheery message, but I am afraid that course is not open to us. </PARA>
<PARA> I see that Senator Carrick has been drawn to the barricades yet again to defend this shonky and incompetent Government, to answer the allegations which we will make about these issues and which I will be making in the course of my remarks. I know what the defence will be, because Senator Carrick has only one defence. He reaches in his grab bag of supportive allegations and he goes back to the period of the Labor Government. He says: 'But look, people were saying these things about the last Labor Government from 1972 to 1975. What is wrong with us? We have an alibi'. He will say: 'A Labor Government was like this too'. Organisations like the Confederation of Australian Industry were saying these things about--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We would be quite happy to if Senator Thomas wants us to but we do not need to because we have limited time and last year's record will suffice. Last year, seeking re-election, Mr Fraser said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The central objective of the Government's policy is to reduce inflation. </PARA>
<PARA>This year's Fraser Budget predicts that inflation will rise to 10 3/4 per cent-a modest prediction in the likely circumstances. Last year before the election Mr Fraser promised increasing employment and reduced unemployment. On page 55 of the Budget statements for 1981-82-the Government's Budget-a slackening of employment growth and little change in unemployment are predicted. In fact, unemployment is increasing. Last year Mr Fraser promised to keep taxes at the lowest possible level. This year's Budget increases sales tax by 40 per cent and pay-as-you-earn tax by over 20 per cent. This year's Budget belies the promises made last year before the election. No wonder Mr Hugh Morgan, the Chairman of the Australian Mining Industry Council, commenting on the Budget, said that this Government does not understand what it is doing. Last year Mr Fraser promised to:</PARA>
<PARA> Distribute the tax burden as far as possible, with particular concern for low income families. </PARA>
<PARA>In fact, Budget tax increases have been assiduously directed towards the less wealthy section of the Australian community. Taxes have hit low income families with one and two children more than anyone else, not to mention the absence of housing policies of this Government and not to mention the failure to honour promises about family allowances. Not to mention any of those things, taxation policies alone have hit families most and low income families most of all. These are some of the broad indicators of the rhetoric and performance of this Government over the last 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at some of the aspects of the Government's administration of its own departments. The Holcroft Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares, for example, was abandoned and the committee members were left to hang out to dry because this Government wanted to look after some friends. Sir Peter Abeles was probably the first businessman to walk into a Liberal Party meeting and address it about his interests. That was why the Holcroft Inquiry was abandoned. We can look at Australia Post, an area of government responsibility. For the first time in the history of that organisation it made a loss last year and, at the same time, this Government hived off its most profitable activity, the Australia Post Courier Service-again at the instigation of a company, Thomas Nationwide Transport Ltd of whom, I think, Sir Peter Abeles, coincidentally, happens to be managing director. That is what happened to Australia Post this year. </PARA>
<PARA> Telecom Australia has had severe interest rate impositions placed on it this year by this Government. The McKinsey report on Telecom, which this Government has ignored, recommends additional capital for Telecom. This was a Government commissioned report which the Government would not release. I released it in the Senate. This year in relation to Telecom we have seen such incidents as the giving of viewdata, which was to be operated by Telecom in conjunction with a wide range of private enterprise companies, to private monopolies run by Packer and Myer. In today's paper we see that Australian Consolidated Press Ltd, as represented by Mr Packer, now wants to retreat from that position and get on Telecom's back again in the running of viewdata. That decision about viewdata which goes to the heart of dissemination of information in a free society and to the heart of profitability for an organisation such as Telecom, was made against the advice of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, against the advice of the Department of Communications, and against the advice of the Department of the Treasury. It was made by Cabinet against all that advice, and it was made in particular by the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair). </PARA>
<PARA> The people of Australia are beginning to ask why? The answer is that that question would not be asked by the people of Australia if this Government faced up to such issues as the freedom of information legislation which it has virtually abandoned despite its electoral promises, if it would face up, as other democracies such as the United States have done, to the issue of the disclosure of funds made available to political parties. That is why people are very suspicious about decisions made by the Minister for Communications. That is an issue which this Government has to face up to. Where is the money coming from?</PARA>
<PARA> Another example of the Government's incompetence relates to the broadcasting and television legislation which was introduced into this Parliament last week. This is the second set of broadcasting and television Bills to be introduced. The first Bill having been abandoned, the legislation was amended as a result of pressure from a particular media proprietor. That legislation goes to the integrity of the Government's Budget because it reduces the Government's revenue at the instigation of one media proprietor. The Government is immovable on the question of sales tax on such things as books, children's shoes and clothing, all issues which are relevant to the mass of the Australian people and their standard of living. It is not immovable when it comes to pressure from a very powerful and wealthy vested interest in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The report of another government instrumentality, Qantas Airways Ltd, was tabled in the Senate last week. The financial directive to Qantas by the Australian Government, which is crucial to its operations, has been under discussion for five years and has not yet been made public. That is very relevant to questions relating to Qantas's accounting and financial performance, a performance which is bad. Another semi-government instrumentality, Trans-Australia Airlines, is now reducing services to the outback of Queensland. Questions are suddenly being asked in this place about TAA's services, and properly so. Senator Bjelke-Petersen is acknowledging that I acknowledge her questions on this point. Those services are being reduced as a result of Government policies in relation to Trans-Australia Airlines. It is something about which we warned this chamber six or nine months ago, but the Government was not then prepared to take the warning. It has now happened. In the last year we have seen the farce of the so-called razor gang, which was a public relations gimmick. This Government is devoted to public relations gimmicks as distinct from real policies. It was an amateurishly compiled exercise abolishing 40 committees, three-quarters of which were created by Liberal governments, and half of which were created by the Fraser Government. Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, in answer to that allegation, said that a government is entitled to change its mind. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right, to see the error of its ways. But that is precisely what business and industry are complaining about. Quite recently Sir Roderick Carnegie said words to the effect that this Government continually changes the ground rules. As Mr Max Burr, the Liberal Federal member for Wilmot in Tasmania has put it, the Government on many issues is firing from the hip with ad hoc policy decisions that do not seem to correspond perhaps with other policy decisions that have been made in the past. Nobody knows where the Government is going because it has no sense of direction itself. It keeps changing its minds on these important issues. Another example is the continued loss to revenue arising from tax avoidance. Last year the Government saved $1.5m because of its staff ceilings policy in the Taxation Office. At the same time millions of dollars-an estimated $46.5m for last year-are lost through tax avoidance schemes which cannot be followed up because of inadequate staff ceilings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another area of Government policy which is very important to consider is that of industrial relations because it illustrates the Fraser Government style. The Government talks up and beats up issues but it has no policies on and no creative imagination about the issues that ought to be involved. Let us look at the 35-hour working week issue which was debated in the Senate earlier this year. Senator Carrick talked his head off about how the Government would make a stand on this issue. I refer honourable senators to what Alcoa said to the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission a fortnight ago. A newspaper article which dealt with the hearing before the Arbitration Commission stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government failed to honour its promise of support to Alcoa earlier this year when the company sought assistance in resisting the shorter hours campaign . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Ian Douglas QC detailed a series of futile negotiations between the company and the Federal Government in April and May on the question of support in countering the hours campaign. </PARA>
<PARA>The article went on at great length and pointed out that this Government talked big about that issue but when the crunch came it went to water and left those companies out on a limb. That is not an industrial relations policy. That is consistent with the rhetoric and empty headedness of this Government and nothing else. This Government has built up in industrial relations the greatest armoury of weapons for use in industrial disputes that any government has ever had but the record of disputes remains the same. Nothing has happened on this issue except a lot of noisy wind from Government spokesmen. </PARA>
<PARA> During this year we saw the Prime Minister, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Anthony) and the Treasurer (Mr Howard) boasting of cheating the Premiers out of $70m. We have seen scandal after scandal revealed from National Country Party Ministers in the administration of their portfolios. Ministers have received the benefit of low interest housing loans on which they pay virtually no repayments at all. We have seen decisions relating to Telecom dictated not by advice but by venality on behalf of particular Ministers. We have seen a decision in relation to telecommunications on Lord Howe Island-one suspects, overriding Telecom-made by the Minister for Communications for some motive which has not been publicly revealed but which is not consistent with orderly policy making. We have seen the Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd situation. He has moved from funeral parlours to dairies. The Minister for Communications follows his mafioso career.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw. This issue of the National Country Party and the Liberal Party is of crucial importance to this Government because the Prime Minister has standards about the Country Party which are different from the standards which he himself has laid down and has applied to people such as Senator Withers, who sits in this place. That is a very important consideration in government policy making. This year we also had the Peacock resignation. That is another issue which paralyses the decision-making of this Government. The Industries Assistance Commission report on the car industry has not been responded to by the Government because the Prime Minister does not know where the Peacock voters will go in the Liberal Party caucus. That is what is paralysing the Government in its decision-making on this issue, as it is on industrial relations issues. So, we have great conflicts within the Government: An abandonment of standards of principle previously prescribed by the Prime Minister to help his friends and an abandonment of standards of government to protect the Prime Minister from revolt within his own ranks. This Government has ignored the interests of the Australian people. It looks after its great and powerful friends by operating a system of patronage. It indulges in costly overseas stunts to conceal those issues and projects a phony nationalism as a gigantic fraud on the Australian people.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Over the past six years the people of Australia, through the ballot box by an overwhelming majority, have put into office and re-elected the Fraser Liberal-National Country Party Government. Let the test be this: The judgment was made by the 7 million or 8 million people of Australia at the ballot box and not by the fruity melodrama of Senator Button. That judgment was made in favour of the competence and integrity and the imaginative policies of the existing Government. I will deal step by step with the matters raised by Senator Button. I would not want to disappoint Senator Button who, of course, always asks me to go back to the past. So I will go back to 1979. On 18 July 1979, the Leader of the Federal Opposition, Mr Hayden, said of the Whitlam Labor Government:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . as a Government we disappointed and disillusioned many Australians by some of our actions, our individual excesses in the period 1973 to 1975. </PARA>
<PARA>I stress the words 'we disappointed and dis- illusioned many Australians by our actions, our individual excesses . . .'. That was a statement to the Australian Labor National Conference on 18 July 1979, a mea culpa from the heart of the Labor leader. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button now raises this matter of public importance. Let me state the positive aspects concerning this Government. This Government has had re-endorsement at the ballot box on three occasions; two of them by extraordinary majorities. The Budget which has just been brought down has been commended by virtually every prominent and authoritative economist and financial writer in Australia as being a Budget that was correct for the circumstances and in the interests of the people of Australia. Our economy has been commended in reports of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and by nations abroad as one of the best run economies in the free world, an economy which some six years ago had been placed by the Whitlam Government in the top bracket of inflation. Mr Hawke referred to inflation running at 16 per cent or 17 per cent at the time. I suppose the Opposition would accept those figures as being correct. It has now been reduced to 9 per cent or 10 per cent. I repeat that our economy has been commended. Our Budget aims to do two things. It aims to take Australia out of the top bracket of inflation, where it was put by the Whitlam Labor Government, and to put it in the lower quarter of the scale of OECD countries. That is what we are doing. </PARA>
<PARA> We have witnessed some extraordinary situations. There has been talk of some inconsistencies of the Government. It has been said that manufacturers have had some problems with this Government. Let me give honourable senators some information on this matter. Mr Willis, a spokesman for the Australian Labor Party, was reported in the Sydney Morning Herald on 18 July 1979 as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> We just can't keep on supporting small manufacturing industries all the time with protection. </PARA>
<PARA>We now know that that is the Labor Party's policy, and the Leader of the Opposition stated that. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, Mr Lionel Bowen, in a speech to the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> We must accept that in the future a more efficient manufacturing industry may involve fewer workers. </PARA>
<PARA>I think some mention was made that this Government was not reducing tax enough. It is worthwhile remembering these things. In the Australian Financial Review of 29 June 1972, Mr Hayden, the now Leader of the Labor Party, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> As a purely personal statement, I'm a high tax man. </PARA>
<PARA>Addressing the Labor Economists Conference, Brisbane in June 1978, Mr Willis said:</PARA>
<PARA> If Labor does not gain office next election then by 1983, when we could next hope to gain office, we would face a mammoth task in rebuilding the public sector-and maybe an equally mammoth task in convincing the electorate that it should pay a higher level of tax to enable us to do so. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was said by Mr Willis when he addressed the Labor Economists Conference, Brisbane in June 1978. I think there was some suggestion that indirect taxation increases are wrong. Mr Hurford, in the Age of 29 June 1977, is quoted as saying:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When it comes to further revenue we will seek to find it, in progressive ways, from indirect taxes. </PARA>
<PARA>We have a situation in which a government which failed and which by its leader's statement indulged in all sorts of excesses and failures is now saying in Opposition: 'Look here you fellows, you are doing these things the wrong way'. I pointed out earlier that we have been commended overseas for what has happened. What has happened in Australia since the Labor Party went out of office in 1975 is that whereas in 1974-75 there was a massive shedding of employees from manufacturing industry-120,000 to 150,000 people in the space of 12 months or less by vicious across the board 25 per cent tariff cuts, against protection-the party responsible, the Labor Party, is now saying: 'You have not got your manufacturing policies in tight order'. We had a situation in which a government was thrown out of office. Senator Button referred to scandals. Why was it thrown out? It was thrown out because of the massive culmination of disaster after disaster. Ministers were thrown out and turned over by Mr Whitlam, and resigned. Finally there was the Khemlani loan affair which is recognised by every right-thinking person as a massive breach of principle, a scandal perhaps of a magnitude greater than anything we have had in Australia. This is the party which on what may be the last day of this session is trying to gain some capital. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button said: 'You do not have an industrial relations policy'. In 1974-75 the Labor Party had a troika in industrial relations. It was in government and had the industrial relations portfolio. It had an Australian Council of Trade Unions President named Mr Hawke. It had as Federal President of the ALP the same Mr Hawke. It had the capacity within the unions, within the Government and within the Labor Party, with absolutely no restriction at all, to resolve industrial relations at every point in Australia. Six million working days were lost then, the record for all time. We reduced it to one million. </PARA>
<PARA> The Labor Party has had the sheer gall to come here and talk about industrial relations despite the fact that when the Labor Party was in government and had, I repeat, an industrial relations Minister and as Federal President of the Labor Party a person who was the ACTU President it had, with the combination of all powers in its hands, the record industrial strife and turmoil of all time. Now members of the Labor Party come to us and say that these things are wrong. Now they try to drum up talk of scandal. It is important to remember that it is all innuendo. There is nothing that they can tangibly raise except repetition. The situation now is quite different from the Khemlani situation. The absolute tragedy of that time is now documented. I think the word 'shonky' was used to describe the dealings. Was there ever such a shonky dealing as the behind the scenes dealing giving unduly high commission, mortgaging Australia for the indefinite future, running an Executive Council illegally, and refusing to tell the Governor-General of the day what was being done? This is the party that has the gall on the last day of sitting to talk of scandal. </PARA>
<PARA> What has it raised? Telecom Australia has said, and it is quite clear, that the policies it makes as to the direction of its telephone public works are its policies and not those of the Minister as such. The Opposition talks about Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd but it can produce nothing on this matter. One after another Opposition senators talk innuendo. Stripped down, what have we? We have a situation in which six years ago they were flung out of office and twice since then that decision has been reconfirmed in a very substantial way. They have condemned themselves by their own statements on every one of these policies that they have raised today. Against that we have a government which took the highest inflation that Australia was facing in that period and virtually halved it. It is bearing down on inflation. Of course it will cut expenditure in doing so. If it is to stop the proliferation of public works borrowings and if it is to take the heat out of public loan raising, the first thing it has to do is to reduce its own deficit so that it does not have to go into the market and borrow in public loans, pushing up interest rates. It can leave the public loan borrowing market to those of the private sector to borrow for the creation of more jobs and more industry. That has been eminently successful. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government is the government that over the decades created the highest home ownership of any country in the world. It did so by enabling the ordinary families of Australia to amass their little capital, which was sneered at by the Dedmans of this world who did not want little capitalists as such. We have always put the thrust in that way. Now, by the empty rhetoric, come these phrases: 'But we do not care about the little people. We do not care about the poor. We care only about big business'. Let me say without any qualification that the overwhelming bulk of the great social welfare legislation and innovations in Australia has been brought about by governments of Liberal faith. Governments of Liberal faith brought in age pensions, widows' pensions, child endowment, pharmaceutical benefits, medical and health benefits and so on. It was this Fraser Government that brought in the family allowance scheme and this Fraser Government which, in this Budget, extended the scheme. If we look, one by one, at the types of legislation that have been brought down in Australia, the picture emerges. Labor talked and talked land rights for Aborigines but which State governments and which Commonwealth government introduced land rights for Aborigines? The South Australian Liberal Government did so. Where does the Wran Labor Government stand on this issue? It is dragging its heels in this situation. The Fraser Liberal Government is showing world leadership on a massive scale on this issue in the Northern Territory. So we have talk on the one part and action on the other. </PARA>
<PARA> If people are looking for a government which has looked and acted with true concern, they must look to the Fraser Government. It is easy and cheap to talk. The Labor Party, over all its history, has put over a massive confidence trick. It has talked about how it is the friend of the workers but it destroyed living standards in 1973, 1974 and 1975. If people want to look at some real legislation which has been put in place and if they want to look at the way in which industrial trade unionism as distinct from political trade unionism has been strengthened, they must look to governments of Liberal faith. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at what the Leader of the Opposition has said. First of all, he talked about there being a lack of confidence in the community. I can only say that time and time again over the past year, in conferences at Cabinet level with business leaders in this country, business leaders have said without qualification, even up to and including the last few days: 'Your Budget was absolutely right. Your Budget with its emphasis on bearing down on inflation and interest rates was absolutely right'. Commerce and industry in Australia know that the policies which we have put in place are the best policies for Australia. The people of Australia know that the way in which to help them, the way in which to ensure that their living standards continue to rise and the way in which to ensure that they can buy homes and acquire more property is to have lower inflation and an abatement of interest rates. </PARA>

By positive action, this Government moves on and on with policies which will benefit the Australian people. It is not for nothing that the countries of the Western world are looking to Australia today as a major hope in terms of resource development to create for them the opportunities for the safeguarding of their own living standards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What we have seen is Senator Button getting up day by day in this chamber exploiting this so-called urgency motion technique, using the rhetoric of melodrama and the abandonment of fact. He supports a leader who says that he is a high tax man. He supports a spokesman who says that small business must go. 'We can't', says Mr Willis, 'keep on supporting small manufacturing industries all the time with protection'. If Senator Button wants to have the kinds of scandals of the past, of course, his blueprint is there. He can back the kinds of industrial relations policies that were the most disastrous in history because the most over promoted individual figure in Australian political and public life, the man who was the President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Federal President of the Australian Labor Party, and who is now a front bench Opposition member in the other place, failed completely when he had the opportunity to do something about the situation. When the Labor Party had the opportunities it failed completely. Now all it has to put forward is the rhetoric of melodramatic nonsense. The fact is that the very health of the economy, the very resilience of business, commerce and industry in this country and the very attraction to this country of foreign investment support the fact that our policies are right and that Labor's policies remain condemned.

The only substantial outstanding matters in all of these reports are those concerning the Australian Wheat Board. This has been an ongoing problem and one on which numerous reports have been delivered in the Senate on behalf of the Committee by Senator Rae. </PARA>
<PARA> Although clearly there has been negligent administration within the Wheat Board in previous years, and I suppose in the Department of Primary Industry, to which it is responsible, the Wheat Board has a continuing problem in accurately determining the stocks which it holds and therefore in presenting accurate financial statements. The problem is that the Board has no effective control over its licensed receivers. The licensed receiver is usually a State-wide grain handling authority although in some cases it is not. Some of the State-wide grain handling authorities are co-operative companies. Some are statutory bodies appointed by State governments. </PARA>
<PARA> In the past some of these licensed receivers, regrettably, seem to have been more concerned with asserting their perceived territorial rights than with efficient administration. It is to be hoped that in the future commonsense will prevail in negotiations between the Wheat Board and its State licensed receivers and that mutually acceptable means will be devised by which the Board can accurately determine its stocks and therefore accurately report its financial position. </PARA>

<PARA>AUSTRALIAN MARINE SCIENCE</PARA>
<PARA>REPORT FROM THE SENATE STANDING COMMITTEE ON SCIENCE AND THE ENVIRONMENT</PARA>
<PARA>Statement by Senator the Hon. Peter Durack, Q.C., Minister Representing the Minister for Science and Technology</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment tabled its report concerning Australian Marine Science on 11 June 1981. The Government has considered the Report and noted carefully its recommendations. I am pleased now to present the Government's response to the report. I seek leave to table a document which presents the Government's response to each recommendation and to incorporate it in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government views the report as a substantial and valuable contribution to the development of policies for marine science in Australia. Its 45 recommendations present a detailed plan for the co-ordination and future development of Australian Marine Science. The Government is pleased to note that many elements of the report's recommendations are already the subject of government initiatives or are matters presently under consideration by the Government and its advisory bodies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government fully supports what it believes to be the Committee's broad objective which underlies its detailed recommendations, namely, the continued development of a viable, effective and productive Australian marine science program. The Government does not, however, at this time accept some of the specific solutions proposed by the Senate Committee, particularly as these relate to the establishment of a statutory Marine Science Council and its subsidiary bodies. These elaborate arrangements are considered not to be warranted by the present and near-future scale of Australia's marine science, and their establishment would be contrary to the Government's policy of financial restraint and its concern to reduce the number of statutory bodies. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government recognises that Australia's marine science effort should be concentrated on matters of high national priority to produce results of direct benefit to Australia. To achieve this the Government will ensure that all available resources are used in the most effective way. To gain maximum benefit we must also ensure that the results of this concerted effort are not only readily available to those who can make use of them, but are also in a form which meets their needs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's commitment to meeting these objectives is amply demonstrated by the actions it has taken in recent years. Many of these are described in the document I have tabled. It is both significant and gratifying that these initiatives are generally in accord with the Committee's recommendations for the future development of Australian marine science. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like now to draw attention to some of the more important aspects of the Government response to the Senate Committee's report. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps the most wide-ranging recommendations in the report concern the establishment of a Marine Science Council having a combined advisory, policy-development, financing and co-ordinating role. As I have stated, the Government fully recognises the need for a comprehensive marine science policy and agrees with the Committee that this should be based on the best available advice. This requires the co-ordination of up-to-date information from all sectors of the community concerned with marine science. However, the Government does not believe that, at this time, a Marine Science Council provides the most appropriate way to carry out these functions. </PARA>
<PARA> The mechanisms established by the Government to develop advice on which to base marine science policies and to implement such policies are in many instances relatively recent and are of a scale commensurate with our current marine science effort. Moreover, these mechanisms are such as to lend themselves to further development as the overall marine science effort evolves. The Government proposes that the Committee's Report serve as a useful paradigm, in some instances, perhaps even a blueprint to guide this development. </PARA>
<PARA> Some changes have already taken place aimed at improving the effectiveness and flexibility of policy and funding advisory bodies. The Australian Marine Sciences and Technologies Advisory Committee which was established as a standing committee of ASTEC now reports directly to the Minister for Science and Technology, while special funding for marine science and technology projects have been co-ordinated by amalgamating the Funding Advisory Panel of AMSTAC with the Queen's Fellowship in Marine Science Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes that AMSTAC has functioned to good effect. AMSTAC's terms of reference provide a broad charter for it to draw information from any source it judges appropriate when developing its advice to Government. In doing this AMSTAC has used a range of mechanisms including workshops, the establishment of specialised working groups, consultation with experts and the wide circulation of discussion papers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Committee's report rightly puts great emphasis on the need to co-ordinate advice from the regions and from individual marine science disciplines. We appreciate this need, but believe that the committee structure recommended in the report, while being more elaborate and potentially more costly than present arrangements provides no guarantee of being more effective by gaining access to a wider source of information, of providing a sounder source of advice or of meeting needs more efficiently than is presently achieved by AMSTAC. Indeed, the increased formality of the proposed mechanism might well inhibit the collection of frank and timely advice. In taking note of the Committee's recommendations, however, the Government will consider whether the resources currently available to AMSTAC are adequate. The Government would not wish to inhibit AMSTAC from taking further initiatives in liaison, consultation and co-ordination to ensure that its advice comprehends views from all relevant sources. AMSTAC is giving increased attention to canvassing the views of the users of marine science data and information, as well as research workers and administrators in various regions and disciplines. </PARA>
<PARA> We have given particular attention to the Committee's recommendations concerning the establishment of a Ship Operations Unit. Research vessels are costly to acquire and operate. They should be utilised as fully as possible, subject, of course, to the necessary considerations of scientific and cost effectiveness. Since the proposed CSIRO oceanographic vessel alone has been designated as a national facility up to the present and we do not, therefore, consider it necessary to establish a Ship Operations Unit. In reaching this decision we have noted that overseas experience indicates that research vessels are best managed by their respective major user. However, the Government supports the view that user committees be established by organisations managing a research vessel designated as a national facility. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Committee has recommended that a centralised Information Services Unit be established. We fully support the view that a marine science program can be effective only to the extent that the data and information it produces are made available to those who need them. However the Government does not believe that centralisation at this time provides the most effective solution. As a first step towards improving the management of marine science information the Department of Science and technology is compiling an inventory of marine science data banks and a directory of current marine research projects. Working Groups of AMSTAC are also examining aspects of this general problem in greater detail. </PARA>
<PARA> One very important aspect of marine science information services identified by the Senate Committee relates to the need for basic oceanographic data on tides, currents, wave climates surges, etc. Such data are required by all agencies involved in the use and management of the sea and its resources. The general lack of such data is a matter of considerable concern which the Minister for Science and Technology has under detailed consideration at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like also to mention those recommendations which advocate that certain fields of research should receive increased priority and funding in the context of a national marine science program. Some of these fields concern research directed towards solving practical problems, such as marine pollution. Others highlight the need to develop a more profound understanding of fundamental marine processes and to collect routine oceanographic data to support activities such as the management of marine resources, design of coastal engineering works and the conservation of the marine environment. These recommendations are welcomed and are consistent with the Government's views. Indeed, the allocation of marine sciences and techologies grants for 1981-82 is evidence of that consistency. But I would emphasise that priority areas will also be strengthened by the other Government actions I have mentioned earlier and by those initiatives detailed in the document I have tabled. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, the Government welcomes the Senate Committee's report as a most useful contribution to the continuing development of policies for marine science. </PARA>
<PARA> The Report will remain a useful reference document, of value not only to the Government but also the the marine science community. The Government will continue to take into account the Report's recommendations and to assess their appliability to meeting the emerging needs of Australian marine science as it continues to develop and new actions and initiatives by the Government are seen to be required. </PARA>
<PARA>Government Response to Recommendations</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 1-An Australian Marine Science Council be established. This Council would: operate as the national adviser on marine science matters, especially in the areas of policy development; co-ordinate marine science research efforts; liaise with similar bodies overseas; and finance marine science research projects. </PARA>
<PARA> Response-The Government considers that a Marine Science Council as proposed by the Senate Committee is not appropriate at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> Recent initiatives of the Government have demonstrated its strong commitment to develop a worthwhile, effective and cohesive marine science program. Support has been given to the relocation of the headquarters of CSIRO's marine research facilities in new laboratories in Hobart and to the acquisition by CSIRO of a specialised oceanographic research ship to be operated as a national facility. The Antarctic Division of the Department of Science and Technology has been transferred to new facilities in Kingston, Tasmania, and is being developed as a centre of excellence in Southern Ocean marine biology. The Australian Maritime College in Launceston was established by Commonwealth legislation in 1978 to provide for maritime and maritime related education and training for the shipping, fishing and allied industries. Substantial new resources have been directed to increasing our knowledge of the Australian Fishing Zone and a large part of this assistance is being channelled through CSIRO's Division of Fisheries Research. The Australian Institute of Marine Science has had its staffing levels increased and is endeavouring to establish for itself a major scientific reputation as a centre of tropical marine research. The new structure of the Bureau of Mineral Resources, Geology and Geophysics will include a Division of Marine Geosciences and Petroleum Geology; funds have been allocated for the Bureau to undertake a major geophysical survey of Bass Basin. Additional resources have been provided for the work of the Navy Hydrographer and the Division of National Mapping to accelerate the charting of Australia's marine areas. These operational developments have been supported by the development of policy advisory mechanisms. Special funding has been provided for marine science and technology projects for allocation on the advice of the Funding Advisory Panel of the Australian Marine Sciences and Technologies Advisory Committee. For greater flexibility this panel has now been amalgamated with the Queens's Fellowships in Marine Science Committee. As a result of the recent Review of Commonwealth Functions AMSTAC now reports to the Minister for Science and Technology. This has served to consolidate marine sciences and technologies advisory and funding functions within a single Ministry that has also an operational role. </PARA>
<PARA> These arrangements are the result of recent initiatives designed to cope with the present and near-future level of marine science activity. The considerable cost and disruption that would be involved in setting up a Marine Science Council are not justified at the present stage of development of Australian marine science. Acceptance of these recommendations would also be contrary to the Government's policy of financial restraint and its concern to reduce the number of statutory bodies. Existing institutional arrangements, including AMSTAC exercising a co-ordinating role and providing advice on marine sciences programs and priorities, are considered adequate for meeting present needs. The Government believes that AMSTAC already has functioned to good effect and with continuing support will become even more effective. The organisational model and concept proposed in this and related recommendations, though inappropriate at present, may have a place at some future time as Australia's marine science effort evolves. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 2-The Australian Marine Science Council co-ordinates research efforts through Regional and Marine Sciences Committees and an Advisory Committee. The Council, through its Executive and Secretariat, would be responsible for operating an Information Services Unit and a Ship Operations Unit. The Council would also manage the two proposed Research Institutes, presently operating as the Australian Institute of Marine Science and the CSIRO Divisions of Fisheries Research and Oceanography. </PARA>
<PARA> Response-See Response to Recommendations 1 and 15. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 3-The Australian Institute of Marine Science Act 1972 be repealed and replaced with an Australian Marine Science Act. This Act would contain such provisions as are necessary to enable the Australian Marine Science Council to fulfil its proposed functions. </PARA>
<PARA> Response-See comment on Recommendation 1. The Government does not consider these legislative changes are necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 4-A Marine Science Research Endowment Bill be enacted to establish a Marine Science Research and Development Fund. The Australian Marine Science Council would be responsible for advising the Minister for Science and Technology on the administration of the Fund. </PARA>
<PARA> Response-Not accepted. The Government does not believe that the establishment of a Marine Science Research and Development Fund would offer any advantage over existing funding mechanisms. Such a Fund would account for only part of the Commonwealth's total expenditure on marine science research. It could not comprehend Tertiary Education Commission and Australian Research Grants Committee funding of marine science for example, and would have no effect on State or private sector funding activities. The Government considers that a plurality of funding mechanisms helps to maintain a proper balance of funding availability between research, development and routine monitoring. In certain circumstances amalgamation of funding sources may be desirable to increase the flexibility of funding. For this reason AMSTAC-FAP and Queen's Fellowships in marine science have already been amalgamated. Co-ordination between Commonwealth funding agencies already occurs, and ensures that proposals are transferred to the most appropriate agency. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 5-A small Secretariat be made available by the Department of Science and Technology to provide administrative support for the Council. </PARA>
<PARA> Response-See comment on Recommendation 1. The Department of Science and Technology provides secretariat support for AMSTAC. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 6-Four marine science regions be identified. These regions would be based on northern, eastern, southern and western waters. </PARA>
<PARA> Response-See response to Recommendation 8. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 7-Four Regional Committees be established, comprising representatives for all major marine science agencies in each region. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recognises that two streams of committees will be necessary: one stream to co-ordinate and advise on a regional basis; and the other stream to deal with special disciplines in marine science. Recommendations 8-12 refer to these committees. </PARA>
<PARA> Response-See response to Recommendation 8. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 8-The role of the Regional Committees be: to co-ordinate research activities within the region, to the extent of advising the Council of any overlap; to provide a means of encouraging co-operation and liaison between researchers and agencies in that region; to ensure that individuals or organisations seeking finance for marine science have access to the financing process; to advise the Council of areas of research, or research projects, which they consider are worthy of support, and to generally represent the region's interest. </PARA>
<PARA> Response-The Government recognises the need for the co-ordination of regional advice but believes that the Committee's proposed regions are not an adequate reflection of the scale, complexity and natural regionalisation of Australia's continental margin, of the very different priorities attached to the scientific study of particular regions (such as the Barrier Reef, Bass Strait and the North-West Shelf) or of the location of existing and proposed facilities around the Australian coast. The proposed Committee structure would be unduly cumbersome and expensive. AMSTAC's terms of reference provide a sufficiently broad charter for it to obtain necessary information from regional, sectoral and disciplinary sources when developing its advice to Government. AMSTAC is expected to give increasing consideration to specific regional research needs and priorities. Already AMSTAC is moving to cultivate closer links with regional organisations such as the Antarctic Research Policy Advisory Committee, the various committees concerned with the Great Barrier Reef, regional committees of the Australian Fisheries Council, the Victorian Institute of Marine Sciences and other state-oriented marine science agencies.</PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 9-Appropriate Marine Sciences Committees be established. These Committees would include the interests of the following areas: marine biology; fisheries research and technology; marine geosciences; oceanography; marine taxonomy; coastal and ocean engineering; and marine environmental studies. </PARA>
<PARA> Response-See comment on Recommendation 10. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 10-The role of the Marine Sciences Committees be: to co-ordinate research activities undertaken in their field and to reduce unnecessary duplication of research; to operate as an information source to researchers by providing resumes of current research being undertaken in the field; to encourage joint research projects across agencies and regions; to ensure that individuals or organisations seeking finance for marine science research have access to the financing process; to advise the Council of areas of research, or research projects, which they consider are worthy of support; and to generally represent the discipline's interests. </PARA>
<PARA> Response-See comment on Recommendations 1, 6, 7 and 8. The Government believes that co-ordination of research activities is best achieved by ensuring that operating agencies receive effective support for scientific collaboration and for encouraging and facilitating contacts between working scientists through the promotion of conferences and workshops, and the dissemination of information. Inadequate co-ordination and collaboration arise as often at the interdisciplinary level as within specific disciplines. AMSTAC will continue to establish specific-purpose working parties to undertake major investigations in the course of which advice and information is sought from non-government disciplinary organisations such as the National Committee on Coastal and Ocean Engineering (of the Australian Institution of Engineers), the Australian Marine Sciences Association, and the Consortium for Ocean Geosciences of Australian Universities. AMSTAC is conscious of the need to identify, and to seek information from those organisations which utilise the results of marine science as well as those carrying out research. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 11-One broadly based Advisory Committee be established to advise the Council on program planning and evaluation, education and training, and the conferring of fellowships, scholarships and project and program grants. </PARA>
<PARA> Response-See comment on Recommendations 1 and 2. Advice on marine sciences and technologies programs is provided to the Minister for Science and Technology by AMSTAC. The amalgamated AMSTAC-FAP and Queen's Fellowships in Marine Science Committee advises the Minister on the conferring of fellowships and on project and program grants in the context of priorities set by the Minister on advice from AMSTAC. Responsibility for advising the Government on the level and pattern of provision of tertiary education lies with the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 12-The CSIRO cease to conduct marine science research, and the Divisions of Fisheries Research and Oceanography become a separate Research Institute. This Research Institute, together with the Australian Institute of Marine Science, would become Research Institutes responsible to the Australian Marine Science Council. </PARA>
<PARA> Response-See comment on Recommendation 13. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 13-Each Institute would have its own Board, to which the Director of the Institute, subject to Council policy, would be responsible for the management and operations of the Institute. The research programs would be approved annually by the Council and would be financed by the Marine Science Research and Development Fund. The Council would direct the Institutes to develop independent programmes to avoid unnecessary duplication. </PARA>
<PARA> Response-Not accepted. See response to Recommendation 1. CSIRO has a responsibility to continue to play a major role in Australian marine science in accordance with Science and Industry Research Act 1949 as amended in 1978, following the Government's acceptance of the report of the Independent Committee of Inquiry into CSIRO. The Executive of CSIRO has given marine research a high priority. The Government believes that removing the marine science divisions from CSIRO would, without providing any compensating benefits, break existing links which facilitate interdisciplinary consultations and a multidisciplinary approach especially to problems which bear on both the terrestrial and marine environments. With CSIRO the marine science divisions interact on the widest possible range of skills and resources and utilise the capabilities of various scientific disciplines to meet changing objectives. The Government has previously accepted the recommendations of ASTEC that the future long-term role of AIMS (5 years ahead and more) be determined by the situation at that time, including the reputation and capabilities of AIMS and of other institutions, as they evolve and that for the foreseeable future AIMS should direct its research towards programs associated with the tropical waters of Australia, particularly, the Great Barrier Reef Region, and chiefly in appropriate marine biological/ecological fields. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 14-In view of the importance of the dissemination of information the Australian Marine Science Council becomes a user of the CSIRONET computing service. </PARA>
<PARA> Response-CSIRONET is a commercially available computing service and its facilities are available to whoever needs them. Several marine science data banks are already stored on CSIRONET. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 15-The Council establish an Information Services Unit to service the information needs of the organisation and researchers and agencies concerned with marine science. </PARA>
<PARA> Response-The Government recognises that the effective management of information is a key element in a national marine science program and believes that it is of prime importance that the transfer of information and data are readily available to those who have a need for them. However, it believes that a strongly centralised information services unit is not practicable. Data and information are best managed by those with prime responsibility for collection and with the necessary expertise to analyse them. A basic need in information management is to have a readily available central registry of what data and information are available and where they can be obtained. To this end the Department of Science and Technology is currently compiling an inventory of marine science data banks and a directory of current research projects. In addition, a research officer is being funded through the Fishing Industry Research Trust Account to investigate the fishing industry's need for scientific information and how to develop better mechanisms for distributing this information. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 16-The Council establish a Ship Operations Unit to co-ordinate the operational management of marine science research vessels. </PARA>
<PARA> Response-See comment on Recommendation 18. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 17-The Ship Operations Unit be responsible for co-ordinating information concerning available ship time on Australian and overseas vessels in Australian waters. The Unit would administer a fund to enable scientists to take up ship time opportunities at very short notice. </PARA>
<PARA> Response-See comment on Recommendation 18. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 18-The Ship Operations Unit establish a Users Committee, comprising representatives of the various disciplines which require access to research vessels. The Users Committee would be an integral part of the Ship Operations Unit. </PARA>
<PARA> Response-The Government accepts that research vessels need to be utilised to their maximum extent possible subject to necessary considerations of scientific and cost effectiveness and that a mechanism is needed to co-ordinate the use of available ship time. However, it does not consider that a centralised system of control is required at this time and believes that research vessels, including those acquired as national facilities, should be managed by major operational agencies. The Government has already accepted ASTEC advice that organisations managing a research vessel designated as a national facility should appoint a committee, comprising representatives of major users of the vessel, to provide advice on the allocation of vessel time.</PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 19-Marine science research vessels purchased, or chartered, as national facilities be managed for the most part by experienced marine contractors and that these contractors form part of the Ship Operations Unit. Such contractors would liaise closely with the Users Committee to ensure compatibility in decision making. </PARA>
<PARA> Response-In response to the report of the Review of Commonwealth Government Functions, the Government has decided that there should be further contracting of its services to the private sector where practicable. In this regard the need is recognised for maximum scientific and cost effectiveness in the use of research vessels. Accordingly the Government will consider in particular cases whether the best results would be achieved through management by marine contractors or through Government operation. In all cases close liaison between operators and users is essential. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 20-Wherever possible all marine science research vessels be chartered, and experienced marine contractors consulted in identifying research vessels suitable for charter or purchase. </PARA>
<PARA> Response-The practice of chartering research vessels is well established in Australia. If a vessel is required for a definite and short-term project, chartering may provide the necessary flexibility if a suitable vessel exists, is available, and can be used to full capacity during the charter period. However the Government believes that, where there is a continuing need, or where a long-term project is envisaged, purchase may be cheaper than chartering. All relevant sources of advice are used in identifying vessels suitable for charter or purchase. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 21-Encouragement be given to developing modular research vessels. </PARA>
<PARA> Response-Most research vessels constructed recently have some provision for interchanging laboratories but overseas' experience has shown that fully modular research vessels have not proved generally effective. It is the view of the Government that users should be uninhibited in selection of vessels designed to meet particular needs. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 22-The Ship Operations Unit fully consider the acquisition of small research vessels for use by bodies such as universities, colleges and museums. </PARA>
<PARA> Response-The acquisition of small research vessels is a matter for the individual institutions concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 23-AMSTAC and ASTEC oversee the establishment of the Australian Marine Science Council. Thereafter, AMSTAC and its Funding Advisory Panel would no longer exist, as the Advisory Committee would assume the responsibilities of AMSTAC. </PARA>
<PARA> Response-See comment on Recommendation 1. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 24-A marine science policy be developed incorporating such aspects as: the types of research to be financed; and mechanisms for the selection, financing and effectiveness of research as well as the exploitation of research results. </PARA>
<PARA> Response-See comment on Recommendation 1. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 25-All possible avenues be explored to acquire a complete bathymetric and hydrographic survey of the Australian coast as rapidly as possible. These measures could include financial assistance to the Royal Australian Navy Hydrographer, The Australian Survey Office, the Division of National Mapping and private contractors. </PARA>
<PARA> Response-The Government accepts the importance of having a complete bathymetric and hydrographic survey of the Australian coast. It has recently committed the ''Cape Pillar'' for additional bathymetric work, at least until the end of 1982. The Division of National Mapping of the Department of National Development and Energy has been allocated additional funds of $1.5 million in 1981-82 for that purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 26-Funding of physical and chemical oceanography be increased, particularly in determining an understanding of the tides, waves and circulation patterns of the continental shelf. Priority should be given to processing this information such that it can be widely made known to other marine scientists. </PARA>
<PARA> Response-Accepted. The Government decided in 1980 to establish CSIRO Marine Science Laboratories at Hobart to be supported by an oceanographic research vessel. The Government notes that CSIRO attaches high priority and commitment to marine sciences and especially oceanography, and inter alia is reallocating staff and resources to this end. The need for routine collection and distribution of oceanographic data is being considered and proposals aimed at meeting this need are being developed. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 27-The Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967 be amended so as to reduce the period for the release of information from five years to twelve months. </PARA>
<PARA> Response-Not accepted. The Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967 was extensively amended in 1980 following consultation with all State Governments. Amendment of the relevant provision (Section 118) was considered at that time, but it was decided that no changes would be made to this provision. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 28-Priorities for coastal and ocean engineering in the protection of our foreshores and the development of our mineral resources be better recognised. Emphasis should be given to the provision of tanks and basins for the simulation of wave, current and wind impact on structures and the sediment bed. </PARA>
<PARA> Response-This recommendation is in accord with advice received from ASTEC/AMSTAC and is being considered in detail by a working group of AMSTAC. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 29-The adoption of a national code to provide a development-free zone of approximately 1 km from the shoreline for those areas of the Australian coast which have not yet been developed and where there is any risk of shoreline erosion or instability. </PARA>
<PARA> Response-Although the Commonwealth has constitutional power with respect to maritime areas beyond low water mark adjacent to the States, under the offshore constitutional settlement each State is to have the same power with respect to the adjacent territorial sea (including the sea bed) as it would have if the waters were within the limit of the State. The establishment of such a zone would, therefore, be mainly a matter for the States, subject to any Commonwealth legislation. The matter will be taken up with them in accordance with the Commonwealth Government's decisions on the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Environment and Conservation Report on Management of the Coastal Zone which is being considered by the State Governments. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 30-A blue-water research vessel be acquired, or a modular laboratory be developed for, the marine geosciences, and that Australia seriously consider participating in the forthcoming Ocean Margins Drilling Programme. Priority should be given to upgrading the services provided by the Bureau of Mineral Resources, Geology and Geophysics. </PARA>
<PARA> Response-The matters raised in this recommendation have also been foreshadowed as important issues for future action by AMSTAC in its report ''Towards a Marine Sciences and Technologies Program for the 1980's''. Participation in the Ocean Margins Drilling Program is not considered warranted. However the Government is expecting to receive shortly a proposal from Australian marine geoscientists concerning participation by Australia in the second phase of the International Program of Ocean Drilling. In the reorganisation of the Bureau of Mineral Resources, Geology and Geophysics, the Public Service Board has agreed to the formation of a Division of Marine Geosciences and Petroleum Geology. This Division will undertake regional offshore geological and geophysical investigations and analyse and integrate offshore petroleum exploration data. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 31-Priority be given to studying the biology of marine micro-organisms, plankton and the fish resources of the 200 n.m. zone. </PARA>
<PARA> Response-Accepted. The Government has already significantly strengthened CSIRO's capacity to undertake research related to the resources of the Australian Fishing Zone. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 32-Increased finance be provided for marine taxonomy and for the upgrading of museum facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Response-The Government accepts the importance of marine taxonomy to Australian marine science and notes that AMSTAC-FAP has supported projects in this field. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 33-Priority be given to research into the distribution, allowable yields and management of current and potential fisheries. To foster such research, greater liaison between government and industry should be developed. </PARA>
<PARA> Response-Accepted. The Department of Primary Industry has established a comprehensive system for collecting catch and effort data from foreign vessels operating in Australian waters as a basis for research and the development and management of the Australian Fishing Zone. An extensive feasibility fishing program has been carried out by means of foreign and Australian commercial partnerships. The results of both these programs are available to industry. The Australian Fishing Council has established the Australian Fishing Zone Committee, a government/industry committee which reports to it annually on the interrelations of foreign and Australian fishing in the AFZ. The reports of the Committee are published. Additionally, there is extensive consultation with industry when foreign operations are approved and during the development of fishery management and development regimes. Industry is represented on the Fishing Industry Research Committee which advises the Minister for Primary Industry on expenditure of funds from the Fishing Industry Research Trust Account. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 34-The possible over-exploitation of the North West Shelf by foreign fishing ventures be immediately examined, and if necessary, rectified.</PARA>
<PARA> Response-See comment on Recommendation 33. There are serious deficiencies in the knowledge and understanding of the functioning and appropriate management of tropical, multi-species, trawl fisheries. Examination of the basis of this recommendation must await further development of our understanding. The CSIRO Division of Fisheries Research is examining a proposal for research of this type. In the meantime, however, the exploitation of the North West Shelf is being managed on a very conservative basis. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 35-Priority be given to researching the effects of oil spills, waste disposal and effluent on the marine environment, especially on coral reefs. This research should include the development of a marine pollution monitoring system. </PARA>
<PARA> Response-Accepted. The Government notes that a number of research programs are underway which are relevant to this recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 36-Attention be paid to the impact of tourism on the Great Barrier Reef. The possibility of developing an extensive underwater viewing gallery should be explored as a means of reducing this impact whilst at the same time promoting tourist interest. </PARA>
<PARA> Response-Accepted. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority has this matter under investigation. The development of proposed tourist facilities on the Great Barrier Reef and adjacent coast is being considered so as to increase opportunities for the public to experience the Reef environment, while at the same time minimising human impact on it. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 37-The declaration of the 200 n.m. Australian Fishing Zone should be accompanied by research into the fauna of this zone, especially mammals, and how they can be adequately protected from the over-exploitation of their foodstocks. </PARA>
<PARA> Response-See comment on Recommendation 31. The Fisheries Act obliges the Minister for Primary Industry to take account of the effects of fishing on cetaceans. Recent government actions on whaling have demonstrated the Government's commitment to conservation of marine mammals. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 38-The development of appropriate technology for the marine sciences be encouraged, especially in relation to remote sensing and fisheries technology. </PARA>
<PARA> Response-Accepted. This recommendation is consistent with the Government's policy of a balanced development of Australian marine science. Development and utilisation of advanced technology already is part of marine science activities. For example, the Fishing Industry Research Trust Account has funded a CSIRO/West Australian Institute of Technology study on the applications of remote sensing to fisheries. The Australian Maritime College is also involved in developing appropriate technology. The College's School of Fisheries provides training in the application of modern fishing techniques. There is an ongoing defence program of design studies for industrial production of the Laser Airborne Depth Sounder which can greatly increase the rate of collection of data from coastal waters shallower than 50 metres. Both CSIRO and AIMS regularly use remote sensing techniques in their research. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 39-The Australian Marine Science Council provide finance for the operation of facilities at the island research stations. Programs conducted at these stations would be the responsibility of the Consortium of Island Research Stations. </PARA>
<PARA> Response-The Government is aware of the important contribution made by the island research stations to marine research in the Great Barrier Reef and notes that parent institutions of island research stations are eligible to apply for funding support through marine research and development grants. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 40-The marine science laboratories at Cronulla be retained as research and training facilities for marine scientists in the Sydney region, especially for university-based scientists. </PARA>
<PARA> Response-CSIRO will have no need for a residual presence at Cronulla when the proposed Marine Science Laboratories are constructed in Hobart. The Government has noted this recommendation and will take it into account when consideration is given to the future of the Cronulla facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 41-Support be given to increase the number of graduates in the marine sciences whose initial degrees are based on the pure sciences. Emphasis should also be given to the provision of courses in resource management and marine technologies. </PARA>
<PARA> Response-The Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission is responsible for advising the Government on the level and pattern of provision in tertiary education. The Commission's planning for the 1982-84 Triennium has been based, among other things, on there being no increase in student numbers in universities during that period. This is consistent with the findings of the Williams Committee of Inquiry into Education and Training. The Government's policy is that, in expensive and highly specialised fields of study, decisions on the number of places to be made available will be influenced primarily by manpower considerations. The Government acknowledges however that an improvement in the quality and comprehensiveness of labour market information is a prerequisite for any significant advances in the use of manpower consideration in educational planning. AMSTAC will review the adequacy of trained manpower in the marine sciences. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the provision of courses, the Australian Maritime College currently offers a number of relevant undergraduate courses and is planning to introduce post-graduate courses in hydrographic surveying and fisheries technology. The college also provides short, specialist, non-award courses to meet the needs of maritime industries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has currently under consideration a suggestion that the proposal for a National School of Fisheries be examined further with a view to its development in the 1985-87 Triennium. It is recognised that such a school would complement the role of the Australian Maritime College with regard to fishing and related activities. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 42-The number of Queen's Fellowships be increased both to give young Australians an opportunity to continue their research in this country or overseas, and to attract researchers from overseas on a short-term basis. </PARA>
<PARA> Response-The recent amalgamation of the Queen's Fellowships in Marine Science committee with the AMSTAC-Funding Advisory Panel enables an appropriate balance between fellowships and project grants to be reached year to year. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 43-Post-graduate scholarships be made available in the marine sciences and technologies, to be tenable in Australia and overseas. </PARA>
<PARA> Response-The number of new Post-graduate Awards provided by the Commonwealth Government has been increased from 700 in 1980 to 800 in 1981. This increase was in response to the recommendations of the Williams Committee of Inquiry into Education and Training. It has not been policy under the Post-graduate Award Scheme to allocate Awards to particular areas of study. Traditionally the Awards have been available in open competition on the basis of academic merit to people in all disciplines. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 44-The Australian Marine Science Council finance marine science in this country through the mechanism of the Marine Science Research and Development Fund. Research directed towards national priorities would be financed through project and program grants, scholarships and fellowships. This Fund would also finance the Ship Operations Unit, the Information Services Unit and the operations of the Research Institutes and the island research stations. Financial support for research conducted at these, and all other facilities, would be subject to successful application for grants, scholarships and fellowships. </PARA>
<PARA> Response-See response to Recommendation 4. </PARA>
<PARA> Recommendation 45-Adequate levies be placed on industries exploiting resources in the 200 n.m. zone, especially foreign-owned fishing ventures and oil and gas industries. The revenue derived from these levies should assist in the financing of marine science research, and in the provision of inspectors and scientific observers on foreign fishing vessels. </PARA>
<PARA> Response-The hypothecation of general Government revenue derived from fishing and offshore crude oil production to specific Government expenditure is contrary to general Government budgetary policy. </PARA>

Those matters include all items set out in the motion except Notices of Motion Nos. 70, 66, 58, 67, 62 and 63. My question is: Why does the Government propose to allow these items to jump the queue ahead of other notices of motion which other senators, including me, have placed on the Notice Paper? I was not consulted in any shape or form as to whether I agreed to the jumping-up of those notices of motion over other notices of motion. I say quite frankly that I am not prepared to vote in any shape or form for those notices of motion if there is not prior consultation about their being brought forward.

It will take the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) a long time to read his statement if he is not granted leave to have it incorporated in Hansard, and other measures can be adopted. I make it perfectly clear that once a notice of motion is placed before the Senate it becomes the business of the Senate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The major provisions of the Census and Statistics Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1981, which I will enumerate, are to tighten the confidentiality sections of the principal Act to ensure that information relating to personal activities cannot be released; to allow for the release of information relating to the activities of an organisation where there is good reason to do so; and to increase penalties on officers or past officers of the Australian Bureau of Statistics for unauthorised disclosure of information from $1,000 or 12 months imprisonment to $5,000 or two years imprisonment, or both. The Bill also removes the penalty of imprisonment on persons giving false information to the ABS, which was a matter of some discussion and indeed of some amendment when an earlier Census and Statistics Amendment Bill related to the Australian Bureau of Statistics passed through the Senate in May of this year. I might add that the current penalty imposed on officers of the ABS for disclosing information without authorisation was introduced in May of this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have two specific amendments in this Bill amending decisions made by the Government only six months ago. This supplements and reinforces the comments made by Senator Button in the matter of public importance and the comments he quoted from Mr Carnegie that one of the great problems of this Government is that it keeps changing the rules. These are relatively unimportant matters, but they are symptomatic of a very serious deficiency of this Government that it cannot seem to make any decision and stick to it, or it makes a bewildering number of changes. For example, in the last 15 months it has, on no less than four occasions, changed the depreciation rates for tax purposes on capital equipment. Senator Martyr said earlier today that the changes the Government makes are in recognition of past errors. The Government has seen the error of its ways. If that was really what was happening, I suppose we should be grateful. I think we are entitled to expect that occasionally the Government might see its errors before it actually enacts them. It might have seen the errors of the assortment of tax rorts that we have seen come straight off the top of the head of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) over the last 18 months. The Government has them under review now. It will almost certainly remove some of them within the next 12 months. Is this Government incapable of recognising error at the time it is commiting error? If other people can recognise its errors, is it so crass that it never can?</PARA>
<PARA> I will make some brief general comments about the Australian Bureau of Statistics concerning the imposition of staff ceilings by the Government and the steady erosion of the scope of the Bureau's statistical collection and processing activities. These have very serious long term implications for economic planning not only by the Government, but also by private industry. In determining what is just or equitable policy, the restrictions placed upon the Bureau are equally serious. For example, nobody who is seriously interested in the study of income distribution in determining the effects of particular policy changes on income distribution-on whether changes are progressive or regressive-can do without the Bureau's household expenditure surveys. The last expenditure surveys were taken in 1974-75. I have been informed that it was planned that another survey would be taken in 1983, an interval of almost 10 years. I am now given reason to believe that that may even be cancelled or further deferred. It would be bad enough if the interval between these household surveys was nine or 10 years. If the next survey is to be deferred even longer, it ought to be quite unacceptable. There is a wealth of information in those household expenditure surveys for people who are interested in income distribution and, in particular, for people who are interested in a more progressive income distribution. I know that that excludes probably the majority of the people in the Senate, but the information is now seven years old and inevitably it is becoming obsolete and increasingly unreliable. But the Government, in pursuit of its ideological objectives, without even pausing to consider whether they are rational or not, insists on imposing staff ceilings on the ABS and reducing the scope of its data collection and analysis. In some instances there are crude political reasons for doing so. The Government does not want the public to be informed. Apart from having an ideological objection it has a very pragmatic political objection to the public being accurately informed by the Bureau about matters which are embarrassing to it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is supporting this Bill. Once again it makes a plea to the Government to reconsider its whole attitude towards the Australian Bureau of Statistics and to attempt to restore the organisation at least to the level of efficiency at which it once functioned. The information that the Bureau could provide is really indispensible not only to people who are interested in equity questions but also to the efficient operation of both the private and the public sector. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am delighted to see the provision in the Census and Statistics Amendment Bill amending the Census and Statistics Act so that no longer will Australians who fill in forms incorrectly be liable to six months in gaol. That provision was put into the Act on 13 May, six months ago, when the composition of the Senate was different from what it is now. At that time I moved an amendment, the effect of which would have been to remove that six months gaol term which, to my knowledge, was the first time in Australian peacetime history that a citizen would be liable to be gaoled for the way he or she filled in a form.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Australian Labor Party supported that amendment, and to his great credit, so did Senator Michael Townley of the Liberal Party. But six months ago the Government used its numbers in the Senate to defeat the amendment and maintain the penal sanction. There was considerable public reaction over the matter and I undertook that when the Australian Democrats numbers were greater in the Senate I would bring forward a private member's Bill to correct the matter. On 10 June I gave notice of my intention to bring in that Bill which was then prepared and printed. Earlier this session I notified the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Carrick) as a courtesy that the following week I would bring that private member's Bill forward and that I believed it had the numbers to pass the Senate. I was then notified that the Government itself had accepted the measure and was incorporating the provision in this legislation now before us which has, of course, since passed through the House of Representatives under the auspices of the Treasurer, Mr Howard. </PARA>
<PARA> Once this Bill has passed the Senate it will have removed a dangerous totalitarian-type precedent from the law. Naturally the Australian Democrats indicate their support for it. The Australian Democrats also give the Government the fullest possible credit for its flexibility and wisdom in bringing through this matter, even though originally it was a Democrat initiative. There should be no accusations of backing down or weakness but only of a proper and statesmanlike recognition of what is right and what is wrong. I say that of the Government with all possible sincerity. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a bridge that the Government has crossed. It has conceded that in no way does it diminish its prestige or strength by the principle of accepting a Democrat initiative and bringing it into law. That is a very important bridge, and crossing it could have important implications for the future. It exhibits a wiser and much more democratic view of the undertakings of this House and the other place than that expressed in some thoughtless areas of the Government where members cry out for double dissolution elections and political crises whenever the will of the Executive is thwarted in the smallest possible way and threaten, as Senator Carrick said on the media two days ago, to have triggers and section 57 Bills 'as a warning to those who seek to frustrate'. The Australian Democrats perceive themselves as a target for that remark, but the remark is completely unjustified as indeed what has happened with the Census and Statistics Bill indicates. </PARA>
<PARA> We do not seek to frustrate. It is a fact that the Government's legislative program has been able to proceed substantially in a normal way during this session of parliament. Its major taxing and Supply Bills have been respected. That has been a matter of deliberate policy on our part. But it does not mean that we should lie down under the bed and never bring forward to this place any measures which might be in the least different from the Government's measures. I believe that the Bill before us now indicates a degree of flexibility in the Government that bids fair for the future. I trust that the Government will bring the enlightened view it has shown about this measure, concerning the gaoling of citizens over census forms, to other matters that have recently engaged the attention of the Senate. The decision to gaol citizens over the census papers was quickly shown as being unpopular in the community and, as a result, the Government has decided to change it. All credit to it, I say again. But I remind the Government that there is another equally unpopular measure which it ought to change in its own interests and in the interests of the community as soon as it can. I commend that action to the Government along exactly the same lines. I refer to the iniquitous and notorious application of sales tax to children's school shoes, clothing, the means of information-books, magazines and newspapers-and the building materials for new houses. Those are the necessities of life. </PARA>

I am glad that you were able to lower the boom on him appropriately, Mr Acting Deputy President. It is true that the Government was impressed with the arguments of Senator Mason last May but I think that one or two points need clarification. Firstly, as was argued in the debate last May, the amendment set out in the Bill at that time imposing the penalty of a gaol term on those who provided false information-I hope Senator Mason will acknowledge this- was to apply only in those cases where there was a deliberate intent to provide misleading or false information. I make that clear to all parts of the Senate.

<PARA> Senator Walsh referred to the household expenditure survey. It is true that the next survey will not be conducted until 1984.

However, that is not to say that the Government is ignoring its responsibilities in this regard. As I said, it will be moving to the collection of new information in 1984.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I spoke briefly last night to the Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Bill 1981 I indicated that the Government, in opposing this measure, was not opposed in total to the concept of union amalgamation-quite the contrary. We believe that it is a very important area of development in industrial relations. Before I address a few remarks to that matter, I will make observations about one or two of the matters raised by Senator Siddons in the chamber last night when he spoke immediately before I spoke. Amongst other things, Senator Siddons said: 'Why are there so few mergers?' That is a reasonable question. Obviously the answer must relate in some measure at least to a lack of enthusiasm amongst trade unionists for that sort of amalgamation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, the honourable senator referred also to the circumstances in the Federal Republic of Germany where, of course, there are only 16 or 18 unions. They are industry-based unions. Of course, it is not easy to compare the circumstances there with the Australian circumstances. Trade unionism in West Germany has grown basically from a nil position after World War II to the position it stands in today. The Germany of Adolf Hitler and the years prior to 1945-46 was a Germany that knew no trade unionism at all. It has had the distinct advantage of developing along lines that are preconceived and planned. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Siddons said further that anything that could be effective in avoiding industrial strife should be sought. Who could disagree with that? Indeed, it would be to everybody's advantage to find a form or measure of amalgamation of trade unions that could aid in avoiding industrial strife. I do not believe that there is a consensus about amalgamations at this stage. I do not believe that there is a circumstance which ensures that industrial strife and action can be avoided by a specific legislative proposal. It has to grow from the basic members of that community which is involved with industrial relations, namely the management and the unionists-the management and the employees. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Siddons mentioned further that unions should decide which unions should amalgamate. That is a pretty reasonable proposition on the surface but, if it were adopted, would it produce an industry-based union? It would not necessarily do so. It may well produce only a great conglomerate of unions without any real relationship, one to the other. One has to ask: Should it be possible for that sort of amalgamation to take place with less than 50 per cent involvement of the unionists concerned? I make a few remarks relevant to this legislation because any legislation that has as its objective the improvement of industrial relations in this country is legislation that needs to be thought about sincerely, clearly and logically. Amalgamation must surely come with a real measure of agreement from the mass of unionists and from the employers. It cannot be successful if it is promoted by only one group. </PARA>
<PARA> A solution to the industrial relations problem in Australia is of enourmous importance in a number of fields. It would be directly responsible for Australia's capacity to reach the quite exciting potential that it has for all its citizens, for itself as a nation, and for the contribution it can make as a nation among the nations of the world. Only by a successful and responsible industrial relations situation can that sort of potential be arrived at; only by that sort of relationship can we develop in this country the sort of enthusiasm that our opportunities should be engendering. Productivity and the general affluence of Australian society are directly related to our capacity to solve the problems. Perhaps this legislation seeks to contribute towards a solution. But in the view of the Government, at this stage, it does not give the sort of solution we need, basically because it is still unresearched to some degree and because it is an area that involves an enormous concentration by all parties involved in the negotiations and the deliberations. </PARA>
<PARA> The amalgamation of trade unions for its own sake is not necessarily desirable. The situation in which unions become bigger by sheer absorption one or another does not necessarily solve any problems. Indeed, it may create problems. It may well submerge the rights, objectives, aspirations and pride of smaller trade unions, craft unions, which have existed in this country for generations and which are, in a real sense, the direct descendants of craft unions in many other parts of the Western world, certainly of those found in Great Britain, the United States and Canada. If a procedure which made amalgamations easier than they are today were to be implemented, there would be a threat to significant numbers of old, small, efficient and proud unions. I do not believe we can involve ourselves willy-nilly in creating that sort of situation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And submerging their skills. There is another fallacy in the assumption that just by increasing the scale or size-the physical dimensions-of a union by incorporating more and more people within a particular umbrella the problems of demarcation disputes will be ruled out. Of course, this is not the evidence of the history of amalgamations of trade unions. That is a suggested plus that may well be little more than a negative. I believe jealousies and competition probably increase with the size of organisations. As I look around massive companies, be they multinational or national, it seems to me that very often the greater they are, the more massive they are, the tougher becomes the competition between them and the more ruthless become their operations.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MQ7">Senator SCOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not necessarily. Generally speaking, there is no complete certainty that unions, just by growing bigger and bigger, will solve the problems that relate to industrial relations. I do not believe the present requirement for an amalgamation-that 50 per cent of the membership of the unions involved should vote and that at least 50 per cent should favour the amalgamation-is unreasonable. I know that there are objections on the grounds that it is hard to get that many people to vote and that there are certain reasons for that. But if 50 per cent of the people in the unions involved cannot be persuaded to vote to indicate their stance on amalgamation, I assume that they cannot be awfully interested in actually effecting an amalgamation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have touched very briefly on the history and nature of unions in this country. I think this is relevant because the capacity to move towards the ultimate objective of amalgamations, the production of industry-based unions, must be dependent in some measure on the history of the unions we are talking about. In the main the Australian trade union system-and it has been a great organisation-has contributed very significantly to Australian development over the last 50 years to 100 years. Unions in Australia have traditionally been of the craft variety. The industry-based unions have to be considered, certainly with a view to amalgamation. The industry-based unions, from many points of view, seem to have a reasonable and proper objective and may have significant advantages. But in my view-and this is relevant to the Government's attitude-there are not yet sufficiently and clearly defined guidelines in the area of industry-based unions to enable us to move to the development of them.</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Harradine" NAMEID="6H4">

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. What is an industry?</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="MQ7">Senator SCOTT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We need to examine very closely what we mean by an industry. We have to have an authority recognised by all the people involved in the unions and in the field of management and we have to be sure that these people recognise that authority in the final term as well as the guidelines and the definition of the organism they are attempting to develop. The enterprise-based union is another interesting area involving, in some sense, amalgamation. But the enterprise-based union is found much more in a traditional situation and is found, significantly, in Japan. It may have a contribution to make in the Australian field. It is not an easy union to bring about but it is not something that can be laid aside as unworthy of consideration. The enterprise-based union develops a significant loyalty and pride amongst both the unionists and the management.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Community of interest is an interesting term too. I find it very hard to identify exactly what is meant by community of interest referable to trade unions. A bricklayer, presumably, would belong to the construction industry, yet he might be using some form of public transport to move to and from his work, be it a train, a bus or whatever. That vehicle would be part of the transport industry. Does he have a community of interest with the transport industry? An enormous number of questions have to be identified and defined before we can move with confidence into the development of amalgamated unions in any or all of these fields. </PARA>
<PARA> Amalgamation is an area where intense research is still necessary by a whole range of parties. I believe it is an area in which no real consensus of view has been established to this point. It has to be accepted that industry and enterprise unions would necessitate a very real and difficult restructuring of the union situation in this country and that is something that cannot be taken lightly. An authoritative body would be needed to apply guidelines and to determine the nature and scope of industry unions. I conclude my remarks by saying once again that the Government is certainly concerned that amalgamation, where it is seen to be a proper and fitting solution capable of making a contribution to industrial peace, must be right in our sights. But until we identify totally and absolutely the direction in which it is to take place it is best that this legislation be opposed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-The Senate is dealing with the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill (No. 2) 1981. In replying to the debate, I will refer to the major points which have been raised and I believe I can do that best by dealing with the issues raised by Senator Chaney. Senator Chaney read a speech which-I do him the kindness of saying that with charity considering the time of year-I believe was prepared by Mr Viner's office. There is no other explanation of the tortuous argument which is advanced other than that it was prepared in Mr Viner's office. I will deal with some of the major issues which are raised in that speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What the Government is saying in response to a private member's Bill which I introduced and which was drafted by the Government, discussed with the National Labour Consultative Council, and promised prior to the last election to be introduced in this session of the Parliament, is that it now has a new view of the whole issue. It says that it is very concerned about industry-based unions. I am not sure whether the Government is concerned about industry-based unions or enterprise-based unions which are what it referred to in a recent statement by the Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Viner. But, let us assume that the Government is concerned about industry-based unions. The Liberal-National Country Party record on the question of union amalgamations can, I think, fairly simply and accurately be described in this way: In 1971, there was a large number of union amalgamations under consideration; in 1971, the then Attorney-General, Senator Greenwood, had a very strong belief that somehow governments did better out of small unions which they had divided and conquered-that was the simplistic view of the world which the late Senator Greenwood had-and that big unions would automatically mean conglomerates of power which would be controlled by communists, left-wingers and undesirable figures who would be a thorn in the side of Liberal governments. </PARA>
<PARA> Between 1972 and 1975, the Labor Government sought to introduce amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to facilitate amalgamations of trade unions. These amendments were defeated in the Senate by the then Liberal-National Country Party Opposition. In 1975-76, when this Government was returned to office, it again began reconsidering this issue. In 1980, the Government negotiated with its own established body, the National Labour Consultative Council, which is representative of employers and unions, and reached agreement with that body about the contents of the Bill which are the same contents as those in the Bill that I introduced last night. Not only was this Bill the subject of consultation and agreement, but also was it the subject of electoral promises. Now the Government is being confronted with its own promise-breaking and with its own breach of faith with the National Labour Consultative Council. Senator Chaney referred to that body very nicely by saying: 'I take it that this matter will cause some concern to members of the National Labour Consultative Council but they will be informed'. That is very nice of the Government. It does not matter how gentlemanly or how courteous one is about informing people, if one lies to them they will not respect one as a gentleman. They will think that such a person is a phoney gentleman. If honourable senators do not understand that, let me explain. The Government said that it would inform the National Labour Consultative Council of its change of mind. That is very gentlemanly. Before the last election the Government informed and promised the Council that it would adopt this legislation. The Government has broken that promise. All I am saying is that it does not matter how gentlemanly the Government is in dealing with that body in the future, I do not think it will be very grateful on the basis of the Government's being nice to it about informing it. The Government informed the Council, as it informed the people of Australia, before the last election that this legislation would be introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the Government has suddenly discovered the virtues of industry-based unions. It is not a new discovery. In 1977 I discussed this matter with the then Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Street. At that time Mr Street said that he was very keen to develop procedures which would facilitate industry-based unions. At that time I said: 'That is a good idea'. Nothing was done about it until 1980 when promises were made by the Government relating to unions amalgamating with a community of interest. The Government, in approaching this issue of industry-based unions, has larded Senator Chaney's speech with quotations which I made in the Senate. I am quoted as saying on 2 June 1981 that the case for industry-based unionism is overwhelming. I am also quoted as saying:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not at all; the honourable senator has done so already. What I want to know is why has Senator Chaney, in this nitwitted speech which he gave last night-I must say that is the only way of describing it; I am charitable enough to say that they are Mr Viner's words, not his-when confronted with an amalgamation Bill in the Senate in November 1981 suddenly discovered the virtue of my words when the Government totally ignored them in 1980. In 1980, after I had uttered those words, the Government said: 'We are not concerned about Senator Button's views because we will go ahead with this community of interest unionism'. The Government made that promise. It is very kind of the Government to think of me in retrospect, but a lot of water has flowed under the bridge since then. The Government ignored those words in 1980 and 1981. I think it is unreasonable that it should take them into account now.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the course of Senator Chaney's remarks yesterday-quite apart from the emergence of this new-found view of the Government about these issues; it was a new-found view after six years of Fraser Government and 10 years of Liberal government since the issue was first discussed in this Parliament-he dealt with a number of other more minor issues which are raised by the Bill. The fundamental issues which are raised by the Bill are that the Government made promises; it recognised that this form of legislation was desirable; it recognised an agreement with the trade unions and the employers; it made promises on the basis of that agreement; and proceeded to prepare a Bill. One thing that is important in industrial relations is expressed in the words used by the then Leader of the Opposition, Mr Fraser, in 1975. He said that the most important ingredient in good industrial relations was an attitude of mutual trust and respect. Neither the trade union movement nor employers in this country can have any feeling of mutual trust and respect with a government which behaves in the way in which this Government has behaved in relation to this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to some of the details of what Senator Chaney said. He referred to the difficulties which organisations allegedly have under the present legislation. There is no doubt about that. The Australian Textile Workers Union, the Clothing and Allied Trades Union of Australia and, more latterly, the Australian Boot Trade Employees Federation, have been seeking to amalgamate for nearly 10 years. Those three unions instructed me as late as today that they have already spent $14,000 on this issue trying to arrange an appropriate amalgamation ballot. They say that because of the high turnover in each of those unions the 50 per cent threshold required by the current legislation in terms of voter participation is impossible to attain, and that the 25 per cent threshold which is suggested by this legislation of mine would be difficult to attain. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Come on! The honourable senator should have a look at the Companies Act. I am saying that it is almost impossible to get 50 per cent of members to vote in most union ballots. Under this provision, after they have obtained a 50 per cent vote they then have to get half of those people to approve effectively of the amalgamation. I think the proposal we have made, and which the Government originally made, is suitable and desirable in relation to the question with which the Senate is now concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn now to the question of industry-based unions. What concerns me about this issue is that, in opposing this legislation, the Government is really saying-this is still being said-that what worries it a lot is that some big conglomerates of unions might emerge which would exercise too much power in society. I want to know what is different and unique about Australia which requires us to have 280-odd unions in a country of 14 million people when all the modern democracies of Western Europe get by with less than 20 unions each. What is so unique about Australia that we require that vast proliferation of unions, many of them very small? I think that is the question which Government senators have to address their minds to in approaching their own legislation. However, I do not think that is the issue at all. What is the issue is who controls those unions in terms of the political composition of the union leadership. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government always arrives at the extraordinary conclusion that some unions, because of their political leadership, are necessarily in an industrial sense more militant than those unions which have a totally different political complexion or leadership. For example, if it wants to be, the Federated Ironworkers Association of Australia which is not said to be a militant union, nonetheless can be a very vociferous and agile union in terms of industrial disputation if issues affecting industrial interests of members are concerned. If honourable senators look at the records of various unions they can draw no conclusions about political complexion of unions dictating the degree of industrial disturbance in which those unions are involved. I say that by way of observation because I am concerned that Senator Walters and others who have an interest in this matter have that particular worry as far as possible alleviated. I do not think we can draw any conclusions, from the ideological composition of union leadership, as to the degree of industrial disputation in which a particular union is likely to be involved. </PARA>
<PARA> What I think is a very real danger in a society in which there is rapidly changing technology, is small unions in very key positions, because of high technology. The classic example is those boorish, dreadful people at the New South Wales Caltex oil refinery who stand up New South Wales-stop pulling the levers-because of their very sectional interests which are not in the interests of the trade union movement as a whole in New South Wales. Those people at the Caltex refinery are very few in number but they are a classic example of the sort of power which can be organised in an increasingly technological society by a small, irresponsible group in a key position. Generally speaking, in the context of a larger union-I know this does not apply in the Caltex situation-we will find, just as we do in political parties, that the extremes tend to be absorbed in the overall good of the union in terms of dictating its policy. I think that is a very good thing. If we have a consensus situation in which extremes in small unions are isolated in positions to exercise great power, they are much more likely to exercise it. In my view that is a very positive argument for amalgamations and not an argument which is based on the view which has been traditionally held in Liberal-National Country Party circles that society and the work force never change. Of course, the composition of the work force is changing daily and the sort of task which people are being asked to perform is changing daily almost on the same basis. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I find the Government's arguments in relation to this legislation extraordinary. What we have here is a demonstrated lack of faith by the Fraser Government in employers and the trade union movement about a matter on which there is total agreement. If the Government is a tripod, if I can put it that way, the only argument it has left is that it is protecting some alleged and fictitious public interest in relation to this matter. I do not think that is acting in the public interest. It is a neurotic fear by ill-informed, conservative politicians about the consequences of change of this order. It is a fear which was, of course, overcome for a period when the Government faced an election. If anything frightens conservative politicions more than neurotic fears about the work force, it is fears about an impending election. In that context the Government will say anything, as it did in the run-up to the 1980 election, on this important question of union amalgamations. </PARA>
<PARA> The most important thing is that this country makes important breakthroughs in the log-jam which exists in industrial relations in Australia. We must get some creative policy making from the Government, and some forward looking policy making in the area of industrial relations, otherwise we will lapse further and further back, and the Government will have paid agitators such as Andrew Peacock calling on it more and more to have a wages policy and to look at the questions related to collective bargaining in industry. As I said, all these questions will keep cropping up for those opposite from paid agitators such as Mr Peacock. They should not worry about the Laurie Carmichaels and other people out there, they will get them in their own party. They are so resistant on the basis of old mythology to constructive, positive and creative changes in industrial relations that in fact nothing is happening. It is not only newspapers such as the Australian Financial Review that write off this Government's industrial relations policy as a disaster area; it is the view of most informed commentators on industrial relations issues. It is a tragedy that Senator Chaney had to come into the Senate chamber last night and read that ill-informed apologia of that failed Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Viner, in order to try to resist this important and significant Bill which I commend to the support of the Senate. </PARA>

It seems to me that everywhere we go people state that amalgamations are necessary to prevent all these demarcation disputes that apply right throughout Australia. We hear how dreadful and intransigent these demarcation disputes are. Senator Button and Senator Siddons referred to this aspect. It is referred to regularly in the Press. Indeed on the last occasion that Senator Chipp, Senator Siddons's leader, spoke about this matter on 3 June 1981 he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I ask one of my colleagues in the Labor Party to correct me if I am wrong. I am told that about 20 per cent of all time lost through strikes is caused not by bloody-minded unions or by employer lockouts but simply by demarcation dispute wars between different unions on the same job. </PARA>
<PARA>According to the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics figures, disputes under the heading 'Trade Unionism' amounted to 1.5 per cent of all working days lost-not 20 per cent, not even 15 per cent, not even 10 per cent, not even 5 per cent, but 1.5 per cent. That was the figure for disputes relating to trade unionism. The column lists disputes concerning employment of non-unionists, inter-union and intra-union disputes, sympathy stoppages in support of employees in other industries and recognition of union activities. All of those types of dispute accounted for a mere 1.5 per cent of the total working days lost from all the causes of industrial disputes. I hope that puts to rest once and for all that particular furphy. I hope the Senate will recognise that, on further figures available from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, disputes derived from demarcation issues represent less than half of that 1.5 per cent. We are talking about introducing a Bill allegedly to overcome a massive problem of demarcations which comprise conservatively perhaps 0.8 per cent of working days lost. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us get down to facts. Let us examine these proposals and put them under some sort of scrutiny in the future, rather than taking as read what we have been told. Indeed, there is no guarantee whatsoever that amalgamations will solve demarcation disputes. In fact, the largest demarcation dispute in the history of Australia-I am going from memory-was one on the west coast of Tasmania between a fitter member and a boilermaker member of the same union, the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. I concede that we ought to have a good look at all of the figures and not accept this nonsense which is thrown about, that there are all these demarcation disputes. In fact, some of the worst types of demarcation disputes occur between members of the same union; for example, over the issue of the use of contractors. Honourable senators may remember some of those very difficult oil industry disputes in the last couple of years. Two of the disputes which affected the community most were between contractor members of the Transport Workers Union of Australia and oil company driver members of the Transport Workers Union. The amalgamation of unions will not help the situation. I believe that far more detailed consideration should be given to this matter. It was pointed out that in the Federal Republic of Germany there are only 16 unions. So what? That does not mean that because there are fewer unions there are fewer disputes. As it happens, in Germany there are fewer disputes of a politically oriented nature. That is because the Federal Republic of Germany will not wear political disputes.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The disputes are not divided in these figures. They are largely in the area of bans, such as bans on ships carrying materials to a port of a country which is not liked by a particular union, bans on uranium and that sort of thing. One can carry the fewer unions and fewer disputes argument too far. Take Japan as an example. Japan has far fewer disputes but it has 73,000 unions. So that is no argument. As to the suggestion that Senator Siddons made last night about wearing the American system, I issue a slight warning about that. America does have craft unions and it also has major amalgamated unions in the vehicle industry, such as the Auto Workers Union. However, there are far longer disputes in the United States where there is collective bargaining. They are massive disputes. I refer to man days lost. I will take this up with Senator Siddons at some other stage and not bore the Senate with it now. The United States figures do not hold up to the Australian figures so far as major industrial stoppages are concerned. It has been said that we ought to pass this Bill so as to arrive ultimately at the situation of having industry unions. As Senator Scott rightly asked, what is an industry union?</PARA></TALK.START>

So far as the Australian Council of Trade Unions is concerned, its policy is not for amalgamation of unions on an industry basis. Let us not kid ourselves.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it is not. For example, in the railways, I do not reckon that you would have an ice cream's chance in hell of getting the AMWSU to give to the Australian Railways Union its members in the railway workshops. Obviously the policy of the ACTU is not to have industry-wide unions. Its rules envisage industrial unions 'by industry or sector'. If the ACTU were to be asked, 'Into what industries ought the unions to be grouped?' the Government and the Parliament would have something to go on. But under the current circumstances the policy is one of 'bigger is best', and in my view bigger is not best. I agree with Senator Scott that some of the craft unions ought to be maintained in their entirety. We should not lay the foundations for tearing down unions, of enabling the larger ones to gobble up the smaller craft unions. All the talk nowadays is not of amalgamations of large and small unions; it is of amalgamations of big unions. If the Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Bill (No. 2) becomes law, 12 1/2 per cent of a smaller craft union could be gobbled up into a larger union.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right, senator. That is what I am saying. The 12 1/2 per cent could decide to be gobbled up and that would apply to the whole range of that particular trade. I am not fussed greatly about it but I am throwing it in so that we will not lose our perspective. In those circumstances, with skilled and unskilled people in the same union, there certainly would be problems in union meetings and so on. It could well create bases for intra-union disputation. Australia needs to ensure that there are groups of unions which have specific attitudes, in regard to the skilled trades particularly. It is on the skilled trades that Australia's future physical development will depend. I maintain that what is suggested in this particular Bill will not do industrial relations any good. I am sorry to have sought leave to speak at this stage. I am doubly sorry not to have entered into the debate more fully so that Senator Button and I could have a discussion about it. At this stage I am not convinced that I should vote for the Bill. Let the ACTU come out with what it means by industries and I will have a look at it.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> One of the basic reasons why this legislation is proposed is the important question of the use of resources by trade unions and the availability of resources to them. I think the resources would be put to much better use by amalgamated unions. Earlier in this debate I specifically referred to the textile, clothing and footwear unions. As I pointed out, for nearly 10 years they have been trying to amalgamate under the provisions of the present law. This industry has followed a torturous path over the last 10 years with massive disemployment, massive closure of mills and factories and the continuing threat of the Industries Assistance Commission recommendations on the whole question of protection hanging over its head. I think there would be a much better use of union resources if the amalgamation which those three unions desire were to proceed. The unions say that they cannot amalgamate under the present law.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I am. I think that would be extremely difficult. The other reason is that we believe that the amalgamation process in such industries as the car industry, the shipbuilding industry and so on would make for easier lines of communication and negotiation between unions and employers. I understand that the employers believe that too. This Bill, in the context of its now being presented to the Senate, is supported by the Australian Council of Trade Unions for the sorts of reasons which were advanced in the second reading speech. I know, we all know, that vested interests are involved in the trade union movement. It is believed that some interests in certain industries would be better served by bigger unions; others believe that vested interests are best served by smaller unions. But whatever the position of the smaller unions is, the fact that this society has to face up to is that in times of very rapidly changing technology craft union demarcations arrived at in the 1850s are not necessarily appropriate in a contemporary society of the 1980s. That is one of the issues that has to be faced up to in relation to the question of amalgamations. It is very important in terms of developing a more modern trade union movement in Australia. Those are the things which we regard as important. I do not dissent from some of the views which have been put by Senator Harradine. I argue that on balance the solution which we propose is much better than the legislation which presently exists and which is keeping the industrial process in Australia from advancing in a more progressive way.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The substance of the Defence Acts Amendment Bill 1981 is by and large uncontroversial and, for that reason, the Opposition will not be opposing it at the second reading stage. But there are some matters to which the Opposition has expressed hostility and we will be moving amendments in an endeavour to improve the Bill in those respects. I also understand that an amendment will be moved by the Australian Democrats in the Committee stage which will have the result of the debate taking off in a rather different direction from that which is involved in the rather pedestrian provisions of the Bill as it presently stands. But it is only with the Bill as it stands and with possible improvements to it of the kind that the Opposition will recommend that I will be dealing in the second reading debate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill deals with four distinct subject areas. In the first place it provides for the payment of additional compensation to members of the reserve and emergency forces who become totally incapacitated through personal injury in the course of their service with the Defence Force. Secondly, it re-enacts and revises provisions relating to co-operative arrangements between the defence forces of Australia and other countries, especially in two areas; first of all, mutual powers of command between such forces and, secondly, in relation to the treatment of those absent without leave in a co-operative arrangement situation. The third major area that is changed by the Bill is the creation of the new rules for public access to declared areas of defence land. The fourth subject matter of the Bill amounts to a series of uncontroversial amendments to the regulation-making powers relating respectively to the forfeiture of salary and allowances in certain cases, the payment of compensation to persons suffering loss or damage in certain cases, the application of Commonwealth, State and Territory taxes to Defence Force canteens and, a little more importantly, the conduct of defence courts and boards of inquiry so far as the compellability of witnesses is concerned and their protection in other proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not need to say anything more about the last of those areas. I do, however, want to make a few remarks about the first three of them and to indicate the scope of the five amendments which the Opposition proposes to move, all of which amendments in fact relate to the single area of co-operative defence arrangements. It is my hope that in dealing with the Bill in this way it will not be necessary for me to speak at any length at all during the Committee stage in relation to the Opposition amendments, but I can now foreshadow the substance of them and the detail necessary for our purposes in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me begin with a few remarks on the subject of the compensation provisions of this Bill. As was acknowledged by the Opposition spokesman, Mr Scholes, in the House of Representatives when the matter was there debated, these amendments are a significant improvement on the present position and an acknowledgment of the need-an acknowledgment only granted, it must be said, after the matter became somewhat controversial-for equity of treatment as between reservists and regular soldiers. Formerly an incapacitated reservist would receive compensation based on his civilian salary for a period of 26 weeks after which he would then fall to be compensated under the Compensation (Australian Government Employees) Act, the provisions of which are notoriously and disgracefully inadequate. As a result of this measure, the reservist will be entitled to be paid at a rate not less than 7.6 per cent of his civilian salary once the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen) has made the necessary declaration. </PARA>
<PARA> We endorse this improvement but, at the same time, we notice and draw attention to serious weaknesses as we see it in the new provisions. That is a situation which might arise where a young reservist who receives an adult military salary, as indeed he should because of the risks he is taking, receives that salary according to rank, but receives a civilian salary by contrast which is age related and is considerably below the adult rate. In those situations if he is injured his long-term compensation will be based on that civilian salary rather than his reservist's rank which might be an adult one and much superior in terms of the salary return. In other words, he will receive only 76.5 per cent of his 17 or 18-year-old civilian salary, as the case may be, for the latter part of the duration of his incapacity. It seems to us that no proper account is taken of his adult needs, or of the fact that he would have graduated to an adult civilian salary in due course. This is not a matter on which we propose to move an amendment in this place any more than we did in the House of Representatives, but we would like a reasoned response from the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) to this particular point because it does seem to us to be one of some capacity. </PARA>
<PARA> The second major area with which the Bill deals, and the area in respect of which we do have a number of amendments, is the matter of arrangements with the forces of other countries. The Bill inserts new Part IXB in the Defence Act covering the general ground previously contained in Parts III and IV of the Defence (Visiting Forces) Act 1963. The object of the new provisions is to set out the general rules for the kinds of co-operative arrangements with other forces of which Australia has a long history, primarily of course with the forces of the United Kingdom and the United States, in Europe and the Pacific and, in more recent decades, in Korea, Malaysia and Vietnam, and with which again regrettably it appears we may be about to engage in the Sinai. </PARA>
<PARA> I said that there were two areas within this large subject area of co-operative arrangements that are dealt with by the Bill. The first of those two areas is the question of the mutual powers of command, and three kinds of situations are envisaged by the Bill. The first is where there is what is described as an attachment between respective forces. Here it is provided that where an individual member of the Australian Defence Force is attached temporarily to another force, or vice versa, in that situation the person so attached becomes subject to the service law, including the disciplinary law, of the force to which he is so attached. The second situation is where the forces are described as serving together. Here the provision is that when the Australian Defence Force or a component of it is serving with others, the respective officers and non-commissioned officers of the forces in question are to be empowered to give orders to their subordinates in the other forces, although it is further provided that breaches of discipline by Australians are to be dealt with by Australian authorities under Australian service law. In a final refinement and description of these co-operative arrangements, it is further provided that in a situation where the Australian defence forces are described as acting in combination with forces of another country, a relationship implying a slightly closer degree of co-operation than is involved in merely 'serving together', there is provision that the commanding officer of the combined forces has the power of both command and discipline in accordance with Australian service law. </PARA>
<PARA> These are complicated provisions but, by and large, in substance they are acceptable to the Opposition. We accept their general legitimacy and the general desirability of the different kinds of integrated arrangements which are described in the Bill. We acknowledge the desirability of there being clear ground rules governing the command relationships and the disciplinary relationships in those respective types of situations. However, it is our belief, and this belief is embodied in our amendments, that there ought to be some reciprocity with other countries concerned before we enact legislation of this kind, which has the potential to place Australians in a subservient position. We do not object to the reality or necessity or desirability of, on occasions, Australian servicemen being placed in a subservient position vis-a-vis the superior officers or NCOs in other forces. But we do believe that if that is to happen then it should happen only in a circumstance where, if the boot is on the other foot, there is equally a willingness on the part of the other country concerned to legislate so as to ensure that the same relationship will apply there. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus, if I might describe at this stage the substance of our amendments in this respect, I think it will save some discussion of this aspect at the Committee stage. Our first amendment is to provide that attachments, properly so-called, may take place only if the country with which the attachment arrangement is proposed has equivalent legislation making its nationals subject to Australian service law when they happen to be attached to our forces. The second and third of our amendments, which I will be moving formally in the Committee stage, deal not with the attachment situation but with 'serving together' or 'acting in combination'. Here we wish to provide that the declaration of the Governor-General establishing these relationships, or at least establishing the command and discipline implications of these relationships, should be subject to parliamentary approval. In this case we are talking about parliamentary approval by both Houses. I make it clear that amendments Nos 2 and 3 on the sheet which has been circulated are interrelated. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not saying by these amendments that Australian forces cannot serve together with, or act in combination with, other forces without parliamentary approval. It is that proposition which is essentially the subject matter of the Australian Democrats' amendment which, as they have foreshadowed in the media, they will move in the Committee stage. We are saying only that the new rules governing who is subordinate to whom and who has command and disciplinary powers over whom should not come into effect unless and until there has been affirmative parliamentary approval. We anticipate, of course, that Parliament would not approve of such a declaration taking effect and these rules relating to command and discipline relationships coming into force if it were not satisfied, again, that reciprocity applied and that the countries with whom the Australian forces were serving accepted themselves some obligations for their own nationals to obey Australian commands where appropriate. That is the substance of the amendment. </PARA>
<PARA> I note in relation to the amendment that the Minister for Defence, Mr Killen, expressed some sympathy with the approach adopted by the Opposition and our concern that there should be formal reciprocity of this kind. He indicated in the course of the debate in the other place that he would seriously consider and take on board our proposals and give us an appropriate response when the matter came to be debated in this chamber. I regret to report to the Senate that that consideration does not seem to have moved Mr Killen even to the extent of giving us a reasoned reply. I will read into the record the letter which he sent to the Opposition defence spokesman, Mr Gordon Scholes, on 30 October 1981. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> During the course of the debate in the Committee stages of the Defence Acts Amendment Bill on 23 September, I undertook to examine certain amendments proposed by the Opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> I am now in a position to inform you that I examined these amendments but, after consultation with my colleagues, it was decided by the Government that the amendments would not be proceeded with. </PARA>
<PARA>Perhaps there is a reasoned justification for the Government's not proceeding with the sympathetic consideration of the amendments proposed by the Opposition. If there is a reasoned basis for it, not just the usual obtuseness of the Minister for Defence and his Department, we would be delighted to hear about it in the Attorney-General's reply in this chamber. If this matter is dealt with in the reply to the second reading debate we can make the Committee stage much less elaborately long-winded than it might otherwise prove to be. </PARA>
<PARA> The remaining matter under the general head of co-operative arrangements that is dealt with in the Bill is the treatment of absentees without leave. The Bill makes various provisions with respect to those absent without leave relating to their apprehension, detention and treatment while in custody. Basically, those provisions seem to the Opposition to be quite sensible, satisfactory and unobjectionable but we have two amendments in this area-Nos 4 and 5 on the list which has been circulated. Perhaps it is a convenient time to indicate briefly what they are. Amendment No. 4 relates to proposed new section 116F which provides that if another country with whom Australia has a co-operative defence relationship asks Australia to apprehend deserters or those absent without leave, the authorised officer in Australia may, at his discretion, issue a warrant to apprehend the persons in question. We in the Opposition simply say that this provision is too open-ended and that there should be some appropriate time limit-we have suggested two years but we would be willing to consider a longer period-beyond which the deserter or person absent without leave cannot be arrested and returned under the authority of this kind of provision. </PARA>
<PARA> We are not proposing that there be some kind of general amnesty necessarily for people in this situation in the sense that they cannot be apprehended or convicted for any other offence that they may have committed when absent without leave while in Australia as members of a force with which we have a co-operative defence arrangement. There may well be other sanctions which are perfectly appropriate to apply. We are just concerned that years after the event-maybe 20 years or 25 years in some cases-this power will have a potential application. In this respect we do not think that Australia should be committing itself, creating a statutory obligation for itself, to co-operate in rounding-up operations of this kind that some other formerly friendly country with whom we have had a co-operative relationship may be minded to embark upon. </PARA>
<PARA> The other remaining amendment, which is No. 5 on the circulated Opposition list, relates to the procedure governing the issuing of warrants for the apprehension of persons arrested without leave. This Opposition amendment provides for a time limit beyond which such a warrant cannot be executed. We suggest 30 days as an appropriate period. Again, this is negotiable. We also seek to provide for an appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal for a review on the merits of the circumstances in which a warrant is issued under this legislative authority. That is the approach that the Opposition adopts. It is a slightly more velvet gloved or sympathetic approach to the problem of persons absent without leave than that which is implied in the Government's proposed legislation. We re-emphasise that our major concern, in our view of this legislation, is with the reciprocity requirements that we see as being appropriate and indeed necessary if we are to have these new command rules established and given permanent statutory form. I will be briefer about the remaining matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The third large area dealt with by the Bill and the last area about which I want to have a word or two concerns the question of public areas of defence land, of which there is a very large quantity scattered around various parts of Australia. The Bill proposes a new Part IXB for the Defence Act which provides in particular for the declaration by the Minister of certain defence land to be public areas, and the appointment of rangers with a provision that any member of the Australian Federal Police or a Territory police force is to be regarded, ex officio, as a ranger for this purpose. It vests these rangers with a number of powers relating to arrest, search and seizure and also vests in the Minister powers to make by-laws relating to the control and management of these public areas of defence land. Again we have no amendments to these provisions but we feel some aspects deserve brief comment. </PARA>
<PARA> First, so far as the powers of rangers are concerned, I simply say that the provisions made for arrest, search and seizure do perhaps justify very close attention in this legislation, as they do in any other. One would have wished that the Senate Standing Committee on Scrutiny of Bills was in existence to give the benefit of an informed report on the implication of these provisions to enable their better consideration, particularly occurring as they do buried away again in a compendious piece of legislation. On the basis of the scrutiny we as an Opposition have been able to give these provisions I think it is fair to say that by and large they seem to conform with the kind of criteria as specified in the Australian Law Reform Commission's 1975 report on criminal investigation governing special situations of this kind, particularly in remote areas. </PARA>
<PARA> In principle we do not see any fundamental objections to these provisions and indeed we further note in this respect with some pleasure, if incredulity, that the basic recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in relation to arrest, search and seizure seem to have been picked up in the Criminal Investigation Bill, Part II and Part V respectively which was introduced into this place last week. I say no more about arrest, search and seizure although there are some possible difficulties in the way that these provisions will operate in practice if they are not sensitively applied. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there is a little more to be said about the question of environmental standards in defence areas and the mechanisms proposed for the guaranteeing that satisfactory environmental standards are maintained. The Minister is empowered by the Bill to make by-laws covering a number of different areas, in particular those relating to the prohibition of pollution of soil, air or water, the use of fire, the use and parking of motor vehicles and generally the protection and preservation of public areas. It appears that most of the powers that this Bill would build into the Defence Act have been borrowed from the National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Act, but not so as to integrate the arrangements for environmental management of defence land with the arrangements that are involved in the operation of the national parks system. Rather, what this Bill would establish is a separate system of national parks. There is no suggestion that there would be a proper plan of management developed in relation to defence land, as is crucial in the national parks administration. I understand that the Department of Defence never at any stage even consulted the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service on this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Opposition is wrong in that belief or understanding we would be delighted to have the Minister tell us so. There may be some considerations especially relating to national security and so on which are peculiar to defence land and which would require some modification of the basic parks legislation. But the essential objects of that legislation and this, relating to the conservation of this land and access to it by the public, are so similar that it seems absurd that there could not have been a better meshing of both the legislative provisions and the proposed administration of the land in question. This seems to be a case of interdepartmental power politics prevailing at the expense of the national interest. I conclude on the note that we have these reservations, these caveats, these proposed amendments to the Defence Bill. We find the Bill essentially a piecemeal approach to a set of piecemeal problems, but I suppose that is inevitable in a clean-up piece of legislation of this kind. Whatever further objections we have, we will reserve them for the Committee stage. We do not oppose the second reading of the Defence Acts Amendment Bill 1981. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats take a somewhat more fundamental and serious view of the Defence Acts Amendment Bill 1981 than does the Australian Labor Party. This legislation is a sort of catch-all of a large number of bits and pieces in the defence area. This seems to us to be a suitable vehicle to deal with an area which not only is of great concern to the Australian Democrats but also, I suggest, is quite reasonably of concern to hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of people in this country. It concerns the circumstances under which Australians can be sent overseas either to war or as members of some kind of peacekeeping force, such as that proposed for the Sinai. Our law is deficient compared with that of certain other countries, such as Canada, in that such decisions are Executive decisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I take honourable senators back to when Australia found itself in a classic dilemma, one of the greatest dilemmas this country has ever faced. One of the most divisive issues that has ever oppressed our history occurred between 1962 and 1971 when some 50,000 Australian servicemen from all three Services were engaged in the war in Vietnam, the result of which was a communist government for the whole of Vietnam. The hostilities almost certainly resulted also in the later destruction of the free governments in neighbouring Cambodia and Laos and the incorporation of all of what was once French Indo-China into the communist state. During that decade of war 492 members of the Australian forces were killed. Of these deaths, 187 were of young men who had no choice as to this tragic early end to their lives because they were conscripts set to fight in an unwinnable and unjustifiable foreign adventure which, judged on any standard, was a disaster and which, far from deterring the spread of communism in Asia, actually contributed significantly to it and speeded up that process. As well as those deaths many more young Australians were injured, nearly 3,000 of them. Of these more than 1,000 were conscripts. </PARA>
<PARA> As if this were not enough, the war has left behind further legacies of horror and suffering for our people. During the war large areas of Vietnam were sprayed with agent orange containing the herbicide 2,4,5-T in its worst and most dangerous form, highly contaminated by large percentages of the poisonous chemical dioxin, which is rightly judged by experts as being possibly the most dangerous substance on the face of the earth and which is responsible for the deformation of children in the womb. The evils of that war were not confined to a single generation of Australians but were passed forward to the next. Even there it might not end. Recessive defects of this type may well show up even in generations not yet born. This is the area of consequence we are talking about as a result of a decision taken to involve Australia in a war without the proper consultation of its people and of its Parliament and without the right, which we are seeking in our proposed amendment, of the Parliament, as the voice of the people, to have some control over the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> In view of this, it is worth looking at the origins of the Vietnam war. There are very many differing versions about how Australia got into that tragic and wasteful episode. For many years it was stated officially that we went there to answer a call for help from the Government of South Vietnam, but that is now completely discredited and is known to be not true. Papers released in the United States as a result of the effective freedom of information law there indicate that the United States wanted Australia there with other countries so that the United States would not be seen to be acting alone. That was the motivation; that was why Australia was there. Of course, we were not told at the time or subsequently that that was the reason. In fact it was stated over and over again by the then Government that the reason was that the government of a free country had asked us to help. But that was not true. So again we must look at the motivation of government, its honesty, should it be left alone in such a situation without the control of the Parliament and the debate in the Parliament that would result from our proposed amendment should it become law. </PARA>
<PARA> What are the motivations of government, the pressures on it, to conceal and to dissimulate? It is said that a nation which cannot learn from the lessons of history has no future. If history has proved anything, it has certainly proved that. So it is reasonable and rational for us to look at the history of the Vietnam war to see what we can learn from it. Australian involvement in that war before it ended was opposed by millions of Australians, certainly by the majority of Australians. It was passionately and actively opposed by scores of thousands-possibly hundreds of thousands. It became a deeply divisive issue in our community and we still bear the scars of it. It has resulted in a deep scepticism on the part of young people about the validity of our process of government. Many of them are not on the electoral role because they fear future wars in which they might again be sent overseas through no choice of their own to fight, against their own will and against the will of the people. </PARA>
<PARA> The Democrats' major interest in this Bill is the foreshadowed amendment which I have circulated and which, if carried, would mean that no such foreign adventure could ever happen again without the consent of both Houses of the Federal Parliament. To the Australian Democrats this is a matter of great concern, a matter on which we have received tremendous representations from the community and a matter which we know, beyond any shadow of doubt, that the Australian community wants. Yet it seems to me quite likely that members of this Parliament whom those people elect to do reasonably what they think is right and proper will ignore this situation. I suggest even at this stage that they will ignore it at their peril. The two Houses of Parliament-I stress the two Houses of Parliament-are responsible to the people of Australia and should reflect their will. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a current fact that the House of Representatives alone does not reflect the will of the people. The Government does not have a majority in the Senate. This situation is certain to continue into the indefinite future. Hence it is imperative that the sanction of both Houses and especially that of the Senate be obtained before fighting forces or so-called peacekeeping forces are sent overseas. This will be a resonable role for the Senate in its role as a cautionary House, a House of review. It would not be enough for the House of Representatives alone to do this. The House of Representatives by its nature is virtually a rubber stamp of the Executive and becomes more and more so with every day that passes. It has even been castigated to that effect in recent days by its own Speaker. </PARA>
<PARA> How can we in this Senate then suggest that the House of Representatives alone should have any responsibility or any authority over this matter? Yet the Labor Party has foreshadowed an amendment to our amendment to seek to water it down to the extent that only the House of Representatives would have to be consulted in the case of any warlike activities on the part of the country. The Australian Democrats feel that the Labor Party, if it has any sincerity or any basic honesty whatsoever, will support the passage of our proposed amendment through the Senate. If it fails to do so it will be rightly judged by the people of Australia for its perfidy, its weakness and its political cynicism. It would mean that its protests over the Vietnam war over the years can now be seen as quite cynically shed crocodile tears; no more than that. </PARA>
<PARA> The same basic comments could apply to the Sinai force. When brought to the test on this matter the Labor Party, in fact, went to water. It does not want to support a situation in which the representatives of the people have control over this matter. What its motivations are for that I cannot even begin to divine. I would be interested to hear, perhaps in the Committee stage, some explanation from the Labor Party on just what it thinks its motivations are. Furthermore, this is one of those important, basic and continuing isues in the community concerning the rights of the people to be consulted through their representatives on whether they go into the most serious, disruptive situation government could ask of them-to go into war. I suggest to the Labor Party that if it fumbles this one it is not something that will be easily or quickly forgotten, nor should it be. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendment takes into account the need for government to act quickly in the event of emergency. There is provision for it to act quickly but it must call both Houses of Parliament together within 48 hours to approve that action. This is a similar provision to the one which already applies in Canada where parliament must be called together within ten days. We feel that in a modern world with modern transport there is really nothing to stop parliament being called together more quickly, and I think that would improve that kind of situation. The amendment also exempts from service personnel abroad for the purpose of buying stores or equipment, those abroad on missions involving their own training, or crews of Australian ships and aircraft abroad. If there are any categories which we have overlooked-we have a fairly long list of them-we will not mind further amendments being moved to extend them if that would improve this proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> I think one basic point is that in Australia we now have a society that will not accept the idea that it must be told what to do by some higher source of wisdom. The new generation of Australians wants part of the action and it also wants safeguards against precipitate, unsavoury or unexplained executive action, especially in a matter as important as this. It is also a much better informed generation than have been previous generations. The enormous switchover of what were once mainly entertainment media to public information and debate functions indicates that. I think any government which ignores this trend must do so at its peril. If the Labor Party puts itself up seriously as an alternative government it cannot also, I suggest, dither like a rather elderly waitress hesitating over which table to serve first-the principle sitting at one table or expediency sitting at the other. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I feel that the Australian Democrats' proposal, as I understand it, deals with the purposes for which the Government would be sending troops overseas. They would include, firstly, unilateral action taken by Australia in its immediate area-for example, Papua New Guinea and its territories in the South Pacific; secondly, action in conjunction with its allies-for example, the United States or under an international agreement such as the five-power agreement; or, thirdly, action taken under the United Nations or international auspices. Those are the sorts of purposes for which I can envisage the Government deciding to commit forces to serve abroad.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is to be noted that the commitment of Australian forces for any of those purposes may be to meet an emergency but it may also be to prevent an emergency from developing. That is the key point-for example, in a case where a friendly government, foreseeing trouble, requests the presence of Australian troops. Of course, that occurred recently when the New Hebrides requested Papua New Guinea to supply troops. The Democrats' amendment seems to me to run into the following difficulties: It assumes that Australian troops would be committed abroad only in an emergency-that is, proposed new section under 50C (3); it allows troops to be despatched immediately but provides that they may not be required to continue to serve. </PARA>

<PARA>This amendment is fairly lengthy. I think honourable senators have had the opportunity of seeing it. I will speak briefly to it although I did mention it in the second reading debate. Basicially, clause 4 requires Australian military forces to serve overseas. It does not contain any provisions limiting the carte-blanche right of the Government to send the troops overseas. That is, of course, the purpose of our amendment. In other countries the provision we propose applies. In Canada, the Governor-in-Council may deploy troops anywhere, any time, subject to Parliament meeting within 10 days to approve action taken. In the Federal Republic of Germany there are limitations. There is constitutional prohibition against German forces participating in a war of aggression. Participation in a collective military action for preservation of peace is permissible only if that force is deployed in a situation which, at that time, represents an illegal attack on the Bundesrepublic. In Japan, the 1947 Constitution of Japan, by article 9, provides:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Japanese people for ever renounce war as a sovereign right of the nation . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The Self-defence Forces are authorised to protect the peace and stability of Japan against direct and indirect aggression. Self-defence Force personnel may not be deployed outside Japan. This has been interpreted by successive governments as precluding participation in United Nations peace keeping and observation teams. In the United Kingdom there are no restrictions on the monarch as commander-in-chief to deploy forces on the advice of his ministers, with a successful noconfidence motion in Parliament and a subsequent election as the ultimate and only sanction. In the United States, the President has independent power to take military action whenever the interests of the United States require it. Congress, however, has power to raise and support armies and to declare war. However, a study prepared in 1951 for the Committee on Foreign Relations cites at least 125 incidents in America's history in which the President has ordered the armed forces to take action or maintain positions abroad without congressional authorisation. So Congress's powers in respect of that right have been eroded. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats' amendment seeks to place the responsibility for a decision to send Australian troops abroad with the two Houses of Parliament subject to exceptions covering the movement of personnel in the normal course of their activities and the need to take quick action in an emergency. The Government will still be able to act quickly in an emergency declared by proclamation but must obtain parliamentary approval within two days. If Parliament is not in session the provisions require it to be recalled to make this decision. I wish to make the point at this stage, because it has been mentioned by Senator Harradine, that we do not necessarily see this as merely operating in an emergency. It is only the subsequent recall of Parliament which operates in an emergency. In a situation where the Government wished to send a force overseas for any reason whatsoever and where it had the time to do so it would, of course, be able to put it through and justify it before both Houses of Parliament in the normal way. </PARA>
<PARA> The provision excludes overseas service by members of the Defence Force pursuant to their temporary attachment, as provided by section 116B, as part of an Australian diplomatic or consular mission on an Australian vessel or aircraft not engaged in hostilities or in operations during which hostilities are likely to occur, for the purpose of their education or training or for purposes related to the procurement of equipment or stores. In those provisions we have tried to provide a situation which is realistic and in which the Government has the utmost freedom of action for the normal and ordinary purposes that its armed forces might be concerned with, short of the two major areas of actual hostilities and use as a fighting force or as a peacekeeping force in some remote country. I commend the amendment to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We oppose the amendment in its present form. We do not believe that decisions to send Australian troops overseas should require-important, crucial and controversial as those decisions often are-the assent of both Houses of Parliament. We do not believe that but we do believe it is appropriate that there should be an opportunity for parliamentary debate before any such momentous step is taken, making due regard for situations of emergency. In order to clearly state our position in that respect we propose to move a further amendment to the Australian Democrats' amendment to delete the references, where appearing, to 'each House of the Parliament' and to substitute the words 'the House of Representatives'. The result of that amendment will be to guarantee that Executive decisions of this kind are brought before the Parliament at the soonest reasonable opportune moment, preferably before the decision is made, except in emergency circumstances. It is not required that the Parliament as a whole convene and certainly it is not required that this chamber, with all its idiosyncratic performances over the years, have a veto power over the Government's decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is a long way and a short way of debating this whole subject matter. The long way is to tackle it in the way in which the Australian Democrats have endeavoured to do, primarily in the speech at the second reading stage by Senator Mason and in a shorter fashion in his contribution to the Committee stage; that is, to review all the kinds of circumstances and cases which have arisen in the past, from the Boer War to the Sinai, or which might arise in the future, to talk about the pros and cons of excursions overseas and raise the spectre-indeed it is often a spectre-of very unfortunate decisions which have often been made in the past, and to suggest on the basis of that that we need some more checks and balances in the future to ensure that they do not happen again. To approach the argument in that way inevitably is to get drawn into a very long argument. It is not an argument which we are anxious to join.</PARA>
<PARA> Our attitudes to the pros and cons of military adventures in the past are perfectly well known. Our attitudes against the proposed current adventure to the Sinai are equally well known. We do not find it necessary to apologise in any way for the kind of tirade that has been directed against us today by Senator Mason. That is one of the reasons I feel a trifle churlish at the moment in responding to his contribution. Our attitude to such military adventures as Vietnam was known and perfectly apparent to the Australian people before the Australian Democrats ever existed on this planet, while indeed their leader was actively participating in the implementation of those heinous decision and while this collection in the chamber were barely out of their political nappies. Indeed, there is plenty of evidence on the basis of today's contributions and others this session that they are still in their political nappies. We do not need any moralising or any hypocritical, sanctimonious grandstanding from Senator Mason or anyone else on the subject of our attitudes, our beliefs and our convictions about the morality or immorality of particular excursions by Australian troops overseas. We simply do not regard those issues as being helpful. We do not regard all the argument, all the controversy and all the emotion that have been generated by those issues as being relevant or helpful to the consideration of the matter that is being brought forward. So, the short way in which I propose to deal with this matter is as follows: While it is desirable that the Parliament debates this matter of the proposed sending of foreign troops overseas, while it is not good enough for Malcolm Fraser, the Prime Minister-I am sorry, Mr Chairman; I have to give him his due title-to make the kind of statement he made yesterday while a chamber of this Parliament is still sitting, without any attempt to have that statement put down and to be made the subject of discussion in this Parliament, and while it is appropriate that the Parliament has the opportunity to debate these matters and for fierce critical opposition to be expressed to them, we do not believe, when all is said and done, that foreign policy issues and decisions of this kind, war and peace decisions as they are in extreme situations, are matters which are other than pre-eminently matters in our system of government for the executive government of the day. These are the kinds of decisions which governments are elected to carry out. These are the kinds of decisions for which governments must retain the ultimate responsibility. These are the kinds of decisions-</PARA>

It is a question of the kind of decision for which a government will properly win plaudits if it is right or for which a government will properly win condemnation if it gets it wrong as this Government has so often got it wrong in the past. I simply do not think and the Opposition simply does not think that it is appropriate to vest this kind of veto power in a chamber which so often has a non-government majority. To do so is to give succour, to give nourishment to all the accumulated nonsense that so often in the past has been talked about the role of this chamber in our system. This chamber has a role of review. It has a perfectly proper role and it has a major contribution to make. I understand that that is a position which has been accepted by the Democrats. You have contributed actively to making this place an effective house of review. But you do not believe any more than we believe that this chamber should exercise a power of life or death over the government of the day, over its capacity to survive.

We simply take the view that there are a series of such limitations which it is perfectly proper to impose upon the Senate in our parliamentary constitutional system. Whatever may be the delusions of grandeur of some honourable senators in this chamber, we are not a United States-style congressional chamber. We are not a legislative body which has the powers, or should have the powers, of the United States Senate. We are not a body which is engaged in a legislative capacity in a kind of tug-of-war, a veto power, a counter-balanced relationship, with the Executive Government in the way that is indispensibly necessarily the case in a United States-style presidential system. Of course it is appropriate that the United States Senate should exercise a veto power over war and peace decisions, about the dispatch of troops and all the other things where presidential power was so outrageously gained and added to in the 1960s and 1970s. That is not appropriate here.</PARA></TALK.START>

We are talking about fast moving executive responses to international war and peace, military situations. They are quintessentially government decisions for which the government of this day must bear the responsibility. They are not the kinds of decisions for which this chamber should have the capacity to exercise a veto power. I do not want to be any ruder than I have been about the Democrats in this debate but with the track record of that Party in this place, we could have a situation that while we are waiting for the Democrats to make up their minds as to what their attitude should be towards some important matter of war and peace, or the dispatch of troops overseas, the war in question could well be over on the basis of the experience we have had over the last few months. It is just not appropriate in matters of this kind. I can only repeat, quintessentially executive and Government matters-for the Democrats, or anyone else who exercise a balance of power when they do not constitute the majority parties, to act in this way. It is a fundamental point about the relationship of these chambers to each other and about the relationship of the legislative arm to the Executive arm in our parliamentary system of government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is the basis on which the Opposition expresses its view on this matter.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Should the defence of Australia be at the mercy and risk of the dithering of the Australian Democrats in this chamber? That is the question in this amendment. It is not a question of some high parliamentary sovereignty. It has always been the case in Australia that the Executive Government responsibly reviews defence situations. It makes decisions in the best interests of this country and brings those decisions to the Parliament for debate. In the amendment before us the Australian Democrats have brought forward an irresponsible veto power over the Executive Government, whether it is a Liberal or Labor government. I believe it is totally opposed to the tradition of executive responsibility in matters of defence for this amendment to be moved by the Democrats. I oppose it utterly. I agree with the great part of Senator Evans's speech and I only urge that he take the implications of his reasoning, that is to reject the amendment that the Opposition has put forward.</PARA></TALK.START>

For the same reason as it is inappropriate for the Democrats to have a veto, I believe it is inappropriate to have the dithering and delay of having to recall the House of Representatives to debate this question. The Opposition ought to reconsider its amendment and withdraw it. In effect, these two amendments delay the passage of this Bill. I do not believe there is any hope whatsoever of an amendment in either form being favourably considered by the House of Representatives. Then it becomes a matter of continual tossing of the Bill between the two Houses.

The interesting point we had from both speakers is that in no circumstances must we have any restraint about going to war; we must have no shortfall; we must have no debate; we must have no discussion at any time. Let us get this matter moving. Let us rush into war without a thought! Let us not have a parliamentary debate on the matter! The point the Australian Democrats have been making is that it is now time to reform this country, not to stand on the conservatism of Senator Evans and Senator Teague, which says that it is sufficient for a few people to make an announcement in Parliament-let us be very clear about this-that commits this country in its most serious form and in a most serious way.

That in Australia constitutes two Houses. I certainly believe that we could give two days to making a decision that is not merely about whether we are to pass another Customs amendment Bill or increase the amount of levy on an apple, or whatever else we want to do in this country. We spend two or four or six days on those matters. But no, when it comes to war we must not do that. We must not take even two days to commit this country to a course which possibly could lead not only to the death of some of our soldiers but also to the total destruction of this country.

He would allow one person in the form of the Prime Minister to make it but will not have the representatives of the people make it. If any government that has a majority in the House of Representatives is to commit our troops, surely it is possible for it to argue to this chamber, even if it does not have a majority, that that is a course upon which we must embark. Surely the Government is not trying to tell me that if the course of action is one which can be argued for in the community, is not one which divides us down the middle, as did the Vietnam war, but is one which has the support of the community, it would not have the support of this House? The type of proposition that is being put is that if the Government has the majority in the lower House, even if it does not have the majority in this House, by all means let it take this country into that type of war even though it will divide the country yet again.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have not as yet spoken on behalf of the Government, so I should formally do so, although I think the Government's view on this subject is very well known. The position is that the Government opposes the amendment proposed by the Australian Democrats, and I will deal with it in a minute. The Government also is opposed to the amendment that has been moved to that amendment by the Opposition. The Government is opposed to the necessity for a parliamentary resolution, whether it be by both Houses or by the House of Representatives only, to a question of the kind that is raised in this amendment. The debate, and in particular Senator Macklin's contribution to it, would seem to indicate that the issue on which Parliament is to be consulted is simply an issue of whether Australia would send troops overseas in a war. In other words, as I understand Senator Macklin's argument, he was saying that Parliament ought to be consulted about whether Australia goes to war.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, the amendment proposed by the Democrats goes very much further than that. It provides that members of the Defence Force may not be required to serve beyond the territorial limits of Australia except in accordance with parliamentary resolution. Australian members of the Defence Force may be required to serve beyond the territorial limits of Australia in a host of different situations. The Democrats' amendment contains some exceptions to that rule, but the exceptions, of course, are by no means exhaustive of the various situations which may arise not just to a defence unit or a force but to a member of the Defence Force. It is not an issue at all of whether Australia is to go to war or to give an expeditionary force or something in the old traditional sense. It is an extremely wide proposition and one which would be quite unworkable in ordinary situations that crop up. Even if some attempt is made to exclude those situations, there are bound to be others cropping up which will not be excluded and Parliament will have to deal with them. I make the point that that is not by any means the ground on which the Government is opposing the amendment. Let me hasten to say that. </PARA>

<PARA> As I said, the Government is also just as much opposed to the proposition put forward by Senator Evans that decisions of these kinds should require the support of the House of Representatives. If there were a case for Parliament to approve decisions of this kind by the Executive I think the proper course would be to do it by an Act of Parliament or by the whole Parliament, not just by one section of the Parliament. But I adopt-the Government basically adopts-the arguments that Senator Evans put forward, arguments which I think completely negative the amendment he has moved. The Government rests its case, as Senator Evans put it, on the high ground of constitutional tradition, propriety, legality and, if I may say so, sound government. This is essentially an Executive decision. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course the Parliament does have a major role to play in these matters. The Executive cannot raise forces or money to sustain forces without the Parliament. Parliament can express its views in relation to the decisions made on these matters. Government and the Executive take great pains to try to ascertain public opinion on these sorts of decisions. But essentially these decisions have to be made by governments, and they have to take the responsibility for them. Governments stand or fall by the propriety of their decisions. The Government would be deeply opposed to and concerned about any derogation of that very important principle of the responsibility of governments under our constitutional system. </PARA>
<PARA> All sorts of arguments and detail can be advanced. Senator Harradine commenced to advance an argument during the second reading stages of the legislation. I am pleased he has returned to the chamber and I hope he will have an opportunity to expand further that argument. In the world in which we live a whole variety of situations face governments. There may be a variety of immediate emergencies; there may be a need to send troops overseas to prevent emergencies occurring; or there may be different levels of an infinite variety of hostilities. These situations can be properly dealt with only by the Executive. They are not appropriate for decisions of the Parliament. As I have said, the Parliament, representing the people, has always had in these situations ample opportunity to express views about these decisions. In the end, Parliament has enormous control because of its power over the purse and its power of raising defence forces. Amendments to legislation may well be required and large volumes of legislation are always required, as we saw in the national security regulations during the war years. There is ample opportunity for parliamentary consideration and parliamentary control in the making of decisions of these kinds, but the actual decisions themselves are essentially Executive decisions under our constitutional system. </PARA>
<PARA> I am delighted that Senator Evans has supported that very basic constitutional principle. I am delighted further that he has not been seduced by arguments that the United States has these sorts of provisions, because unfortunately he is sometimes seduced by those comparisons. Comparisons with the United States are quite inappropriate in this case. The United States Senate has to ratify treaties and all the vast range of appointments to government. There is just no comparison between the United States constitutional system, and certainly the position of its Senate under the United States Constitution, and our situation. I also place on record the Government's opposition to this amendment, on the high constitutional principles which, as I have already said, have been well enunciated by Senator Evans. </PARA>

I readily concede that I, Don Chipp, am embarrassed about Vietnam. I am embarrassed; my conscience is troubled about the years in which I opposed the Jim Cairnses, the Labor politicans of this world who wisely opposed our involvement in Vietnam.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is predictable that Senator Watson and Senator Walters would vote for it but I am talking about the thinking members of this Parliament, the people who do learn some of the lessons of history. An overwhelming number of the members of this Parliament would admit that the decision was wrong. If someone wants to make political capital about my situation at that time he is entitled to do so. But at least I hope to be forgiven in some part by having the grace to admit that I was wrong in supporting the decision; indeed, at the time I was Minister for the Navy. I do not resile from the accusation of my friend Senator Evans. Perhaps it is because of Vietnam that I am so sensitive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will tell the Senate a story that is not new. It has been told several times; I told it in a book which I wrote a few years ago. I had been in the Parliament only a couple of years when one evening a very close friend of mine, the Honourable Senator Shane Paltridge, a close confidante of Sir Robert Menzies, said: 'Chipp, for some extraordinary reason the old man has an affection for you. He is deeply upset. Will you go in and see him?'. Being a humble back bencher, terrified, as all of us were, of Menzies, I hesitated to go in without an appointment but Paltridge, wonderful man that he was, said: 'Look, go in. He needs a friend'. I went in and, to my surprise, Sir Robert Menzies welcomed me. He sat there for a while and then said: 'I want to tell you something. I have a problem. This afternoon Cabinet agreed to send troops to Vietnam. We do not yet have a request from the Vietnamese Government to send troops. We do not have a request from the Americans and some bastard in Cabinet has leaked it to the Press'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Go for a jog around the lake, Senator Walters. It would improve a lot of things. The incident happened in mid-afternoon. During the dinner hour a telex or some form of telegram came from Saigon resembling a formal request by the then Vietnamese Government that Australia send troops to fight in a war. If the oddity that the Australian Government had already decided to send troops before it had been asked to do so does not impact itself upon Senator Walters, I should not be surprised. But that was the fact of the matter. In the event, on that day Sir Robert Menzies, the Prime Minister, was saved by the dinner gong because the Press and the Opposition had the story and were about to embarrass the Government over the issue but the dinner hour intervened and at 8 o'clock he was able to come out and announce the participation of Australian troops in Vietnam. Of course, he then received the unanimous support of all members of the Liberal Party and the Country Party, including me. The outraged cries at that time of the Labor Party, which I repeat was subsequently proven to be right, did not mean a damn thing.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I love the frivolous and mischievous interjections of my friend Senator Button. Normally I enjoy them. But, if he will forgive me, I can do without them this time because we happen to be talking about the very serious matter of the commitment of Australian soldiers to a bloody, fighting war overseas. I just wonder whether Senator Teague, for whom I have regard, would believe that that is the proper way in which to commit young Australians to fighting and dying overseas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What are the Democrats saying? We are saying that in a situation like that it should be the Parliament of this country that makes that decision. What Senator Evans and Senator Teague are basically saying is that it is outrageous that we should entrust to the democratically elected representatives of the people the task of making this decision. What a dreadful proposition the Democrats are putting up! To coin the phrase used by Senator Evans when he was describing some of his own colleagues, why entrust some ratbags elected to this place to make such a fundamental decision? All wisdom is focused in the magical group of people who comprise the Cabinet. I have a list of the present Cabinet, which is made up of 14 people-13 males and one female. To my knowledge only one of those people has been engaged in overseas service. That is no reflection on them; I merely state it for the record. What makes that list of 14 people so magical that they can commit Australia to a fighting, bloody war overseas? What is wrong with a proposition that enables democratically elected representatives to have a say in this matter?</PARA>
<PARA> What are we talking about? As Senator Macklin says, this is not an amendment to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. We are not debating a banking Bill. This is about the ultimate obscenity-war. If there is any question about which the elected representatives of the people should have a say on whether to commit their young men and women it is war. I hope that nobody in this chamber is stupid enough to believe that the next war will be like a Vietnam war. I hope nobody here is idiotic enough to believe that those kinds of hostilities will be played by the so-called gentlemanly rules of Vietnam, where the worst thing that happened was the use of friendly napalm. The next war will be something almost indescribable in terms of my personal comprehension. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to Senator Evans's points. I must say that I cannot understand the basis of his logic. He talked about high constitutional principles or whatever. But he says that the Executive should have the say about sending troops overseas to fight and die. </PARA>

By very definition of what Senator Evans has just said the Executive on that day-the day the troops are being committed-would have the majority in the lower House and, judging by the performance of the lower House over the years, would have a rubber stamp on any action it took. What a farce, what a humbug it is for Senator Evans to say: 'Let one House of Parliament make this decision'. What he means is: 'Let the Executive make the decision unencumbered and unhindered'. Stripped to its naked terms, that is exactly what the Labor Party wants. If he were to tell me that the lower House is more democratically elected than the Senate that would be a queer argument for a Labor politician to put. Under the present system, at any one time a candidate needs 51.5 per cent of the popular vote even to look at gaining office in the lower House, whereas at least in this chamber where we have a system of proportional representation, if a political party gets X per cent of the vote it gets X per cent of the seats. I have just about had the ridiculous argument that this House is not democratically elected.

Let it be recorded in Hansard that the Labor Party-this comes from the shadow Attorney-General-now says: 'If Mr Fraser wants to introduce conscription or an amendment to the Act he can do it unilaterally. That is okay with the Labor Party; it need not come to this Senate'. I find that to be a quite remarkable revelation from the Labor Party. I would have thought that the commitment of troops to Vietnam in the early 1960s was inevitably followed by conscripts. I repeat what I said during the election campaign: Mr Fraser can commit troops to the Sinai because he has Executive power but if that becomes a Vietnam-type situation with an escalation in the conflict, if he then finds that the regular army cannot achieve what it is supposed to achieve and if at that stage he needs conscripts which he would get if a shooting war broke out in that part of the world, there is no way in which-I hope while the Democrats and the Labor Party are here-Mr Fraser could have passed a Bill which sought to re-introduce conscription for overseas service. In view of Senator Evans's recent interjection I would be delighted if he were to say in this place-I think he owes it to this Parliament-that in that hypothetical situation the Democrats at least would have the support of the Australian Labor Party in vetoing a Bill to conscript people to the Sinai.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have no wish to prolong this debate but I cannot allow misrepresentation of the kind that has just been uttered by Senator Chipp to pass without remark and uncorrected. The position is that the Australian Labor Party's attitude with respect to the powers of this Senate has been placed on record in our platform as our long term perspective. It is perfectly clear that we do not think the Senate ought to have any powers at all in respect of any class of legislation and that ultimately a constitutional amendment-it is hoped it can be achieved by way of consensus, by agreement-can be reached whereby the powers of this place are simply reduced to those of delay and whereby this place can assume its proper role as applying the spotlight of scrutiny on legislation rather than having power of life or death over it. We disagree about the long term role of this place. That disagreement is perfectly clear.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Until that millennium comes about, our present position in respect of the powers of this place are equally clear. They have been articulated by numerous senators on this side of the chamber on numerous occasions particularly over the last six months. We will not vote against any Government Bill which is crucial to the Government's survival in office, and in particular the Supply and Appropriation Bills come into that description, nor will we vote against any Government Bill, whatever its character and however obnoxious we find it to be, if the Government has a clear-cut electoral mandate for the Bill. That is the position which we have adopted. That is the position which I believe has been understood by the Australian Democrats before today. I find it inconceivable that this Government could ever-certainly it could not at the moment-claim an electoral mandate for a conscription Bill of the kind that Senator Chipp hypothetically advanced and without such a mandate of course we would regard it as obnoxious and of course we would vote against it. But we would be placed in a very difficult position if the Government did go to the next poll and state its willingness, its desire, its intention to put a conscription Bill to the people. If we fought against that, as undoubtedly we would if that were a part of the Government's program, and if the Government was then elected on that program, consistent with the principles we have enunciated in this place today we would find it very difficult to oppose such a Bill because we are--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Mason, when he speaks, may be able to clarify a couple of points I am concerned about in respect of the Australian Democrats' proposed new clause 4A, which provides that the Governor-General may declare that an emergency exists and that emergency ceases to exist the day after either House of Parliament fails to vote positively authorising service in territories beyond Australia. That is the position as I see it. There are exemptions in proposed new section 50C (7). But as I was going to say in the second reading debate, I envisage that any government of this Commonwealth of whatever political character may wish to commit forces to serve abroad in, say, the following three categories of service: First, unilaterial action by Australia in its immediate area, for example, Papua New Guinea and its territories in the South Pacific; secondly, action in conjunction with its allies, for example, the United States, or under an international agreement such as the five-power agreement; and thirdly, action under United Nations or international auspices.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One problem that I have with the amendment is that it assumes that forces would be committed for any of those purposes to meet an emergency situation. But it may also be to prevent an emergency from developing. For example, a friendly government which forsees trouble may request the Commonwealth for the presence of Australian troops. I have already given the example of Papua New Guinea, not Australia, sending troops to the New Hebrides. It was not an emergency; it was a request for troops and that request was met by Papua New Guinea. The Australian Democrats' amendment seems to run into certain difficulties. It assumes that Australian troops would only be committed abroad in an emergency apart, of course, from those exceptions in proposed new sub-section (7) which do not meet my point. It allows troops to be despatched immediately, but provides that they may not be required to continue to serve except in accordance with a motion agreed to by both Houses of Parliament within two days. Let us suppose that there is a real emergency, that troops have been flown, say, to a neighbouring country, and that Parliament, when it meets two days later, fails to approve the despatch of troops. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, they come back, but their immediate withdrawal might have disastrous consequences not only in the theatre itself but also to civilians in the theatre. On the other hand, let us suppose there is no emergency but merely the prospect of a future emergency which, it is believed, might be averted by the presence of Australian troops. Under the Australian Democrats' amendment, troops could only be despatched if the Governor-General proclaimed that an emergency existed requiring members of the Defence Force to serve abroad. In the circumstances envisaged in that situation, I suggest that such a proclamation may not be warranted and, indeed, may not be acceptable to the power that is seeking the support of the Australian troops and seeking our presence. It might also not be acceptable to an ally with whom Australia proposes to take some joint action. Some of the countries that I envisage may be involved in this would certainly be embarrassed if Australia declared that there was an emergency situation in that particular country when, in fact, the request had been made on the basis of simply preventing the emergence of an emergency.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And Canada. I am sorry. I do not think the precedents cited by Senator Mason carry much weight in the case of Australia. Let us take as examples the German and Japanese cases. They are exceptional cases in that they derive from the defeat of both of those countries in World War II. That is clear to everyone. Much was made by Senator Mason of the Japanese self-defence forces, but he must remember that the constitutional provisions surrounding the establishment of those forces were made as a result of the defeat of Japan in World War II. Canada's geographical position and its responsibilities in its own area-which is, of course, also the area of the United States-are very different from those of Australia. I think Senator Evans adverted to the United States of America. Of course, it is governed by the Constitution, but that has given rise to great difficulties. A compromise arrangement has arisen out of the Vietnam war, but those of us who have been to the United States and have discussed this matter with key people, both in the administration and outside, know that there is an uneasy situation in that country about the present arrangement. The most important point that should be recognised is that Congressional authorisation has not really worked.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Finally, I should like to deal with the aspect of both Houses of Parliament and then the amendment put forward by Senator Evans. Certainly the latter is more acceptable than the former. As has been said, it is impossible, surely, to provide to this chamber the power of determinant in respect of this most important and, as Senator Chipp said, I think, horrendous-or some such word-matter, the possibility of war. Surely that is an area for the elected government including all the back up that is required in consideration whether to commit troops in a situation of modern warfare. That might seem to be leading me towards the acceptance of what Senator Evans said. </PARA>

As the Leader of the Australian Democrats says, it is a matter of a most grave situation. If the elected representatives of the people object to such a decision, they have the right, through the forms of either House of Parliament, to censure the government and, in the case of the House of Representatives, it has the power to censure the Prime Minister. If the censure motion is carried, as it could well be if it were so contentious, with some of the Government members supporting the censure, it would be on the Prime Minister's head to resign and for the government to resign at that stage. What is more likely to happen is that beforehand the party members of the political party in power would force the resignation of the Prime Minister and a new Prime Minister would take his place. All that could happen without affecting the integrity of our armed forces.</PARA></TALK.START>

He speaks for long enough in this place, as is well known. I mentioned earlier that proposed new sub-section (7) could be extended. Senator Harradine referred to the existence of an emergency. I take his point. The amendment would be improved by saying 'an emergency or other situation'. That probably covers the point that he made. This could easily be put in an amendment if it were to go that far. He said that another power might be offended or have difficulty because our Parliament had to approve of our forces going to war. I suggest that our law should hardly be bent to suit other people to that extent. This does not cause any difficulty.

I would think it most unlikely, where the Executive has firm control of the House of Representatives, which is, of course, the case, that a censure motion could be moved.

I find generally the Labor-Liberal correspondence on this matter quite disquieting, although, for the sake of formality, the Australian Democrats will oppose Senator Evans's amendment. We believe it is axiomatic that the House of Representatives is a rubber stamp of the Executive. That is precisely what it is.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I simply want to reply to two matters which Senator Chipp brought up in his very fiery and rhetorical way which, I think, completely misrepresented the position of the Australian Labor Party. At one stage he accused the Labor Party of saying : 'Perhaps it is all right that Mr Fraser can do what he likes, for example send troops to Sinai, by sheer Executive power'. The Labor Party is saying by its amendment that even a future Labor government should be stripped of an unfettered power to commit Australian troops to serve abroad. We say that a government should not pretend to be exercising some royal prerogative to wage war, unfettered by the opinion of the elected representatives of the people. We say that Mr Fraser, or Mr Hayden after 1983, should be able as the Prime Minister, the leader of the government, to commit Australian troops to serve abroad only if he retains the confidence of the House of Representatives. That is a much larger and more democratic advance than the proposition which Senator Chipp tried to put as the position of the Labor Party when he said that we were in agreement with the Prime Minister of the day exercising unfettered Executive power to commit Australian troops abroad.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We say that no government, no Prime Minister, no Cabinet, no party room majority can decide that. It has to be decided by positive resolution of the House of Representatives. The Labor Party will continue to maintain that that intense link which should exist between the House of Representatives and the Government, so that only the House of Representatives can create or bring down a government, should have its effect in this very important area, this matter of vital national concern, the sending of Australian troops abroad. The failure to pass such a motion would, in our view, be the equivalent of a censure motion such as Senator Harradine says may be a substitute. We prefer to see the House of Representatives members themselves in that forum confronted with a decision, debating it on the record and resolving one way or another the question of sending Australian troops to serve beyond our territorial limits. Secondly, in a sloppy use of language Senator Chipp asked: 'What is wrong with the proposition that the Senate should have a say in this?' We say that, in our bicameral system, there is nothing wrong with members of this chamber having a say, debating the matter at length, being part of the deliberative process of the Australian people, fulfilling their role as elected representatives, albeit elected in a different manner to that of the House of Representatives, but not in a manner which entitles them to hold a threat of veto over the House of Representatives and its resolution. This is the point. Senator Chipp and the Australian Democrats want to go beyond the deliberative function, the review function, the scrutiny function, the full debate within this chamber. They want it to have a power of veto over the Executive which retains the confidence of the House of Representatives in the committing of troops beyond the territorial limits of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chipp, in agreement with Senator Macklin, said: 'Don't think for one moment that the next war will be like the one fought in Vietnam'. He evoked visions of a final holocaust. I say that it is most likely that Australian troops will be involved in another commitment to our north. Let us for a moment imagine that once again, Indonesia is engaged in confrontation with Malaysia and that the government of that friendly Commonwealth country calls on the Australian Government to provide troops in order to withstand some invasion by Indonesia. Let us say that the Labor government agrees that that ought to be the case. But let us say that a conservative coalition of senators, in a temporary majority in the Senate, thinks that, rather than confronting Indonesian troops in Malaysia, perhaps Indonesia ought to be pacified in some way and those troops not be committed. That is a more likely scenario than anything conjured up by Senator Chipp. Some people would want to substitute Papua New Guinea for Malaysia, but I think that Papua New Guinea has different ties on our hearts, right across the broad spectrum of Australian politics. So I have used the example of Malaysia and confrontation. I say that no Australian government which retains the confidence of the House of Representatives should be put in a position where it is vetoed by a Senate of a different political complexion in a matter such as that. </PARA>
<PARA> I entered the Parliament because I changed my view about Australian politics in the course of the Vietnam war. I certainly take umbrage at Senator Chipp's implying that many of us in the Senate are not concerned about the commitment of Australian troops abroad. We on this side are extremely conscious of the enormity of what one is doing in asking a fellow Australian to serve overseas, beyond our territorial limits. We are also conscious of the proper constitutional arrangements, which should serve this country not only in questions of war and peace but also throughout the whole of our political and national arrangements. We say that the intense relationship forged between the House of Representatives and the Executive ought to be the criterion which governs our arrangements in this case. </PARA>

<PARA>The amendments are to proposed new sections 116A, 116C, 116F and 116H.

We request a reasoned reply from the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) on this matter since we did not get one in Mr Killen's letter which I quoted during the second reading debate. Amendments (4) and (5) contain our suggestions on the absence without leave provisions. Again we would appreciate a reasoned reply there. We request the Attorney-General to reply to another matter I raised in the second reading debate-the compensation provisions of the Bill and the crticisms made that they are insufficient in their application to young reservists who may be critically injured. With that I hope it will be unnecessary for me to rise further on these matters. </PARA>

This is the amendment that seeks to introduce a limitation period of two years after which Australia would not apprehend absentees without leave from the forces of other countries who had requested assistance. This amendment seems unnecessary in view of proposed new section 168H which in effect gives the responsible Minister full discretion over what happens to the person concerned once he or she is apprehended. So, we do not propose to support that amendment or to introduce a similar one, but we support the remaining Labor amendments.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is opposed to the amendments that have been moved by Senator Evans on behalf of the Opposition.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They had not heard the argument on the other side. The honourable senator assumes that because he gives an argument, everyone accepts it. The amendments deal with a variety of different matters, so it is not easy to deal with them all in one argument. The first amendment requires a limitation to be placed on the making of a declaration in relation to a country with which we wish to have arrangements for forces serving together. The amendment would simply require that the laws of that other country with which our forces were serving should be virtually the same as ours. That would be a very awkward proposition and would probably prevent such arrangements being made. Before arrangements are made with another country for our forces to serve with its forces, arrangements are entered into. As far as posible we seek to avoid our defence forces being subjected to laws to which we would have grave opposition; for instance, the death penalty. Other than that, the principle is that when forces are in another country they are subject to the laws of that country. For that reason the Government is opposed to that amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The two other amendments which deal with much the same matter of defence forces serving with other forces would require declarations being made about the matter being subject to disallowance. The Government's opposition to that is really the same as the stance the Government took in the debate we have had recently. These sorts of arrangements are very much the same as for decisions on whether troops are to be sent abroad at all. Therefore, as it is an Executive decision, we do not think it is appropriate-for all the reasons that were canvassed in the previous debate-that those declarations or orders should be the subject of disallowance. </PARA>
<PARA> The other amendments deal not with this issue but with deserters from forces of another country who have come to Australia. There are long-standing provisions in regard to the return of deserters to the forces of the country to which they belong. The Government believes these provisions are perfectly adequate. They have been amended from existing provisions to give very wide discretion to and control by the Minister in relation to these situations. We do not think it at all appropriate that these powers should be limited to a period of only two years previous to the requests that have been made in this matter because that would be far too restrictive. As to making an appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, we do not see why that is appropriate in a circumstance of this kind. The people involved are deserters from a foreign force and on the basis of comity they should be returned to that force. The question of whether they were deserters, which may be some ground for a claim being made, could be quite appropriately raised by these people under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. The Government does not see why there should be any special appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal about the merits of decisions of this kind. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, Senator Evans asked me whether I would comment upon another matter altogether which is not the subject of amendment but which he raised in his speech in the second reading debate. That relates to compensation for reservists. The only point that I think was raised in relation to this aspect of the Bill was that the provision of compensation based upon the wages or earnings of a young reservist may not be very satisfactory because his earnings or wages may be lower than what he would receive as a reservist. The point has been noted by the Minister for Defence (Mr Killen). I understand that it was raised in the other place. This legislation does not determine a scheme; the legislation gives the Minister the power to determine a scheme. The Minister will take into account the point that has been raised by the Opposition in formulating his determination which has yet to be made. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Copies are now being circulated. For the information of honourable senators, the motion has been amended in order to try to accommodate, more widely, the views of individual senators. The new motion incorporates two points. Rather than the Library Committee be given terms of reference-it is not quite clear who they would be given by, but presumably it would be by both houses of Parliament; we do not want to run the risk of falling between two stools on that issue-it is suggested that the Parliamentary Library Committee adopt its terms of reference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second point, which was the subject matter of debate in the Senate on Tuesday night, is that you, Mr President, be requested not to proceed with the appointment of a new Parliamentary Librarian until certain things have happened; namely, the adoption of the terms of reference and the approval by resolution of the procedures to be followed in the appointment of a new Librarian. This second point is designed specifically to meet objections which were made in the debate the other night that perhaps the Parliamentary Library should not be too closely associated with the actual appointment of a Librarian but at least it should be aware of the procedures which will be followed and have cognisance of those procedures. I interrupted Senator Harradine to make these observations and to seek leave to amend the motion in the way in which I have indicated.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Previously a proposition was put forward which expressed the view that the President of the Senate be requested not to proceed with the appointment of a new Parliamentary Librarian until the applications had been presented to the Joint Parliamentary Library Committee for its consideration. I think it is important for the Senate to understand that what Sentor Button has put forward is to be read in place of that second part of the motion. Whilst I have only just seen the amendment, it seems to me that there is nothing in the amended second part of the motion which should give honourable senators any concern. I believe the original concern was that members of parliament as such ought to be involved in the actual appointment of the Parliamentary Librarian. To a number of honourable senators that appeared to be not in the best interests of the continued apolitical nature of the Parliamentary Library and its information and research services. It was felt-in fact the point was made-that the responsibility devolves by legislation on the President and Mr Speaker to make the appointment. They are the statutory officers who have this responsibility. In respect of the appointment of the Parliamentary Librarian they stand in place of the Public Service Board. No parliamentarian or group of parliamentarians can take away from them that right.</PARA></TALK.START>

Senator Button quite rightly said that if the situation was left simply as it was before, and the Committee was given terms of reference, in fact, it could fall between two stools-the House of Representatives and the Senate.

I am not terribly fussed about it. If it is believed that the House of Representatives and the Senate should draw up those terms of reference jointly that is fair enough by me. But honourable senators should bear in mind that any proposition has to be adopted by a positive vote of both Houses of Parliament. That may not be possible under current circumstances.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I oppose the original motion moved by Senator Button and the amended motion. The current procedure in the Parliament is that by statute the Presiding Officers-yourself, Mr President, and Mr Speaker in the House of Representatives-jointly make arrangements for the departments of the Parliament, including the Joint House Department, the Parliamentary Library and Hansard. The Presiding Officers have a direct responsibility to make arrangements for those departments and to appoint the Parliamentary Librarian. There is nothing that this Parliament, or this chamber in particular, can do that can derogate from that authority given by statute except to change the statute and to take away those powers from the Presiding Officers. Motions put by an honourable senator that deny, limit or postpone the powers of Presiding Officers to go ahead with their proper statutory role of making provisions for the Library and appointing a new Parliamentary Librarian are out of order. The Senate is not empowered to adopt such a motion. I understand that the Parliament has appointed representatives from the Senate and the House of Representatives to a Presiding Officers advisory committee. This committee has no specific terms of reference. I think it should have specific terms of reference as this would clear up the kinds of questions that have been debated in the face of this motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is understood that members of the House of Representatives and honourable senators who sit on the Joint Parliamentary Library Committee are acting in an advisory capacity to the Presiding Officers, both of whom are present and make arrangements for chairing and convening meetings. I, as one Government senator representative, am a member of the Library Committee and I understood from the beginning that we are there in an advisory role. If the Parliament wants to deny that advisory role, if it wants to take away from the authority and responsibilities of the Presiding Officers, I believe that the only way that that can be done is by direct amendment of the statute. </PARA>
<PARA> As for the intent of the motion that is before us, it is irresponsible because it directly seeks to deny the proper authority of the Presiding Officers. The motion, in its earlier form, stated that 'the President be requested not to proceed with the appointment of a new Parliamentary Librarian until the applications have been presented to the Committee for its consideration'. Senator Harradine has already indicated-and I support that part of his argument-that that would immediately bring the appointment under criticism-that it would involve politics and allow partisan attitudes to intrude into the decision. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the present members of the Library Committee can provide every area of advice about the kind of person who would best fill the position of Parliamentary Librarian and the arrangements for the administration of the Parliamentary Library. There is no limit to the advice that can be given by the Parliamentary Library. Advice having been given, it is still fully within the responsibility of the Presiding Officers to make decisions. The new form of the motion provides that the Presiding Officers cannot go ahead and make those decisions until, firstly, some terms of reference have been adopted by the Committee, and secondly, that some procedures that may be included in those terms of reference have been followed. I believe that that is just not in order. It will delay the exercise of the proper authority of the Presiding Officers to go ahead and appoint a new Parliamentary Librarian. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button is suggesting-I cannot understand how, if he is in his right mind, he could do so-that the Committee adopt its own specific terms of reference. Are we in the Senate of the custom of appointing a group of senators to a committee, giving it a name, and asking its members to go away somewhere, behind a bush or under a tree, and determine their terms of reference, their powers and what kinds of motion they may adopt? To adopt such a course would be entirely irresponsible. It is nonsense to suggest that any committee of this chamber would determine its own terms of reference. The practice always, as I have observed, is for individual senators to put a motion in this chamber and the Senate, as a whole, considers the terms of reference for a committee. The Senate as a whole determines the references to be undertaken by committees set up by the Senate. I believe the same holds for joint committees of the two Houses. Indeed, the people who are to serve on committees so defined are appointed by the Senate as a whole, not by one part of the Senate. I totally reject the notion that the Library Committee should somehow or other be set up so that it can determine its own specific terms of reference. There may be some merit in there being specific terms of reference for the Library Committee but that must be by resolution of the House of Representatives and the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> A few other matters were raised in the earlier debate some days ago. One concerned the proposition that the Joint House Department, Hansard and the Department of the Parliamentary Library be amalgamated into one department. I reject that proposal for amalgamation until evidence has been presented to senators so that we may make some judgment in the matter. There has been a management consultant's report on the administration of these departments. I understand that some useful recommendations may have come from that report, but the report has not been in the hands of senators. We have not been able to assess the merits of any recommendations that have been proposed by that report. I agree with Senator Harradine that it makes sense, until we are persuaded otherwise, that the functions of the Library be administered by a body whose total terms of reference are to look after the Library and not to be muddled with other catering and Hansard functions in the Parliament. If there is merit in some parts of the administration of those three departments being amalgamated, such as the payment of salaries to staff, let that be put and be considered by the Senate or the House of Representatives. I do not support any of those amalgamations until the evidence for the amalgamation is put. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter-and with this reference I conclude-is that the Library has received a reduced allocation of funds for the current financial year. As I understand it, that arises because of some misunderstandings about the way the submissions were received and discussed. There is regret on the part of some Ministers that there was such a reduction in the money allocated to the Library in this Budget. I, as a senator, very much regret the cut in funding and urge the Government to note very sympathetically the submission that will be received for the coming financial year and indeed, ahead of that, in the supplementary appropriation Bills early next year. I urge the Government to make an allocation to make up for those cuts so that, within this financial year, there is an adequate amount of money for the purposes of the Parliamentary Library. In summary, I do not believe that the motion is in order, particularly in its second form, in which it is now before the Senate. I urge senators to oppose every aspect of the motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been a member of the Library Committee since early 1976. I think that technically I am still a member of the Library Committee even though I have submitted a resignation to you, Mr President. Along with all other Labor members on the Library Committee, I submitted a resignation from that Committee after we found ourselves to be in an untenable position especially in regard to the appointment of the new Parliamentary Librarian. I say that technically I am probably still a member of the Committee because I believe it takes a resolution of the Senate to discharge members from a committee once they are appointed to that committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It may be that, if we do not get around to having that type of resolution, I will stay on the Library Committee even though I have submitted that resignation. If I stay on the Library Committee and the terms of reference that we are proposing are adopted and I serve on the Library Committee again, I will be happy to do so. Even though there have been difficulties in the last year or so, my time on the Library Committee has been interspersed with some occasions when I have been able to make a contribution, and I am sure that I will be able to make a contribution again. There was some surprise, I think, when I said that I would be happy to serve on that Committee again. I do not think there should be that surprise because the resignation of every member of the Australian Labor Party on the Committee occurred almost over this specific issue of the appointment of the new Parliamentary Librarian. I admit that it was probably the final trigger, if one can use that word in the current political climate, that suggested to all of us that we should withdraw our services from the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> I support the motion which is before us, although I have some reservations about one aspect of it which I will mention. I will outline how I think that reservation can be removed if we take some further action at a later stage. Certainly, in relation to the appointment of the Parliamentary Librarian, the President and the Speaker do have the power to appoint that person. But the appointment of a Parliamentary Librarian is a significant appointment for all members of the Parliament. That Librarian will control one of the parts of this Parliament which is absolutely vital to all members of parliament, especially members of the Opposition. For this reason it seems quite clear to me that members of the Parliamentary Library, being members who represent all members of the Parliament, both the House of Representatives and the Senate, should have some input into that appointment. How far that input should go is probably open to debate, but at the moment there is no input at all. It was mentioned by Senator Teague a few moments ago that the Library Committee is an advisory committee. But my experience is that when the crunch comes the Library Committee has no real role at all because if the President and the Speaker, in their wisdom, decide to take a specific course of action, that Committee's advice can be set aside. That is one of the reasons why Labor members recently found it necessary to withdraw from the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The Library Committee does not have any specific terms of reference. If it did have, all of us-not only the members of the Library Committee but also the Speaker and the President-would clearly know where we are going. I support the suggestion in the motion that we adopt specific terms of reference for the Library Committee, but I also share the concern of some other members that the Library Committee itself should adopt terms of reference. However, I do not see that to be an insurmountable difficulty. If we adopt specific terms of reference within the Library Committee, it seems to me that the logical extension to that would be to bring those terms of reference back at some stage and have them ratified by both the Senate and the House of Representatives. We could go a different way and suggest that specific terms of reference be introduced, say, in the Senate and then be sent to the House of Representatives for ratification, or vice versa. Then the Library Committee would have its terms of reference. It seems to me, however, that this might be a very long way round the problem. If the Library Committee were to meet, adopt terms of reference and then have those terms of reference ratified by both Houses of the Parliament, there would be some real backing to those terms of reference. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a concern that if we adopt terms of reference within the Library Committee and do not bring them back to the House of Representatives and the Senate, those terms of reference probably will not have much backing because, after all, the membership of the Library Committee changes from time to time. If we had the backing of the two Houses of Parliament, those terms of reference would really mean something. I support this motion as being an interim solution to the problem. However, I suggest that if we pass the motion and the Library Committee adopts specific terms of reference, those terms of reference should come back to both Houses of the Parliament so that the terms of reference which have been adopted can be approved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Georges is not a member of the Committee either. It is possible that he has no idea of what has gone on. The Committee looked at the terms of Senator Button's motion. I agreed with them. I suppose that is one of the reasons I am not really surprised that he changed it. He moved then that the Joint Parliamentary Library Committee should be given specific terms of reference. I agree entirely with that because I believe there is some confusion on the Library Committee in regard to the part it plays. I think I have been a member of the Committee for as long as Senator Harradine. He claimed that he was the oldest member; I will give him the years in age but I will not give him the time of service. We both became members of that Committee soon after we came to this place. I think Senator Colston joined the Committee at about the same time. Members of the Committee were told originally that it was a committee formed to advise the Presiding Officers, to put forward the concerns of members and senators in this place and to look after their interests. The Committee is an advisory committee only; it was not created to advise the Presiding Officers on appointments to the Library. I do not believe for one minute that the 14 members of the Library Committee can possibly come up with any indication, no matter how many application forms we had before us, of who we believe should be the Parliamentary Librarian.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to ask Senator Button whether he does not agree that the Clerks of the two Houses, the Director-General of the National Library, and a senior representative of the Public Service Board make up a committee that should come up with recommendations to the Presiding Officers. That would be a completely non-political body. I believe he does gross disservice to those gentlemen by saying that they could come up with a recommendation for the position of Librarian with which either side of this Parliament might not be satisfied. I cannot agree that the Library Committee should adopt its own terms of reference. I certainly cannot agree that the Committee should approve of some other system to come up with recommendations. I think the recommendations of which the Library Committee was informed-the recommendations put by the Presiding Officers that this committee be non-political-are very justified. I certainly oppose all the amendments Senator Button has brought before the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In years past I have been a member of the Library Committee and therefore am acquainted with some of its functions. I oppose strongly the amended motion proposed by Senator Button. It is outside the competence of the Senate and contains some very severe defects. In the first place, one should not contemplate, as is the case in paragraph 1, that the Senate is of the opinion that the Joint Parliamentary Committee should adopt special terms of reference. The fact is that it would have no such powers. It is no good saying, as has Senator Colston, that perhaps we can rectify that by bringing the terms back to the Senate and having them passed. Any proposed terms of reference would have to be first considered by the Senate. We would need to know them to know what we had in mind as the remainder of the duties of the Library Committee. We are doing things the wrong way around. If we are proposing that the Library Committee should have fixed terms of reference, the first thing to do is to bring before the Senate a motion stating what those terms might be and have them adopted, amended or rejected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Also the second part of paragraph 1 of the motion states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . including the power to pass substantive resolutions within those terms of reference. </PARA>
<PARA>Thus, a knowledge of the terms of reference is fundamental to the understanding of that provision also. The words 'substantive resolutions within those terms of reference' could mean that the Committee could make executive type decisions. Here we are tonight not knowing what is meant by this motion. Do we mean that we intend to give to what is an advisory committee the power of executive decision making? Thus, the first paragraph is defective in its construction and its appropriateness for presentation to the Senate. It ought to be withdrawn, redrafted and, if it is to be pursued, terms of reference presented so that the Senate may have some understanding of what is intended, some explanation of whether the terms of reference are of an advisory or executive nature and therefore what could possibly be meant by the words, 'to pass substantive resolutions'. That defect, in itself, ought to be sufficient to defeat the motion. However, the second paragraph of the motion states:</PARA>
<PARA> That Mr President be requested not to proceed with the appointment of a new Parliamentary Librarian until the Joint Library Committee has (a) adopted the terms of reference referred to in (1) above, and-</PARA>
<PARA>We do not know what those terms are. We do not know whether they embody executive powers. The motion continues:</PARA>
<PARA>(b) has approved by resolution of the procedures to be followed in appointment of the new Librarian. </PARA>
<PARA>The essential, and first, thing for the Senate to decide is whether it intends to continue, as has been the case in the past, with the absolute freedom given the Presiding Officers to appoint key staff, free of direction. Paragraph 2 (b) of the motion is quite emphatic in stating that a new Parliamentary Librarian must not be appointed until the Library Committee has approved, by resolution, the procedures to be followed in such appointment. It provides, in effect, that the Committee shall prescribe to the Presiding Officers the procedures to be adopted in the appointment of the Librarian. In other words, it states quite emphatically that the freedom of the Presiding Officers to make arrangements for the appointment of staff is to be taken away. That represents a serious defect. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let Senator Georges stand up and speak if he wants to make a contribution. We have before us a motion which, on its face, is defective. It is defective in that it does not first seek the ratification of stated terms of reference. It asserts the power of a committee to make substantive resolutions, although that power has not been given to it and it proceeds to do something that is fundamentally opposed to everything that we have ever done in this Parliament or that, I believe, has ever been done in other parliaments. It proceeds to prescribe the right and power of the Presiding Officers to make appointments. The day that appointments in the various departments of the Parliament are made politically and not objectively and administratively will be a sad one for the Parliament. It is for the very reason that we want objective and apolitical decisions that we appoint Presiding Officers whose role is apolitical. On those grounds I find the motion totally defective in all its constructions. I believe that the Senate ought to have no recourse but to reject it roundly.</PARA></TALK.START>

We have before us an amended motion on whether the parliamentary Library Committee should be given or adopt terms of reference.

<PARA>I do not think there is any substantial difference of opinion amongst a lot of honourable senators about the fact that the parliamentary Library Committee should have terms of reference.

I think it is very silly for anybody, including Senator Walters and Senator Carrick, to come in here and seriously suggest that it is not a practical consideration for the Senate to have a debate about terms of reference for the parliamentary Library Committee when the Senate is composed, as Senator Walters went to great lengths to point out, of ill-formed people like me who do not have her vast experience in these matters. Neither the insult from nor the silliness of Senator Walters surprised me. That would be an extraordinary position to adopt. We would argue that the best way for the Library Committee to get some definition of its terms of reference is for that Committee to meet and to adopt for its own purposes terms of reference which have force only when they are adopted by each House of the Parliament. Honourable senators are in fact asking the parliamentary Library Committee to be a sub-committee in the drafting sense which would present terms of reference to the Parliament which would have to be adopted. </PARA>

There are several reasons for supporting this proposition. In fact, at the time the changes were made as a result of the Budget in 1978, the Opposition expressed the very concerns that Senator Macklin has expressed in his introduction of this Bill. The Bill does not seek to appropriate money and, by itself, does not achieve much. But, as I said, it at least expresses the Senate's view on this matter. The Hughes Government, as far back as 1922, first granted a permanent pension to those ex-servicemen who suffered from tuberculosis. At that time a letter was writen to all ex-servicemen who had tuberculosis. The letter contains the following statement:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a result of recent investigations of your war pension claim, your pension has been continued at the rate of 84/- per fortnight. This rate of pension will continue subject to further review but under no circumstances will the rate be reduced below the 100 per cent ordinary rate, namely, 84/- per fortnight. </PARA>
<PARA>That letter, which is in my possession, is dated December 1927. More than 20 years later World War II veterans got similar letters which read:</PARA>
<PARA> In conection with your war pension which is payable at the rate of #10 2s per fortnight, you are informed that pension will continue subject to further review, but will not under any circumstances be reduced below the ordinary total rate prescribed by the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act. </PARA>
<PARA>Certainly since those days the treatment of tuberculosis has improved. The prognosis of those who suffer from tuberculosis has improved to the extent that now most people who suffer from tuberculosis, those who suffer from pulmonary tuberculosis, will in fact be treated effectively and have very few residual after-effects. Certainly those who suffer from meningeal tuberculosis, or perhaps spinal tuberculosis, which is increasingly less common, may have after-effects. The ordinary case of pulmonary tuberculosis, if treated effectively, causes no difficulties and leaves very few residual problems. Therefore, it is reasonable to do what the Government did in 1978: It suggested that cases of tuberculosis discovered after that time, which, in most part would be treated very effectively, should be judged as all other repatriation disabilities were judged, that people should be judged on their degree of disability. </PARA>
<PARA> That was not the case when Mr Hughes introduced the legislation; it was not the case after World War II; it was certainly not necessarily the case when I first graduated in medicine and first dealt with cases of this nature. At that time, the treatment of tuberculosis was prolonged. It frequently involved surgical procedures which were disabling. People who had tuberculosis could not, in fact, join the Commonwealth Public Service as permanent public servants and receive full superannuation; they were restricted from many occupations. Because of the long and protracted nature of the treatment they frequently missed out on work and study opportunities to advance their future careers. </PARA>
<PARA> It was for this reason that over those years governments persisted with the policy that the tuberculosis pension should be paid, and should be paid at the full rate from then on. There was a further reason: Tuberculosis was more common then, as it is now, in those who were socially disadvantaged, those who were malnourished and those who lived in poor living conditions. It was felt at the time that we should do what we could to keep ex-servicemen out of situations where they were likely to have their tuberculosis exacerbated. </PARA>
<PARA> When all these ex-servicemen received their pensions they were given letters to the effect that they would stay on this 100 per cent rate of pension for life. Through their organisation and as individuals they have complained with some justice that successive governments of all political persuasions in this country have maintained this policy and have told them that they would receive this pension. Many of them, therefore, have organised their affairs on the assumption that they would receive this pension. They felt fairly well compensated for the difficulties they had suffered and the career opportunities and the superannuation they missed out on over the years by the fact that they had this 100 per cent pension, and they believed that the word of the government of the day would be kept. It is therefore unfair and quite wrong for the present Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) to write back to these people and say that the letter meant that their pension would not ever go above the level of the pension they received then, which was 84s in 1927 and #10 2s in the post-Second World War days. It is not fair or just for the Minister to suggest, as he has, that in fact what that letter meant was that that was the level that the pension would stay at. The level of pension to which the Minister referred and which was assumed by governments, by ex-servicemen's organisations and everyone else involved in this situation was, in fact, the 100 per cent disability pension. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1978 the Government changed the procedures because of the new situation. Because of the fact that tuberculosis could now be treated effectively it was reasonable for that situation to apply to those who suffered from tuberculosis after 2 November 1978. It was not reasonable for the Government to say that that set of conditions should apply to those who had for years been on this pension and who had been promised by successive governments that they would continue to receive this pension. It was in fact the retrospective application of a new set of procedures which were introduced in 1978. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Macklin's proposal is that in fact those who received the pension before 2 November 1978 and who received letters saying that they would stay on that 100 per cent rate should be left on that rate and that the promises of successive governments from the Government of Hughes in 1922 through the governments of Curtin, Chifley, Menzies, Holt, Gorton, McMahon and Whitlam should be kept. If there is anything else that is needed in our social security and our repatriation system it is a feeling by those who are receiving assistance that there will be consistent application and that the application of these provisions will not be capriciously changed as they were in 1978. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not arguing that ex-servicemen who have suffered tuberculosis since 1978 should not be treated like other ex-servicemen who suffer from other diseases. There would be very few of those who would qualify for the 100 per cent pension. But those who received the pension before 1978 were given the promise that in fact they would stay on that rate. Many of them, particularly those in the 30s, the 40s and the 50s suffered considerably because of the treatment that was necessary. This treatment was often traumatic, it was always prolonged and it was sometimes not very effective. They suffered considerably because of the restrictions that were imposed on them, because of the community's attitude towards tuberculosis, an attitude which one could understand because of the tendency for tuberculosis to recur. They suffered the restrictions of not having the same career opportunities and the same opportunities for advancement that their brothers and sisters in the community had. </PARA>
<PARA> This payment, like other repatriation payments, was in fact a compensation for these very real difficulties they suffered, as well as an attempt to keep them away from the depressing conditions which may have made their treatment difficult and may have made an exacerbation of their illness more likely. Therefore, Senator Macklin's proposal in the legislation is a reasonable one. It is a proposal which is backed, of course, by the organisations which represent the tuberculose ex-servicemen. It is backed by the Returned Service League in this community and it was backed recently in Canberra by a combined meeting of returned veterans organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the worst aspect of what happened in 1978 was the breach of faith by the Government going back on the promise which previous governments had made to these people. The second aspect, I believe, was the Minister's interpretation of the letters that they received. I think it is very hard and harsh to suggest to these people that what those letters meant was that they would remain on the money figure they were receiving in those days. If we carried that through to its logical extreme, the people who first received the tuberculosis pension in 1927 would still be receiving the decimal equivalent of 84s a fortnight. If we carried it to its extreme, those who received it in the post-war years would still be receiving the equivalent of #10 2s a fortnight. That is a nonsense argument. It is an argument used by someone who is desperate to justify the unjustifiable position that he or she is taking. It is for that reason that we support Senator Macklin's private member's Bill, a Bill which expresses the view of the Senate that these people who were taken off their 100 per cent pension on 2 November 1978 have been hardly done by and that this Government has not kept faith with those deserving people who served their country and fought for it at a time when they were needed to maintain for this country the freedom that we all, I suppose, have come to take for granted. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise very briefly to explain the Government's position and the decision which was originally made, as Senator Grimes has pointed out, in the Budget of 1978. It is clear, as was acknowledged by Senator Grimes, and I believe also by Senator Macklin, that tuberculosis has been treated very effectively in later years. In fact in the Australian community the disease has almost been wiped out. In terms of the effects of tuberculosis upon ex-servicemen from both world wars, it is well and truly acknowledged that those who have been assessed in the way in which Senator Grimes outlined during his speech have been relatively well cured of the disease. The incidence and, particularly, the effects of the disease are not very evident amongst those in receipt of disability pensions at present.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is important to recognise that the special rate of pension which has applied since 1978 in respect of previous tuberculosis sufferers has not been reduced in money terms. Rather, it has been frozen at the level that was being paid at that time. Ex-soldiers who suffered from the disease were examined and their disability pensions were assessed in line with the degree of the incidence of the disease. The disability from which they suffered at the time was taken into account and assessed. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that some people have won in terms of their disability pension as a result of the re-assessment. It is also true that others may have been disadvantaged to some extent. However, the substantial point remains, that persons in this situation have been in receipt of the cash benefit of the special pension. They are also, of course, properly assessed in terms of the repatriation legislation on their degree of disability. In fact, they are in receipt of money incomes as a result of these pensions, which are designed to compensate for their degree of disability as a result of their disease. </PARA>
<PARA> Free medical treatment was restored in August 1979, following the August 1978 decision. It was granted as a result of representations made to the Government by the Federated TB Sailors, Soldiers and Airmen's Association. In that respect previous sufferers of tuberculosis have not been disadvantaged in the treatment which is available through the repatriation hospital system. For these reasons, the Government maintains its opposition to the Bill. It believes that its decision in 1978 was correct in line with the experience of those who have recovered from the disease and proper assessment of their disability and their war service. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Walters listens, she will learn that the disability that these people suffered was suffered after the war. While the disease may have been curable since the war that has absolutely nothing to do with the disability that those veterans suffered after World War II. The disability was encountered after the Second World War. Here we are talking about the majority of pulmonary tuberculosis veterans who numbered 1,146 as of 30 June 1980. This is out of a total of 1,198 tuberculosis sufferers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Immediately after the Second World War, these people suffered severe social restrictions, very painful and lingering treatment and the inability to re-establish themselves within the community. The type of medical advice that they were given was to restrict their lifestyle. They were told: 'Don't work overtime and don't push yourselves'. A host of other quite proper medical advice was given at that time to those veterans. In other words, at that time those veterans suffered a disability in economic, social and physical terms. Those problems have not gone away, simply because the disease has been cured. If a person suffered a disability in 1946 and so was not able to gain a suitable occupation and establish a family and home in the way he could have done had he been in full health, that problem is still present in 1981, regardless of any medical cure in the meantime. These are the only veterans we are speaking about. These are the veterans who had the disease prior to 1978. We totally accept the proposition that with the medical treatment now, no special attention over and above that for veterans suffering from other diseases is warranted for those in our services suffering from TB. </PARA>
<PARA> We are solely concerned with those people to whom the Government at the time made promises and who then worked on the supposition that they would be supported. Some of these veterans were from the First World War. Indeed, they numbered 24 veterans as of 30 June last year. On calculations those people as of 12 November are now some $13.15 poorer. That may not seem very much to the Minister and other honourable senators in this chamber, but it is a lot to those people. We are talking of only 1,198 people. Here is the miserliness of cutting off aid to veterans from the First and Second World Wars and the Malaysian and Korean encounters. These are the people we are talking about. These are the people who retrospectively-after all the promises this country has made to them-are now to be penalised. </PARA>
<PARA> I sum up simply by asking honourable senators to remember that, after World War II, our troops came home to tickertape processions and to the adulation and thanks of the whole population. We were thankful enough then. Forty years on we have forgotten them. They feel forgotten. We have forgotten our duty to assist those people. Probably we have forgotten too that we meet in this chamber because of the actions those veterans took. Would any government have acted in 1945 in the same manner that this Government has acted in 1978? Would any other government have defended so openly and so brazenly a denial of basic rights which had been granted to our veterans by all governments up to that date? Would any government have done that when the veterans stepped off the troop-ships? Of course not. But memories die, and 40 years on it seems it is all right to penalise people. It is hoped that people forget. Is it not interesting that the motto of our leading veterans' organisation is 'Lest we forget'? The action which was taken in 1978 shows that some had already forgotten. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that by the vote here tonight more honourable senators than just those belonging to the Australian Democrats and the Australian Labor Party will show that they have not forgotten. I hope that they will at least give their vote and their moral support to a campaign to restore the pension to those who had it in 1978. Perhaps if it is remembered that their numbers will grow fewer every year, therefore the total cost will be less every year, that will loosen at least a few votes. I do not care why honourable senators support this Bill, but I ask them at least to cast their votes in support of those veterans to show that somebody in this country has not forgotten what they have done for us. </PARA>

<PARA> '(b) resolves that the Senate should establish a Standing Committee as recommended to consider the Senate's appropriations and staffing;</PARA>
<PARA> '(ba) proposes that the Estimates for the Senate as finally agreed to by such Standing Committee be submitted to the Minister for Finance for inclusion in a separate parliamentary appropriation Bill;'. </PARA>
<PARA>I have moved these amendments because, as I said on the previous occasion, I believe that the motion which was moved initially did not include all of the recommendations. In fact, it omitted one of the most important of the proposals which is contained in paragraph (c) of the amended motion. It relates to the recommendations in chapter 6 of the report. Paragraph (c) states:</PARA>
<PARA> Proposes that the estimates for the Senate as finally agreed to by such standing committee be submitted to the Minister for Finance for inclusion in a separate parliamentary Appropriation Bill;</PARA>
<PARA>I will not repeat the arguments which I raised on the previous occasion in which I indicated that there was a defect in the motion as then proposed. I know there have been discussions but since that time, so far as I know, there has not yet been presented to the Senate any statement of the Government position, although documents have been discussed by honourable senators who are members of the Senate Select Committee on Parliament's Appropriations and Staffing which presented this report. I want to explain why the amendments I have moved are vital amendments. In the first place if one looks at the situation and the motion as it was before one finds that if, in fact, the Government took a position that it should retain control of the total amount of the parliamentary appropriation that, of course, would be a vital decision. That is the position at the moment. It is not the position in most of the parliaments of the world. The Committee has clearly recommended that that should not be the position hereafter but that when a standing committee of the Senate has decided what is necessary to carry out the functions of the Senate properly that decision should be submitted to the Minister for Finance for inclusion in a separate parliamentary Appropriation Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> In our recommendations we went on to say that if the government did not like that amount and felt it was excessive, on the floor of the Parliament it could move accordingly to reduce the amount of that appropriation. I think that is a vital part of the Committee's recommendations. If, in fact, the government can retain that global figure and can say that $100m or $10m is the amount that is to be spent for the expenditure of Parliament in a year we can well see what the situation would be. There may be a committee. The Government may feel that a joint committee is needed. Whatever form it is in, committees of both chambers may say that they want so much money. They may say: 'On our committees' advice we need this amount of money'. But of course there would inevitably be a battle between the committees of both Houses. There would be fighting over the bone that the Government had provided as the total amount. </PARA>
<PARA> It is my belief that it is fundamental to the Parliament of this country that it regain control over the total amount that it determines-acting, I believe, quite sensibly and responsibly-is needed for the carrying out of parliamentary functions. These should be determined, of course, by members of the Parliament who know the committee responsibilities and the other responsibilities of the Parliament. Of course, if the Government retains the global figure there will be inevitable conflict between the House of Representatives and the Senate. We all know that there have been conflicts in very recent times between the Senate and the House of Representatives as to the number of rooms and places in this House that should be occupied either by senators or members. One can imagine that the doctrine of divide and rule will apply and that when there is a lack of agreement between the Houses the Government will have to step in and say: 'You cannot agree, so the Senate will have this amount and the House of Representatives will have that amount'. </PARA>
<PARA> The control over the total figure is vital and must be included in any resolution that adopts the Select Committee's proposals. The same problem arises in relation to staffing. If staff numbers and expenditure relating to the Houses of Parliament were to be controlled by the Prime Minister or by Cabinet the same degree of argument between the two Houses could occur. Both Houses could be restricted to quite inadequate amounts to carry out their tasks. That should be avoided at all costs. </PARA>
<PARA> My amendment to the motion which is now being debated by this Committee adopts the recommendations of the Select Committee. The Committee consists of representatives of all parties in the Senate. We considered the evidence. The Speaker of the House of Representatives, in fact, was among the witnesses before the Select Committee. We came to certain conclusions. We now request this Committee to adopt the recommendations which the Select Committee made. There will be room for negotiation. It will not alter the position which is, at the moment, unsatisfactory. But at least this Committee will indicate that it agrees with the recommendations which that Select Committee has made. That should be done before we rise for the summer recess. It is well within the capacity of honourable members of the Senate and members of the Government to discuss the situation in a calm atmosphere. Then other arrangements may be made. I urge that this amendment be adopted because it complements and completes the motion which is based upon the Committee's recommendations. We will then be able to attempt to achieve some result with the Government. With those thoughts in mind I commend my amendment to the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I, and the members of the Senate Select Committee on Parliament's Appropriations and Staffing who dealt with this important subject, support Senator Missen's amendment. His amendment highlights matters that were implicit in the original recommendations that were before the Senate. I believe it is proper that we should agree to Senator Missen's amendment. The Committee believes that it has presented a reasonable and responsible approach to the reform that is suggested in the report. The Committee was aware that the reference before it required a cautious and reasoned approach. Testimony to the fact that the report of the Select Committee achieved this objective is given by the wide acceptance of the recommendations approved by senators and members from all parties and by Senator Harradine. Senator Harradine recognised that point. I believe it is important that the Parliament assume the responsibility in this area. The Government recognises that the Committee has identified areas that are important. We deliberately did not recommend a single line appropriation administrative vote for the simple reason that once parliament has its own Appropriation Bill a single line appropriation is unnecessary. In addition, the Committee did not wish to apply one set of accounting practices for the Parliament when the Senate and the Government are on record as objecting to one line appropriations for the Public Service generally.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The question of what is and what is not an ordinary annual service is not a justiciable one. Long ago, in 1911, the High Court of Australia decided that it is a matter for decision between the two Houses. That is why we have agreements such as the so-called 1965 compact. The Government could take the view that Parliament is an ordinary annual service of the Government, but it is only a view. The important point is that the Attorney-General's Department advised the Select Committee during its hearings that the matter is one for determination by the Houses concerned. Senator Missen pointed out that each House should have a capacity to deal with its own destiny as far as appropriations are concerned. I believe and the Committee believes that Joint House matters should be dealt with jointly by the two Houses. Our report suggests this course of action. I think that I have made my point and my attitude to the matter clear in my previous speech. I simply endorse Senator Missen's amendment to the motion that I have already presented. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be very brief in my remarks. The report of the Senate Select Committee on Parliament's Appropriations and Staffing has been considered by the Government. It has been put under detailed study. The Government has reached some conclusions. Prior to the presentation of those conclusions the Government believes there should be detailed discussions with each of the Presiding Officers and members of the Committee. It is possible that within the scope of that framework some give and take might be possible. The Government has, through me in this chamber, approached Mr President and the Committee and has provided the Committee with a summary of its present thinking. Through the Leader of the House in the other chamber, Mr Sinclair, an approach has been made to Mr Speaker. The deliberations have started. The Government believes that it ought to be able to put forward its thinking in more precise terms upon the resumption of the Parliament. It would hope that during that period the two Presiding Officers will have their views presented to us. Therefore, the Government is acting with good will. I simply indicate that the Government believes it can make some considerable reforms which will go a long way towards achieving the kinds of goals that were contemplated by honourable senators in the preparation of the report.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I too shall be brief. As one of the Australian Labor Party representatives on the Senate Select Committee inquiring into Parliament's Appropriations and Staffing, the Committee's report, as we see it, is a moderate document and one which has been based on the principle of gradualism at all times. Having considered the motion of Senator Jessop and the amendment of Senator Missen, the Opposition supports Senator Missen's amendment because it strengthens the original motion of Senator Jessop and is in line, as Senator Missen has said, with the Committee's recommendation set out in paragraph 6.8 on page 21 of the report, which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In relation to the Estimates, the Committee-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the Committee to be established for the purpose of considering the parliamentary estimates-</PARA>
<PARA>would examine the proposals of the President and the officers of the Senate at, unless otherwise ordered, public hearings. The Estimates as finally agreed by the Committee would be submitted to the Minister for Finance for inclusion in a separate Parliamentary Appropriation Bill. The Minister would then introduce the Bill in the House of Representatives in accordance with current practice. The Senate, upon receipt of the Bill from the House of Representatives, would consider its provisions in the normal way and, at that time, would also have before it a report from the Appropriations and Staffing Committee covering its deliberations concerning the Estimates. </PARA>
<PARA>As I have said, the approach has been one of gradualism. The Opposition firmly believes that the Parliament cannot be regarded as an ordinary annual service of the government. Therefore, we believe that the motion of Senator Jessop and the amendment of Senator Missen should be supported this evening. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bills be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate the second reading speech in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> These Bills provide for a tax of 10 per cent on the advertising of liquor and establishing a fund to cover the costs of a nationwide advertising campaign designed to reduce excessive use of alcohol. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely it is unnecessary to describe in detail the tragic consequences of alcohol abuse. </PARA>
<PARA> The World Health Organization nominates alcohol as the third largest killer of the human race. It closely follows heart disease and cancer. </PARA>
<PARA> It has left a trail of broken families, battered children, innocent people killed and maimed on the road. </PARA>
<PARA> According to medical authorities (Dr Chesher and Associate Professor Starmer, Sydney Morning Herald, 23 November 1981) alcohol has been proved to cause brain damage, be toxic to the heart muscle, cause liver damage, gastritis, reduce resistance to infection-the list goes on. </PARA>
<PARA> Logic would demand a conclusion that for society to allow millions of dollars to be spent inducing or seducing members of that society to consume such a product or to abuse such a product borders on social insanity. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact remains that the abuse and misuse of alcohol kills millions more people than the abuse of heroin or cannabis, and yet what kind of public outrage would there be if someone advocated the allowance of the uninhibited advertising of heroin, of opiates, of marihuana or drugs of addiction. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Bureau of Statistics reported the following facts concerning 1980. There were 3,272 people killed on Australian roads, and more than 90,000 injured. 50 per cent of these deaths and injuries has been estimated to be due to alcohol. </PARA>
<PARA> The National Health and Medical Research Council estimates that 'not less than 10 per cent of admissions to public hospitals are substantially due to alcohol'. This means that public hospitals spent at the very least $540 million on treatment of alcohol induced illnesses or injuries in any one year.</PARA>
<PARA> This figure does not measure the exquisite agony of personal, physical and mental suffering and heartbreak. These Bills are not designed to prohibit the consumption of alcohol, as such a course has already proved a social disaster in the United States in the late 20's. It does not ban the advertising of alcohol. It is not based on an assumption that it is possible nor even desirable to persuade society to totally forsake the use of this drug. Sad though it may be, it is doubtful that our present society with its mad way of life and false and materialistic ideals could survive without some form of social lubricant such as alcohol. Imagine what a jolly affair the Melbourne Lord Mayor's Ball would be if only orange juice was served. </PARA>
<PARA> One could well question the wisdom of permitting the continued advertising of alcoholic beverages. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare has already made a recommendation to the Commonwealth Government to ban advertising of alcohol. The Government has refused to accept this recommendation. The Government stated, that instead, it would use preventive and curative measures to combat alcohol abuse. The 1980-81 report by the Director General of Health shows there is little evidence of any determined, broadly based attempt to identify what makes us drink to excess and to concentrate our efforts in those areas. In recent months, I have studied the results of a great amount of relevant research. </PARA>
<PARA> None of the available research evidence discloses a correlation between the level of advertising, consumption and abuse. Somewhat reluctantly, therefore, I conclude that at this stage, there is no conclusive evidence to my knowledge of a direct causal relationship between increased liquor advertising and an increased level of alcohol consumption and abuse. In fact, incredible though it seems, some of the figures I have studied seem to indicate the opposite conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA> I say ''reluctantly'' because I have a healthy respect for the business acumen of the liquor industry and hence find it a little difficult to accept that annual expenditure exceeding $25 million is directed only to persuading people to switch brands or beverages-(say between beer and wine). </PARA>
<PARA> In 1979, according to the Australian Association of National Advertisers, expenditure in Australia on media advertising alone amounted to over $23 million and was allocated as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>$m  Press   9.80  Metropolitan TV  10.66  Country TV   1.80  Radio   1.46</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>  Total media  23.72</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> It remains difficult to believe that expenditure of this order has no effect on consumption, but until we find specific evidence to this effect we are confronted with an extremely complex causal interaction of cultural social and psychological factors. However, this does not relieve the advertising industry or the liquor industries of their responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> The images projected, particularly in television advertising associate alcohol with commercial success, ''well earned'' rewards, sophisticated people in glamorous settings, healthy, outdoor living, gaiety and mateship-images which relate to the aspirations and anxieties of most people. To this extent the advertising industry contributes however subtly, to the maintenance and reinforcement of the social and economic climate which, it says, is to blame if people persist in using alcohol to excess. </PARA>
<PARA> In this context, but at another time, the role played by our not so hidden persuaders in determining the kind of society we live in may be worth examining. As I said, another time. I do believe, however, that there is a case for the Alcoholic Beverages Advertising Council to review its code for alcohol advertising with the aim to discourage advertisements creating general receptiveness to alcohol and to concentrate more on its proper functions in this area-the provisions of specific information. </PARA>
<PARA> Recently I was privileged to be one of the guests of honour at the annual presentation of the television advertising awards conducted by the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations (FACTS). The series of advertisements which won first prize was one which featured Paul Cronin, the distinguished Australian actor, suggesting to his mate that he had had too much to drink and should not drive home. Cronin takes the keys and offers his mate a bed in his house or a taxi fare. </PARA>
<PARA> I have gone into some detail here to show that educational advertisements need not be preaching, moralistic, nagging or narrow minded. In this case a practical real life situation firmly implants in the viewer the concept that he or she can save a mate's life. I was distressed to learn from the producers of this advertisement which had been commissioned by the Commonwealth Department of Health, that the Department did not have sufficient funds to show these advertisements beyond a couple of provincial towns. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bills proposed by the Australian Democrats seek to expand this approach into a carefully prepared and targetted attack on the misuse of alcohol and to ensure that sufficient funds are available for this purpose. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liquor Education Fund Act 1981 seeks to establish a Fund to be available to the Minister for Health to run public education programs to reduce, '. . . the dangers of the misuse or excessive consumption of liquor'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Liquor Advertising Tax Assessment Bill 1981 provides for the assessment and collection of a levy on all liquor advertising to enable the Government to appropriate adequate funds for the purpose of running the education programmes. </PARA>
<PARA> Under S.53 of the Constitution, taxing and appropriation bills may not originate in the Senate. Hence, following passage of these bills in the Senate, a message would be sent to the House of Representatives requesting passage of these bills together with a bill for an Act imposing a 10 per cent tax as defined in the Assessment Act. The message will include a request to pass a Bill for an Act to appropriate a sum equal to the sum estimated to be collected under the Liquor Advertising Tax Assessment Act and to apply it for the purpose specified in the Liquor Education Fund Act 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> On an estimated total annual liquor advertising expenditure of $26 million the proposed tax would raise $2.6 million nationally. </PARA>
<PARA> In the field of health education we have not progressed as far as I would have liked in the past decade. I can remember turning to health educators between 1969 and 1972 when as Minister for Customs and Excise I was warning against the growing menace of illicit drugs. In those days we relied essentially on the fear technique, which I believe does not work and in fact may well be counter productive. We have learnt that there is a wide range of techniques suitable to achieve acceptance of the positive aspects of moderation. </PARA>
<PARA> The trend towards education rather than prohibition is illustrated by other instances: the continuing Queensland Government program on alcohol abuse, the $1 million appeal by the Victorian Foundation on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence to combat drug and alcohol misuse, pilot education programs in Tasmania are just some examples. Surely prevention is better than cure and surely our resources are better used to eliminate causes rather than to cope with the damage once it is done. </PARA>
<PARA> I also note a recent report (Age 13/11) that the crime rate in Ballarat, Victoria, fell by 14 per cent following an intensive campaign based on personal contact by the local police force. </PARA>
<PARA> The potential of such campaigns to change people's perceptions about the consequences of drug abuse and, as a result, to reduce the level of consumption has been demonstrated recently by the Healthy Lifestyle Program in the North Coast Region of NSW. </PARA>
<PARA> Part of this program, run by the Health Commission of NSW, in conjunction with the Commonwealth Department of Health, was directed towards the reduction of smoking in the two test towns chosen-Lismore and Coffs Harbour. Mid-term results are now becoming available and show a reduction in the prevalence of smoking of 9.6 per cent and 11.3 per cent respectively. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, there is a case for extending the principle of co-ordinated, nationwide educational programs to the use of tobacco. Here I wish to commend Mr Fraser for his courage for insisting on the ban on tobacco advertising on TV and radio in the face of massive opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> The State Governments stand condemned for their gutlessness in failing to enact similar legislation for the print media. A lot more needs to be done in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make it clear that the Australian Democrats do not hold a brief for any particular type of education program. Here we should turn for help and advice to the people who are expert in finding out what makes us tick and who, I am told, can even make us tick in a particular manner. </PARA>
<PARA> What the Democrats want is a fund administered by the Department of Health which would employ advertising agencies of equal brilliance, cleverness, astuteness as those who work for the alcohol industry who would simply get the message across that if you drink do not drive, you could be killed, mained, or kill an innocent person. </PARA>
<PARA> I personally do not believe the acceptance of this measure is the total solution to the problem of carnage on our roads. I have a personal view that we should also be moving towards the extremely severe penalties imposed in Sweden, where being in charge of a vehicle while having a minimum blood alcohol count means a mandatory jail sentence. However, that would be the subject of another Bill, and clearly the Commonwealth's powers are limited and such a Bill brought in by this Federal Parliament would need complementary legislation by the States. However, these Bills are a start. </PARA>
<PARA> When any party or when Parliament attempts such a reform it necessarily is confronted by opposing vested interests. I have not the slightest doubt this Bill will be strongly resisted by the breweries and the liquor industry generally. However, unlike a measure which would ban the advertising of this product, we do not expect opposition from the television and radio industry or the advertising profession. Indeed, we expect their active support and co-operation. </PARA>
<PARA> Their financial and active participation in combatting misuse would be an expression of social responsibility as well as good economic sense. </PARA>
<PARA> I accept without question that excessive use and the tragic consequences are neither intended nor directly promoted by either the makers, marketers or advertisers of alcoholic beverages. I believe it is not beyond the combined resources of the liquor industry and of Government to reduce substantially the devastatingly harmful effects of the misuse of alcohol. </PARA>
<PARA> These Bills are designed to make this co-operative effort possible. </PARA>
<PARA> I appeal to senators to avoid party lines or party direction on this issue and treat it as a conscience measure. I ask that it be examined on its merits.</PARA>
<PARA> I have left it until the end of this Session so that it can be discussed during the next few months within the community and then brought back hopefully for a positive decision by the Senate and subsequently the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bills to the Senate. </PARA>

I have been to Yugoslavia several times and talked to the people on the worker-management committee on Litistrov and Lex. We discussed this problem.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Time is short and the Senate is debating an Industrial Democrary Bill, so-called, which has been introduced by Senator Siddons. I say at the outset that the Opposition has some qualifications about this Bill. We do not, for example, think that it should be called an Industrial Democracy Bill, as we do not think it is an Industrial Democracy Bill. It is perhaps a step towards industrial democracy legislation with which we feel Australians should be concerned and with which this Parliament should be concerned as a matter of importance and priority.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Having said that we have qualifications about the Bill-and in the Committee stage I will indicate some of those qualifications-we welcome the general spirit of it because it seeks to bring a more constructive and imaginative approach to industrial relations than has ever shown by the present Government. It seeks to encourage new approaches within the community to industrial organisation. Most importantly, I think the Australian Democrats are to be congratulated because, in a sense, it widens the agenda of political debate in the area of industrial relations. I hope that Senator Chipp took note of what I said-that the Australian Democrats are to be congratulated for widening the agenda of political debate on this important issue. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wanted Senator Chipp to hear that because sometimes I suspect he thinks I am less than charitable to him. The device used by this Bill to try to encourage employee participation in the ownership of organisations, companies and so on is the provision that, in return for certain concessions which are made by the employer in terms of employee participation in ownership and in return-as the Bill will be amended-for employee participation in decision-making, a tax concession will be granted to those companies which fall within the classification or description of an industrial democracy company. That classification would be determined by a board or committee, I am not sure which.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would be a board, established under the legislation, which would have the discretion, according to guidelines, to determine whether or not a company falls into that category. One or two amendments will be made to the Bill. We welcome the fact that it encourages not only more humane and more productive management techniques but also in that process it encourages employee participation of one kind or another. As I have said, the Opposition would like to see a Bill which goes further than this Bill goes. We think it is important that this Parliament discusses this issue for the first time in Australia. It has been an issue widely discussed in most European parliaments and it has been the subject of a special report commissioned by the former Minister for Productivity, Mr Ian Macphee, entitled 'Employee Participation in Industry'. It has been the subject of discussions by the National Labour Advisory Council and also of discussions between the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the Government and the ACTU and employer groups. So we think it important that this Bill should pass through the Senate and widen the agenda of pgditical debate on these issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In passing, Senator Siddons, in approaching the introduction of this Bill to the Parliament, to our knowledge had discussions with the Opposition and with the Australian Council of Trade Unions about his proposal. In neither case, as he knows, was there total approval of this Bill. However, there was approval of the notion that this should be the subject of political debate in the Australian context. We welcome the Bill and wish it a speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Siddons has raised a most important subject; one which should not be ignored. There can be no doubt that relations between management and employees in this country are generally most unsatisfactory. I would also agree that there is, at least in theory, no logical reason why the management of a company should be solely in the hands of the providers of capital while the providers of the other element of production, labour, have no influence on company policy except by confrontational tactics. We certainly must not be satisfied with the status quo. The subject is too important and our present arrangements so obviously defective for us to be complacent about it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The problem is what to do about the situation. I am not satisfied that Senator Siddon's solution is the best one, even as the basis for an experiment. One might well ask: If the advantages of his proposed company structure are as clear cut as he claims for both management and employees, why are they not adopted without government incentives? It may be because of the conservatism of both employers and trade unions, both of whom would have to give up some of their power and capacity for confrontation. It may be that that is the reason, but I think further investigation is needed before we make that assumption. </PARA>
<PARA> There have been many different attempts in various countries to tackle this problem. Some are clearly not suitable for us. Others quite possibly could be. It seems an ideal subject for a Senate standing committee to investigate and report on. A Senate committee is the best approach, for there would be some chance of achieving bipartisan support for such a scheme and without it any scheme would be stillborn anyway. Firstly, it should investigate whether a system of industrial democracy is desirable and, if so, which is the preferred solution. Secondly, it should investigate whether there is any necessary role for the Government in such a system. Thirdly, it should investigate what form the Government's role, if any, should take. If Senator Siddons likes to move, at some future time, the referral of this problem to a Senate standing committee, I will support him. The question is: Which Senate committee?</PARA>
<PARA> I have pointed out previously that the present division of responsibilities between our eight standing committees is far from ideal. A matter such as this, covering industrial relations and business management, does not sit very happily with any of those committees. I suppose the closest is the Senate Standing Committee on Trade and Commerce, of which I note Senator Siddons is a member. I therefore commend to him the suggestion that he should move to have the problem referred to one of the standing committees. Even if the Bill is passed tonight, it is almost certain that it will not be passed in its present form by the House of Representatives. I think the matter should be kept alive by its being referred to a Senate committee, but I will oppose the present Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to make a few preliminary remarks before incorporating in Hansard a paper that Senator Lewis thought was relevant to the problem. I submit it on his behalf. The paper was prepared by Mr Symons, Chairman of Directors of the Fletcher Jones group of companies, which are owned, as to 76 per cent, by present and past employees and the widows of deceased employees. Mr Symons has spent nearly 40 years examining and implementing employee participation schemes under the guidance of, and in furtherance of the aims of, the company's founder, Sir Fletcher Jones. Mr Symons went to the trouble of making a submission on this subject to the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a copy of that submission. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>SUBMISSION TO THE COMMITTEE OF ENQUIRY INTO THE AUSTRALIAN FINANCIAL SYSTEM</PARA>
<PARA> This submission is made by Donald Neil Symons of 201 Liebig Street, Warrnambool, Chairman of Directors of F. J. Organizations Pty Ltd and the associated companies in the Fletcher Jones Group. </PARA>
<PARA> The business now conducted by the group was begun in 1943 by the late Sir Fletcher Jones. </PARA>
<PARA> It began as a manufacturer of trousers. Later the business was extended into retailing activities and the product range has been progressively broadened. Retailing activities are conducted in all states (other than the Northern Territory) and manufacturing activities are conducted both at Warrnambool, where the business began, in Melbourne and at Mount Gambier. </PARA>
<PARA> From the outset, one of the fundamental objectives of the founder was to establish some form of co-operative staff ownership in the business. </PARA>
<PARA> There were two reasons for this. </PARA>
<PARA> First, he was concerned to attempt to create worthwhile jobs which would be available to several young men who had been employed in his business as a clothing retailer before joining the armed services during World War 2. He felt a responsibility to try to ensure that on their return from war service they would have better future prospects than he had enjoyed on his return from service with the first AIF. </PARA>
<PARA> The second reason stemmed from his interest in the co-operative movement, his reading on the subject and his personal involvement in the co-operative activities of the late Doctor Kagawa in Japan. He had come to believe that it should be possible to establish some sort of compromise between socialist and capitalist philosophies by encouraging a situation in which the ownership of the means of production and distribution would be placed in the hands of those directly involved in these processes. He saw in this development the possibility for a personal crusade to spread the gospel that the only justification for ''a licence to own the means of production and distribution was the acceptance of a responsibility to try to give more and more for less and less.''</PARA>
<PARA> This phraseology sounds naive in these inflationary days but it expressed a belief which the Late Sir Fletcher Jones attempted to practise during the remainder of his business career. In real terms, he achieved very considerable success in the process. </PARA>
<PARA> I was closely involved in the establishment of the corporate structure which was intended to facilitate the involvement of employees of the business in share ownership. Currently we have about 1300 shareholders. The interest of the founder and his family has progressively reduced from about 95 percent at the outset to 24 percent at the present time and the remaining issued capital is owned entirely by present and past employees and the widows of deceased employees. Each share carries one vote and thus, technically, the company can be said to be under the control of its employees. It can be expected that the founder's interests will continue to reduce progressively as his family has fully accepted the obligation to attempt to continue the implementation of his staff co-operative ambitions. </PARA>
<PARA> I appreciate that this forum is not the place at which to discuss the merits or demerits of this particular philosophy but in my submission no study of the Australian Financial System would be complete without consideration being given to trends in ownership of the private sector and the investigation or ways and means which trends seen to be potentially undesirable might be arrested. </PARA>
<PARA> Our own philosophies and techniques have been entirely home grown and it was not, in fact, until we came to study the Employees Stock Ownership Plans espoused by Louis Kelso in the United States and the social aims which had led the U.S. Congress to support them, that we came to realize that we in our organisation were in fact unwittingly following much the same path but without any of the assistance which the U.S. Congress deemed appropriate in that country. </PARA>
<PARA> So far as I am aware, this is a subject on which no evidence has been placed before the Committee and I would not like to hold myself out as being the best equipped witness to argue the case. </PARA>
<PARA> Put very briefly, I think that it can be demonstrated that there has over the years been a progressive narrowing of the base of ownership of privately owned capital assets. This has been clearly established in the United States of America. </PARA>
<PARA> The joint Congressional Committee, in the report which led to the 1974 Trade Act made the following observation:</PARA>
<PARA> ''Over 95 percent of investment finance is based on either the reinvestment of current profits of borrowings repaid with future profits; only a tiny fraction is based on the sale of new equities for cash to the small segment of the public who can afford such a cash transaction. But conventional techniques of investment finance are expanding the productive power of U.S. corporations by annual increments of over $100 billion of newly fabricated capital formation. Some industry spokesmen are projecting U.S. capital needs over the next decade at $4.5 trillion. If industry continues to rely almost exclusively on conventional methods of finance, we may achieve that estimate, but we will create virtually no new capital owners in the process.''</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee recognised that almost 100 percent of privately owned United States capital was concentrated in less than 10 percent of United States households and that the top 1 percent of wealthholders owned over 50 percent of all stock of United States corporations. It took the view that the removal of barriers between capital owners and workers, accomplished within principles of private property, could only strengthen national well being. </PARA>
<PARA> ''Qualitative studies of the U.S. capital ownership base show that almost 100 percent of privately owned U.S. capital assets are concentrated in less than 10 percent of U.S. households. Although 30 million Americans own at least one share of corporate stock, the top 1 percent of U.S. wealthholders own 50 percent of all U.S. corporate stock. Few workers, including most corporate executives, own capital of any appreciable income significance. Hence, few working Americans have any effective means of participating as stockholder-constituents of our free enterprise system, even in the corporations for which they work. A removal of any barriers between capital owners and workers, if accomplished wholly within the principles of private property and free market economics, could only strengthen our national well-being and our capacity to remain competitive in world trade.''</PARA>
<PARA> I know of no authoritive Australian statistics on this subject and would be hesitant about quoting the A.M.W.S.U. Publication ''Australia Ripped Off'' as a statistical source. </PARA>
<PARA> It does seem to be reasonable, however, to assume that the American trend exists to a greater or lesser degree in this country. In fact, discussions which took place before this Committee in the course of the evidence given by Mr John Brunner, B.H.P. Chief Economist, as reported in the Melbourne Age, would seem to suggest that the trend has at least been touched on in evidence already given. </PARA>
<PARA> The progressive decline in the number of shareholders in B.H.P., accompanied by a progressive increase in issued capital, has been apparent over a number of years. Similar trends can be seen in other companies. </PARA>
<PARA> On the other hand, there is also clear evidence of substantial increases in the investment of financial institutions in particular companies, both in money terms and as a share of total ownership. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not attempted to obtain any recent statistics but the trend was clearly demonstrable in the figures relating to the purchases of equity shares in the years 1970 to 1973 by comparison with the years 1954 to 1957 as set out in the following information which was supplied to me some years ago by the Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research. </PARA>

<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> It could be said that this is a trend which must be seen as inevitable under existing conditions of inflation, coupled with the world wide move towards more capital intensive activity but, even taking into account the fact that a significant proportion of the institutional investment can be seen as being theoretically representative of the small investor as a member of superannuation fund or the holder of life insurance, I would suspect that it might be common ground that every reasonable step should be taken to spread the ownership of private capital over the widest possible base. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not, therefore, propose to attempt to develop the merits of this argument but I would submit, with respect, that if the Committee is not in substantial agreement with it, then the subject should be thrown open for widely representative public debate before the Committee's report is finalized. </PARA>
<PARA> My own view is that the trend has to be seen as being most serious and that there is a greater likelihood that our so called ''free enterprise system'' will move, as a result of public inertia, towards a financial obligarchy than there is that it will move, as a result of political or disruptive activity, towards a state of socialism. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe, therefore, that Australia could well follow the lead of the United States in adopting the policy proposed by the 1976 Joint Economic Committee's report:</PARA>
<PARA> 'To provide a realistic opportunity for more US citizens to become owners of capital, and to provide an expanded source of equity financing for corporations, it should be made national policy to pursue the goal of broadened capital ownership. Congress also should request from the Administration a quadrennial report on the ownership of wealth in this country which would assist in evaluating how successfully the base of wealth was being broadened over time.'</PARA>
<PARA> The Kelso theory takes the view that the use of Employee Stock Ownership Plans could be a very important part of this process and apparently the United States Congress agrees. </PARA>
<PARA> I would not regard myself as competent to express the full Kelso philosophy but, as I understand it, put very simply, it goes like this:</PARA>
<PARA> If a company decides to expand its activities in a way which requires the use of additional funds, in general terms those funds will come from one or other of two sources, or possibly a combination of both. </PARA>
<PARA> Most likely they will come from borrowing, in which event not one additional owner of capital will have been recruited in the process. The future earning capacity of the business will be charged with the responsibility to generate funds to repay the loan. </PARA>
<PARA> To the extent to which the funds are generated by the raising of additional capital, the probabilities are that the additional funds will be raised from the existing shareholders and that the more affluent shareholders will acquire the rights of those who are unwilling to add to their investments. In this case, the result is more likely to be a progressive narrowing of the ownership base. </PARA>
<PARA> If new capital is to be raised from outside the ranks of existing shareholders, the probability is that it will come from institutional sources.</PARA>
<PARA> Kelso sees the ESOP as being both a financial tool and a means of broadening capital ownership. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus, for example, if a company wished to raise a million dollars for a new project, rather than borrowing or looking to existing shareholders for the required funds, it would arrange to issue one million shares to the trustees of its Employee Share Ownership Plan. </PARA>
<PARA> The trustees would raise the necessary funds by an external loan, repayment of which would be guaranteed by the company. </PARA>
<PARA> Associated with the company's guarantee to the lender would be an assurance to the trustees that contributions to the fund by the company over the period of the loan would be sufficient to cover the repayment of the debt and interest. The company's contributions could be in two forms-a direct contribution to the ESOP and the payment of dividends on the shares held by the trustees. </PARA>
<PARA> Because company contributions to an ESOP are made on a pre-tax basis, the prospective lender can view the guarantee with rather more confidence than he could in the case of the company's guarantee of the repayment of a conventional loan. In effect, the company would be able to charge the repayment of a capital debt against revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> The ultimate ESOP concept is that dividends payable in respect of shares held by an ESOP should also be payable on a pre-tax basis. </PARA>
<PARA> This appears to be a reasonable recognition of the proposition that funds invested back into the company in this way are very similar to loans, interest on which would be tax deductible on the part of a company. </PARA>
<PARA> As could be expected, the tax deductibility of an ESOP scheme is contingent on the trust deed providing appropriate safeguards to ensure that there will be no abuse of the system to the advantage of major shareholders and that the real benefits of the scheme will be enjoyed by bona fide long term employees of the company. I am not as fully informed as perhaps I should be with regard to these safeguards nor am I completely up to date as to the current limitations on the extent to which tax deductible contributions to the ESOP may be made. </PARA>
<PARA> My most recent information was that the maximum contribution was 15 per cent per annum of the total wages of the employees covered by the plan. This might seem a high percentage by comparison with our general limit of 5 per cent for superannuation contributions and it can perhaps be seen as a measure of the importance of this process in the eyes of the United States Congress. It should be noted that the 15 per cent limitation relates to the total wage bill of the people concerned and that the actual benefit to an individual can in fact be greater than 15 per cent of his actual wage. </PARA>
<PARA> Income in the hands of the ESOP trustees is non-taxable and it would seem that in the normal circumstance, the shares which the individual participant receives-which are generally not available to him until retirement-do not attract taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is significant to note that in the United Kingdom the provisions of the Finance Act of 1978 relating to profit sharing schemes indicate a similar acceptance of the importance of this type of activity in that country, although I am not aware of anything which encourages the use of profit sharing schemes as a financing tool, as advocated by Kelso. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the English system the safeguard for excessive erosion into the taxable income of the company concerned appears to rest in the limitation that the maximum market value of shares appropriated to any one participating employee in any year of income must not exceed 500 pounds. In practical terms, in a scheme in which there was extensive rank and file participation, 500 pounds could very likely represent about 10 per cent of annual wages. The English legislation contains safeguards, also, with regard to capital gains tax but it would seem, in general terms, that an individual participant who retains the shares allocated to him over a period of years ultimately reaches the point where disposal of the shares does not attract any tax at all. Dividends paid in the meantime are taxable whereas, under the USA system, it would appear that no tax attaches to dividends received by the trustees in respect of shares which have been notionally allocated to individual participants. </PARA>
<PARA> In my submission a careful analysis of the respective merits and demerits of the two systems, would be justified and this would obviously involve an investigation in some depth. For present purposes, however, the significant point appears to be that in both countries the importance of the encouragement of employee participation in share ownership has been recognised and it is perhaps particularly significant that in the U.K. this recognition came in an Act of Parliament introduced by the Labour administration. </PARA>
<PARA> Low key representations have been made for the introduction of Kelso type system in the Australian scene. The subject was looked at by a Committee of the Liberal Parliamentary Party at a fairly early stage of the present Administration and it is my understanding that the Committee was in favour of its inclusion in the Policy of the Party-subject to more specific information being obtained about the development of the movement in the U.S. I am not aware whether this investigation, which would presumably have involved some cost to the Government, was proceeded with but I think it must unlikely, in the face of strong Treasury opposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from the necessary amendments to the income tax legislation, it would appear that it could be necessary to amend provisions of Section 67 of the Companies Act to broaden the exceptions to the restrictions which currently prevent companies from dealing their own shares. There is currently a power for a company to lend money in circumstances associated with the purchase of shares for the benefit of employees but there is no power to issue guarantees.</PARA>
<PARA> (On the subject of guarantees, the Kelso philosophy includes the establishment of an insurance corporation with government backing to guarantee the repayment by E.S.O.P. trustees of loans raised for the purchase of shares. Attention has also been given to ways and means of creating opportunities for employees in government and semi-government instrumentalities to acquire a portfolio of investments through an E.S.O.P. in compensation for the fact that their type of employment does not naturally lead to share ownership in the employer organisation.)</PARA>
<PARA> In the current state of preoccupation with the necessity to balance the budget, it is understandable that Treasury should have viewed with considerable suspicion the suggestion that the E.S.O.P. system should be introduced in Australia. I understand that it has been suggested that the introduction of the system could only be justified on the basis of clear evidence that schemes of this cost could with confidence be expected to result in great improvements in productivity and, presumably, also in industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA> This, of course, is a very effective riposte by those whose concern it is to protect the revenue at all cost, because to those of us who have been concerned in this area for some time, no more counter-productive argument in support of the E.S.O.P. system could be suggested than one which suggested that employer participation in ownership converted workers into contented cows. </PARA>
<PARA> Personally I do not see that there is much justification for concern about the need to protect the revenue. If there were likely to be a wide scale adoption of E.S.O.P. techniques, which presupposes an initial wide spread enthusiasm for the subject, a control such as applies in the U.K.-which could be progressively relaxed if circumstances warranted it-would seem to provide an adequate safeguard and if there were a wide spread enthusiasm for the system, the ultimate social consequences would seem to be likely to be most advantageous. </PARA>
<PARA> Kelso lays great stress on the effect on purchasing power which can be achieved by the creation of a second income through an E.S.O.P. investment. He believes that this could result in a significant improvement in consumer demand, pointing out that under the current system the excessive purchasing power enjoyed by the few tends to be directed towards increasing the value of their capital investments rather than adding to demand for normal consumable goods and services. </PARA>
<PARA> There would be little doubt that, in the case of some organisations in which E.S.O.P. procedures have been adopted for a relatively small number of individuals in highly capital intensive activities there must have been substantial increments to the assets of the individuals concerned but I would be inclined to join issue with Kelso as to the extent to which, in the short term, the average man in the street would see much in the way of immediate benefit other than a greater feeling of security in retirement. This latter is, in itself, of tremendous social significance particularly as the average age of the community increases and reliance on social benefits is likely to increase at least in proportion. </PARA>
<PARA> But there are many other facets of the subject which could be discussed. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the years I have been involved in various local fund raising activities. In metropolitan eyes, this might be seen to be a small town experience but the Warrnambool scene could well be a typical part of a wider landscape. </PARA>
<PARA> There was a time when local business and industry could be looked to for substantial personally interested support. Over the years the scene has changed-at times almost imperceptibly at times dramatically-and, from being a community of locally owned undertakings we have become a collection of branches of national undertakings. With one or two rare exceptions, those of the locals who have determined to dig in and maintain their independence have either dug a grave for themselves or at best have created a rut which allows no prospect of growth, no prospect of expanding job opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA> This trend away from local ownership is not only the result of economies of scale. Other factors include</PARA>
<PARA> the impact of taxation, which adds intolerably to the difficulties involved in ploughing back profits to allow for growth or replacement of assets,</PARA>
<PARA> the impact of inflation, which has tremendously increased these difficulties,</PARA>
<PARA> increasing difficulty in recruiting, motivating and retaining suitable staff. Higher educations levels have produced higher expectations. Big business can at least offer prospects of advancement-perhaps through transfer to other branches-for which the one unit business can have no hope of offering competition, except perhaps through prospects of partnership. </PARA>
<PARA> So called 'employee shares'-the sort of thing which we investigated when we were first setting up our ownership system-involving limited voting rights (if any) limited dividend rights, limited participation in growth-seemed to us to be only cynical lip service to a form of professed paternalism. They are not the answer. </PARA>
<PARA> But participation in ownership and the responsibilities as well as the benefits of ownership could be a very different thing, particularly if it were as part of a system which had the imprimatur of legislative respectability, as being seen to be socially desirable and responsibly administered. </PARA>
<PARA> I would have to be the first to acknowledge that on this subject I have an axe to grind. </PARA>
<PARA> We are probably as well equipped as anyone else to take quick advantage of the E.S.O.P. procedure because we are psychologically and technically adjusted to it already but we are certainly no more in need of this type of blood transfusion than many other companies both public and private. </PARA>
<PARA> Personally, I would sooner see an E.S.O.P. procedure established by legislation than a reduction in company taxation. It would be less costly and better for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Better in what way?</PARA>
<PARA> Better for the organisations concerned, for the people who work in them-their self respect, pride in belonging to a team and, possibly, for their productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> We can't talk about the effect of employee share ownership on productivity because it has always been with us, though we can envisage a variety of intangible reasons why it could stabilize the climate required for good productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> But I would never try to sell participation in ownership on the basis of productivity. </PARA>
<PARA> The motive would be wrong; the psychology would be wrong; the knockers would have a field day and the trade union movement would be justifiably suspicious.</PARA>
<PARA> I would sell it because co-operation is a healthy thing to promote, because it is a useful way of developing a second income and a retirement benefit which avoids the need for complete reliance on a welfare state, because the future of a stable, wholesome well based capitalist system is dependent on the widest possible spreading of the ownership of capital resources amongst people who care about the way in which those resources are deployed-because in the final analysis the increased involvement of financial institutions in the ownership of equity capital, no matter how benevolent and public spirited the managements may wish to be, is not all that different from socialist control except for one thing-you can't control a financial obligarchy through the ballot box. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most traumatic things which happened to the traditional craftsman as a result of the Industrial Revolution was the way in which he was divorced from the job satisfaction of working for himself and for his customer. </PARA>
<PARA> I like to think that the basic objectives of our organisation-which were directed first towards quality, service and value and then to management by consultation and co-operative ownership-have helped to reduce the incidence of these traumas. </PARA>
<PARA> Kelso offers us all the opportunity of giving our employees a feeling that they are working for themselves and their fellow shareholders in the group and not for an unknown mass of changing, faceless, uncaring investors whose sole interests are dividends, the security of their cash and the prospect of capital gain. </PARA>
<PARA> This would be a worthwhile prospect at any time. It could not be more timely than now because the E.S.O.P. means of financing would add a valuable tool for those of us in the private sector who are now desperately looking for bootstrings to clutch. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that Mr Symons says that his reference in the submission to the United Kingdom Finance Act of 1978 is now out of date; that the benefits that were available under the Labour Administration have been substantially improved upon under the present Conservative Administration. Mr Symons, with his many years of both practical application and theoretical knowledge of employee participation schemes, says that the scheme proposed in the Bill presented by Senator Siddons is impractical and impossible. He says that very few companies-in fact he doubts if any-would be able to comply with the intricate and complex details of the Bill. Those remarks were given by me on behalf of Senator Lewis. They reinforce my view that, rather than this Bill being implemented by the Government, a detailed examination is needed of its practicalities, of the best way to go about it and of the proper role of government in such a scheme. For that reason, I would support Senator Siddons if he chose to ask that the proposal be referred to a Senate standing committee. However, I will oppose the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Government, I indicate that it does not propose to support the Bill put forward by Senator Siddons. I have prepared a fairly extensive speech, which sets out the reasons. However, I propose to speak briefly to the matter and, because of the pressure of business upon us this evening, to seek leave of the Senate to incorporate the speech in Hansard. In summarising the speech, I would like to say that the Government agrees that the thrust of the Bill is such that it would receive general support. I refer to the encouragement of a closer link between employers and employees, to the benefit of both. Indeed, as is indicated in my prepared speech, the Government has been pursuing precisely that objective. However, the specific means proposed in the Bill to meet the objective are open to very severe criticism and the Government's list of criticisms are set out in the document which I will be seeking leave to incorporate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In summary, so that honourable senators and those listening to the debate will have some idea of the Government's approach, which is not inconsistent with the view which has already been put by Senator Hamer a few minutes ago, I point out that our approach in this broad field where we have the common objective of trying to encourage the closer link between employers and employees, has had two central elements. It has a firm basis in trying to achieve a three-way consensus approach involving employers and trade unions in the development of programs and strategies and the rejection of a prescriptive approach presenting a blueprint of practices to be adopted by all enterprises regardless of their particular circumstances. In the view of the Government neither of these essential elements is present in the approach suggested by Senator Siddons's Bill. Although there is scope for involvement of the Australian Council of Trade Unions on the Industrial Democracy Board, and perhaps for employers or their representatives, the system is put forward as a fait accompli. </PARA>
<PARA> The ACTU issued a policy on these matters in 1979. On the question of legislation the ACTU stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Congress stresses that proper consultation and agreement be reached between governments and the trade unions prior to the introduction of legislation and amendments to existing legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>Moreover, the ACTU emphasised that representatives involved in employee participation structures must be trade unionists employed by the enterprise or persons nominated by trade unionists and that these trade unionists must be financial. It could be argued therefore that the approach by the trade union movement is one which sees employee participation as a means of achieving greater trade union control rather than employee control. In any event, with respect to this Bill, it is easy to foresee trade union opposition to any attempt to sidestep its authority in the labour movement. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the view not only of the Government but also of the Confederation of Australian Industry and the ACTU, as reflected in joint statements by the National Employee Participation Steering Committee, that there can be no detailed blueprint for employee participation which will suit all enterprises. Within each enterprise employers and employees need to work together to develop approaches which suit the particular needs and circumstances of each organisation. It is neither possible nor desirable to develop, as suggested in this Bill, a master plan to be adopted by all enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, there would be a great deal of administrative complexity in the scheme. The Board would be required eventually to watch over each resident Australian company with regard to organisational structure, the operation of the consultative council and the level of employee share ownership. It would therefore come to have very great power and influence over the private sector and in some respects duplicate the functions of the National Companies and Securities Commission. In particular, the share ownership level of employees in the individual enterprise could fluctuate dramatically over a year. The cost to the taxpayer of the bureaucratic organisation which would be required to oversee the scheme could thus be extremely high. To repeat, the present Bill makes no provision for supplying the funds necessary for the Board's arrangement and operations. That summary of the argument does not do full justice to the matters raised by Senator Siddons. However, in deference to the pressure of business, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the full substance of the Government's stance on this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>INDUSTRIAL DEMOCRACY BILL</PARA>
<PARA> Difficult not to agree with the thrust of the Bill-namely, to encourage a closer link between employers and employees, to the benefit of both. Indeed, as indicated below, the Government has been pursuing precisely that objective. But the specific means proposed in the Bill to meet this desirable objective are open to very severe criticism. </PARA>
<PARA>1. The Government's Record The Government has taken the view that questions of 'employee participation' should be achieved through freely entered into discussions between labour and management, appropriate to the requirements and characteristics of each individual enterprise. Voluntarism in this area much more in keeping than legislation with the spirit of what employee participation ought to be about. </PARA>
<PARA> Our view has been that the most appropriate approach is one which creates the environment within which labour and management can develop the most appropriate practices for each enterprises, as determined by labour and management. </PARA>
<PARA> In June 1978, the then Minister for Productivity, the Hon. Ian Macphee, announced the Government's policy on employee participation. The general thrust of that policy was, and remains, to encourage procedures which enable Australians to influence work processes and their work environment. While facilitative legislation may be required in the future, it must be determined on the basis of experience gained. The development of employee participation in Australia is still at a very rudimentary level, and it is therefore inappropriate to be considering legislation at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1978, the Government has undertaken a four-pronged program of action:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Public Relations-to increase the community's understanding of employee participation;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Research and Documentation-to investigate, evaluate and distribute information on the results of programs of employee participation throughout Australia;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Training-to assist, both directly and indirectly, those who may wish to introduce or expand the practice of employee participation;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Corporate Action-to provide a consensus three-way approach for the promotion of employee participation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Science and Technology has undertaken wide-ranging information, research, advisory and training activities in line with the first three elements of this progam. These include:</PARA>
<PARA> the provision of information and advice on employee participation and personnel practice generally to approximately 3,000 organisations each year;</PARA>
<PARA> the dissemination of information through publications such as the Department's journal 'Work and People' and individual booklets, such as those concerned with job design and financial participation;</PARA>
<PARA> the development of standard training models on different aspects of employee participation;</PARA>
<PARA> research into the experience of companies introducing participation practices;</PARA>
<PARA> the development of an inventory of resources (e.g. consultants, training courses, training aids) available in this area;</PARA>
<PARA> the funding of 5 research projects into specific approaches and issues relating to employee participation, such as safety and technological change. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth element-Corporate Action-has been pursued through the National Employee Participation Steering Committee which the Government established in 1978 following Mr Macphee's announcement. This was a tripartite committee, comprising representatives of employer and trade union bodies and appropriate Commonwealth Government departments. Its work has been directed towards developing a greater understanding, and encouraging the implementation, of employee participation in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> One of its major achievements has been the production and promotion of two consensus statements on what employee participation entails and how it should be introduced. </PARA>
<PARA> In other words, thanks to the mechanism established by this Government, for the first time in Australia there was an agreed view shared by employers, unions and Government on these very important and sensitive issues. Both booklets have stimulated a high degree of discussion and action in this field.</PARA>
<PARA> As part of the recent Review of Commonwealth Functions, the Government has adopted an even more comprehensive approach to the general question of employer/employee relations. The Steering Committee's functions have been placed under the umbrella of the National Labour Consultative Council and the Human Relations Branch of the Department of Science and Technology is to be transferred to the Department of Industrial Relations. This integration of the Government's consideration of these matters, it is hoped, will stimulate further development along the lines that I have already described. In summary, then, the Government's approach in this broad field has had two central elements:</PARA>
<PARA> its firm basis in a three-way consensus approach involving employers and trade unions in the development of programs and strategies;</PARA>
<PARA> its rejection of a prescriptive approach presenting a blueprint of practices to be adopted by all enterprises regardless of their particular circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA>2. Specific Criticisms of the Siddons Bill Neither of these elements is present in the approach suggested by Senator Siddons' Bill. Although there is scope for involvement of the ACTU on the Industrial Democracy Board, and perhaps for employers or their representatives, the system is put forward as a fait accompli. </PARA>
<PARA> (i) Industrial Relations Aspects One of the practices to be encouraged through this Bill is employee share ownership. Frequently with such schemes, so many restrictions are placed on the shares held by employees that their ownership has limited impact. Experience suggests that, in order for this kind of scheme to be effective, a number of conditions should be attached. For example, voting rights should be accorded with the shares, the scheme should cover all employees and not discriminate in favour of the senior personnel of an enterprise, and the eligibility period for the scheme should be relatively short. The Bill gives quite inadequate attention to these matters. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill does not include any reference to the resources, skills and training that companies will require to introduce such practices. The implementation of employee participation is not an easy process and requires considerable time, effort and expertise. There is currently a lack of resources and skills in this area and it is this gap which the Government has been working to fill. </PARA>
<PARA> Experience has indicated that the practices outlined in the Bill are not appropriate in every case. For example, semi-autonomous work groups are not compatible with all forms of work processes. Works Councils will not succeed unless there is a real desire for them and continuing interest in them amongst participants. It is most unwise to try to channel companies into establishing and/or maintaining certain practices when these may not be the most appropriate for those particular companies. It is unlikely that the benefits cited by Senator Siddons as flowing from this scheme would be forthcoming in such cases. </PARA>
<PARA> There would, of course, be considerable difficulty in determining whether enterprises had fulfilled the requirements imposed on them by the terms of this legislation to an extent sufficient to gain the taxation benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill raises the general question as to whether it is appropriate to impose mandatory conditions on companies in order to establish a co-operative environment within an enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA> The arbitrary level of employee share ownership required under the scheme would cause significant inequities and costly inefficiencies. For example, employees of unincorporated businesses, the self-employed and those providing public services would be unable to participate in such a scheme. Moreover, firms whose employees did not participate in share acquisition to the required level would be unable to take advantage of the scheme and would find it more difficult to compete against those firms which attracted the concessional treatment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Scheme seems designed to include private companies along with public companies. While presumably excluding companies with less than 10 employed shareholders, most private companies would be easily able to arrange their affairs (shareholders becoming ''employees'') to meet the requirements of the scheme. The result would be a potentially large revenue loss with no possibility of any associated gains, and no significant advancement in benefits to the ordinary employees. </PARA>
<PARA> The requirement that profits from each production unit be distributed to employees would pose problems where some units are profitable and others make losses, but no overall company profit emerges. </PARA>
<PARA> The arrangements regarding employee share ownership seems to require that the shares be sold to employees at par. It is not hard to imagine that BHP employees would be happy to purchase BHP shares at the $2.00 par value, but it is hard to imagine who is going to sell them. </PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Taxation Aspects Rigid organisational structure which the scheme would tend to force on businesses because of the associated taxation incentive would not be appropriate for the majority of those businesses. </PARA>
<PARA> The highly disaggregated monthly profit reporting requirements for each production unit would be extremely costly and often impracticable for firms with large numbers of employees firms, for which presumably the scheme was particularly designed. Inefficiency, rather than improved efficiency, would be the result, and over and above the cost of the scheme to participating firms, there would be a cost to taxpayers, running possibly into hundreds of millions of dollars. </PARA>
<PARA> Private companies would no doubt criticise the scheme on the grounds that, while their after tax profits might rise, the distribution requirements under Division 7 would tend to reduce the scheme's benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> Companies making losses while still being candidates for the Board's register would not be able to benefit from the reduced rate of company tax. Yet these companies could well be the ones in greatest need of a restructuring of their operations. </PARA>
<PARA> There is no apparent reason for the selection of 8 per cent as the maximum level of reduction in the company tax rate. Perhaps the only criterion was to keep the potential revenue loss in the realm of a few hundreds of millions of dollars, rather than getting up to the billion dollar mark. </PARA>
<PARA> As presently drafted, the Bill proposes a reduction of 8 per cent in tax payable, not a reduction of 8 per cent in the company tax rate as seems to be the intention. </PARA>
<PARA> Nor is it at all clear who gets the 8 per cent tax saved-the company (as a reward, or as an offset to the additional costs of the scheme, or as a fund for investment); the shareholders; or the employees via higher wages. </PARA>
<PARA> Allowing a partial reduction for a part year compliance would provide scope for manipulation. </PARA>
<PARA> The scheme seems to be based on the belief that the present system of taxing companies and their shareholders as separate entities would continue idefinitely. Whether this would be so following the Government's consideration of the Report of the Campbell Committee is a not insignificant question. Simple reductions in company tax would not work (or would work only partially or clumsily) if the present system of taxing companies were replaced by another system. There is a further question of whether it is appropriate that provisions to grant a reduction of tax be included in a Bill of this kind rather than in an appropriate income tax rates bill and supported, if necessary, by a bill amending the Income Tax Assessment Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill defines ''enterprise'' as meaning a company for the purposes of the Income Tax Assessment Act. But that Act contains three definitions of ''company'' for differing purposes. This would be incompatible with the intention of the Bill, including as they do syndicates and unincorporated bodies. </PARA>
<PARA> The draft Bill establishes a Board without, however, providing the necessary funds and provides for a (conditional) reduction in company tax. It has to be asked whether such a composite Bill is constitutionally sound. </PARA>
<PARA> (iii) The Views of Employer and Union Organisations It is clear that the Confederation of Australian Industry would have a number of objections to the Bill, not the least being that it seeks to impose on management a degree of control over financial administration which would simply not be acceptable to employers. While employer organisations might accept the potential benefits of employee participation (in terms of increased productivity and job satisfaction) on bases appropriate to individual enterprises, the C.A.I. would not accept an across the board approach which would have a severe impact on the capacity of a firm to restructure or cope with the many corporate decisions which determine the profitability and economic viability of an enterprise. There are some businesses where the approach suggested by the Bill might well bear fruit. But that is a decision which should issue from negotiations between the parties and not be imposed from above by Government. </PARA>
<PARA> At its 1979 Congress, the ACTU issued a policy on industrial democracy which bears on matters contained in this Bill. On the question of legislation the ACTU states that 'Congress stresses that proper consultation and agreement be reached between Governments and the Trade Unions prior to the introduction of legislation and amendments to existing legislation'. (Article 7, p.75)</PARA>
<PARA> Moreover the ACTU emphasizes that representatives involved in employee participation structures must be trade unionists employed by the enterprise or persons nominated by trade unionists; and that these trade unionists must be financial. It could be argued, therefore, that the approach by the trade union movement is one which sees employee participation as a means of achieving greater trade union control, not employee control. But, in any event, with respect to this Bill, it is easy to foresee trade union opposition to any attempt to side-step their authority in the labour movement. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the view not only of the Government but also of the C.A.I. and ACTU, as reflected in joint statements by the National Employee Participation Steering Committee, that there can be no detailed blueprint for employee participation which will suit all enterprises. Within each enterprise, employers and employees need to work together to develop approaches which suit the particular needs and circumstances of each organisation. It is neither possible nor desirable to develop, as is suggested in this Bill, a master plan to be adopted by all enterprises. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, there would be a great deal of administrative complexity in the scheme. The Board could be required eventually to watch over each resident Australian company with regard to organisational structure, the operation of the Consultative Council and the level of employee share ownership. It would therefore come to have very great powers and influence over the private sector and, in some respects, duplicate the functions of the National Companies and Securities Commission. In particular, the share ownership level of employees in an individual enterprise could fluctuate dramatically over a year. The cost to the taxpayer of the bureaucratic organisation which would be required to oversee the scheme could thus be extremely high-and, to repeat, the present bill makes no provision for supplying the funds necessary to the Boards arrangement and operations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the opportunity to debate this matter afforded by the introduction of the Industrial Democracy Bill 1981. The tax laws are used for a variety of purposes. However, I do not believe it is appropriate to use tax concessions to introduce industrial democracy to Australia. Industrial democracy as a concept has a lot to commend it. But I believe if it is to be viable it has to stand on its own two feet. It will not succeed merely by concessions being given to business. One must have the right sort of relationship between the people who run the organisations and the workers who are producing the goods. I believe that if we are to introduce any tax concessions it must be to help small business and we can do this by providing differential rates to private companies. We should help small business in this way rather than forcing a concept of industrial democracy on business through the tax mechanism.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because of the pressure of business I regret that what I have to say will be somewhat truncated, as I have indicated that I will speak for only two minutes. I believe that the Industrial Democracy Bill deserves a great deal more time in discussion and debate than we are able to afford it on this last night of the last sitting day of the last session of the year. I, along with Senator Button, welcome the introduction of this piece of legislation. I congratulate Senator Siddons on his initiative in bringing it forward. It is a step along the way to the principle of worker participation in industry. As I understand it, it does not go to the final step of worker participation at board level, making provision for election to that level directly from the employee level.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have been a very strong advocate of the principle of co-operatives. I have had a long association with the role of co-operatives in the economic and social development of developing countries. I have always been concerned with co-operative societies throughout Australia. I think they do a marvellous job. A recent Four Corners program reported on the famous Mondragon experiment, which is no longer an experiment but a very profitable operation in the Basque country of Spain. This Bill, of course, does not relate to co-operatives but it is a step in the general direction of involving workers in their enterprise for the benefit both of the workers themselves and of the enterprise. I say that Senator Siddons is to be congratulated for bringing the Bill forward. I wish it a speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply-I foreshadow certain amendments to the Bill, which I shall move in the Committee stage. The Bill has been discussed with many individuals and organisations, and I wish to pay tribute to the many people who have helped to shape it. We see it as an important first step in the humanisation of the work place in Australia. To refresh the memories of honourable senators, who in recent weeks have been deluged with legislation, I shall very briefly-I assure the Senate that I will be brief-outline the functions of the Bill. The Bill is designed to encourage the introduction of industrial democracy through granting reductions in company tax for enterprises which meet certain specified criteria. In essence, the Bill provides for the establishment of a seven-member Industrial Democracy Board, with three members nominated by the Minister for Industrial Relations, three members nominated by the Australian Council of Trade Unions, and one member nominated by the President of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Board is to maintain a register of industrial democracy enterprises which, in the opinion of the Board, substantially comply with the following four criteria: Firstly, the employees to share ownership of at least 14 per cent of the issued share capital of the enterprise; secondly, the activities of the enterprise to be carried out through autonomous working groups based on profit centres within the enterprise; thirdly, a profit sharing scheme which distributes an agreed proportion of the profits within each group to employees of the enterprise; and, fourthly, a consultative or works council, one-half of the members of which are elected by employees and the other half of which are elected by the management. If enterprises substantially comply with these criteria the company tax paid by a registered enterprise is to be reduced by 8 percentage points. </PARA>
<PARA> I will comment briefly on Senator Chaney's remarks. I believe that the seven-member Board would be composed of part time members, at least in the initial stages. I believe it would not have a heavy work load. The whole thrust of the Bill is a first step in this important area. As I said in my second reading speech, probably not more than 5 per cent of the enterprises in this country would attempt to meet the criteria in the first instance and those companies that did attempt to meet them could be looked at with great interest by governments, trade unions and employers as a valuable experiment to see how well this concept was working. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chaney commented that the Australian Council of Trade Unions would not support the Bill. At least, that is what I understood him to say. I am happy to say that the ACTU described the Bill as an important and welcome initiative. The ACTU in a written submission to me stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill will provide an impetus for further discussion and action towards the promotion of industrial democracy schemes in Australian enterprises and the improvement of job satisfaction for workers in this country. </PARA>
<PARA>It went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is concerned with improving the quality of the work life through the encouragement of greater worker participation in enterprises and that the principles of the new Bill, if implemented, would tend to encourage better industrial relations. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the comment from the ACTU. However, the ACTU did have, as Senator Button has outlined, some important reservations about the Bill. The amendments which I intend to move in the Committee stage will go some way towards meeting the reservations of the ACTU. However, I must stress that although the Bill is still not all that the ACTU might want, its President, Mr Cliff Dolan-I would like to comment in passing that in all the discussions and negotiations I have had with him he has been very reasonable and forthright-and other officials of the ACTU support the Bill as an important development in the area of employee participation. That, I suggest to honourable senators on the Government side, is no mean first step. </PARA>
<PARA> The ACTU, however, as one would expect, remains committed to encouraging directly the adoption by enterprises of suitable forms of industrial democracy through discussion and negotiation between unions and employees, as its position paper on this subject clearly points out. Basically, the ACTU would like a broader range of criteria including agreement between unions and management on an industrial democracy scheme for a particular enterprise. In other words, it is saying that it wants a more varied approach to the subject. The amendments which will be moved at the Committee stage represent an attempt to give the Board greater discretion so that it can take up some of these objections which have been put forward by the ACTU. The ACTU also believes that the promise of greater efficiency and improved industrial relations should be sufficient incentive in themselves. Of course, Senator Chaney made this point also. In an ideal world perhaps they should be, but sometimes people need to be educated to perceive their own self-interest. This Bill gives that educative process a nudge. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the most important functions of the Industrial Democracy Board would be to publish and disseminate information on industrial democracy. This Bill allows a start to be made. The whole subject is immense. It is the greatest challenge, I believe, facing Australian industry today or likely to face it during the rest of this century. This Bill does not pretend to solve that immense problem. It is a first step, an important step, a step that does not lay down firm directions but seeks to encourage firms in this area. We need a humanisation of the work place and a work environment that frees people to use their human qualities of imagination, initiative and technical expertise. These vital human qualities frustrate people if they are not given the scope to be developed. The undoubted virtues of industrial democracy in many forms are practised in this country by diverse organisations. Parts of the concept of industrial democracy are practised by Repco Auto Parts and Fletcher Jones and Staff, quite diverse and separated industries--</PARA>

<PARA> In 1979 I had the honour of giving the Kirby lecture. I discussed some of the principles that are incorporated in this Bill. I have lectured on the subject since that date hundreds of times in universities and colleges of advanced education and to business leaders and experts in this area around the country. Unfortunately the progress has been slow. A tremendous amount of talk and a lot of lip-service was given to the principle but there has been very little action in this country. Australia is rapidly becoming an industrial backwater. Countries like Japan have been practising these principles for 10, 15 and 20 years and are so far ahead in industrial relations that the Japanese are now going to the United States, to the centre of industry in Detroit, and explaining to the leaders of the automotive industry there how to develop quality circles and decentralised management. Australia has not even begun to think about this matter to any great degree. A number of improvements have been suggested to the Bill by various individuals. I thank them for their contribution. The Bill has also been discussed extensively by the Opposition. Some drafting points have been improved with the help of the Opposition. I am delighted to acknowledge its support for this Bill and, in particular, the support of the Leader of the Opposition, Senator Button, and his staff, even though the Bill may not go as far as the Opposition wants. </PARA>
<PARA> The thrust of the amendments I now propose is to give the Industrial Democracy Board greater flexibility in dealing with applications for registration under the Bill. I believe Senator Chaney made the point that the Bill requires too much of most organisations. We take that point. We have attempted in our amendments to give greater flexibility to the Board. In particular, the Board is now empowered to lay down criteria for registrations of enterprises employing less than 25 non-executive employees and to lay down guidelines regarding the share of profits to be distributed to employees, the allocation of shares to employees, and to distinguish between non-executive and executive employees for various purposes.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Siddons has moved a number of amendments. Those amendments have been the subject of consultation between the Australian Democrats and the Opposition. There has been a contribution made towards those amendments, if I may say so, in an effort to improve the Democrats Bill about which we had considerable qualifications and now have considerably fewer qualifications, but still have some. Senator Siddons's amendments include, as I understand it, amendments to clause 20 to substitute 8 per cent for 5 per cent. I should indicate on behalf of the Opposition that we oppose Australian Democrats amendment No. 6. This would remove a stipulation which could become a bureaucratic hurdle in the future, namely, the requirement that Senator Siddons has referred to that at least 8 per cent of profits be diverted into a profit sharing scheme. We are happy with the requirement that the Board ensure that any profit sharing scheme be a bona fide one and that will be ensured, in our amendment, by proposed new clause 28 (1A) (c). That is the basis of the opposition to Australian Democrats amendment to clause 20.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I indicate the other amendment which the Opposition wants to move to clause 20. Senator Siddons's amendment No. 10, which deals with clause 20, proposes a new sub-clause (5). We want to amend Democrats amendment No. 10 by leaving out sub-clause (5) and inserting the following sub-clause in substitution therefor:</PARA>
<PARA> (5) If in the opinion of the Board an enterprise cannot for whatever reason meet all four criteria set out in sub-section (1), at the discretion of the Board that enterprise may be listed in the register if it complies with only three of those criteria, if in the opinion of the Board the listing of that enterprise in the register would be consistent with the purpose of this Act. </PARA>
<PARA>I understand that that amendment is acceptable to Senator Siddons. There is opposition to the Democrats amendment No. 6 and there is an amendment to their amendment No. 10, which is acceptable to Senator Siddons. I think I need take it no further than that. We will not be seeking a division on the opposition to amendment No. 6. We hope that Senator Siddons will yield. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Amendment No. (3), clause 20, proposed new paragraph (a), leave out '5 per cent', insert '8 per cent'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I amend the motion of which I have given notice. I move accordingly. The motion now reads as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) That the following matters be referred to the Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The human rights and the condition of the people of East Timor</PARA>
<PARA> (b) United Nations resolutions and actions with regard to East Timor; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the appropriate policies to be adopted by an Australian Government in relation to matters revealed in the Committee's inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) That, as soon as practicable after this Resolution is agreed to by the Senate, the Committee cause public advertisements to be made advising of the reference of these matters to the Committee and inviting submissions in relation to these matters, such submissions to be lodged with the Clerk of the Senate on or before 30 March 1982. </PARA>
<PARA>I will just indicate briefly something of the history of this matter. I think there has been reasonably widespread concern in the Australian community about the situation in East Timor. That concern has manifested itself in two ways: Firstly, concern about human rights in East Timor and, secondly, concern about the condition of the people in East Timor particularly in relation to the question of poverty. I think that a number of honourable senators on both sides of the Senate have been subject to representations about these issues from the food aid organisations in particular or overseas aid organisations in general, which organisations have maintained a commendable and consistent interest in the plight of the people of East Timor. It is in response to those pressures that honourable senators on the Opposition side of the chamber-Australian Democrat and Labor senators-and some honourable senators on the Government side have been concerned to see that this issue be examined by a committee of this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> I say on behalf of the Opposition that an approach was made to the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence to see whether it would deal with this matter which is expressed in the terms of reference set out in the motion which I moved. We were told by the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence that because of other commitments it would not be able to consider this matter at all. It was consequent upon that situation that it was proposed to set up a select committee of the Senate to look at this matter. It was for that reason that I moved some two weeks ago that a senate select committee on East Timor be established with terms of reference almost identical to the ones the subject of this motion tonight. Subsequently-I see that all sorts of influences are at work in this place-it was suddenly decided today by the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence that it would examine this reference. There is some urgency about it. It should not be put off indefinitely because there is a great deal of community concern about it. For that reason, in paragraph (2) of the motion which I moved the suggestion is made that submissions should be called for on this issue and that they should be returned to the Clerk of the Senate on or before 30 March 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to say one or two things about this motion. I said earlier that a number of food aid organisations and other bodies in Australia had expressed an ongoing and continuing concern about essentially quite basic humanitarian issues relating to Timor. The Opposition does not intend that this Committee should embark on a political investigation of rights and wrongs of the past. It is my view that not one of the major political parties-that is, the Australian Labor Party and the present Liberal-National Country Party coalition-has, if I might put it mildly, an impeccable record in relation to East Timor issues. </PARA>
<PARA> What we are concerned about is that the inquiry should be directed towards very positive matters, namely, the deprivation of human rights and human poverty. It will be a continuing, ongoing and running sore in Australia's public posturing in the world at large if we continue to talk as we do about human rights in various other places in the world and ignore a situation which exists on our own doorstep. That matter cannot be swept under the carpet. It will not be allowed to be swept under the carpet because of the great community concern about it and because of the continuing interest of the Fourth Committee of the United Nations on the East Timor issue. It is in that general spirit that I move my motion. </PARA>
<PARA> I said earlier that two groups were particularly involved in the matter-the aid organisations and people concerned about human rights issues. It might be asked: What could the Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee, which will now be asked to examine the matter, find in relation to the issue; what will be new? Of course, it is unlikely that it would be allowed to visit East Timor. It is unlikely that it would get a great deal of co-operation from governments. But the point is, of course, that new information about Timor is available. There is new information about massive poverty in East Timor. It has been possible to bring out of the country, one way or another, new information about human rights situations in East Timor. There is a growing concern about several other issues in relation to East Timor which are of particular relevance to Australia. One of those concerns refugees from East Timor, a large number of whom are in Australia-I think the second largest number after Portugal. This raises the question of family reunions for those refugees. </PARA>
<PARA> It is now three years since arrangements were reached with the Indonesian Government, arrangements which have not been fulfilled in respect of the reunion of families who have come to Australia. Only a short while ago I asked a question in the Senate-to which, I think, I have not yet received an answer-about a report of 60 Timorese being arrested in Jakarta, effectively on their way to Australia to rejoin their families. That sort of matter is one which a Committee of this kind can legitimately look at. Mr Deputy President, in conclusion, in view of the terms of this motion and the reference to the Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee, I seek leave to amend my motion by replacing the words 'Clerk of the Senate' in the second last line in the motion with the word 'Committee'. Submissions would then be lodged with the Committee. Paragraph (2) of my notice of motion would then read:</PARA>
<PARA> (2) That, as soon as practicable after this Resolution is agreed to by the Senate, the Committee cause public advertisements to be made advising of the reference of these matters to the Committee and inviting submissions in relation to these matters, such submissions to be lodged wit' the Committee on or before 30 March 1982. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know that a number of honourable senators in this place have a very genuine and legitimate concern about this issue. I believe that for those who have taken an interest in this matter and have taken the opportunity of consultations with Timorese refugee groups, this issue, in terms of the actions which Australia should take and of the size of the human tragedy involved, transcends parties. I have great pleasure in commending the motion to the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have much pleasure in seconding this motion because I believe it is desirable that the Senate should undertake an investigation, in the general language in which this motion is now phrased, of the situation which has arisen in East Timor. Without going into great detail tonight, because I know that time is short, I believe we have great obligations to Timor and to the Timorese people-obligations which go back many years to war time periods and obligations since then. I am afraid that there have been certain regrettable incidents in our past in regard to this matter. I think it important that we should recognise that, whatever the legal situation of Timor might be, we still have a continuing obligation in this matter because of evidence which has come forward in recent times to indicate that in East Timor there are possibilities of famine, that there is certainly a great deal of discrimination and that there has been unfortunate behaviour on the part of the ruling authorities. So, we are not free of our obligations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe the motion as now proposed is a good one. I take it, from information given to me tonight, that the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence is prepared to accept this reference, otherwise I would not be prepared to second the motion in this way. Honourable senators will recall that in October I endeavoured to ask questions of the Chairman of the Committee and to persuade the Committee to take up a reference of this type because I believe it was the appropriate Committee to do so. It is the Committee which this Senate has created and to which it gives authority to speak on foreign affairs matters. Therefore, I believe it is obviously the better choice. Having failed at that time to achieve that result, I approached the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, but it said that likewise it did not have the opportunity to take up this matter because of other work. I believe the other alternative which was subsequently floated, that of a select committee set up merely for this purpose, was certainly the least adequate choice. Because of the number of select committees already in existence in this Senate, the choice of such a committee would have meant considerable delay before this matter came forward. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe there is in the Australian community a very strong demand for such an investigation. I have received from organisations scores of letters and resolutions. I realise that some of them are part of an organised campaign which is perhaps directed more particularly to those honourable senators, such as Senators Bonner, Kilgariff and Martin, who are known to have taken a particular interest in the matter for many years and who have been very active and concerned with the cause of the Timorese people. Probably no subject has figured so largely in my correspondence in recent months as this. Therefore, one cannot disregard the concern which people in this country feel for the Timorese situation. I believe the Committee would be concerned not so particularly with past actions and past mistakes but rather with present situations. </PARA>
<PARA> The motion, in the way in which it is phrased, is directed more particularly to human rights and the conditions of the people of East Timor, to certain resolutions of the United Nations and to the appropriate policies to be adopted. It is certainly predicated on the present situation. Of course, it concerns the reunion of families, which Senator Button referred to; and nobody can be very satisfied with the delays and complaints with regard to that situation. I do not propose to go into those details tonight. They are matters for the Committee. I believe evidence will come forward. Likewise, I will not go into the question of what is happening in Timor. I believe that investigations of this sort may well bring up a lot of material. </PARA>
<PARA> It may be that this Committee cannot go to Timor. Several of us have endeavoured to go to Timor on previous occasions as members of this Parliament and have been refused entry. But I do not give up on the possibility that the Indonesians may be persuaded to allow a responsible committee of this Parliament to go into Timor and make its own observations with people who can speak the language. I believe that evidence is available outside Timor, in Australia and overseas. People have come from that country in recent times. One knows that so far, following questions asked in the Parliament, there have been some requests by the Government to obtain information, particularly in relation to recent reports which have been sent from Timor and which have complained of very serious violations of human rights. The answer to a question which appears in Hansard of 12 November this year states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Indonesian Department of Foreign Affairs has provided the following official response to the request from the Australian Embassy in Jakarta for comment on recent Press reports about East Timor:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has taken the matter into its attention and is still processing it to verify the authenticity of the document itself. As for the sensational news reports, it is noted as an annual exercise before the United Nations General Assembly session commences. It is aimed to attract public sympathy and to discredit the efforts made by the Indonesian Government in East Timor. </PARA>
<PARA>I regret and deplore that that sort of attitude was taken in reply. I seriously suggest, as one who has no reason for any particular dislike of the Indonesian Government and wants to see that country grow in strength economically and in good relations with Australia, that it is not necessary for a country such as that to take the attitude which the Soviet Union very much takes. It says: 'It is our domestic affair; do not interfere'. That is not accepted by human rights defenders anywhere in the world and certainly not in this country. I believe it is important to stress with the Indonesian Government the idea that a sensible, carefully conducted inquiry which, of course, does not try to inflame but tries to inform the Australian people, is one which will do its best to improve ultimate relations with the Indonesian people. Therefore, I believe this inquiry, which is now to be held by the proper and recognised authority on foreign affairs in the Senate, ought to be supported. I, therefore, have much pleasure in supporting the motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats have held a position of preference in the past that this matter should be considered by a select committee only because a select committee would be able to give its full and concentrated attention to the matter. However, it is of primary significance that the matter should arise and be discussed within the terms of reference. If, indeed, the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence can accommodate this reference in the midst of the many other pressing matters which engage its attention-and, after all, members of that committee are merely human-and can provide a report which is satisfactory to the Australian people, the Australian Democrats certainly support this initiative. At this stage I only want to add to the comments Senator Missen has made that I have found this to be an issue of very great importance in Australia. The number of people at a meeting in Melbourne, at which both Senator Missen and I spoke, surprised me; there were 600 or 700 people at it. It was on the issue of East Timor.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I look forward to the consideration of this reference and I look forward to attending some of the Committee's meetings. I feel that the Australian people will be looking forward to a very thorough report from the Committee. I feel that any effort it can make in that direction would be worth while, including going to Timor, if possible, as Senator Missen has mentioned. I do not see that the Committee can really report in any conscientious or final way unless facilities are made for it to go to Timor. We urge the Government or any necessary authority to try to make that facility open to the Committee. On that basis, the Australian Democrats support the amended motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall speak very briefly. I too support the inquiry-and, in fact, any inquiry-into past events and present and future happenings in East Timor. I wish to speak because of something Senator Mason said and just to repeat the old problem that the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence has always had in the many years I have been on it-that is, the lack of funds and facilities to travel abroad to carry out investigations. On a recent reference two other members of that Committee and I paid our own way around Asia in an attempt to pick up information. That finally allowed us to bring down a report. It seems that for there to be a thorough investigation of the situation in East Timor the Committee should be provided with funds to travel to East Timor if that is possible. But more so I believe that the Committee should be given the ability to travel to Portugal which seems to be the source of a lot of information that has recently been available via the underground route. I think it would be a pity if we could not tap that source as a Committee to fill in the gaps in the information that may be available in other areas.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>Pesticides Inquiry-Examining the use of 2,4,5-T, 2,4-Dand Agent Orange</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Don Jessop (Liberal, S.A.), Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment, expressed surprise at the claim by Mr P. Thompson, National President, Vietnam Veterans' Association of Australia (VVAA), that the Association was being disadvantaged in the organising of the public hearing to be held in Sydney on 8-9 December 1981. Senator Jessop said that Mr Thompson's claim that the VVAA would be allowed an appearance of only 1 1/2 hours before the Committee compared to at least six hours by Commonwealth Departments, neglected a number of very important points and was a gross misrepresentation. </PARA>
<PARA> (1) A number of specialist witnesses who were planning to appear with the VVAA would now be appearing individually, making a total scheduled appearance time of 6 hours compared with 5 hours for Commonwealth Departments. It is anticipated that further VVAA witnesses will give evidence at later hearings. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) Mr Thompson did not seem to appreciate that in arranging public hearings it was the Committee's normal practice to allocate time periods to witnesses for scheduling purposes. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) The organisation of the public hearing was quite flexible and extra time could be given to witnesses if necessary. Witnesses could also be recalled for further examination at future hearings. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to Mr Thompson's statement that the Committee was delaying consideration of the VVAA's case, Senator Jessop said that the Committee had to allow a reasonable time period for the preparation of submissions and that was the reason why, following the initial hearings in December, further hearings had been scheduled for 9, 10 and 11 February 1982. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Jessop completely rejected Mr Thompson's claim that a Judicial Inquiry would be more effective than the Senate Committee's investigation. Senator Jessop pointed out that it is the Government's policy to respond to Committee reports within six months of their being tabled and that no such obligation existed in relation to Judicial Inquiries. Senate Committee's were also able to review actions taken in relation to reports. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Jessop added that the Committee would seek the approval of the President of the Senate to appoint specialist advisers in the fields of genetics, research design and epidemiology to provide it with independent expert advice during the inquiry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to reiterate that witnesses appearing on behalf of the Vietnam Veterans Association, together with several specialist advisers to the organisation who will be giving evidence separately, are scheduled for some six hours of hearing time. Clearly, as the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) pointed out last Thursday, the scheduling of witnesses is completely the responsibility of the Committee. I can assure the Senate that at no time has the Minister or his Department attempted to influence the time allocated to witnesses. I am pleased to report that the Committee staff are keeping in close contact with Mr Phil Thompson, President of the Vietnam Veterans Association. They are offering his organisation their co-operation and assistance in ensuring that witnesses who want to give evidence to the Committee are being given this opportunity. The scheduling of witnesses is now proceeding smoothly and should soon be finalised. I am assured that the Vietnam Veterans Association is quite happy with the proposed arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate authorises the President to have closed circuit television facilities for the monitoring of the Senate Chamber installed at certain locations and in offices of certain Senate Office Holders as approved by the President. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not think that I need to explain that the brevity of my case tonight has nothing to do with the importance of this matter but obviously relates to the problem we have with time. I will be brief. This is a matter that I believe is very important. I do not think I have to press the point, but honourable senators appreciate the need for the three party Whips to know what is going on in the chamber. They need to know that the Minister or shadow Minister is on duty. They need to know that speakers are ready to move into their speeches. I recall that Senator Brown used to speak with his eyes shut. I recall one evening that he was speaking with his eyes shut and sat down also with his eyes shut but unfortunately there was no one else in the chamber and he had to spring to his feet very smartly and recommence his speech. If we had some way of watching what was going on that sort of thing could be avoided. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that the Whips ensure that the chamber is kept. This is the responsibility, by tradition, of the Government. They need to know how many people are in the chamber. The Whips also need to be alerted to any problems-I use that word in the fullest sense of the word. We need to know what is going on so that we can perhaps avert some of those possible problems. This can be done by Whips sitting in the chamber; by frequent movements of the Whips in and out of the chamber through the various doors; by having a peep-hole in the wall to the left of the Chair; or by closed circuit television. We have tried all of these. Firstly, the Whips sat in the chamber. I think it would be generally agreed that that is time consuming and that it is not really an efficient use of time to have the Whips sitting in the chamber all the time. When I refer to Whips, I refer also to Deputy Whips since either the Whip or the Deputy Whip is in the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> There are certain problems, of course. If the Whip is in the chamber he has to listen to the speakers, and that is sometimes disturbing, given some of the speakers. The frequent movements in and out of the chamber are disturbing. They disturb the people who are speaking, and the person is not always there when necessary. The peep-hole is not effective. One has to be about 6 feet 4 inches tall to be able to operate it. Apart from not having good coverage, we notice that when we open the slide a light shines through from the Whip's office. So closed circuit television is quite clearly the answer. It gives a good coverage; the cameras give a good picture of what is happening. The proposal is to have four cameras mounted in the chamber. These cameras will be small. They are similar to the units that were on display here a short time ago and similar to those that operate in shops. They will be mounted to the ceiling under the galleries and will not be obvious. Certainly they will not detract from the look of the chamber. Monitors will be placed in the Whips' offices so that the Whips will be able to see both sides of the chamber. Basically, each Whip will be concerned with his own side of the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me stress-again I am hurrying this because of the time factor-that the test we carried out, of which all honourable senators were aware, was authorised by the Senate Standing Orders Committee. The monitors will be placed in the Whips' offices and nowhere else. My motion allows the President to have a monitor in the corridor or in his office, but that is at his discretion. No monitors will be placed in members' rooms. Let me stress very strongly that this is not associated at all with the possible televising of the Parliament at a later stage. This has no connection at all. In no sense is there any idea of spying on members. The system will enable the Whip, instead of looking at members from his seat in the chamber, to look at them from his office. It is simply using technology to be more efficient. Once again I stress that the control of this system is clearly in the hands of the President since the wording of the motion gives him the authority to say where the facilities will be placed. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that it is not that we do not enjoy the speeches of our colleagues from both sides of the chamber-we would like to sit here and listen to them sometimes-but we want to be like other senators and be able to do some work in our offices as well as doing the job we have been given by being elected as Whips. I wish to thank the Australian Broadcasting Commission for arranging the test which was done a short time ago and for giving us its advice. I thank you, Mr President, for your co-operation in assisting with the arranging of the test and your involvement in it. I commend the motion to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> (c) That the date on which the Committee shall commence its inquiry be contained in a subsequent Resolution. </PARA>
<PARA> (d) That the foregoing provisions of this Resolution be communicated to the House of Representatives by Message, requesting its concurrence in the Resolution. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) That, as soon as practicable after this Resolution is agreed to by the Senate, the President shall authorize public advertisements inviting submissions in relation to the matters referred to in paragraph (1) (a) of this Resolution, such submissions to be lodged with the Clerk of the Senate on or before 10 March 1982, and that any such submissions be presented to the Senate and forwarded to the Committee in the event that the House of Representatives agrees to the establishment of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>It was a decision of the Australian Labor Party originally to try to establish a joint committee because it accepted the principle that a change in the electoral system was more likely to be of effect and value to those who reside in the House of Representatives rather than in the Senate. However, at that time, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) refused to consider such a submission. We believe that if the Senate were to adopt such a proposal this evening and make a request to the House of Representatives it is likely the Government would reconsider that matter and agree to the appointment of such a joint committee. I indicate to the Senate that the Government has recognised the need for amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act. It called for a report which was made available on 22 August 1979. A further report was made available to the Government this year but those reports have not been made public documents. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators might recall the appointment of the Harders Inquiry into the Disclosure of Electoral Expenditure which was designed to inquire into a number of matters associated with elections. That report is in the hands of the Government, and similarly, has not been made a public document. As it is the desire of the Opposition, with the support of the Australian Democrats and the independent in this place, for the Senate to have a look at the Commonwealth Electoral Act in the event of the Government not proceeding to carry out what one of its departments has suggested, there is a need for a thorough overhaul of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. In fact, in that first report which has been suppressed significant recommendations were made upon which the Government has not been prepared to act. I ask the Senate to take the action that we propose. A lot more could be said about this matter but, in view of the pressure of time, I ask the Senate at least to take this step which will enable the President to call for submissions from interested parties and groups during the period in which the Senate is in recess. When the Senate and the House of Representatives reassemble in February next year the matters can then be considered by such a joint committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak from two points of view on this motion. I speak briefly as a Minister, to the substance of the motion. I will not go through the amended form of the motion at this stage but will just reiterate that the Government has already taken a number of initiatives in the area of examining electoral procedures and the Commonwealth Electoral Act. I place on record the fact that last year the Minister for Administrative Services, Mr Newman, announced on 2 December 1980 a wide ranging comprehensive review of electoral legislation and procedures. That review is still continuing; it is incomplete. The Senate should understand that what it is proposing is taking place against the background of a continuing government review.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Also last year Sir Clarrie Harders was appointed by the Government to conduct an independent inquiry into matters of electoral expenditures. That report-I think I referred to it on 19 August in the Senate-is also before the Government and will require some attention. That study took Sir Clarrie Harders some months of full time effort and the Government needs a fair time-whatever that is-to respond. There is a background of government activity in this area. Whether the Senate decides on the matter of substance to proceed is a matter for the Senate. I do not offer a government view except to say that in my opinion anything that the Government proposes as a result of its consideration would have to come to the Parliament and to the Senate for endorsement and resolution. There is no way that any government proposal could avoid being considered here. It would open up the question of the Electoral Act for parliamentary review when that happened. </PARA>
<PARA> I put that matter aside. While I may be a Minister I am no less a senator than any other senator in this chamber and I have as much interest in the committee system as any other senator. I have a past record of committee service and I am quite troubled by the motion originally proposed by Senator Geitzelt from the point of view of a senator who has served and still serves on Senate committees. I have concerns about the procedures which are being sought and about any proposal for any kind of joint committee. I am now talking personally, as a senator in this place. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Evans has a particular view. In how many of the joint committees does the Senate get fair or equal treatment? Let us take that question first. I ask honourable senators, before they seek to establish a joint committee, to look at the joint committees which exist and at the relative strengths of honourable senators who serve on those committees and at the people who occupy the chairmanship of those committees. Sir Magnus Cormack as an exception, had a chairmanship, but mostly the Senate is subjugated on joint committees. That is my belief. Having served, like Senator Georges who is trying to interject, on joint committees that is one of my points of concern. I find that joint committees do not operate to the advantage of the Senate. I am not certain that a joint select committee would operate to the advantage of the Senate. If it is the wish of honourable senators to put this study into the hands of the House of Representatives, which is what will happen on the experience of numbers as these committees have been constituted, then so be it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am concerned about the whole question of proliferating Senate committees. I have stayed out of most of the debates, but on this occasion I want to raise my concern and say that the Senate established its committee system in 1970 with two standing committees. It has expanded the committee system at a steady rate. It now has eight standing committees and the system, as it was proposed and as it has grown, has never envisaged a large or excessive number of select committees. In fact, one might even say that the Senate is its own worst enemy in the way in which it has watched the committee system grow. The original six standing committees extended to seven committees in 1974 and to eight committees in 1975. The estimates committees started with six committees and have now extended to eight committees. The Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances formally extended its role in 1979. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -Last week the Senate established a further standing committee-Senator Missen will recall this-to undertake the scrutiny of Bills. There are now 23 active Senate committees. There are five joint committees on which the Senate is represented. There are 28 active committees, even ignoring the committees that have not met for years or that have met only occasionally. There are still only 64 senators. If we exlude the six Ministers-I serve on the Standing Orders Committee but basically Ministers do not play a significant role-and we exclude the Presiding Officers and probably most of the office holders, that leaves only about 52 senators and each senator, on average, with the committee load we have now, is required to serve on three or four committees just to make the system work. So I have a concern about the proliferation in the number of committees. Of course, the proliferation of select committees is adding to our problems because we are having difficulties in staffing the select committees.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator McLaren cannot avoid making a partisan interjection when I am trying to make a speech about problems facing the Senate. The matter is of no concern to me personally. I remind honourable senators that between 1971 and 1976 the average number of select committees was about one or two in each year. At some stages there were three, but mostly it was only one or two.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have been establishing select committees which we have to service. We have to service them with staff, we have to service them administratively and we have to service them with membership. I am concerned about the capacity of the Senate to continue to service the committees it sets up. There is a limit to what we can do; there has to be a finite limit somewhere. I put it to honourable senators that we need to consider how many select committees should be operating at any one time. I suggest that two or three select committees might be about the limit which we can service and operate properly at any one time. I think until tonight there were three select committees actively operating. There were five shown on the Notice Paper, but two of them have completed their work. Senator Gietzelt's motion originally set out to establish a parking lot, as it were, to give precedence to particular select committees for the next vacancy that might come up. He gave notice yesterday of a motion to establish a committee in principle, to be established in fact at some later date. I am not certain that that is a desirable development for the committee system, but that is a matter for the Senate in the end. </PARA>
<PARA> I come now to the motion. The procedure which is being proposed is extraordinary. If honourable senators look at the motion proposed by Senator Gietzelt, they will see that paragraphs (1) (a), (b), (c) and (d) really are unexceptionable. The Senate will either agree or disagree to them on their merits. But paragraph (2) of this motion is quite extraordinary, I think. It is certainly unprecedented in my experience in this place. I do not know whether it is unprecedented in the operation of Senate committees. I am not certain that it is really proper in a parliamentary sense. Let us go through what was proposed yesterday, when notice of the motion was given, and what is proposed now. What was proposed yesterday was extraordinary enough. That proposition was that a committee be established in principle, with the details to be spelled out by later resolution, but that we were to proceed nevertheless, before the committee was established, before its membership was established, before its secretariat existed and before it had determined the form in which it wanted submissions, to advertise for submissions to the committee. </PARA>
<PARA> That is extraordinary enough. I would suggest-since it no longer applies I just raise this matter for honourable senators to consider-that it is a procedure which we probably would not want to adopt. At the very least a committee should have a chance to meet and to make some decisions about its procedures, the form in which it wants submissions, the priority it will give to the various matters contained in its terms of reference-is that so unreasonable-and then to advertise for submissions to meet its determination as to how it will carry out the reference given to it by the Senate. But what is proposed now really is extraordinary. The Senate on its own does not have the capacity to establish a joint committee. A joint committee can be established only by resolution of both Houses of the Parliament. This committee can only be recommended by the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> Paragraph (1) (d) of the motion suggests that 'the foregoing provisions of this Resolution be communicated to the House of Representatives by Message'. The purpose of that is to seek its concurrence in the formation of a committee. As a senator, I find it improper that we should seek in paragraph (2) to advertise for submissions to a committee which really does not exist and which cannot exist, in the parliamentary sense, until the other House of Parliament indicates that it wishes to be a part of the joint committee exercise. I put it to honourable senators that that is an extraordinary departure from proper parliamentary practice. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr President, I ask whether, in accordance with the Standing Orders, you will separate paragraphs (1) and (2) of the motion and put separate questions on those paragraphs. I indicate that, whatever happens in regard to paragraph (1), I will be seeking to divide the Senate on paragraph (2). I oppose paragraph (2) simply because I believe it is not a proper procedure to undertake. If a committee is to be established under paragraph (1), so be it; but at the least we should have enough concern for parliamentary propriety to wait until the committee is established before we go off seeking submissions to what in the end may be a non-existent committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The arguments Senator Peter Baume has raised on the procedure adopted are very sound. This proposal constitutes a very extraordinary change and precedent for relations between the two Houses of the Parliament. Speaking to the general issue, I believe and have believed for many years that there is a good case for investigation by a committee of the Parliament of a number of questions dealing with electoral reform. A number of matters in Senator Gietzelt's motion call for a great deal of public discussion and consideration. There is no doubt that many divided views are held in the community and there is no doubt that various proposals are of greater interest to some parties than to others. There is a vested interest-not necessarily an improperly vested interest-by some parties in some matters and less interest in others.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have taken part in debates on electoral matters in the Senate for many years. I have seen the folly that has been disclosed in Bill after Bill-the fault is not all on one side-whereby the party in power proceeds to put forward proposals for electoral reform that suit it and ignores others. On several occasions I have suggested the desirability of discussing this. I do not resile from the idea that it ought perhaps to be a joint inquiry. It seems to me that it is equally the concern of both Houses of Parliament-though in different ways. They are both concerned with even the electoral methods that apply to the other House. Therefore I strongly believe that there is a good case for a general inquiry to be conducted, preferably at a time when an election is not immediately in the offing, but I do not believe that it would be desirable for a committee to be set up now as a result of this motion. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an eagerness to establish an inquiry-in fact many inquiries-at present; there are plenty on the agenda. It has been said that there have been at least two inquiries recently, the results of which have not been made available to the Parliament. I know that the Minister has been undertaking a very extensive review of the Electoral Act. I know also that the Harders inquiry has been concerned with electoral expenditure. It is an important area and I look forward to its report. I regret that the results of recent inquiries are not yet public knowledge. I hope they soon will be. If in fact they do not become public knowledge in the coming year, there will be a stronger case for a committee to be given the power to conduct its own investigation. Clearly, that is something which must be taken into account. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remind the honourable senator, who apparently has not been paying close attention, that an election is probably two years off. Of course, in the meantime consideration should be given to this matter. This is a premature motion which is perhaps designed to demonstrate a great deal of interest in electoral reform. But, until we know that there is a joint interest on the part of both Houses of Parliament, such a proposal cannot be effected. I will not go over the ground which Senator Baume covered so ably. It is extraordinary that we should try to prejudge the method and timing of such an inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Clearly, in view of the many different aspects involved it would be necessary for such a committee, if formed, to have sub-committees and to decide the order in which it would conduct its investigations. Therefore, from time to time, it would want to seek up to date submissions on the questions before it. To seek now, before such a committee even exists, submissions on the whole range of matters involved would waste the time of a lot of people who would respond. This proposal is premature. If the motion is not carried tonight, I am sure we will hear more about the matter in the next year. However, the proposals embodied in the amendment, which came to our hands only a few minutes before the debate began, should not be accepted by the Parliament. It would be an affront to the other House to suggest that the matter be proceeded with in the way proposed. </PARA>
<PARA> For many years I have called for investigations by committees of the Parliament whereby we could exchange views and perhaps agree to proposals that were not necessarily helpful to our own particular parties. For example, the Australian Labor Party has strongly supported the removal of ballot procedures that make it more difficult for people to vote and cause mistakes to be made. The highest degree of informal voting has taken place in Labor-held electorates. I think this is a greater concern in that area. I do not criticise that matter yet many other matters are of more interest to other people. I believe that none of these matters is unworthy of consideration and acceptance by a committee of this Parliament. However, I do not think it is desirable that the committee be formed in the way in which it is being proposed at present. I hope that the matter will be the subject of further discussion and consideration in the coming year. </PARA>

<PARA> An invitation was extended to the Government to have a joint committee on this issue. That invitation was refused. The Senate, by passing this motion, would extend a further invitation to the House of Representatives to have a joint committee with the Senate to examine these issues. What the Senate is doing is expressing its view of the terms of reference of a joint committee. If there is to be a joint committee the House of Representatives would express its view. We do not believe there will be a joint committee; such a proposal has been quite explicitly refused in the past. Paragraph (1) (b) of the motion provides that the composition and powers of the committee be contained in a subsequent resolution. That means that, if the House of Representatives accedes to the request for a joint committee, the Senate, acting upon paragraph (2) of the motion, would provide for the composition and powers of the committee, as would the House of Representatives. We see nothing extraordinary about that proposition. All that paragraph (2) of the motion seeks to do is to advertise to the public that there will be a joint committee of the House of Representatives and the Senate if the House of Representatives accedes to this view. If the House of Representatives does not accede to this view, under paragraph 1 (b) the Senate would establish the composition and powers of a Senate committee and-</PARA>

<PARA> The second part of the motion indicates that the public should be entitled to make submissions on this issue, which is of widespread concern, on or before 10 March 1982. Where those submissions are ultimately directed would be dependent upon the final opinion of the House of Representatives and the Senate. That is all we seek to do. We are happy to accommodate Senator Baume's request for a separate vote on the two parts of the motion. I wanted to explain the connection between the two parts of the motion as we saw it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>The objectives of this Bill are to implement Australia's treaty obligations under the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women; in particular, to make sex and marital status discrimination unlawful in a number of specified areas, to promote affirmative action for women in employment and create the necessary enforcement mechanism. The Bill makes it unlawful to discriminate on the ground of sex or marital status in the areas of employment, education, the provision of goods and services, accommodation, land and clubs. The Bill also makes unlawful victimisation, certain advertisements, and aiding and abetting of unlawful acts. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to employment, protection is extended to employees who are employed by:</PARA>
<PARA> the Commonwealth or a Commonwealth authority;</PARA>
<PARA> a foreign corporation or a trading or financial corporation formed within the limits of the Commonwealth;</PARA>
<PARA> a bank other than a State bank;</PARA>
<PARA> a firm engaged in insurance other than State insurance;</PARA>
<PARA> a firm engaged in trade and commerce with other countries or among the States;</PARA>
<PARA> a registered organisation under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904; or</PARA>
<PARA> an authority of a State or the Northern Territory in receipt of section 96 payments from the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>All areas of employment in respect of which the Commonwealth has powers will be covered by the provisions of this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Before proceeding to a description of the Bill, I will indicate the need for this kind of legislation. Legislation of this kind is necessary because throughout Australia woman experience discrimination based on sex or marital status. The result of this discrimination is serious economic and social disadvantage. There are several major areas in which women suffer disadvantage and discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA>Employment</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The latest unemployment figures as at October 1981 show that 6.7 per cent of the female work force is unemployed compared with 4.7 per cent of the male work force. For females from 15 to 19 years of age, 17.4 per cent are unemployed compared with 12.9 per cent of males aged from 15 to 19 years of age. These figures, of course, do not take into account hidden unemployment amongst women. Because so many women are ineligible for unemployment benefit and therefore do not register, the unemployment situation is actually much worse than the statistics indicate. Migrant women have much higher unemployment rates than do the rest of the female work force, and Aboriginal women have higher rates again. </PARA>
<PARA> Another disturbing trend in female employment is the substitution of part time and casual work for full time permanent employment. Most part time and casual jobs do not carry with them the benefits of full time permanent employment such as holiday pay, sick pay, superannuation and long service leave. A total of 36 per cent of the female work force is now in part time or casual employment, the majority of it without the benefits of full time permanent employment; 79 per cent of the part time work force is female. </PARA>
<PARA>Income</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The 1981 Budget figures on taxable income of males and females show that while 90 per cent of men earn less than $30,000 per annum, about 90 per cent of women earn less than $15,000 per annum; 55 per cent of women who pay tax have incomes of under $10,000 per annum compared with 27 per cent of men. One-quarter of all women paying tax earn less than $7,000 a year. Women comprise a disproportionate percentage of the poor. Almost two-thirds of those who rely on social security benefits for the major proportion of their income are women. This reflects women's reduced access to employment. </PARA>
<PARA>Education</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> In the area of education, not only do few women have post-school qualifications, but even in areas where the number of women students approaches the number of men, such as in undergraduate courses at universities, the women are channelled into restricted areas. Statistics compiled from a sample survey of university graduates in 1980 show that women are significantly under-represented in scientific, mathematical and technical fields of study. For example, in engineering courses less than 2 per cent of students are female; in architecture, dentistrq and commerce only 20 per cent of students are females; in agriculture and economics only 25 per cent of students are female, and in law and mathematics less than 30 per cent of students are female. </PARA>
<PARA> Discrimination, both overt and covert, occurs not only in the private sector but also within Commonwealth Government departments and instrumentalities. The most blatant discrimination occurs within the defence forces. Women are not accepted in the Service apprentice and technical training programs in areas where career employment and progression involve employment in restricted areas. Women are not accepted into the Service's youth apprentice schemes. With the exception of adult apprenticeship training in the electrical technical communication category, there is no provision for female technical training in the Royal Australian Navy. Women are not accepted into pilot training in the Royal Australian Air Force. Women are not accepted as officer cadets at the Royal Military College, Duntroon. In the Department of Defence, out of some thousands of engineers, draughtspeople, naval architects, technical officers and trainees in these fields, less than one dozen are women. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not only honourable senators and members of the Australian Labor Party who acknowledge the gross economic and social disadvantage of women. I am pleased to note that the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in a speech to the Australian Businesswoman of the Year Award on 16 November 1981 acknowledged this disadvantage in some detail. I quote from the Prime Minister's speech:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . women now fill only 14 per cent of administrative, executive and managerial positions and although women comprise almost 40 per cent of the workforce, there is an unnatural concentration of women in a narrow range of jobs. For example, 62 per cent are in clerical, sales and service occupations and last year, women made up less than half of 1 per cent of those in apprenticeship training in Australia if hairdressing is excluded. . . . </PARA>
<PARA>. . . there are persisting barriers to equality and diversity in employment opportunities. There is in some places a continuing bias in education towards traditionally female occupations. There is in some places a continuing bias of one kind or another in recruitment procedures and without doubt, there are still various forms of discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, recognition of discrimination is widespread throughout this Parliament and throughout the community. The legislation that I now propose is a practical and responsible way to reduce the disadvantages acknowledged in the Prime Minister's speech. I must make it clear that legislation will not eliminate all forms of discrimination against women. The effect of social prejudice against women will not be totally and immediately addressed by this legislation. However legislation is the function of this Parliament; it is a part of the achievement of social change, a necessary, if not sufficient, part. </PARA>
<PARA> The experience in those States where similar legislation operates has demonstrated beyond doubt that such legislation creates opportunities for women which did not previously exist and that this in turn breaks down community prejudice against women. </PARA>
<PARA> In Victoria, for example, the annual report of the Victorian Commissioner for Equal Opportunity, for the year ending 30 June 1980, shows that a total of 164 matters were referred to the Commission. Eighty-two per cent of these complaints were from women and the vast majority were on the grounds of sex discrimination rather than marital status. Complaints of discrimination in employment dominated, making up 72 per cent of all complaints. Of the 164 matters referred to the Commission in 1979-80, 46 per cent resulted in a conciliated settlement, in 38 per cent of cases there had been no negotiated change at the time of the report, 13 per cent of cases were in progress and 2 per cent had been withdrawn. </PARA>
<PARA> In South Australia the annual report of the South Australian office of the Commissioner for Equal Opportunity for the year ending 30 June 1980 shows that a total of 189 formal complaints of discrimination on the grounds of sex and marital status were received. Of these 79 per cent were received from women and 21 per cent were received from men. Complaints concerned with discrimination in employment comprised 60 per cent of total complaints received. A further 30 per cent of complaints received concerned the provision of goods and services, access to public places, services of public bodies, clubs, credit, banking and insurance. Of the 189 complaints received in 1979-80, 47 per cent were settled by conciliation, 12 per cent were withdrawn, 19 per cent were found to have no basis or found to be outside the jurisdiction of the Commissioner and a further 22 per cent had been redirected or were in progress at the time of the report. </PARA>
<PARA> In New South Wales the report of the New South Wales Anti Discrimination Board for the year ending 30 June 1980 shows that the New South Wales Counsellor for Equal Opportunity received 285 complaints of discrimination on the grounds of sex or marital status. Eighty per cent of complaints received were from women, 20 per cent from men. Fifty per cent of complaints concerned discrimination in employment. Of the 285 complaints received in New South Wales in 1979-80, 32 per cent were resolved through conciliation; 4 per cent were referred to the Anti Discrimination Board for inquiry; 18 per cent were not proceeded with; 5 per cent were not substantiated or were referred elsewhere; and 41 per cent were still under investigation as at 30 June 1980. In making a general comment on the operation of sex discrimination legislation in these three States I note that approximately 20 per cent of complaints came from men, demonstrating that the legislation extends the rights of men as well as women, and that a large percentage of complaints were resolved by conciliation. It appears then that legislation discourages discrimination and provides an effective remedy where discrimination occurs. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to a brief description of the Bill. The constitutional basis of the Bill is twofold: First is the International Convention on the Elimination of all Forms of Discrimination Against Women, which was signed by the Australian Government in Copenhagen in 1980. The Convention came into force on 3 September 1981 after ratification by 20 countries of which Australia was not one. A second constitutional power resides in section 51 of the Constitution and this power is set out in clause 4 (2). The Bill is in six parts. Part I sets out the objectives and extent of the Bill. Part II defines discrimination and sets out the areas where discrimination becomes illegal. This area includes all Commonwealth employment and employment in the private sector where there is constitutional power. The basic format of Part II follows the New South Wales, Victorian and South Australian Acts on sex and marital status discrimination. These Acts have been followed because they have been shown to be adequate for the establishment of an individual's rights and remedies in this area. An additional reason for following the pattern established by the States is to develop a similarity of jurisdiction and to create legal mechanisms which are readily understood by the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The provision concerning clubs in clause 22 is based on a similar one in New South Wales. The purpose of this provision is to ensure that in many important social situations women are not denied access to facilities. In many country towns as well as in many of our suburbs registered clubs provide the only recreation facilities in the community. Women should not be excluded from full access to these facilities. Clause 24 makes it unlawful to advertise an intention to breach the act, for example, by advertising for 'men only' and 'salesman wanted'. This provision is essential to break down sex segregation of the work force. There are exceptions to Part II in clauses 28 and 29 covering superannuation funds and insurance policies. </PARA>
<PARA> Part III sets up an enforcement mechanism for Part II. It provides for investigation and conciliation of complaints by a Director of Conciliation. This mechanism is based on the enforcement mechanisms under the State Acts. Where a matter cannot be resolved satisfactorily by the Director of Conciliation, the Director shall refer the matter for investigation by the Human Rights Commission. The Commission is given powers to operate effectively in this area, that is$ it has been given powers to call witnesses and demand documents. It will have the enforcement powers of penalties up to $5,000. The Commission may make a determination which may direct the re-employment or promotion of a complainant or that the respondent should pay damages. </PARA>
<PARA> Part IV of the Bill provides for affirmative action in public and private employment. It is important to include constructive provisions in this Bill. It is not enough simply to render certain forms of discrimination illegal, without taking positive steps to provide for equal employment opportunity for women. While individual complaint-based mechanisms are essential as a recognition of rights and remedies for individuals they will have only a limited effect on the breakdown of sex segregation in this society, in the work force and in access to goods and services. Numerous studies have shown that there is still a large amount of structural discrimination. This can be eliminated only by positive action; the establishment of affirmative action plans for both the public and private sector. These provisions are based on New South Wales provisions relating to public sector employment and have been formulated with the United States of America experience in mind. It should be noted here that the requirements are in terms of goals and targets and not in terms of quotas. Quotas can create artificial opportunities which can be counterproductive to the cause of equality. On the other hand provisions for goals of eliminating discrimination based on sex and marital status and targets for the achievement of equal opportunity in employment for women can be pursued in a method that is fair and just to all and enables the promotion of women at a realistic rate. </PARA>
<PARA> The inclusion of private corporations in the provision for affirmative action plans will ensure that large scale employers in the construction industry, manufacturing, wholesale and retail trades, finance, property and business, will be covered. Small enterprises are not included as they are not suitable for the introduction of such plans. I stress that it is certainly not the intention of this legislation to create difficulties for small business. Similarly the obligation to develop an affirmative action plan is imposed on any firm which has entered into any contract with the Commonwealth Government for the supply of goods or services exceeding the value of $50,000. Part V sets out the administrative provisions for the directors of conciliation and affirmative action and the Human Rights Commission. Part VI gives the Human Rights Commission power to conduct research and community education progams relating to the objectives of this Bill. It also includes provisions for exemptions and exclusions from the Act. It is important to point out that these provisions are included because it is not the intention to create unworkable situations or to introduce anomalies. </PARA>
<PARA> This is a very brief description of the Bill, a more detailed description is contained in the explanatory memorandum which accompanies it. From this brief description it can be seen that the aim of the legislation is to cover major areas of employment and the provision of goods and services in the areas where Commonwealth powers apply. It deals with the significant forms of discrimination based on sex and marital status; it does not attempt to cover every possible form of discrimination nor does it attempt to regulate all employment or all provision of services. It is a realistic and sensible use of Federal powers. The particular stimulus to my introducing this Bill at this stage was the decision by the Australian Government to sign the international convention eliminating all forms of discrimination against women. It ought to have been the case that the Government itself introduced this legislation. Had it done so it would surely have had the support of the Opposition. In the absence of Federal Government action in this sphere, I am not prepared to allow Australian women to go without the protection which can so readily be provided. </PARA>
<PARA> Although I introduced this Bill as a private member, its objectives accord with the tradition of Labor governments legislating to strengthen human rights. It is a natural development from those policies and programs of the Whitlam Government which advanced the status of women and it extends human rights in a manner similar to the manner in which the Whitlam Government's Racial Discrimination Act 1975 used the Commonwealth's constitutional power to make discrimination on the basis of race illegal. It is interesting to note that the Fraser Government is now defending the Racial Discrimination Act against a challenge by the Queensland Government. I hope that the sex discrimination Bill will gain similar bipartisan support. </PARA>
<PARA> I put forward the Bill at this stage of the parliamentary session for particular reasons. The Bill is lengthy and complex. I acknowledge that it raises constitutional issues of some substance. By including the conciliation and affirmative action machinery I have added to the complexity of the Bill. However, I judged that it was important to be positive and to lay out in some detail the way in which the objectives of the Bill should be implemented. Because the Bill is so detailed and complex in its provisions it is necessary that honourable senators and the community in general have adequate time to consider it before proceeding to a vote. Therefore, I lay the Bill before the Senate this evening but do not intend to seek leave to proceed with the second reading debate until some months have elapsed. </PARA>
<PARA> I acknowledge also that, because of the extent and complexity of the provisions, honourable senators may wish to move amendments in the Committee stage. In the spirit of bipartisanship which I hope will inform the consideration of this legislation I will welcome any suggested improvements or clarifications of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion I remind honourable senators, particularly those who are always concerned to protect the rights and responsibilities of State governments against the intrusion of Commonwealth powers, that only Commonwealth legislation can deal with the area of Commonwealth employment, only Commonwealth legislation can deal with the employment practices of corporations and the major deliverers of goods and services in our community. There is no more effective way of dealing with these major areas of discrimination than Federal legislation. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take advantage of the opportunity presented by the first reading of these money Bills to draw attention to the way in which the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union has been a fabulously rich legal aid gold mine for Mr Frank Galbally and his Melbourne firm of solicitors, Galbally and O'Bryan. Information provided by the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) in his answer today to my Question on Notice No. 956 reveals that, under an agreement reached with the Commonwealth in November 1980, the firm of Galbally and O'Bryan was paid a total of $172,930 between 1 October 1980 and 16 July 1981 for legal representation of the union before the Royal Commissaon. The major components of this sum were, in round figures, $96,000 at $800 a day, for 120 sitting days of the Royal Commission; $62,400, at $800 a day, for 78 non-sitting days of the Commission; an additional $8,400, at $600 a day, for 14 sitting days on which Mr Frank Galbally himself appeared on behalf of the union; and approximately $6,000 for interstate hearings, at $100 a day, and for air fares to and from such hearings. It is nice work if you can get it!</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When certain questions arose demanding the appearance of Mr Galbally and members of his firm as witnesses before the Commission and the union, as a result, had to be represented by other lawyers, payments by the Commonwealth were still made through Galbally and O'Bryan until the Commission finally denied that firm, Galbally and O'Bryan, leave to appear further on 16 July 1981. Although the Attorney refused to answer this part of the question, I understand that the fees paid by Galbally and O'Bryan to its sub-contractors, as it were, were significantly lower than the fees being received by that firm for the very same services. I believe that the barrister who conducted most of the case for the union from May 1981 to 16 July 1981 received only around $300 a day and that a similar sum was paid to the acting solicitor, leaving some significant balance retained by Galbally and O'Bryan. </PARA>
<PARA> The whole affair has all the appearance of a disgraceful rip-off. Discredit is reflected not only upon Mr Galbally and his firm but also upon the Government for allowing itself to be persuaded to agree to such extraordinarily generous terms. In these days of recurrent legal aid shortages, sweetheart deals of this kind, negotiated behind closed doors, are simply unacceptable. While needy litigants are repeatedly unable to get legal aid, it is intolerable that the Galbally and O'Bryan nest should be feathered at the rate of $800 a day, especially when the rate is the same for non-sitting days as for sitting days. </PARA>
<PARA> The right of the union to be represented before the Royal Commission is not in issue. What is objectionable though is the inequality of access to legal aid when persuasive and influential lawyers can attract a large slice of the legal aid cake for a single case and in so doing impoverish the legal aid fund for the great majority who lack that political clout. If the legal aid dollar is to be efficiently and equitably used, legal aid must be provided increasingly through salaried practitioners. That will enable far more people to receive assistance and will prevent insider trading of the kind graphically illustrated by this case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to deal very quickly with a matter that I regard as purely a Senate matter. Over the last couple of days the Senate has been sitting at different hours from those it usually sits. Except for some of the people who work in the printing area and maybe one or two other areas, the matters that are important for keeping the Senate running have been able to be organised. It is my feeling that it is time the Government looked once again at this matter of the sitting hours of the Senate. Admittedly it is a matter that affects the Senate and could well be decided by the Senate at its leisure; and it certainly is using its leisure to do it. But I admit that there are certain matters that any government would need to take into account when it looked at sitting hours.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I just hope that some arrangements can be organised to enable the Government and the Opposition to look at the matters they have to look at whilst the Senate is running. I believe it is a waste of money to keep the Senate running the way it does. I believe that is an historical fact. In the beginning-I do not want to sound biblical-when the Senate started early in the century many of the people who came to Parliament were only part time politicians. Now I do not think anyone has any time to do anything other than what they have to do in this place. From a personal point of view, I find it is reasonably tiring having to be here from early in the morning until quite late at night. </PARA>
<PARA> For many of the people who work in this building I believe the hours present a health risk which they should not necessarily be asked to carry. They are certainly bad for the staff who work in every area. They are bad for the people who have to drive parliamentarians and others to and from work. They are bad for those who work in the offices and who have to work for an hour or so after we go home late at night. As I have said, they are bad for the printing people who have to have Hansard and things of that nature ready for us when we get here each day. In every respect the sitting hours that are now a habit in the Senate and really in this Parliament are something that I believe we should change experimentally. If we cannot make the decision to change them in a definite way let us change them experimentally. </PARA>
<PARA> No one else I know who works in any sensible business activity around this country works the hours that the Senate does. When I tell people outside this place the hours that I spend inside this building very few of them believe me, but if they do they reckon I am crazy. I think we are all crazy to put up with the hours under which we have been operating over the last few years&amp; I know there are some people who would say that it is bad for staff if they lose their overtime. I think it is time we paid our staff well enough so that they do not need to work the hours of overtime they are working. </PARA>
<PARA> If some of those who now work late into the night need the overtime they could well be doing what they need to do before we get here. They could start early and they could have the benefits of daylight saving that we in Tasmania know so well. </PARA>
<PARA> Do not think for a moment that I am trying to limit the income of the people who work here. Not for a moment am I trying to do that. I am trying to get back to a sense of reality that some of the doctors in this place have spoken about and some other people have spoken about when they were not Ministers. Since I have been here thank goodness I have not had the misfortune of seeing anybody die within this chamber. But I was reading an article last night that gave an account of some of the things that do happen. I have seen people from this chamber die, but not within the chamber. I would have thought that when Senator Chipp had the heart attack he had just a few months ago we might have seen some action on this matter. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not necessarily-from the Government. As I have said, this is not a government matter. Perhaps that needs emphasis. This is a Senate matter. It is time the Senate decided what it is going to do about it, at least for a trial period. When former Senator Murphy, to whom I was talking last night, was here we saw some attempt to change the hours. I do not believe the amount of time the experiment was carried on was long enough. As regard what should happen, after the way in which the Senate has been sitting over the last few days, I believe all the staff in this place should have off completely the day after the Parliament rises. I know that sometimes when I go back to Tasmania I am tired out from the week's work. I have the ability perhaps to sleep on an aircraft and to have an hour's sleep in the afternoon on a Friday. I have no hesitation of saying that because I know how tired one can get in this place. We have to remember again that the staff are here for longer hours than we are. It is time we thought about the hundreds of people who work in support of this place.</PARA></TALK.START>

I think it is high time that the people who now control the numbers in the Senate recognised the facts. They should have the courage to do the things that they think should be done.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak briefly on two matters. Firstly, the Liberal Party of Western Australia, for reasons both realistic and devious, has decided to put the skids under the honourable member for O'Connor, Mr Tuckey. He is to be replaced as the member for O'Connor by a sitting State Liberal member of the Legislative Assembly whose vacated seat will then be taken over by the leader of the rump, known as the National Country Party, Mr Old, whose seat was abolished in the recent redistribution which is the subject of court challenge, the ultimate outcome of which is uncertain.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second matter I wish to raise concerns a question asked by Senator Bolkus of Senator Carrick today which was in four parts. He asked whether the former head of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs, Mr Besley, resigned one morning and was physically and permanently out of his office and the Department by 5 o'clock that afternoon; whether it was announced the next day that he was to be appointed managing director of Monier Ltd; whether he is still on leave from the Department; and whether the Public Service guidelines on the private employment of retired senior public servants had been observed. Normally, when a question such as that is asked without notice-no notice was given-one would not expect Senator Carrick to be able to give a detailed or definitive answer. In this case he did. He was obviously prepared for the question and gave a very carefully prepared reply which raises two questions. The reply, by the way, to paraphrase it was: Yes, Mr Besley did resign one morning and was physically out of his office for good that afternoon; it was announced that he was to be managing director of Monier Ltd; he is still on leave; and the Public Service guidelines had been observed. </PARA>
<PARA> This raises queries about the extraordinary speed with which Public Service Board approval was secured. There was, obviously, a strenuous endeavour to facilitate Mr Besley's sudden retirement from the Public Service. Indeed, one might say, there was even indecent haste in the Public Service Board approving his taking the position with Monier while he was, and still is almost two months later, on the public payroll. Well sourced information which has been given to me reveals that Mr Besley was the subject of an Australian Federal Police inquiry and report. I do not care at this stage to go into the reasons for his having been subjected to that Federal Police inquiry and report. I just observe that there was obvious collusion between the Public Service Board and the Government-no doubt on the direction of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser)-to pre-empt any further action which may have arisen from that Federal Police report by removing Mr Besley from the scene of his peccadillos. </PARA>
<PARA> The final observation I make is that Mr Besley is a protege of the Prime Minister. A former protege of the Prime Minister, Keith Compton Gale, is currently doing 13 years in Long Bay gaol for fraud and other charges. Another protege of the Prime Minister has, to say the least, fallen from grace. This leads one to speculate whether it is an unfortunate coincidence that prime ministerial proteges are the sorts of people they are or whether the Prime Minister actually selects such people. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When speaking to the motion for the first reading of these fisheries Bills one can probably talk about anything but my contribution tonight will relate to fishing. I refer to the lack of control over fishing by the Fisheries Division of the Commonwealth Department of Primary Industry. That Division is so disorganised that it is contributing to the complete destruction of our fisheries in Australia. On the whole Australia is a very barren country. Any barren country does not have very large fish supplies in surrounding waters. We could have a very viable fishing industry if it were properly managed and controlled. Unfortunately, that is not so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I raise the question of prawn fishing in South Australia. For many years South Australia did not believe that prawns were present in that area. It was always considered that the region was far too cold to support a prawn industry. As a result of an investigation in the St Vincent Gulf in 1969 we found that we could have a sizeable prawn industry if it were managed correctly and very delicately. After a lot of investigation it was found that in South Australia, because of colder waters, prawns took something like between four years and five years to develop. That is quite different from the situation which applies in the northern regions of Australia where prawns can develop into fully grown species in a period of between 12 months and 14 months. It was always felt that mangrove swamps were essential for prawns to breed and multiply. But we have very few mangrove swamps in South Australia and it was found that prawns breed and shelter in weeds. In 1969 South Australia started a prawn industry. Several boats were registered to fish. Over a period a total of 14 boats have entered the industry. For a number of years the fishermen found that this was a very profitable enterprise. They said to the South Australian Government that they would voluntarily place restrictions on a large section of the Gulf as there were a lot of small prawns in the area. The fishermen decided that they would not fish in waters of a depth below five fathoms. For 11 weeks during each winter, they completely stopped fishing. They only fished the large prawns in the centre of the Gulf. They never fished the Investigator Strait Area. It was always recognised that this was a hatchery area where small prawns bred in weeds. Eventually, as they grew, they moved up into the centre of the Gulf. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1977, there was a dispute between the South Australian Government and the Commonwealth Government over who controlled the waters in Investigator Strait. After court action it was decided that the Commonwealth controlled those waters. From that point the Commonwealth Government registered boats to fish prawns in Investigator Strait. Fishermen who were fishing in St Vincent Gulf warned the Government that fishing this area would upset the whole of the industry-but the Commonwealth Government still registered fishing boats. Originally it registered eight boats in that area. As a result of that Commonwealth action, the prawn fishing industry is being completely destroyed. Despite all the warnings that have been given, the Commonwealth Government refuses to withdraw the licences of those fishing boats. Only four of the original eight boats remain in the area. They are still fishing the very small prawns and are destroying the whole of the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The fishermen who are registered by the State Government each pay a fee of $2,000 a year. The boats registered by the Commonwealth each pay a fee of $50. There is no control of this Commonwealth area. There is nothing to stop over-fishing. These people fish for the whole of the 12 months. There is no attempt to keep the industry viable. I repeat that these fishermen have completely fished out the whole area. </PARA>
<PARA> To illustrate this matter further, I refer to an area of Venus Bay on the west coast where, despite many approaches by the South Australian Department of Fisheries, Commonwealth fishing authorities would not co-operate in its management policy. In the three years from 1976 to 1979, the average catch dropped from 239 tonnes to 16 tonnes a year simply because the area was not managed. The Commonwealth went into that area, imposed no restrictions, and allowed the wholesale slaughter of the fishing industry. If the Commonwealth Government does not withdraw the licences of the boats that it has registered in Investigator Strait, that prawning industry will never recover. I believe that it is absolutely ludicrous to allow such a situation to occur. I said earlier that the 14 fishermen who were registered by the South Australian Fishing Department earned a very good living from this area but, because of interference from the Commonwealth Government, the whole of that industry will be destroyed. Because South Australian prawns are in colder water they take longer to mature and any interference with the small prawns has major effects on the whole of the Gulf area. There have been rumours of what happened and why the Commonwealth Government will not withdraw those licences. Mr Buick from Kangaroo Island has been registered under the Fisheries Division of the Commonwealth Department of Primary Industry. He stated in front of other fishermen that during election time he put his hand in his pocket for the Liberal Party and that if his licence were withdrawn he would raise the very devil. At least 20 people can verify that statement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is true, he did authorise advertisements in newspapers. They were not supporters of the Labor Party at the meeting either. The majority of fishermen do not support the Labor Party. Some do and some do not. I think the Commonwealth Government should look at what it is doing. I think that this situation provides a case for political parties to be funded from the public purse. Mr Buick said that if he loses his licence he will make certain statements. I was not present when he said that and I cannot verify it. I was just informed on the matter. Any fisherman in the region will require an income of about $150,000 a year for prawn fishing to be a viable proposition. Fishermen in the Gulf are now earning about $90,000 a year and this figure is still dropping. As I said the whole industry is being destroyed and there is no need for this. There should be complete co-operation between State and Federal governments in this field.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn to tuna fishing. Recently the Commonwealth Government allowed licences to be issued for tuna fishing to all-comers. By issuing those licences the Government will in turn destroy that industry as well. Fishermen tell me that the Heinz company demanded that this be done. It wanted more fish and it did not care about the preservation of the industry. Some people in the Fisheries Division of the Department of Primary Industry have a lot to answer for. We have not exploited the industry for the benefit of Australians. We have protected primary industries and I agree with that policy. I believe that the fishing industry should be protected, as should any primary industry. Insufficient help is being given to fishermen. It is very difficult for them to procure finance to build boats and to develop the fishing industry. They get very little help. They pay very high interest rates on borrowed money in order to build boats. I think this Government, or any Federal government, should look seriously at not just one aspect of the fishing industry but the whole of it. I believe that a viable fishing industry in Australia can be achieved. There are a lot of difficulties with it, but it can be achieved if it is properly managed, and I think that is the way to go about it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; This morning I received a reply from the President to a question I asked. I would like to read that reply because it outlines what my question was and sets the scene for the remainder of what I want to say this evening. The reply stated as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 18 November 1981, Senator Colston asked me whether the 1982 diaries supplied to honourable senators were printed in Hong Kong. I am informed that the 1982 Senate Diary is a standard item (Model 72PA) supplied by an Australian company based in Sydney. The diaries for 1981 and 1982 were manufactured in Hong Kong to that company's specifications. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1978, the Department of the Senate has purchased desk diaries from a Canberra firm, which selects an Australian company to supply the diaries on the basis of the lowest available price. The Canberra firm arranges with a local manufacturer for the hot foil stamping of the Australian crest and the word 'Senate' on the front cover of the diary. It is understood that the recommended retail price (which includes sales tax of 17 1/2%) is $6.80 and that the recommended retail price of a similar diary made in Australia is approximately $15.00. The cost of each 1982 Senate diary is $5.85. </PARA>
<PARA> Inquiries will continue to be made of other Australian companies to ascertain whether a similar diary made in Australia can be puchased at a price comparable with that of the present Senate diary. </PARA>
<PARA>When I originally asked the question, I was referring to the small diary with which we were issued-E3P. When I received the answer to my question I was surprised to find that the larger diary with which we were issued was in fact made in Hong Kong. I would be interested to find out at some subsequent stage whether the small one with which we have been issued was also made in Hong Kong. As it was produced by the same company, I presume it was. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to raise the protection-free trade argument which is often before the Parliament. In fact, I have never raised it myself in the Parliament and I do not intend to do so tonight. But surely Australian printers would expect that the Australian Senate would purchase an Australian product. In my opinion, it is an absolute disgrace for the Australian Senate to distribute diaries to honourable senators when those diaries have been made in Hong Kong. I suggest that next year a firm price be obtained for a diary which has been printed in Australia. In that way honourable senators will be able to determine what savings, if any, have been made by actually purchasing a diary which was produced in Hong Kong. I believe that we will be able to obtain a firm indication because this year we were told that the approximate price for a diary printed in Australia was $15. If we obtain a firm price we will know what, if anything, we are saving. Whilst I acknowledge that much Australian printing goes to Hong Kong, I consider that an Australian Senate which does not insist that its diaries are printed in Australia looks ridiculous. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking at the first reading stage of these four fishing Bills, my colleague, Senator Elstob, said that he would be dealing specifically with fishing. I will deal with a person who for a short time has engaged in a bit of dirty fishing-in fact, filthy fishing. On 17 November, during the debate on the vote for the Department of Aboriginal Affairs under the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1981-82, I told the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Senator Baume, about this matter I wanted to raise but that I could not develop at that time. I said I was given to understand over the telephone that a most unwarranted attack was made on me last week by Mr Lewis, the member for Mallee in the State House, because of my action in trying to assist the Ralkon Agricultural Co Pty Ltd at Meningie. I told the Minister that as soon as I got a copy of the Hansard report I would refer to this matter in the Parliament and would say a few things about Mr Lewis which he might not appreciate. I said Mr Lewis would get a shock when I mentioned them. I went on to say that Mr Lewis was just a babe in the woods so far as this matter was concerned. He was a newcomer to the problem, he had been in Parliament for only two years and he was one of those Johnny-come-latelys who put themselves up as instant experts. In the meantime I have been able to obtain not only a copy of one Hansard report but also of another in which this person is pursuing a vendetta against the manager of the Ralkon Agricultural Co. who has been rightfully and properly elected by Aboriginal people. Before I get on to that, I want to make some comment on the remarks made by Mr Lewis on 10 November in the State Legislative Assembly in South Australia. I remind the Senate that Mr Lewis is the Liberal member for the seat of Mallee. Mr Lewis said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . I intend to pursue a question that will take me more than one opportunity to debate to the fullest degree. It is a question of great importance to a significant community within my electorate. The community to which I refer, in the vicinity of Meningie, has difficulties. We need to bring down the curtain and obtain a satisfactory conclusion to a sorry saga and a running sore, largely caused by one man's self-righteous ambition and awful duplicity. This man has given misleading advice to a community, either as a result of his own ignorance of the truth and the law or as a result of his own determination to gain control of very valuable real estate and control of a large number of people's lives, or else it is a combination of both those motives. </PARA>
<PARA>On 17 November I said to Senator Baume that if Mr Lewis was prepared to utter those remarks outside the Parliament, away from its protection, he would need a very large bank account. They are only a few of the accusations that this person has made. He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Either way, he likes to exercise this power and seeks to discredit and destroy anyone or anything that threatens this position. Certainly he has always succeeded in getting a platform to publicly abuse anyone who sought the truth and sought to serve the best interests of this community. He has continued to attack them until they are silenced either by fear or are removed from influence in that situation. He has succeeded in seducing, or, if one likes, conning ALP members in the same way, notably Senator McLaren. </PARA>
<PARA>I have taken the trouble to consult the Concise Oxford Dictionary. It refers to a person who has been conned, who has been persuaded or who has taken part in a swindle, or things to that effect. Further on-this concerned me greatly-when we come to the explanation of seduction and the word 'seduce' we find that he has claimed that I have been led astray, I have been tempted into sin or crime, I have been corrupted, I have been persuaded as a person into an abandonment of principles, I have even lost my chastity or my allegiance and have been persuaded by tempting or attractiveness. I do not think that I am guilty of having fallen into any of those errors in my life. I have always endeavoured to be a law abiding citizen and since my election to this Parliament I have endeavoured to do the best that I can in the interests of people who I think need protection, guidance or help. I have always endeavoured to do that. Yet here we have a man saying these things about the manager of the Ralkon company, in the first instance, and then claiming that I have been seduced or conned. In the Hansard record the Minister for Agriculture, Mr Chapman, is reported to have interjected: 'Seducing them?' Mr Lewis then said:</PARA>
<PARA> In intellectual terms that is just about what one would call it, although I must say that Senator McLaren was obviously willing in the belief that he could make political mileage of it, which I think was regrettable and unfortunate. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that Senator Chaney, who is in charge of the House tonight and who has held the portfolio of Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, will agree that any person who takes up a cause for Aboriginal people certainly cannot make any political mileage out of it. You do it out of the goodness of your heart and, in most cases, come in for very severe criticism. In regard to political mileage the speedo is wound back, not forwards. I regret that many members of this Parliament are like Mr Lewis who, whilst they espouse wonderful things for, and have very kind thoughts concerning, Aboriginals are not prepared when the crunch comes to do anything about the issue. They hide under a bushel and keep away from it. I have not been prepared to do that. I took up the case for the Ralkon people-the Aboriginal people came to me in the first instance, not the white manager- in the Parliament many years ago. I have not gained any political mileage out of it. In some instances I have gained a lot of abuse. In others I have been held up to ridicule-unfortunately by some members of my own party who, like Lewis, are Johnny-come-latelys and do not understand the problem but set themselves up as instant experts. As I proceed with my speech I will say something of what I endeavoured to do for those Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Lewis went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to Mr Ian Hillock-</PARA>
<PARA> That is the person he was talking about, but when one reads the speech one realises that members of the South Australian Parliament thought he was talking about me until Mr McRae interjected: 'Who are you talking about, for Heaven's sake?' Lewis said:</PARA>
<PARA> I refer to Mr Hillock and to the mess that he has made of the Point McLeay people, its prosperity, and the proprietary agricultural company limited that they set up years ago to run their farming business. </PARA>
<PARA> Because the hour is late, I will not read the whole transcript into Hansard. The time will come when we will have more respectable hour to debate this whole matter. However, I want to enlighten the Senate as to some of the qualities of Mr Lewis. I have a transcript of a television program, the film on which is in the library for those who are interested to check, and particularly those who might be interested in the problems being suffered by these people at Ralkon. The transcript is of the program State Affair of ADS Channel 7 in Adelaide, on 6 April 1981. Interviewed were Spencer Rigney, the Chairman of Ralkon Agricultural Co. Pty Ltd, Mrs Val Berry, the spouse of the returning officer for the election of the 1981 Point McLeay community council and Mrs Leta Padman of Narrung. I will not quote all of the interview because it is in the library for people to have a look at. However, I will quote the pertinent part. The reporter asked:</PARA>
<PARA> But certain outside influences want to control the council and thus the farm. Just before the election, a smear campaign against Ralkon was slowly leaked to the press. Point McLeay Aboriginals say it was done by outside bureaucrats. </PARA>
<PARA>I have claimed that here on many occasions-</PARA>
<PARA> There are also substantial allegations of social, legal and political pressure brought to bear on the returning officer for the election as his wife explains. </PARA>
<PARA> Then Mrs Berry, the wife of the returning officer, replied. I might add that Mr Berry was not only the returning officer elected by the then council for its elections but also was appointed by the State Electoral Officer and the Federal Electoral Officer to act as returning officer for State and Federal elections. In answer to the reporter, Mrs Berry said:</PARA>
<PARA> There were several suggestions that he should resign-</PARA>
<PARA>She is referring to her husband-</PARA>
<PARA>from different people but one was from the Member for Mallee who visited us on the Friday, the day on which the nominations closed, and suggested that John should resign that it would be for the benefit of the people of Point McLeay, that everything should be thrashed out before the actual election took place, that it really would be for John's own benefit too, if he did resign. </PARA>
<PARA>The reporter then said:</PARA>
<PARA> It sounds a bit more than a logical reason, it sounds almost like a vague threat. </PARA>
<PARA>The transcript indicates that Mrs Hammond replied. However, it was Mrs Berry. She said</PARA>
<PARA> Well, it could be taken as that. We couldn't see any logical reason because we were of the belief that the election should go on before things could be straightened out. It has been promised that Senator Baume is to come over and look into the situation once the elections are over and therefore we felt that this was probably the best way. There was so much ill feeling in the air too, until the elections were over but I think it's better that that is over. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was Mrs Berry. The transcript shows that this was said by Mrs Hammond. I have seen the film and I can assure the Minister that it was Mrs Berry. What she was saying in answer to the reporter is that Mr Lewis, who stands up in the State Parliament and accuses me of being conned and being seduced by Mr Hillock, and who accuses Mr Hillock of all sorts of unlawful things, is the person who went there and threatened the returning officer with all sorts of reprisals if he did not call off the election. Of course$ we know what happened after that. I have spoken in the Senate about it. Pressure was brought to bear and a writ was taken out in the Supreme Court. Six of the people who for many years had been living a few miles away from the settlement on the property known as Ralkon, Bartlett's farm, were struck off the roll and were unable to take part in the election. Of course, a couple of those people were candidates and could not take part in the election. But shortly after the election a decision was made by the council that those same people were to be restored to the roll. It was decided that anyone living within five miles of the settlement was entitled to vote and to stand for election to that council.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Lewis said that this is a sorry saga. They were about the only truthful words that he used. I have been raising this saga in this Parliament for years. I have been trying to get a public inquiry into the problem and I will refer to that matter shortly. However, I want to proceed in proper chronological order so that my speech will not be distorted. I have a letter from the Commonwealth Ombudsman, Professor J. E. Richardson, dated 6 May 1980 which gives the lie to what some people in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs are saying. Documents have been hawked around the country which people have claimed are copies of the final report of the Ombudsman. The letter dated 6 May 1980 states:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator McLaren,</PARA>
<PARA> I am writing to you about your criticism appearing in Senate Hansard of 22 April 1980, of the handling by my office of a complaint from Ralkon Agricultural Company Pty. Ltd., of South Australia. Your particular criticism was that although almost two years had elapsed since my office received Ralkon's complaint I had not made a report to the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare. </PARA>
<PARA> On 21 July 1978, the Senate Committee advised Ralkon to approach the Commonwealth Ombudsman. Ralkon accepted this advice, my office receiving its complaint on 4 August 1978. The complaint was formally investigated and by letter of 25 October 1978 one of my deputy Ombudsmen informed Ralkon of the results of the investigation and offered to hold discussions with Ralkon should Ralkon disagree with the tentative conclusions reached. </PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise the Professor's words 'the tentative conclusions'. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Ralkon wrote to the Deputy Ombudsman on 31 October 1978 indicating disagreement with the conclusions. The Deputy Ombudsman met with Ralkon's directors at Narrung, South Australia on 6 November 1978, and the Manager of Ralkon agreed to provide taped comments which outlined Ralkon's objections. My office received the first tape on 18 December 1978 and following further correspondence with Ralkon we received the second tape on 9 May 1979. </PARA>
<PARA> It was not until last month, however, that my office completed its reconsideration of the complaint in the light of analyses of the tapes. Whilst I believe we acted expeditiously in our initial investigation leading to the communication of tentative conclusions to Ralkon it should not have taken nearly so long to pursue the complaint to completion. Since its inception my office has worked under considerable pressure in coping with the large volume of complaints we receive and at times we have simply lacked the resources to complete our tasks expeditiously. Notwithstanding, the principle cause of delay in the Ralkon complaint was an administrative failure which should not have occurred and for which I accept responsibility. It is important that complainants generally should have confidence in my office and revised operating procedures which I introduced last March will, I hope, ensure that such cases will not recur. </PARA>
<PARA> I should offer a comment on your criticism of my office's failure to report to the Standing Committee on Social Welfare. In March this year my Deputy Ombudsman explained to the Secretary of the Committee that the Ombudsman was not at liberty to make a report to the Committee. The Ombudsman Act confines the Ombudsman to reporting to the responsible department or authority and its Minister and sending particulars of the results of the investigation to the complainant. Had Ralkon not withdrawn its complaint it would have received last March the results of the investigation and it then would have been open to it to advise the Committee of them. </PARA>
<PARA> I am taking the liberty of sending a copy of this letter to the Chairman of the Committee, Senator Baume. </PARA>
<PARA> Yours sincerely,</PARA>
<PARA> (J. E. Richardson)</PARA>
<PARA> Ombudsman</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that correspondence went to Senator Baume in May of last year. On 2 March this year the Ombudsman wrote to me again. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> On 19 January 1981 I wrote to the Chairman of the Ralkon Agricultural Company Pty Ltd following conversations between you and this office and Mr Bob Randall and myself. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Bob Randall is a State Liberal member in South Australia. The letter continued:</PARA>
<PARA> My letter to Ralkon contained the following. </PARA>
<PARA> I sought from the Secretary comments on the apparently unauthorised circulation-</PARA>
<PARA>I emphasise the words 'unauthorised circulation'-</PARA>
<PARA>of Mr Crotty's letter of October 1978 addressed to Mr Koolmatrie. The Secretary's response, not unexepectedly, is to the effect that he is unable to ascertain whether the copying and circulation of the letter took place within his department. He has provided details of the enquiries he made which show that the relevant files are recorded as having been in storage for many months previous to our inquiry, and there is no further information which would enable him to speculate fruitfully on how the document came to be circulated. </PARA>
<PARA> I can understand your company's concern at the circulation so long after the event of a letter which contained only the preliminary views of this office in relation to your complaint, but I have to say that if, as seems possible, people with interests opposed to the company are responsible, the likelihood of action by this office being successful in preventing the activity is small. I should, therefore, be interested to have your reaction to another possible course, which while it will not guarantee that the document ceases to be circulated, may go some way towards nullifying its effect. Should you wish it, I would be prepared to furnish you with a statement to the effect that the letter in question, dated 25 October 1978, represented preliminary conclusions only by this office, and that those conclusions and the evidence upon which they were based were contested by your company. It would be open to you to use such a statement to counter the effects of the circulation of the document. Beyond that, however, I find it difficult to perceive any other solution which could be of much assistance to you. </PARA>
<PARA> I have not heard further from the Company but if I do, of course, I will, if requested, provide the statement. </PARA>
<PARA>The same Mr Lewis is referring in the State Parliament in South Australia to that preliminary finding as the Obudsman's final report. Again, not only is he misleading the Parliament but also he is creating a mass of mischief among the people of South Australia who are being conned-I use that word now-by some of the bureaucrats in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. That is not the first time that I have made a statement to that effect in this chamber. That is why I have been calling repeatedly in the Senate for a Senate inquiry to be set up. It was only recently-in June this year-that I sought to have a Senate select committee inquiring into the matter and got the brush off. Some members of this Parliament are not concerned about the problems of some of these people. I am concerned, and I will pursue this matter until my last day in this Senate to see that some justice is done and we establish this inquiry to find out who the culprits are. I have a further letter dated 31 March of this year from Mr W. J. Blick, the Principal Investigation Officer from the Ombudsman's office. It is addressed to Mr Rigney. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Dear Mr Rigney,</PARA>
<PARA> I understand from Senator McLaren that you had not received Professor Richardson's letter of 26 March by the 31 March. </PARA>
<PARA> A copy is attached in case the original does not arrive. </PARA>
<PARA>I shall read a copy of Professor Richardson's letter. It is dated 26 March. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Mr Rigney,</PARA>
<PARA> As promised earlier I am writing in connection with Ralkon Agricultural Company Proprietary Limited's (the Company's) complaint to this office about the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and this office's investigation of that Department's actions. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular I refer to a letter sent to the Company by the then Deputy Ombudsman, K. M. Crotty, in October 1978, to which was attached a document of 29 pages entitled 'History of Ralkon-events leading up to complaint'. That letter, insofar as it purported to contain conclusions about the conduct of the Company and of the Department, contained preliminary conclusions only, which were disputed by the Company. The Company also disputed a number of the assertions of fact in the 29-page attachment. Although we were close to determining our attitude at the time the investigation was discontinued, we had not done so. </PARA>
<PARA> You are free to use this letter in any way you see fit. </PARA>
<PARA>I am in possession of the letter because Mr Rigney brought it to my office. There again is conclusive proof of what some meddling people in this community are doing. I hope that some of the people who may be listening around Parliament House tonight who, in my view, have done things to frustrate this proposed inquiry take some notice and that when we come back here next year they will agree to the setting up of a select committee so that some honest people can be cleared of these false accusations that have been made against them. Some have been made only just recently, as I have pointed out, by a local member in the House of Assembly in South Australia saying that he is in possession of the Ombudsman's final report. When I pleaded with Professor Richardson to make that report available to Senator Chaney when he was the responsible Minister, he told me that under the Act he was prevented from doing so. So there is no final report so far as Professor Richardson knows. He has still got it locked up and he is unable under the Act to release it. Yet these mischievious people are peddling around the country stories that they have got it and they are using it to the detriment of these people. </PARA>
<PARA> On 27 May I gave notice of my intention to move in this Parliament for the setting up of a select committee to inquire into this subject. I will not read out the terms of my notice of motion, but I seek leave to have incorporated in the Hansard my notice of motion No. 28 on the Notice Paper of 24 November 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) That a Select Committee of the Senate be appointed to inquire into and report by 27 August 1981 on-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the viability of the Ralkon Agricultural Company of Loveday Bay Road, Narrung, in the State of South Australia, and the competency of the Company to successfully farm (in the interests of the Aboriginal residents of Point McLeay) the three properties it now occupies:</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the relationship between the Company, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Point McLeay Aboriginal Council from the time of formation of the Company in 1975 until 30 June 1980; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the relationship between the Company, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, the Point McLeay Aboriginal Council and the Aboriginal Development Commission since July 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) That provisions relating to membership, powers and proceedings of the Committee be contained in a subsequent Resolution. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4L7">Senator McLAREN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For the record I point out that that is not the first time I had sought in this Parliament to have an inquiry set up because I did propose a reference to the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare on 31 May 1978. The terms of reference were: 'The management and financial affairs of Ralkon Agricultural Co. Pty Ltd, Narrung, South Australia'. It is the people who live on that property who want the inquiry, not me. They have asked me to try to get a Senate inquiry to look into those things, yet people have the hide to say that I am running around supporting Ralkon. I am supporting justice. I was hoping that we could get an inquiry and that there would be sitting on that Senate select committee-not me; they can call me as a witness if they like; I will be quite happy to go-some independent people who are prepared to see that justice is done. That is the sort of thing that we have to put up with.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On 28 September this year Mr Charles Perkins-I have criticised him in this Parliament before and I will criticise him again and again if need be-wrote a letter to the Adelaide-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister got rid of him. He got him out of his hair. He put him off to the Aboriginal Development Commission. Senator Baume has a very great smile on his face tonight. I want to read the letter that he wrote to the Advertiser and then in turn I will read the letter Mr Rigney wrote to the Advertiser which that newspaper did not see fit to print. The letter from Mr Charles Perkins is headed 'Faction fracas'. It reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Sir-On behalf of the Aboriginal Development Commission I totally reject allegations by Mr Hambidge (The Advertiser, 21.9.81)-</PARA>
<PARA>I interpose to say that Mr Hambidge is the well respected editor of the Murray Valley Standard in Murray Bridge and no one can validly level any criticism against him, but he saw fit to write a letter to the editor of the Advertiser. The letter from Mr Charles Perkins continues:</PARA>
<PARA> that the Commission is doing its best to split the Aboriginal community at Point McLeay with the aim of wrecking the Ralkon Company. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission is attempting to reconcile factions separated by the actions of Ralkon itself. </PARA>
<PARA>How happy we would all be if that were in fact true. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA> Rather than butt in, as Mr Hambidge implies, the commission has been answering pleas for help from the Point McLeay Council first made 12 months ago for the commission to assist the council to regain lawful control of its farming lands from Ralkon. </PARA>
<PARA> The commission does not accept that the Ralkon project in its present condition is a good example of Aboriginal enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, it is clearly the most difficult enterprise with which the commission is involved. </PARA>
<PARA> The Ralkon Company, which has been responsible for a marked deterioration of the farming lands, is managed not by an Aboriginal, but by a white man who undertook the position six years ago on the understanding that he would train a local Aboriginal to replace himself within two years. </PARA>
<PARA> A recent report by expert consultants stated that Ralkon's management techniques are far from satisfactory. </PARA>
<PARA> For some time, the commission has been extremely concerned about the operations of Ralkon and its handling of a number of matters relating to the management of the lands it purports to control. </PARA>
<PARA> Not the least of these is the fact that the company has failed to give a proper accounting of the use of money spent on projects around the properties in question and has refused an audit for the past four years. </PARA>
<PARA> As a responsible body and the organisation that legally owns a part of the farming lands, the Aboriginal Development Commission cannot allow its lands which were acquired by substantial public investment to be jeopardised any longer. That is why it is taking action to support the Point McLeay Council. </PARA>
<PARA> Incidentally, Mr Spencer Rigney is not a member of the Point McLeay Council as stated by Mr Hambidge. </PARA>
<PARA>The letter is signed 'C. N. Perkins, Chairman, Aboriginal Development Commission, Canberra'. At one time Mr Rigney was a member of the Council and, if my memory serves me correctly, he was Chairman of the Council. I understand that he is one of those persons who were candidates at the last Council election. Through some actions of people in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, no doubt supported by the Aboriginal Development Commission, his name was struck off the role and he was not allowed either to stand as a candidate or to vote. I have a letter dated 29 September headed 'Ralkon Agricultural Company, Loveday Bay Road, Narrung'. It is addressed to the editor of the Advertiser Newspapers Ltd, King William Street, Adelaide, South Australia. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Sir,</PARA>
<PARA> I wish to set on record certain facts relating to matters raised in the letter from Mr Charles Perkins (The Advertiser, 28.9.81). </PARA>
<PARA> Ralkon was established in 1975 at the instigation of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs following our representation to conduct farming operations on behalf of the aboriginal people of Point McLeay. The Department advised those residents that after the formation of the company they would each receive shares in the company. Following the formation the Department advised that the shares should be held by the Point McLeay Community Council on behalf of the residents and not by the residents themselves. This upset the residents who had paid money for the shares in the company. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1979 the company's articles were changed to enable the shares to be issued to residents so that they would have a direct say in the operation of the business of the company in farming lands purchased at Point McLeay. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1980 Ralkon made a submission to the Minister of Aboriginal Affairs which was conveyed to the Aboriginal Development Commission requesting that the land held by the Aboriginal Development Commission be transferred to it if necessary by purchase with adequate safeguards imposed to ensure that any public funding was properly protected. This transfer would enable long term development of the land to take place for the benefit of the aboriginal residents at Point McLeay. On the 23rd March 1981 the Aboriginal Development Commission without reference to Ralkon and the people of Point McLeay offered a lease of the land to the Point McLeay Community Council. </PARA>
<PARA> On the 28th March 1981 an election was held for the Point McLeay Community Council and after the election the Council reflected the views of the Point McLeay residents. At a number of Council meetings during March, April and May 1981 the Council resolved to reject all agreements between the previous Council and the Aboriginal Development Commission and requested that the farm land be transferred to Ralkon. </PARA>
<PARA> On the 29th May 1981 I visited Canberra with the Chairman of the Council to discuss this matter with Mr Perkins who stated there was nothing wrong with the company's Articles of Association and if the company could show that it could manage the farm the Aboriginal Development Commission would look to giving freehold title in the land. </PARA>
<PARA> A majority of the Point McLeay community signed a letter to the Minister of Aboriginal Affairs on the 12th June 1981 requesting that the Department should not interfere further in the activities of the Point McLeay people. This letter also requested that the land be transferred to Ralkon. </PARA>
<PARA> On the 27th July 1981 following further persuasion from the Aboriginal Development Commission the Council signed a lease with the Aboriginal Development Commission which endeavoured to exclude Ralkon from any farming operation in respect of the property. The Directors of Ralkon believe that this decision was made against the wishes of the majority of Point McLeay residents and have sought to have the matter raised at various levels to ensure that the wishes of the majority of people are carried into effect. </PARA>
<PARA> The company has not caused any split amongst the people at Point McLeay. This split has been brought about by outsiders interfering in the affairs of the Point McLeay residents. </PARA>
<PARA> The Company has not unlawfully retained control of the farmlands at Point McLeay as on a number of occasions the community council have requested the Aboriginal Development Commission to transfer those lands to Ralkon. </PARA>
<PARA> Ralkon has managed the farming operation at a profit and has carried out proper accounting procedures, it has not refused an audit and it is not opposed to its account being audited. </PARA>
<PARA> The Directors of Ralkon who are all Aboriginals have been very happy with the management and assistance given by Mr Ian Hillock who has been the company manager for six years. Mr Hillock has, on a number of occasions, indicated that he would leave if so requested by the Directors but the Directors and shareholders have expressed their desire for him to stay and have been grateful for his continued support. The company is capable of managing the farm operation profitably and has sought to have the land transferred to it with appropriate controls to ensure the long term development of the land. The Aboriginal Development Commission has ignored the request of a majority of residents of Point McLeay to lease or transfer the land to Ralkon and has sought to impose its own will upon the people of Point McLeay. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours faithfully, S. Rigney, Chairman, Ralkon Agricultural Company Pty Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA>So what! The Advertiser in Adelaide was prepared to print a letter from Mr Hambridge, the editor of the Murray Valley Standard, and in return to print a letter from Mr Charles Perkins, the Chairman of the Commission. It did not see fit to print a letter from the chairman of the company rebutting much of the statement made by Mr Perkins. So there again we have people in the community being misinformed. It then falls to my lot to raise the matter again in the Senate. I probably would not have done it if I had not been attacked by Lewis. I would have waited to see whether the Minister, when we return for the Autumn session, would agree at last to the setting up of a select committee so that we can have this public inquiry into the affairs at Point McLeay and examine all the allegations which have been made by many people who are misinformed and ill-informed, as I have said. If this inquiry could be set up, perhaps we could at long last set this thing at rest. </PARA>
<PARA> I am sure that the people on that particular farming enterprise would be most happy if that were to happen. They are not afraid of an inquiry. They have asked for the inquiry. </PARA>

It is addressed to Senator Peter Baume, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Parliament House, Canberra. It states:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Senator Baume,</PARA>
<PARA> We heard your rejection of Senator McLaren's request that our problems be looked into as a matter of urgency. </PARA>
<PARA>It was at that stage that I moved to have Standing Orders suspended in order to try to get this committee set up so that it could do its work during the winter recess when we had staff and senators available. The letter continues:</PARA>

We are tired of it. Point McLeay is not a political football to be kicked around to satisfy or protect the sensitivities of your Department. It is a small community of Aboriginals doing their best to make something of themselves for the future and for their children. </PARA>
<PARA> Enough is enough. We know what has happened and so do you and, thank God, so do others. You and your Department mean nothing to us. Ralkon means everything. So let's stop pretending. </PARA>
<PARA> We have made our requirements as to Land Tenure perfectly clear. They are normal commercial requirements, no more no less. We want no further interference from your Department. That is reasonable and you should be glad of it. You know what has to be done. The decision is yours and the time is now. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours sincerely, The PEOPLE OF RALKON</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The date of that letter is 12 June of this year. It was written because those people happened to be listening to the broadcast of the Senate when the debate took place. They heard every word that Senator Baume said and every word that I said. They know what the result of the vote was.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have checked the list of shareholders which was attached to the statements of the company which were lodged with the Office of Corporate Affairs in Adelaide in 1979. I took the trouble this evening to go through that list. Of the 31 people who signed that letter to Senator Baume, 24 are shareholders in the company. Shares are also held by the community council. I will read the names of the shareholders. People by the name of Rigney had nine shares and nine signed the letter. People by the name of Long had one share and one signatory. The Koolmatries had five shares and five signatories to the letter. The Sumners had four shares and two signatories to the letter. The Rankines had three shares and one signatory to the letter. The Wilsons had three shares and one signatory to the letter. The Gollans had two shares and two signatories to the letter. The Marks had two shares and two signatories to the letter. Harradine had one share and one signatory to the letter. Twenty-four of the shareholders signed that letter. There were 31 signatures. As far as I can ascertain, seven people were not shareholders. I might be wrong and they might also be shareholders but that is the latest list I had. </PARA>
<PARA> I told the Minister on 17 November that I would have to raise this matter. I did not think I would have to do so at this late hour. I have always been opposed to the Senate sitting late. This is the last day of sitting on which this matter can be raised. I put it on the record once again for the information of Senator Baume in the explicit hope-I think it is a forlorn hope-that he will get off his backside and get something going for these people. I have told them that he has said to me that Ralkon has something to hide. I have said to them: 'If you have anything to hide it will all come out in the inquiry'. They said: 'We are quite prepared for the open inquiry'. They asked me for it. I did not interfere in their affairs. They came to my office, as a member of parliament, many years ago to ask me to take up this matter for them. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Baume knows the whole history of the matter. When he was Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare, I gave to the Committee my complete file of Ralkon. I kept nothing back. If he had done his job as the Chairman of that Committee, he would have read everything. He would have known, if he had read the documentation in the Department since he became the Minister, what was there. From the private conversations that I had with him, I really believe that Senator Chaney was honestly trying to do something for those people. I have no reason to doubt that he had the ifterests of the people at heart and was trying to solve the problem. For some reason there was a change in the portfolio. We got Senator Baume. I immediately asked Senator Baume to try to follow up the work that Senator Chaney had done. We are now back in limbo. These people are being falsely accused by a Liberal member of parliament in South Australia of being untruthful. He is saying that they are crooks. He is saying, in particular, that they are being led by this chap, Hillock, who, he said, is trying to get his hands on the property. </PARA>
<PARA> Any sane person would know that if the Aboriginal Development Commission or the Aboriginal Affairs Department holds title to that property there is no way that any individual can get hold of it and use it to his own benefit or sell it. I say again that these are false accusations. The sooner we can set up an inquiry to solve the problem, the happier the people at Ralkon will be. If it is proved that they have not been doing the right thing in running the farm, it will be because they have to leave their farm so often to go to Adelaide to take part in stupid court cases, instigated by white people, who go there and manipulate some of the Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> I cannot say any more tonight but I will keep on saying these things in the Parliament. It is time that people on the other side of the chamber who have the wherewithal and the methods to set up this inquiry did so. If they did, Senator Baume might be able to tell me that I am completely wrong. He might say that I have been chasing a hare up a blind burrow. If I have, I have done it in all innocence and out of my duty as a member of Parliament trying to help people who have come to me seeking assistance. I cannot do any more except stand up in this place. Whilst I have a few more years here I am going to annoy honourable senators on the other side-apparently that is what I am doing-as long as they sit over there. If they are not on that side I assure them that we will have a committee of inquiry to see that justice is done. </PARA>
<PARA> I say again that I hope that some of the people who are doubting Thomases about what has taken place will read both letters from the Ombudsman which will prove that they have been misled in relation to what they think has taken place. They have been misled by some people in the Department who I claimed before, and who I claim again, have a skeleton in the cupboard and something to hide. I hope Senator Baume will see that justice is done and will agree to set up a Senate select committee immediately we come back after the recess. Had the committee been set up during the winter recess the job would have been done. Had it been brought forward this session we could have found out who was right and who was wrong. At least we would have laid to rest all these lies which people are peddling around the country. I only hope Mr Lewis is prepared to make those statements which he made on two occasions in the State Parliament outside the Parliament so that he will get his just deserts. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SG7">Senator KEEFFE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps somebody might like to make a suggestion as to which one. I think the Government is in the happy situation of not having won very much in the last four or five weeks. The next session will not be any better. As we move towards the double dissolution-provided the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) has enough courage to go through with it-there will be other defeats which the Government can chalk up. I make those preliminary remarks. The razor gang which was appointed very early in the life of this Government to cut out public expenditure has been a total disaster. Even according to the razor gang's reckoning the final amount that will be saved is merely the petty cash in the whole of the Budget Estimates. One of the things that disturbs me greatly is the inroads that have been made into education. It is the sort of thing that betrays the views of the Government almost to the point of corruption.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In my city of Townsville-one of the remoter areas of this country-the decision to amalgamate the Townsville College of Advanced Education and James Cook University is a great disaster so far as education is concerned. Courses that have been introduced by the CAE under the directorship of Ross McKee have been unique and have brought higher education to people who would otherwise not have been able to obtain it. Incidentally this new system is not going to save any money in the short term. In fact, it will cost us a lot more money in the short term and will probably cost us money in the long term. There is no possible way in which it can be a financial advantage as far as the Government is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> In spite of my earlier threat I do not propose to speak at great length. There are two or three points I want to make. I instance that one of the people guiding this amalgamation at the State Government level occupied a very high position in the Government of Queensland. He was unable to pass his scholarship when he sat for his final school leaving exam. I think there were four or five students in the class. He failed it. He was the only one who failed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think it really is necessary to mention names. I leave that to honourable senators' imaginations. I am sure they all will come up with the same answer. I will read what this document, which came off the back of a bus or a truck, has to say. This is the sort of document that was used to convince some people in certain areas, but the people who prepared it made sure that not everybody got a copy of it. Item 1 states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Townsville College of Advanced Education Council and Student Union will cease to exist as from 1 January 1982. All property, liabilities, assets, contracts, etc., will be transferred to James Cook University. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, the James Cook University is not interested in some of the courses that the CAE has been running since its inception. Item 4 states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Institute will offer the same courses as were offered at Townsville CAE. The courses can be altered, dropped, or substituted only with the Minister's approval. </PARA>
<PARA>Any honourable senator who knows the Minister for Education, Mr Gunn, will know that his only ability in directing education is to go bang. He will be quite happy to see things like Aboriginal primary teacher training disappear totally because of the States Government's intense hate of anybody who is less than white. He will be quite happy to see the social services courses disappear because the people who are trained in those courses and who obtain a diploma are people who look after the poorer people in the community. Item 6 states:</PARA>
<PARA> If a dispute arises between the University and the Boards, it may be referred to the Minister whose decision shall be final and given effect to by all parties. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the National Party will take over the amalgamation. It will ensure that the CAE is totally crippled. That will lead to a disintegration of some of the major courses at the James Cook University. I am not scaremongering; I am stating a fact. Item 7 states:</PARA>
<PARA> The University Council composition will be altered by the addition of the following members:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Five members appointed by the Governor-in-Council. </PARA>
<PARA>I point out that the Council has five members, all of whom are either card-carrying members or supporters of the National Party. Your party, Mr President, will not get a look in, nor will the Australian Labor Party. People interested in education will not be appointed to that Council. One of the qualifications required for appointment will be that an applicant has not passed his or her primary school grades. That item goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) One member of the staff of the Institute of Advanced Education appointed by the staff. </PARA>
<PARA> (iii) One student of the Institute appointed by the Institute's students. </PARA>
<PARA>Those two people probably will be well qualified, but they will be outnumbered. They will not be able to do one thing about the situation. Item 8 states:</PARA>
<PARA> Council of the University shall within one month of amendment of the Act establish an Advisory Committee for Advanced Education in North Queensland, to consist of five new members of Council who have a particular interest in advanced education, and four other members of the Council. </PARA>
<PARA>I understand that those people will not have any degrees or any academic qualifications at all. Wal Fife, the Minister for Education at the Australian Government level, has been totally hoodwinked. He does not know that is going on. I doubt that he understands what is going on. The other day I heard a suggestion that there will be a reshuffle of the Ministry. If the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) is advised properly, he will make sure that Wal Fife is no longer the Minister for Education because people at government level in Queensland have totally hoodwinked him. Earlier tonight I referred to a copy of the document which fell off the back of a truck. I have an extract from the Townsville Daily Bulletin, the first paragraph of which states:</PARA>
<PARA> Students are the first and major consideration in the amalgamation of the James Cook University and the Townsville College of Advanced Education, the Minister for Education, Mr Gunn said yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that was referring to Mr Bang Bang Gunn. That is not on. Gunn does not even know what is happening. He is not particularly brilliant in the field of education. He has been hopeless as Minister for Education, and there is no way in the world that he will be able to rectify the present situation unless the Federal Government takes the initiative. My second quote is from an article reporting criticism by academics, which appeared in the Courier-Mail on 4 November 1981. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The senior academics described the Bill as 'a power grab by the State Government in an area normally free of the Bjelke-Petersen administration'. </PARA>
<PARA>As I said a few moments ago, this will be run by Gunn and Bjelke-Petersen. They will decide who constitute the committees. They will decide who runs the CAE. Ultimately, if they survive long enough, they will decide when the CAE goes out of existence. But they will be able to decide in the next 12 months which courses disappear. Mr President, I have shown the document from which I quoted to your predecessor in the Chair tonight and to a Minister who was in the Senate earlier tonight. Both agreed that there was no objection to its incorporation. I now seek leave to incorporate that document in Hansard. </PARA>

<PARA>STUDENTS-TOP PRIORITY IN AMALGAMATION PLAN: GUNN</PARA>
<PARA> Students are the first and major consideration in the amalgamation of the James Cook University and the Townsville College of Advanced Education, the Minister for Education, Mr Gunn said yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> Replying to claims of Government control over the University in legislation effecting the amalgamation, Mr Gunn said some measure of monitoring was necessary to protect advanced education courses. </PARA>
<PARA> 'There was a real concern that advanced education could be swallowed up and some courses disappear in the amalgamation, with a resultant dramatic effect on students,' he said. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Gunn said the Federal Minister for Education, Mr Fife, had approved of the legislation and in insisting there be a genuine amalgamation of the two institutions, said that two distinct streams of higher education must be maintained in North Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> 'This was stated clearly on more than one occasion by both Mr Fife and the Prime Minister. The Commonwealth's State Grants Tertiary Education Assistance Act provides for a reduction in grants to universities which have amalgamated with colleges of advanced education if they fail to offer in 1982 the courses offered by the college in 1981,' Mr Gunn said. </PARA>
<PARA> 'Therefore I would see the Queensland legislation as being a protection for James Cook University rather than 'a power grab by the State Government' as some academics had described it,' Mr Gunn said. </PARA>
<PARA> 'These are unusual circumstances, which have been forced upon us which require unusual measures, but in all matters to do with education, no matter what level, the interests of the students are paramount,' he said. </PARA>

<PARA>FOREIGN FISHING BOATS LEVY BILL 1981</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is the first of a package of four Bills that I am introducing today for the purpose of authorizing the imposition and collection of a tax on various kinds of fishing activities by foreigners. The others are the Fisheries Agreements (Payments) Bill 1981, the Fisheries Amendment Bill 1981 and the Continental Shelf (Living Natural Resources) Amendment Bill 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill imposes a levy on the grant of licences authorizing foreign boats to fish in the 200 nautical mile Australian fishing zone or to take sedentary organisms from the Australian continental shelf. Since the establishment of the fishing zone on 1 November 1979, the Government has collected amounts in addition to licence fees in accordance with agreements between the Commonwealth and the foreign interests concerned. This Bill does not affect that practice. I shall refer to this in more detail later. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's policy is to encourage joint fishing operations between Australian and foreign interests as the preferred method of allowing foreign fishermen to have access to the portion of fish stock in the AFZ that Australian fishermen do not harvest. </PARA>
<PARA> The principal purpose of this Bill, is to enable implementation of an aspect of the new guidelines for joint Australian/ foreign fishing arrangements, developed by the Australian Fishing Zone Committee comprising representatives of the fishing industry and State, Northern Territory and Commonwealth governments. </PARA>
<PARA> Following endorsement by the Australian Fisheries Council in September 1980, the Minister for Primary Industry announced the Government's acceptance of the new guidelines. The guidelines provide that in addition to administrative fees prescribed by regulation under the Fisheries Act, joint venture partners during the period when foreign vessels and crews are utilised, might be required to pay access fees which may be reviewed during the course of the project. This provision in the guidelines is designed to cover the initial situation where there is little Australian involvement in the joint venture. As the Australian content is increased the levy could be phased out. Alternatively where considerable benefits are offered the levy would be payable if the benefits do not materialise. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill provides for the assessment of a levy payable in respect of the grant of licences for foreign boats operating under the control of joint fishing arrangements and for the liability of licence holders, who may be Australian residents or companies, for payment of the levy. Other Bills in this package provide for the collection of the levy, and how it may be reduced or waived if other suitable benefits are provided to Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill applies not only to licences granted as the result of a joint fishing arrangement. It subjects all licensees of foreign fishing boats to an obligation to pay a tax to be called 'levy' except in two cases. The first case is where the licence is granted under an agreement with a foreign government which specifies that an amount is payble over and above the licence fee. The second case in which levy is not payable under this Bill is where the boats are temporarily imported, and the regulations prescribe them to be exempt. The Government's intention is that the regulations will exempt only those temporarily imported boats that are under the exclusive control of Australians for use in developmental fishing. </PARA>
<PARA> The amount of levy that is payble under the Bill will be set out in the Regulations. Clause 7 provides that the Regulations may set out the amount of levy payable for any boat or class of boats by reference to a wide range of matters relating to the boat or its operations. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have just mentioned, the amount required to be paid in respect of boats in joint fishing arrangements may be less than the applicable levy as the result of provisions in the Fisheries Amendment Bill or the Continental Shelf (Living Natural Resources) Amendment Bill, to which I will refer later. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, neither this Bill nor any other Bill in the package, applies to fishing operations with Australian boats. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA>FISHERIES AGREEMENTS (PAYMENTS) BILL</PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is the second of the four Bills dealing with payments in respect of foreign boats licensed to fish in waters or areas of the continental shelf under Australian jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of the Bill is to provide the Commonwealth with legislative powers to give effect to fisheries agreements entered into with a foreign government, providing for the payment by nationals of the other country of amounts additional to administrative fees payable for the issue of licences. Boats licensed pursuant to a government-to-government agreement are exempt from levy under the Foreign Fishing Boats Levy Bill and any amount required to be paid under the agreement is payable in lieu of levy. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill has the constitutional character of a taxing Bill and has no other application than in that sense. There are mirror provisions in other Bills to which I will later refer, which have effect if the provisions are held not to deal with the imposition of taxation. This course of legislative action has been taken on legal advice to put the matter beyond doubt. What is not caught by this Bill will be caught by one of the others. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill does not of itself provide statutory authority for the Commonwealth to enter into agreements. The Commonwealth does this in the exercise of its executive authority. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1979 when the Australian fishing zone was established, the Commonwealth has collected an access fee in respect of Japanese tuna longline vessels in accordance with the subsidiary agreements with the Japanese Government. The Bill does not replace provisions of that kind in any past or future agreement. It leaves the two governments free to agree that all or some of the amount becomes payable after the licences are granted. This additional flexibility is of benefit to both parties in negotiating the agreement. The Bill supports this flexibility by providing a power to suspend the licences granted under the agreement while amounts agreed to be paid remain outstanding. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA>FISHERIES AMENDMENT BILL 1981</PARA>
<PARA> This is the third of the four Bills dealing with taxation in relation to foreign fishing boats. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the collection of levy payable on the grant of licences under the Fisheries Act 1952, which the Bill amends for the purpose. The Bill also contains provisions to facilitate giving effect to fisheries agreements entered into with foreign governments, to the extent that those provisions do not deal with the imposition of taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> When moving the second reading of the Foreign Fishing Boats Levy Bill, I referred to the Government's policy of licensing foreign fishing boats to fish in the Australian fishing zone-AFZ-only after entering into formal agreements with the foreign fishing interests seeking the licences. These agreements fall into three general categories, each of which this Bill deals with separately. </PARA>
<PARA> The first category is agreements for the conduct of joint fishing operations. Where a joint fishing company offers benefits to Australia, in consideration of which the Commonwealth has agreed to release the company from additional impost by way of levy, the Bill empowers the Minister to give effect to that agreement. The Government expects that the use of this power will encourage joint fishing companies to create employment for Australians, to invest in facilities on shore in Australia, or to provide other tangible benefits. </PARA>
<PARA> The second category of agreements is where Australia agrees with the Government of a foreign country to license fishing vessels flying its flag to fish in the AFZ. The Foreign Fishing Boats Levy Bill exempts boats licensed pursuant to such an arrangement from liability to pay the levy. The Fisheries Agreements (Payments) Bill provides legislative authority to give effect to the agreement insofar as it may be held to deal with the imposition of taxation in relation to the agreed amount. The Fisheries Amendment Bill provides for giving effect to the agreement in cases that do not have taxation implications. </PARA>
<PARA> The final category of agreements comprises those which do not fall into either of the previous categories, such as the agreement with the Kaohsiung Commercial Fishing Boat Guild of Taiwan. Foreign boats licensed under agreements in this category will continue to be liable to pay the full amount.</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill requires the Minister to table agreements of any of these kinds in both Houses of the Parliament within 15 sitting days after entering into them.</PARA>
<PARA> The Fisheries Act which this Bill amends, sets out objectives in section 5B, to which the Minister is to have regard when administering the Act. The Minister exercises his discretionary power to grant or refuse a licence under section 9 of that Act in accordance with those statutory objectives. The Bill will require the Minister to disregard those objectives when granting licenses pursuant to agreements. The stage at which the Minister considers the conservation and fisheries management objectives of the Act is when the agreement is being negotiated. </PARA>
<PARA> It is proposed to insert a new section 9C in the principal Act to provide for collection of levy payable in respect of all foreign fishing boats that have not been exempted under the Foreign Fishing Boats Levy Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Proposed sub-section 9C (2) enables the Minister to make arrangements with people or companies liable to pay the levy, concerning the time and manner of payment of the levy. In such a case, proposed sub-section 9C (10) requires payment in accordance with the arrangement or, where there is no such arrangement, within 30 days of the grant of the licence. </PARA>
<PARA> By proposed sub-section 9C (6), when the Minister has made an agreement approving a joint fishing arrangement and the company has defaulted on the provision of a promised benefit, the amount of levy that had previously been waived becomes payable. The Minister may then suspend some or all of the licences held by the company in respect of foreign fishing boats. Agreements for joint fishing arrangements will normally refer to the benefits to be provided on a year-by-year basis, in conjunction with the issue of licences. </PARA>
<PARA> If the company subsequently either pays the levy together with any penalty that has accrued or provides the promised benefit, the Minister is then required, by proposed sub-section 9C (7), to reinstate the suspended licences.</PARA>
<PARA> In the case of an agreement in the third category, when levy is not paid by the due date, proposed sub-section 9C (8) empowers the Secretary to the Minister's Department to suspend the licences for the foreign fishing boats concerned. Under the next proposed sub-section he must revoke the suspension when the levy and any penalty is received. </PARA>
<PARA> Proposed sub-section 9C (11) provides a rate of penalty of 10 per cent for each month the levy remains unpaid after the due date. Penalty ceases to accumulate on the date that the license would have expired. </PARA>
<PARA> The combined effect of these provisions is that the licensee would commit an offence against the Fisheries Act 1952 if he used the boat for fishing in the AFZ during the suspension and even if the levy were not paid during the period of the licence, it and the penalty would remain as money owing to the Commonwealth, recoverable in a court of competent jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA> The intention of these sanctions is that they should serve as much as an incentive to the provision of promised benefits of prompt payment of levy as a punishment for default. Nevertheless, the sanctions will be applied whenever a default occurs. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not appropriate, in the case of an agreement with the Government of another country, to make any unpaid amount a debt to the Commonwealth recoverable in a court or to impose any penalty for non-payment. However, the Bill contains provisions for suspension of licences in such a case. </PARA>
<PARA> To assist in verification of the amount due when levy is assessed in accordance with the size of the boat, Clauses 5 and 6 provide a power for an officer to go on board and measure the boat or to obtain the assistance of another person, who would have the powers and rights of an officer while so engaged. It is envisaged that the other person would be a qualified marine surveyor employed by the Commonwealth or a State. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, clauses 7 and 8 make a number of formal amendments to the principal Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA>CONTINENTAL SHELF (LIVING NATURAL RESOURCES) AMENDMENT BILL 1981</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is the final Bill in the package concerned with taxing foreign boats. In substance, it is identical with the Fisheries Amendment Bill. For that reason, I will not take the time of the Senate with a recital of its detailed provisions. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there are several points about which it is appropriate to inform the Senate in relation to the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia's sovereign rights in relation to living sedentary organisms on the Australian continental shelf differ significantly from Australia's sovereign rights and responsibilities for managing the swimming fishery resources of the AFZ. In particular, Australia is not obliged to allocate to foreigners, any surplus of the allowable catch of sedentary organisms that Australians do not take. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the Continental Shelf (Living Natural Resources) Act 1968 came into force, the Commonwealth policy has consistently been not to license foreign ships. This does not mean that, if Australian fishermen did not harvest the allowable catch of presently known or newly discovered stocks of a sedentary organism, we would not at some future time review the policy to see if there was benefit to be gained for Australia by allowing foreigners to harvest those stocks on terms and conditions determined by the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government considers it appropriate to provide now for collection of the levy in relation to licences that may at some future time be granted for foreign ships to take sedentary organisms. Without the Bill, the Government would be limited in the options available to it in relation to any future proposals it might receive from foreign fishermen seeking permission to harvest sedentary organisms from the continental shelf of Australia or the external Territories on a commercial basis. At present there are no such proposals under consideration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fishing Bills before the Senate this morning deal with a range of issues that are of importance to the various fishing industries in the States of Australia. I wish to raise some points about the fishing industry and the problems that it is currently facing in Queensland, which problems I believe are symptomatic of the types of problems the industries around Australia are facing. Leaving aside the problem of fuel costs, which contribute so much to the costs of fishermen, particularly the fisherman with a single boat, the major problem for fishermen seems to be the availability of loans. The Primary Industry Bank of Australia, which has provided low interest finance in a range of primary industry areas, unfortunately still insists on linking forestry and fishing together. Up to 30 June 1981, $8.1m out of $364.9m went to fishing and forestry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fishing industry feels that this reflects the continuing disinterest of the major trading banks in recognising ship mortgages and vessel hulls as collateral for loans. This unfortunately has had the effect of moving fishermen out of the market for low interest loans, which are so necessary to primary producers, into the area of finance companies, from which many fishermen have had to seek loans at interest rates sometimes in excess of 20 per cent. In Queensland it has had serious long term effects not only on the fishing industry but also on associated industries. </PARA>
<PARA> I will mention one of those which is, of course, the underwriters and insurers of the fishing boats in Queensland. For example, in the year just ended claims in excess of $4m were made on these insurers. Apart from the smaller claims this record loss relates to some 40 boats being either totally written off or disappearing during the year. It does not take much imagination to know why, when a small business person is forced to the wall, there will be repercussions for other industries. Indeed, in that industry the losses and the payouts far exceeded any of the income which means that many of the underwriters who are currently in the industry will move out, thereby forcing up the rate of insurance for those who remain within the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem of rising fuel costs is one which, of course, is not confined to the fishing industry alone but is shared between it and other primary industries. I will take an example. We can look at a trawler which may be using 45 litres of fuel per hour with the following results: In one night's fishing-steaming to anchorage, trawling for, say, ten hours and returning to anchorage-we would be looking at a cost of roughly in excess of $170 using figures for early 1980. If one looks at the average catch and cost at that time one finds that the boat would take in roughly $180. We thereby see the enormous problem that in one night what is left to make repayments and pay other expenses is something in excess of $10. If this is spread over the years to illustrate the enormous increase in charges we can see the results. </PARA>
<PARA> In July 1978 the total costs of that type of example I have given for an average trawler working 200 night in the year would be in excess of $15,000. In July 1980 we were looking at a cost in excess of $30,000. In other words more than double the amount of money would have to be expended by that trawler on fuel. Those types of problems-in relation to loans and rising fuel costs-illustrate fairly clearly the types of difficulties that one of our major primary industries is running into in this country. It is a pity that while much is being done and some useful initiatives were taken in the last Budget-up until the last Budget I think most fishermen were looking for some alleviation of their costs and all they managed to do was to get increases loaded upon that industry. Yet, of course, in industry terms the fishing industry is one of the major contributors to our export earnings in the primary area and one of our major income earners. </PARA>
<PARA> The last point that I want to raise in relation to the fishing industry is one which I believe has exercised a large number of people's minds; that is, the enormous difficulty that the industry is facing because of imports. Particularly in Queensland, imports of such things as crumbed scallops, peeled prawns, sea perch and a number of other items are seriously undermining the viability of individual fishermen. I believe that in the short term unless immediate and urgent measures are taken we will see many more of those small businessmen go to the wall, we will see many more of their boats repossessed and we will eventually see the destruction of small individuals in the fishing industry. They will be replaced by large companies which are generally overseas owned. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that unless the Senate comes to grips with this problem it will be residing over the demise of an extremely important and valuable primary industry. I believe it is a pity that so much time was devoted to other matters in the first reading debate and so little was devoted to what is a vital industry to Australia and to so many people in this country. I hope that early in the next session it will be possible to have a more general debate on this issue. I believe time will be made available for debate on a report which will be brought down and that we will have a much more extensive debate so that the problems of these people can be raised. I hope that some suggested solutions to their enormous difficulties will be presented. </PARA>
<PARA> Question resolved in the affirmative. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I oppose the motion that has been moved by my colleague Senator Robertson. I move an amendment to the motion in the following terms:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave out all words after ''That'', insert ''the Standing Orders Committee be requested to consider improvements required in the Senate Chamber, including the provision of closed circuit television facilities for the monitoring of Senate proceedings, and to report to the Senate on the cost of such improvements''. </PARA>
<PARA>I shall indicate briefly the reasons for my amendment, but before doing so I want to indicate why I oppose the motion. When Senator Robertson moved the motion earlier he made some mention of snooping or perhaps a lack of snooping. I understand quite well that there is no wish on behalf of Senator Robertson to snoop on what is happening in the chamber but, with the restricted installation of closed circuit television facilities, it is easy to be suspicious about this possibility. If closed circuit television is to be beamed into certain locations within the building, one of the questions I would ask is: Why is it to be restricted? Initially it will be beamed to the Whips so that they do not have to be present in the chamber to see what is going on. Perhaps I have an old fashioned feeling about this, but it seems to me that the place for the Whips is in the chamber. If they want to see what is going on, I suggest that they be present. </PARA>
<PARA> If we intend to introduce closed circuit television so that the Whips can have access to a visual display of what is happening in the chamber, why stop there? It would seem to me that if the Whips need closed circuit television to see what is going on in the chamber so too do the leaders-the Leader of the Government in the Senate, the Leader of the Opposition and the Leader of the Australian Democrats. If the leaders need it, why do not the deputy leaders need it? If the deputy leaders need it, why do not the deputy Whips also need it? If the Whips, the leaders, the deputy leaders and so on need it, why not introduce it for the Temporary Chairmen of Committees? After all they need to know what is going on in the chamber. If all of those people need to have closed circuit television, why not the Clerk? Obviously the Clerk wants to know what is going on. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps this is being ridiculous but, if it is, it is being ridiculous right at the very start. If all of those people require closed circuit television facilities, why not all honourable senators? If all honourable senators had closed circuit television beamed to their rooms perhaps I would have fewer reservations about the whole proposal than I have with the facilities going only to one or two locations or perhaps half a dozen locations in the building. We have been told that when we move into the new Parliament House-that is, those who are members of this Parliament at that time-we will have closed circuit television in all the rooms. If the facilities were provided in all the rooms I would see that as quite acceptable. Perhaps there could be some voice coverage also. As Senator Bjelke-Peterson would know, in all the rooms in the Queensland Parliament there are closed circuit televisions. It is not the crummy type of television which we had here-black and white; it is colour television. The point I make is that if the facility is to be provided in all the rooms, perhaps there would be some justification for it. If it is to be provided in only a few locations, I would be opposed to it. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to another plane. Perhaps other improvements need to be made in this chamber before we spend money on closed circuit television. If we have money to spend let us see whether it can be spent in a better way. Perhaps there are other priorities at which we should be looking. For instance-perhaps this does not refer specifically to the chamber-we have been decrying the fact recently that we have had a cut in funds allocated to the Parliamentary Library. If we have money to spend why do we not put it into the Parliamentary Library rather than into closed circuit television? Many honourable senators have been decrying the fact for some time that we need staff for Senate committees. If we have money to spend, why do we not put on additional staff for the Senate committees?</PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps we should be more adventurous than this and think of some of the other things that would improve this Senate chamber. Why do we not have an electronic system whereby we can vote without having to cross the floor and being tallied like sheep? Why do we not have an electronic system so that during Question Time we can just indicate to the President through this electronic system that we would like to be called upon to ask a question rather than spend an hour every day exercising ourselves by getting up and sitting down and probably eventually going out of the chamber frustrated because we did not get the call. It seems to me to be much better to look at this sort of possibility. I am not saying that at some stage we should not introduce a closed circuit television system. I am saying that we should be looking at all of the improvements that we require in this chamber and perhaps the improvements that we require for the service of the chamber before we decide that we will spend money on some particular aspect. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the things that concern me about the proposal that has been brought to us this evening is that we were not told what the costs would be. Before the Senate decides to take the radical step of bringing closed circuit television into the chamber I think we should look at the costs and perhaps even compare these costs with the cost of other improvements that could be made. Therefore, I propose an amendment which will cover some of these points. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> Leave out all words after 'That', insert 'the Standing Orders Committee be requested to consider improvements required in the Senate Chamber, including the provision of closed circuit television facilities for the monitoring of Senate proceedings, and to report to the Senate on the cost of such improvements'. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to make a few remarks concerning that amendment. Included in that amendment is provision for closed circuit television facilities, although I understand that there is a reference before the Senate Standing Orders Committee to look at the provision of television. I am not quite sure whether that involves closed circuit television or the televising of the proceedings of the chamber. But I included that provision in the amendment to indicate that I do not have any objection to the Standing Orders Committee having a look at that as one of the improvements that might be required in the Senate chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> I think other improvements should be looked at-perhaps some of those that I mentioned; perhaps some others might come to mind as well. We could then look at the costing of all of those improvements and perhaps the priorities in which they should be implemented, if we are to implement them, and report back to the Senate giving the priorities, the types of improvements that might be required and the costs of such improvements so that the Senate can have a look at them and make up its mind on the basis of some clear data-data that was not given to us this evening. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support Senator Colston in what he has had to say. I have mentioned before in this place this matter of having an electronic apparatus, which is a relatively simple matter these days. A very simple little system would be able to convey to you, sir, our voting intentions and would assist also during Question Time. The four, five, six or seven minutes involved in counting a division may not seem long, but when we take the costs of the Senate over a year to the community those costs are very considerable. With respect to the community it devolves on us to consider that we are not really an antiquated sort of a place in which tradition is the only thing that is important. We are here to do a job for the community for which we are paid accordingly. We should support Senator Colston's amendment for that reason.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We should look at a system by which votes in divisions can be communicated to you, Mr President, through a quite simple computer-that is all it would be-so time, which costs money, is not taken up unnecessarily. The present procedure for Question Time, whilst quaint, is antiquated and has no real relevance to the present-day world. Through some electronic means honourable senators could communicate to you that they want to ask a question and the details as to order could be recorded. Mr President, you would know who had asked questions. This would make it less necessary for you to keep a complicated list. It is not proper and right that you should have to keep such a list. You should have the assistance of whatever modern conveniences is available so that the intentions of honourable senators is known to you. </PARA>
<PARA> On that basis I suggest that we should have a general exploration of what might improve the conduct of business in this place and which might make it easier for honourable senators and you, Mr President. That would make it apparent to the public that we were not a sixteenth century chamber but a place cognisant of the modern world and its facilities. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I take the unusual step of opposing my colleague Senator Colston, but as he has opposed me I suppose I have some justification in doing it. I do not want to detain the Senate for long but I will cover a couple of points that have been raised in the course of the debate. Firstly, the matter of closed circuit television monitoring of the Senate chamber has been considered by the Standing Orders Committee. It authorised the present test and it is for us to make a decision on the basis of the recommendations made by the Committee. I believe that a delay would be unfortunate. There has been some urgency in getting this matter moving because, if we are to have closed circuit television, we want to see it installed during the recess. If we put it off it would have to be left certainly until the next recess if not later. I apologise for the fact that we moved fairly quickly on this matter. It was considered by the Standing Orders Committee and I was authorised to have the test done. The job was done quickly by the Australian Broadcasting Commission. Perhaps it would have been better had we raised the matter in the chamber and talked about it first. But in that event we might have decided to look at it in 1982 and perhaps introduce it in 1983. I believe it is important that we get television brought in as soon as possible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is proposed that the television facility be restricted, for a very important reason. The leaders and a number of senior people believed that it should not be in every room. Most of them spend one and a half to two hours per day in the chamber and we certainly would not want to discourage them from attending for that time. Cost is a factor to be considered. This was raised by Senator Colston. In a moment I will give the cost of installing four cameras and three monitors. Honourable senators can imagine the additional cost if an attempt were made to place monitors in all rooms, as I understand will be the case in the new Parliament House. We do not have that sort of money to play with at this time. We have to keep within a reasonable budget. The reductio ad absurdum that my colleague went on with really supports the case that I want to make. No suggestion has been made that closed circuit coverage go to all rooms. The suggestion was that it be introduced as a technological aid to the three Whips, and this was made quite clear. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Colston said that there were other priorities. No doubt there are. It is not an either/or situation. We do not look at all such propositions. We went through the normal arrangement of saying: 'Let us have a look at this and attempt to identify the need. When we have identified the need then let us try to meet it'. The proposition was put up on that basis. </PARA>
<PARA> I am advised that the cost to install four cameras and three monitors would be $15,500. Honourable senators will notice that my motion mentions authorising the President, who has a responsibility to provide certain facilities for honourable senators. If after considering the matter he thought it was worth while, he would be authorised by the Senate to go ahead and have the job done. This whole matter is tied in to a degree with what we were looking at today, that is, the staffing and appropriations for the Senate. We want senior officers of the Senate to be given the authority to make those decisions, to say: 'Yes, we think that is good and it can be installed'. I would like to see a situation whereby the senior officer is advised by a small committee, but that is a matter for another debate. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Mason made comments about wanting the most efficient situation. He talked about not wanting to live back in the middle ages, I think. But, as I tried to explain this afternoon for the purpose we are looking at-the most efficient way of doing our job-we believe, after looking carefully at the test, that the best method would be to use modern technology. It is perhaps unfortunate that more time is not available to discuss this matter. I have apologised already for this fact. It may have been better to have stretched the matter out over some months or perhaps years before we made the decision. Nevertheless, we have gone ahead. The test has been made. I think, without any doubt, that the test has been most effective. I think that the introduction of what is not exactly radical technology will add to the efficiency of the Senate. So I do not think we need to go any further on this matter. I simply ask the Senate to reject the amendment and to support the original proposition. </PARA>
<PARA> Amendment negatived. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator Peter Baume</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Mr Blackett-Ord sought appointment as Non-official Postmaster at Mount Lewis because of his interest in purchasing the business in conjunction with which the post office is conducted. He completed a printed application form on 23 May 1979 and was subsequently appointed to the position on 27 July 1979.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Mr Blackett-Ord was supplied with figures which indicated that for the first year of his appointment, payment would be at the rate of $9,867.50 pa. He was advised that this rate would be reviewed annually and would vary in accordance with the level of business transacted at the post office.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes. The figures quoted were based on the level of business transacted for the year 1976-77 and the payments being made to the incumbent Postmaster. This information did not take into account the fact that business had declined during 1977-78 to the point where, should the office be transferred to a new non-official postmaster, it should have been re-classified to a lower category at a lower rate of remuneration. Investigations revealed that the mistake was caused by records in the Divisional Manager's Office not being maintained in the prescribed manner.</PARA>
<PARA> The relevant recording methods have been changed so that variations in the level of business are not overlooked, and that the current level of business and the current rate of payment are readily discernible. These changes are designed to ensure that similar errors do not occur in the future.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) See (3) above.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Given the circumstances, payment to Mr Blackett-Ord was adjusted to the rate he had originally been advised he would receive (plus national wage adjustments) for the full period of his appointment as Non-official Postmaster at Mount Lewis. He suffered no loss of expected income for the period.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government is aware of the restraints on political activity in Pakistan and the continued detentagn of Benazir Bhutto, the daughter of the former Prime Minister. We also know that the Government of Pakistan has recently begun legal proceedings against the Bhutto family to recover funds allegedly misappropriated by the former Prime Minister while he was in office. At the time of Bhutto's execution my predecessor, Mr Peacock, made it clear in the House of Representatives on 4 April 1979 that this Government deeply regretted that event. Australia, together with many other countries, had appealed to the Government of Pakistan to exercise clemency but these representations were not accepted.</PARA>
<PARA> My Government continues to regret the detention of Benazir Bhutto and looks forward to a return to a situation where political parties can again play a role in a democratically elected government. We welcome as a step in this direction the announcement by President Zia that he will appoint this month a broad-based Federal Advisory Council. At the same time we are aware of the special difficulties Pakistan is now facing as a result of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. We have given what diplomatic and other support we can to Pakistan in its efforts in the UN and elsewhere to find a lasting political settlement to the Afghanistan situation. As you are probably aware, Australia has also given substantial assistance to Pakistan in its efforts to cope with the Afghan refugee problem.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> In your question you drew attention to the strategic importance of Papua New Guinea and Australia's role in the Pacific region. The Government recognises the strategic importance of the South Pacific region. This is evidenced by the number of new posts, such as Apia, Vila, Nuku'alofa and most recently, Tarawa, that the Government has opened in the past four years. In continuing its process of examining the need for opening or closing posts, the Government will keep in mind the importance of Papua New Guinea and the decision on Lae.</PARA>
<PARA> I appreciate the honourable senator's concern that the Consulate-General in Lae, opened in 1974 to cope with consular demands resulting from Papua New Guinea becoming an independent nation, is now to close. The decision was taken, however, as a result of a review of workloads at overseas posts and the pressures on financial and staffing resources of the overseas service, and because the High Commission in Port Moresby is able to undertake consular duties for Lae through regular visits by consular and other officers.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Home Affairs and Environment has provided me with the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australia Council has advised me that it has made several attempts to assist the Australian Gallery Directors Council (AGDC) to overcome serious financial difficulties. The AGDC is facing an accumulated deficit of about $300,000. Principal among these attempts was an offer to maintain the 1981 grant level ($278,000) and an offer of an extraordinary grant of $100,000 conditional on the AGDC raising from non-government sources the balance of $200,000 required to meet the deficit. The AGDC has been unable to raise these funds and as a result the Board of the AGDC has decided that it will recommend voluntary liquidation to a general meeting of Council members to be held on 18 November 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> The decision by t'e AGDC to go into voluntary liquidation would be regarded by the Australia Council as a matter for regret, particularly in view of the important role played by the Company in organising major local and international exhibitions. Council funding for the AGDC through the Visual Arts Board has been on the basis of annual grants towards exhibition programs and operating costs of the AGDC. The Australia Council has no legal responsibility for debts incurred by the AGDC which is an independent, incorporated company.</PARA>
<PARA> It is not possible at present to say definitely what will happen to the exhibitions which are currently touring under AGDC auspices. It is expected that individual galleries or other suitable bodies will assume responsibility for individual exhibitions such as 'Aboriginal Australia', so that tours within Australia can be completed. Some exhibitions which are only in the planning stages, and the overseas tour by 'Aboriginal Australia' may be cancelled, but current indications are that of approximately 20 scheduled exhibitions, only a few may be affected in this way. The Australia Council will examine ways of helping the regional galleries overcome the problems which may occur if the AGDC goes into liquidation.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator Messner</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Both TAA and Ansett schedule their aircraft to achieve an economic passenger load factor. Timetables are also designed to supply a level of capacity proportionate to average expected traffic demand. However, due to unpredictable fluctuations in demand, cancellation of some lightly loaded schedule services occurs on occasions when demand is well below the level required to return a reasonable load factor. Flight cancellations of this nature are rarely made over routes or to isolated areas where suitable alternative travel arrangements cannot be made for passengers affected. Such cancellations are intended to minimise costs and contain pressures for increased air fares.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Flights cancelled as a result of low demand are more often than not cancelled well before the day of operations when advanced passenger bookings are minimal. Passengers holding bookings at the time of cancellation are offered alternative travel on other services or if preferred, another carrier who may have a more conveniently timed flight.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) There are no separate records kept of flights cancelled as a result of a low traffic demand, nor the number of people inconvenienced or money theoretically saved by the airlines for 1979-80 and 1980-81. It should be realised that all cancellations take place against a background where scheduling is prepared some months in advance, and as a result, some cancellations will always occur. However, TAA advise that in weeks unaffected by industrial problems in the past financial year, more than 97% of total timetabled flights operated as scheduled.</PARA>
<PARA> I have been most concerned at cancellations occuring at short notice on some routes and the inconvenience caused to intending travellers. I have therefore asked the airlines to review their scheduling against passenger traffic experience in order to reduce the necessity to cancel flights on any route.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Carrick</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Education has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The report of an Interdepartmental Working Group on Adult Literacy and Numeracy, made public in November 1979, indicated that significant numbers of adults and children have not mastered basic literacy skills at appropriate levels. However, there were insufficient data to establish the number of illiterate or functionally illiterate Australians.</PARA>
<PARA> (2a) The report noted that assessment of the literacy level of a population is very difficult, particularly if the concept of 'functional literacy' is accepted, because measurement of skills which are ranged along a continuum is required. The difficulties are such that it is unlikely there will be a method which can be applied to assess satisfactorily the functional literacy 'rate' of whole populations.</PARA>
<PARA> (2b-f) I would like to emphasise that the primary responsibility for adult education rests with the States through programs provided by technical and further education institutions. The Commonwealth involvement in this area has been limited to the provision of grants to the States to improve the quality and effectiveness of technical and further education. Funds are available to State TAFE authorities under the Particular Purpose Recurrent Grants Program. States may request funds for 22 categories of particular purpose, one of which is:</PARA>
<PARA> 'the provision of adult literacy, remedial and special programs especially for the intellectually, educationally and physically handicapped and the unemployed.'</PARA>
<PARA>Among other things funds have been used for the training of tutors, the development of study modules, the establishment of community-based schemes, the operation of a summer school for students with reading problems and the evaluation of existing literacy programs.</PARA>
<PARA> A component of the Commonwealth's recurrent grants program of assistance to the States is its support for programs of non-government adult education. This program allows access to adult education for groups whose needs are not adequately met by the formal system. An important priority of the States in this program has been adult literacy.</PARA>
<PARA> Grants have been used by a variety of organisations, including national bodies, affiliates of local government and church groups, and smaller community groups.</PARA>
<PARA> Grants have also been made available under the TAFE Research and Investigation program. Since the program commenced in 1974-75 five projects have concentrated specifically on adult literacy, particularly in the areas of evaluating the effectiveness of programs and training teachers.</PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth Departments and agencies consulted by the Department of Education have shown that there is a marked awareness of and concern for problems of adult literacy and where feasible action is being undertaken by Departments and agencies to adapt their services in appropriate ways to meet the needs of persons whose literacy level falls beneath that of functional literacy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) It is not generally the practice to disclose whether or not specific proposals have been submitted to the Foreign Investment Review Board because foreign investment proposals are, of course, dealt with in confidence. However, Minatome Australia Pty Ltd has indicated it has no objections to it being made known that no application has yet been made to the Foreign Investment Review Board for approval of the Ben Lomond project in Queensland. The company has, however, had various discussions with the Board on its continuing efforts to introduce Australian equity into the project. An application by Minatome to proceed with Ben Lomond is unlikely to be submitted to the Foreign Investment Review Board until late next year.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) A proposal to develop the deposit would be subject to the Government's foreign investment policy. As a general rule, the Government expects new projects for the mining and production of uranium to have 75 per cent Australian equity and to be Australian controlled. In cases where it is demonstrated that 75 per cent Australian equity is clearly unobtainable, alternative proposals will be considered, provided there would be significant economic benefits and at least 50 per cent Australian equity, and provided the Australian participants had the major role in determining the policy of the project.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The study by Mr Peter Davies for the Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System showed that 87.3 per cent of bank nominee shares in Peko Wallsend and 74 per cent of bank nominee shares in Western Mining Corporation were held on behalf of foreign residents.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The study by Mr Davies covered only those foreign portfolio shareholdings that were held through bank nominees, and it is not, therefore, possible to derive the actual levels of Australian equity in the Ranger and Roxby Downs projects solely by reference to the results of the study. The information that is available, however, suggests that the actual levels of Australian equity in these projects are of the orders quoted by the honourable senator.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) and (6) Under the Foreign Takeovers Act and the foreign investment policy, approval is not required for investments of a purely portfolio nature. For the purposes of determining the standing of a project under the Australian equity participation guidelines, the effect of foreign portfolio shareholdings in the participants in the project on the level of Australian equity is normally disregarded, except in the case of uranium projects (where individual holdings of less than 10 per cent are disregarded in the absence of special circumstances), and in cases where the aggregate foreign portfolio shareholdings in a participant amounts to 40 per cent or more. The treatment accorded to foreign portfolio equity investment under the foreign investment policy is in recognition of the fact that, by comparison with foreign direct equity investment, it provides Australia with access to overseas funds on a basis that does not involve foreign control. Under Section 36 of the Foreign Takeovers Act 1975, the Treasurer may require information where 'he has reason to believe that a person is capable of giving information or producing documents relating to matters that are relevant to the exercise by the Treasurer of his powers under this Act'. This power may be used in relation to foreign investment proposals that are subject to the Act. In other cases, there is reliance upon the co-operation of the parties to the proposal in seeking any required information. Information as to the beneficial ownership of nominee shareholdings is sought in those cases where such information is of potential significance for the purposes of the consideration of a foreign investment proposal against the requirements of the Government's foreign investment policy, and careful consideration is given by the Government to those cases where the size of foreign portfolio shareholdings in a participant in a proposal would have implications for the policy's objectives regarding Australian equity participation.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is, of course, concerned to ensure that Australians should have opportunities to participate as fully and effectively as practicable in the ownership and control of the country's natural resources and industries, and considers that the present features of the foreign investment policy are being effective in achieving this objective. These features include the Australian equity participation guidelines, which provide opportunities for Australian ownership and control of natural resource projects, and the naturalisation provisions, which provide an incentive for companies that are predominantly foreign-owned to introduce higher Australian ownership and Australian control.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Under the Memorandum of Understanding between the Commonwealth and the Northern Territory, special arrangements were entered into in relation to revenues from uranium production in the Northern Territory. Unlike other minerals, which have been vested in the Crown in right of the Northern Territory, ownership of uranium and other substances prescribed under the Atomic Energy Act continues to be vested in the Crown in right of the Commonwealth. However, so as not to put the Northern Territory in a disadvantaged position as a result of this, the Commonwealth makes an additional annual grant to the Northern Territory of an amount in lieu of uranium royalties at a rate of 1.25 per cent of the value of production less certain allowable deductions. These arrangements were agreed to on the basis that payment of the grant would be conditional on the Northern Territory ensuring that the terms of stamp duties and similar charges applying to mining agreements or to financial transactions in respect of such agreements are in line with those that apply in the States. The $1.02m grant referred to by the honourable senator is the estimated 1981-82 payment under these arrangements.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 13 October 1981, (Hansard, page 1092) Senator Foreman asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Resources, the following question, without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer the Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Resources to the latest survey of the economy undertaken by the Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research economists which suggests that an increasing proportion of retail sales is drawing on imports. Will the Minister indicate specifically how much of private final demand is being met from imports rather than from current domestic production? Is the Minister aware that if this trend continues it will prohibit growth of Australian manufacturing industries and prevent thousands of Australians from obtaining jobs? Is the Government deliberately turning a blind eye to this trend in order to satisfy the whims of the farmers, who desperately want to see a devaluation of the Australian dollar?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Trade and Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> It is not possible to indicate precisely the extent to which private final demand is being serviced through imports rather than through current domestic production. There is a measure, however, which is commonly used to estimate the impact of imports on the domestic economy. This measure shows the ratio of imports of goods and services to gross national expenditure (which is defined as the total expenditure, both public and private, on final goods and services bought by Australian residents within a given period). In 1980-81 imports of goods and services accounted for 18.7 per cent of gross national expenditure compared with the long term average share of 16.5 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> The honourable senator may be interested to know that the increase in the importance of imports in 1980-81 was largely due to a sharp rise in imports of capital equipment. In 1980-81, imports of capital equipment (excluding transport equipment) rose by 29.8 per cent compared with an increase in total imports of 16.9 per cent and a rise in imports of consumer goods (including imports of passenger motor vehicles and food and beverages) of only 8.4 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> It was entirely appropriate that imports grew strongly in 1980-81 at a time when domestic demand also grew strongly and when, in particular, business fixed investment rose by 21.4 per cent in real terms. Without imports supplementing domestic supplies, the economy could have been subject to severe excess demand pressures with severe inflationary consequences.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Education has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) The overall levels of funding for tertiary institutions for 1982-84 in the guidelines announced by the Minister for Education on 4 June 1981 were based on a Budget policy of maximum expenditure restraint for tertiary education, as well as the Government's concern at the proliferation of institutions, and its intention that the consolidation of institutions should result in genuine amalgamations and real saving of resources. The Government has since approved the distribution of these funds as recommended by the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission, on the basis of a reallocation of effort by institutions and taking account of the Government's consolidation measures. There will be no overall additional costs to the tertiary education system as a result of these decisions. Payments to staff of individual institutions will be the responsibility of the institutions which are the employing authorities, and the States.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) When the Government announced its decision in the context of the Review of Commonwealth Functions to rationalise 30 colleges of advanced education it took account of the advice of the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission but decided to accelerate the process and wished to reach agreement with each State concerning rationalisation matters by the end of 1981. Further consultations are continuing with New South Wales and Victoria on the remaining institutions listed for amalgamation.</PARA>
<PARA> The States Grants (Tertiary Education Assistance) legislation gives the Minister some flexibility for funding in 1982 if final agreement has not been reached by the end of 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has asked the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission for advice on the grants that should be provided for recurrent purposes for the colleges involved. The individual grants will be recommended by the Commission after it has had an opportunity to consult with the State higher education co-ordinating authorities. The grants for 1982 for these colleges will be provided on the clear understanding that consolidation arrangements will be actively pursued during that year.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) A major objective of the policy of consolidating single purpose teacher education institutions into larger more broadly based institutions is to increase the particular opportunities available to students. The higher education institutions will be better able to respond to changing needs and to widen access to a greater range of more relevant courses.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) There have been extensive consultations between the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission and the State Co-ordinating Authorities concerned. The Commonwealth's policy has been that it was a matter for the States to develop particular arrangements in relation to individual institutions so as to achieve a more efficient use of available resources. Agreements between the Commonwealth and the States on satisfactory proposals have now been reached on all but seven of the original 30 institutions listed for amalgamation.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator Durack</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Courses are grouped and start at the same time. It may be up to 12 weeks before the next group of courses commence. Persons who apply after the commencement of a group of courses have to wait until the next group of courses starts. Those persons who apply now (November 1981) will have to wait until early 1982 to commence a course.</PARA>
<PARA> Those persons attending courses at the Migrant Education centre at Caltex House or attending courses at other migrant education centres in Sydney are drawn from the total pool of applicants for courses at community migrant education centres in Sydney. Following consultations between the New South Wales Adult Migrant Education Service and my Department, I am advised that at the end of October 1981 there were 437 applicants for full time on-arrival courses at community centres, 472 applicants for full time courses in the ongoing phase of the program and 88 for part time courses in that phase. Those applicants are expected to be offered places in courses commenced early in 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> About 17,500 persons attend courses and other learning arrangements in the Adult Migrant Education Program at any one time in New South Wales. The number waiting should also be seen in that context.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Through its complete acceptance and implementation of the recommendations of the Review of Post-Arrival Programs and Services for Migrants (the Galbally Report), the Government has clearly demonstrated its recognition of the role which the acquisition of English language proficiency plays in enabling migrants to have an opportunity to fully participate in and contribute to Australian society.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) A migrant is not limited to a 10 week course. The Adult Migrant Education Program provides an initial English language course of up to 10 weeks in length for new arrivals with no or limited fluency in English. That program provides further English language learning opportunities through a range of full and part time courses and other learning arrangements in the ongoing phase of the Adult Migrant Education Program. Nationally during 1981-82 over 16,000 people are expected to attend on-arrival English courses, and in addition people will enrol in more than 100,000 places in the on going phase of the Program.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Teachers in the State Adult Migrant Education Services are employed by State authorities. A number of the teachers in those services have worked in them for some years. There does not seem to be any undue or abnormal wastage or turnover of staff. The Adult Migrant Education Program is a special program of limited size and is thus different to other broader areas of education. The Adult Migrant Education Program must also be staffed and organised in a way which allows the services within the program to be provided to meet the changing needs arising from variations in migrant intake and location. For that reason the most appropriate arrangements would seem to be a mix of full time and part time staff. Abut 120 full time permanent teachers are employed on the staff of the New South Wales AMES. A joint working party has been set up to examine staffing arrangements in that Service.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) The Government's policies relating to Australian industry participation (AIP) will apply to the purchase of 10 new P3C aircraft for the RAAF.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Mark 10 Mortar is being progressively removed from River Class destroyers during their half life modernisation. The last system will be withdrawn from service in 1984, having been replaced in each ship by Ship Launched Torpedo (SLT) tubes capable of launching Mark 44 or Mark 46 torpedoes. Ships of this class will continue to be able to detect submarines operating in less than 100 feet of water, and attacks could be conducted by directing aircraft to attack with depth charges, if the depth of water precluded attack by torpedoes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) DDG and FFG class ships can detect submarines in less than 100 feet of water, and attacks could be conducted by co-operating aircraft with depth charges if the depth of water precluded attack by torpedoes.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Approximately 175,000 square nautical miles of Australian territorial waters are comprised of water less than 100 feet deep. This represents approximately 20 per cent of total Australian territorial waters. However of this most is:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) within the Great Barrier Reef;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) off the North West Coast; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) within Bass Strait,</PARA>
<PARA>in areas not navigable by submarines. Of the rest the 100 foot line is approximately one to two nautical miles from low water mark for most of the coast. It should be noted that dived operations for submarines inside waters less than 100 feet deep are extremely hazardous. Conventional submarines cannot remain submerged in water depths less then 50 feet, and nuclear submarines in depths less than 75 feet, due to their physical height from keel to fin top.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Combat radius in the configuration specified would be dependent on the number of external fuel tanks carried and the mission profile (speeds and heights) flown. Exact combat radius data of the type requested bears both United States and Australian security classifications and is not available for public disclosure. Attention is drawn to the data provided to the Australian press by the Department of Defence on 20 October 1981. In these documents an FA18 strike radius 'in excess of 1000 km' was mentioned.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Present basing plans are two squadrons and an operational conversion unit at RAAF Base Williamtown, New South Wales, and one squadron at RAAF Base Darwin, Northern Territory.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) FA18 type aircraft at typical combat take-off weights could use all existing RAAF airfields except Point Cook, Victoria, and Gin Gin, Western Australia (the latter is a satellite airfield for RAAF Base Pearce, Western Australia).</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The M61A1 gun will be manufactured in the US by General Electric Corporation, Burlington, Vermont.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) The type of 20mm ammunition for use with the FA18 aircraft is the subject of a technical evaluation currently being undertaken by the RAAF. The study is scheduled for completion by 1 July 1982.</PARA>
<PARA> Assuming favourable results from this study, a submission has been made for financial approval to establish a local capability for the manufacture of ammunition subject to completion of appropriate licencing arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) It is estimated that, over 20 years, each FA18 will require six replacement sets of barrels for its cannon; a total of 450 sets is required for the entire fleet, therefore. A set of barrels consist of six single barrels plus fittings. Unserviceable guns will be overhauled at a RAAF facility. Replacement of complete cannon assemblies is not envisaged.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 8 April 1981 (Hansard, page 1205) Senator Evans asked me, as Minister representing the the Minister for Administrative Services, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My question is directed to the Minister for Administrative Services or, if he prefers, to the Attorney-General, because it is about the Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence. With the appointment now announced of the new Director of the Bureau, and with its operations due to commence this month, will the Minister table all the papers relating to the formation of the Bureau which was announced on 6 February? Does the Government still claim, as it was certainly claiming last year, that the establishment of the Bureau is in accordance with the recommendation of the Australian Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs, chaired by Mr Justice Williams, when it knows, or it ought to know, that such recommendations of that Royal Commission related only to intelligence associated with drug offences and not to criminal intelligence generally? What steps, if any, have been taken to ensure that adequate safeguards will be produced to surround the creation and operation of this Bureau, especially to meet the concerns of the Australian Law Reform Commission relating to the dissemination of information obtained by it and procedures whereby persons can check information about them in certain circumstances to see whether it is misleading or untruthful? What steps have been taken to ensure that the Bureau will be responsible and accountable to at least one elected government and parliament in the Federation, given the notorious difficulties which have been associated with other such exercises in co-operative federalism?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Bureau of Criminal Intelligence (ABCI) was formed by agreement between the Commonwealth, the States and the Northern Territory Governments. Accordingly, the tabling of the agreement would depend on all signatories agreeing to such action. I am consulting with the Police Ministers of the States and the Northern Territory Governments seeking their assent to the tabling of the agreement, if possible, simultaneously, both in the Commonwealth Parliament and in the State and Northern Territory Parliaments.</PARA>
<PARA> The establishment of the ABCI is in accordance with the major part of the recommendations of the Australian Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs (ARCID). The ABCI was established for the purpose of gathering intelligence on organised crime, with an emphasis on drug trafficking. While the ARCID recommendations concentrated on drug matters, Judge Williams specifically commented that the proposed Criminal Drug Intelligence Centres could serve a broader purpose than this:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 11 June 1981 (Hansard, pages 3019-20) Senator Coleman asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Health, a question without notice concerning the visit by Dr I. Bayley to Australian spinal units and media advertising which glamorises dangerous behaviour.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Health has provided the following information:</PARA>
<PARA> I am aware of the visit earlier this year to Australia of Dr Ian Bayley. I understand Dr Bayley, who is Director of the Spinal Injuries Unit of the Royal National Orthopaedic Hospital in the United Kingdom, saw value in visiting spinal units in Australia to assist in the development of the first such unit in London.</PARA>
<PARA> While he was here Dr Bayley was able to observe some of the preventive work being promoted by our Australian specialists in spinal injuries. One of their efforts in prevention is an audio-visual kit on the prevention of spinal cord injury. Dr John Yeo, Director of the Spinal Unit at the Royal North Shore Hospital in Sydney, has sent me a copy of the kit.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe it is particularly appropriate that during this International Year of Disabled Persons efforts of this kind are being made. Much of the publicity this year has been directed towards the effects of disabling injuries. To complement this, I understand that prevention displays, including the audi-visual kit, have been on show in some Sydney metropolitan banks in an attempt to make the public more aware of the risks of spinal injury.</PARA>
<PARA> I would encourage responsible industries to join with the medical profession and my Department in promoting greater public awareness of the need for greater care and healthier life-style practices. My Department's involvement in media advertising for health and safety included the pilot National Health Promotion Program during 1980 and some projects approved for funding under the Government's Health Services Research and Development Grants Program. Each of these programs has sought methods of effectively increasing public awareness concerning health factors.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is funding a project under the latter program to evaluate the learning of behaviour from a television program for primary school children in New South Wales. The project aims to develop positive attitudes and behaviour towards health and personal development, and to promote awareness of a range of specific health problems and harmful health practices in children between the ages of six and 12 years. The effect of the television media on safety behaviour will be analysed.</PARA>
<PARA> The connection between allegedly dangerous behaviours promoted in media advertising and morbidity or disability is difficult to establish. Epidemiological studies may assist. Under the Health Services Research and Development Grants Program, the Neurological Society of Australia has received funds to establish the basis for a national plan for the reduction of mortality and morbidity from neurotrauma (head injuries).</PARA>
<PARA> The Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations has informed my Department that every attempt is made to limit the potentially dangerous aspects of advertisements for which it is responsible. This will often include obtaining expert medical opinion and ensuring that safety facets are obvious.</PARA>
<PARA> On the matter of approaches to advertising the honourable senator will no doubt be aware that an advertising code of ethics produced by the Australian Advertising Industry Council provides for self-regulation within the advertising industry. Part of this code states:</PARA>
<PARA> 'Advertisements shall not exploit children nor contain anything which might result in their physical, mental or moral harm'.</PARA>
<PARA>The Council encourages inquiries in the event that a particular media advertisement is considered antagonistic to the code and I would hope that people would advise the Council of any advertisements which they believe should be brought to its attention.</PARA>

What equipment is proposed to be used? What cost will be involved if this type of transport is undertaken?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> I have read the article referred to by Senator Jones. The headline 'Military Plan to Beat Union Ban' and the lead sentence of the article are misleading in that there is not now, nor was there at the time the article was written, any Defence plan specifically designed to employ the Defence Force in shipment of uranium overseas.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 15 October 1981 (Hansard, page 1271), Senator Giles asked me, as the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) How many apprenticeship and technical training positions are available in the Defence Force and in the Department of Defence civilian workforce.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) In which trades and technical occupations are these training opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Where are the positions located.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) How many applications have been received from women and how many have been successful.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) From which classifications are women excluded and on what grounds.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Are both young women and young men able to train as pilots with the Royal Australian Air Force.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) What steps have been taken to ensure that the recruiting material and promotion material are designed to attract applications from young women whose training needs are too often neglected.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) There were 3204 apprenticeship and technical training positions in the Defence Force and 1333 positions in the Department of Defence civilian workforce on 30 June 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Defence force youth apprentice schemes provide training opportunities in the trade classifications of motor mechanic, fitter and turner, carpenter and joiner, plumber and gasfitters, electrical mechanic, electrical fitter, electronic tradesmen, and aircraft mechanic. Adult apprentice and other technical training opportunities are provided in the fields of radio, electronics, aircraft engineering, motor mechanics and metal machining. The Defence civilian apprentice scheme covers the same trade classifications as the Defence Force scheme plus the classifications of electro plater, painter and sign writer, ship wright, boiler maker/welder, instrument maker and sail maker. Other civilian technical training opportunities are in the fields of drafting, naval architecture, engineering, science, navy systems, computers and data processing.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Defence civilian trainees are employed at all of the Department's dockyards, research establishments and in numerous Defence Force establishments located in New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia and the Australian Capital Territory. Defence Force technical training positions are located in Victoria and New South Wales at HMAS Nirimba, HMAS Albatross, Army Apprentices School, RAFME Training Centre, RAAF School of Technical Training and the RAAF School of Radio.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Ninety women applied for trade and technical training positions with the Department of Defence civilian workforce for 1981, of these, 20 were successful. Relatively few women have sought similar training with the Services but, as the records of applications do not show which applications are from women and which are from men, it has not been possible to determine the actual number of women applicants. During 1981 there have been 53 women selected for adult apprentice or technical training in the Services.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Women are not excluded from any of the Defence civilian apprentice or technical training categories. Within the Defence Force there are, as a matter of policy, some restrictions imposed on their employment in such areas as sea duty, combatant duty and in certain types of field units. Therefore, women are not accepted in the Service apprentice and technical training programmes in which arrangements for training, career employment and progression involve employment in the areas subject to restriction. Presently women are not accepted into the Service's youth apprentice schemes. With the exception of adult apprentice training in the electrical technical communication category there is no provision for female technical training in the RAN. Current policy does not prevent women from entering most of the Army trade training areas however it does prevent them from serving in specific units on completion of training. Women are not excluded from entering any of the RAAF technical musterings.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) In compliance with the Government's policy on the employment of women in combatant roles, women are not accepted into pilot training in the Royal Australian Air Force.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) The Defence Force recruiting material used for the promotion of apprentice and technical training opportunities is designed to either encourage aspirants to seek more information or to provide applicants with further counselling to reinforce the decision. In cases where opportunities do not exist, no attempt is made to attract a female enquiry. In other cases no discrimination is made in the terms used. Recruiting material for the Department's civilian workforce includes material that is specifically designed to encourage young women to seek apprentice and technical training positions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 27 October 1981 (Hansard, page 1633) Senator Hearn asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Health, a question without notice concerning funding of the activities of family planning associations.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Health has provided the following information:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government recognises the importance of education in family planning and, for this reason, continues to provide financial assistance under the Family Planning Program for education, information and training activities undertaken by various family planning organisations, including the State and Territory Family Planning Associations.</PARA>
<PARA> I should emphasise, however, that Family Planning Program funds are appropriated annually by the Parliament and are finite. Therefore, it is not always possible to fund family planning organisations to the full extent of their stated requirements-nor has it been the Government's intention to do so. While the Government has continued to make as large a contribution as possible to family planning education activities, it has always been made clear to family planning organisations that there was no unlimited undertaking to underwrite those activities. However, considerable care is taken by my Department to recommend to me for approval Family Planning Program grants at levels that will enable the activities of Family Planning Associations to remain viable.</PARA>
<PARA> As the Program's appropriation is finite, increased allocations to one organisation can only be made at the expense of other organisations supported under the Program. Therefore, existing commitments to on-going activities do not enable increased financial assistance to be made available under the Family Planning Program for 1981-82.</PARA>
<PARA> It will be noted that, under the Family Planning Program, each organisation receiving Program support must accept responsibility for setting its own priorities within the context of the resources available to it, and I am sure this is a situation which the organisations accept as appropriate.</PARA>

<PARA> My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Acting Minister for Administrative Services, refers to a report in last week's Adelaide Advertiser which stated that the Australian Federal Police are involved in the inquiry being conducted by the South Australian Attorney-General into allegations of corruption in that State's police force. Can the Minister tell the Senate whether any members of the Federal Police are under investigation in South Australia? What involvement, if any, is there by members of the Federal Police in the inquiry being conducted by the South Australian Attorney-General? Further, will the Minister tell the Senate to which authority officer will report in the first instance?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> I am advised by the Australian Federal Police (AFP) that on 15 October 1981, the Commissioner of the South Australia (S.A.) Police asked the Commissioner of the AFP to provide a senior officer to assist the S.A. Police with an internal investigation into allegations of corruption against certain members of the S.A.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 29 October 1981 (Hansard, page 1803) Senator McLaren asked me the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I preface my question to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs by reminding him that on 17 September I raised in the adjournment debate the matter of a mail van being burnt south of Meningie. The answer I received from Senator Baume was that the van was carrying mail and some 96 bags of mail were destroyed. Why is it that the Minister's Department took up to three weeks to honour cheques which were payable by it to recipients of repatriation benefits in the Mount Gambier area, when the social security cheques which come under the jurisdiction of Senator Chaney were able to be paid almost immediately to people who went to the Department of Social Security and said that they had not received their cheques? People who were expecting their repatriation benefit cheques had to wait up to three weeks. What was the reason for the inordinate delay in making payment to these people and causing them some undue suffering?</PARA>
<PARA> The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> I am informed that the accident occurred at Meningie on 16 September 1981 when an Australia Post contractor's van was burnt causing damage to the mail bags being conveyed. The mail bags contained pension cheques from my Department and cheques from the Department of Social Security.</PARA>
<PARA> There were 930 cheques from my Department involved in the accident. Of these, 124 were returned from the various post offices involved as being too badly damaged or having an indecipherable address. As these cheques were received by the Branch Office in Adelaide, replacement cheques were issued. The last of the 124 was returned to the Department on 25 September 1981 and replacement cheques for these were issued on the same day.</PARA>
<PARA> From 17 September to 27 October 1981, advice was received from some pensioners that their cheques for the 17 September payday had not been received. Duplicate cheques were issued to the pensioners involved immediately the advice was received. In this period 201 duplicate cheques were issued.</PARA>
<PARA> A check has been made of the pensioners whose cheques would have been involved in the accident, to identify anyone who had not presented the original cheque for payment or had not requested a duplicate cheque. This check showed that there were 36 pensioners in this category. They have been contacted to advise them of the accident and of the procedure to obtain a duplicate cheque if the original has not been received.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) It was estimated that the average number of eligible persons in a full year would be in the order of 1 million-about 500,000 claimants and about 500,000 dependants. A rough breakdown of these figures is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Claimants Dependants Total</PARA>
<PARA>Unemployed and special beneficiaries  340,000 200,000 540,000 Low income persons  175,000 290,000 465,000 Migrants/refugees  25,000 25,000 50,000</PARA>
<PARA>  Total  540,000 515,000 1,055,000</PARA>
<PARA> These figures can be taken as broad orders of magnitude only primarily because:</PARA>
<PARA> the categories themselves are not mutually exclusive; unemployment beneficiaries and migrants, for example, may choose to apply for a six-monthly card on the basis of low income; and</PARA>
<PARA> there is no up-to-date data on the income distribution of Australian families-the figures for low income persons were derived from Australian Bureau of Statistics data in relation to 1978-79.</PARA>
<PARA> Figures for unemployment beneficiaries and migrants/refugees were based on data provided by the Department of the Treasury and Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, respectively.</PARA>
<PARA> A proportion of low income people and migrants/refugees may not take up their entitlement or may defer applying until they have a need to seek health care or have received health care. It should therefore be noted that the above estimates for these persons relate to the number eligible and not the number likely to take up entitlement.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) On the basis of the initial level of applications and the number of recipients of Unemployment and Special Benefit, it is estimated that the number of cards issued in each category in a full year will be about</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Low income 270,000,</PARA>

<PARA> (1) to (6) To my knowledge such statements have not been made in external authoritative submissions such as the Auditor-General's report. However, views have been put forward from time to time along the lines that the provision of a greater number of staff in the Department of Social Security may lead to greater accuracy in payments made by the Department and increases in the recoveries of overpayments. Generally, there is a realisation that on a cost/benefits basis the provision of additional staff has to be carefully balanced so that the cost of the employment of such staff is not greater than the value of incorrect payments avoided or additional overpayments recovered. When overpayments are identified the major constraint on recovering those overpayments is the difficulty many debtors face in paying, not insufficient staff.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The following table shows the latest available information for Australia on the number of special benefit recipients by category (as at 29 May 1981).</PARA>
<PARA> Since difficulties have been experienced in the past with the inclusion of manual payments of special benefit into the computer statistical system, as well as with the coding of characteristics of special benefit recipients, these statistics should be treated as estimates only.</PARA>
<PARA> More detailed statistics, including a more detailed set of categories of special benefit, will be available when the National Benefits System (NBS) is introduced in all States and Territories. However, to date only South Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory have been converted to the new system. NBS statistics on categories of special benefit are still being tested but they should be available for these States early next year. It is expected that the remaining States and Territory will be converted to NBS by July 1982.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) An evaluation of International Year of Disabled Persons will be undertaken at a national meeting of disabled people from each State and Territory. The meeting is to be held under the auspices of the National Committee of Non-Government Organisations for IYDP and will report its findings and recommendations to the final meeting of the Council of Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers for IYDP.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Currently 8 full-time and 1 part-time staff are employed in the Department of Social Security's IYDP Unit. The estimated annual cost of maintaining the Unit at this time is $199,000. However, during 1981 there have been up to 15 full-time staff employed in the IYDP Unit.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) My Department considers it desirable that persons with handicaps should have a major say in the running of their working and living environments within institutional frameworks. This is in keeping with the major aim of IYDP which is that disabled people should be entitled to full participation and equality in the community. While respecting the independent role of voluntary organisations the department nevertheless encourages participation of handicapped persons in the management of sheltered employment facilities, accommodation and other services funded under the Handicapped Persons Assistance Act.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) There is no plan to re-introduce an assets test at this stage. I am concerned, however, that, since the change from the means test to the income test in 1976, there appears to have been a marked increase in the number of people, some with quite substantial amounts of money, who are contriving to make themselves eligible for the pension by participating in artificial income avoidance schemes and by placing significant sums in non-interest bearing accounts. Such practices restrict the Government's ability to provide assistance to those in genuine need. The Government will be moving to counter such practices by strengthening the existing provisions in the Social Services Act which deal with the deprivation of income. I plan to introduce legislation on this matter during the Autumn sitting.</PARA>
<PARA> Some details of the intended new arrangements in respect of non-interest bearing accounts were announced recently. The intention is that amounts of up to $2,000 (for a single person) and up to $3,000 (for a married couple) held in non-interest bearing accounts will be exempt from the new arrangements. Allowance would be made for specific situations where such amounts were exceeded for reasons not related to pension entitlement, for example, during the period between the sale of one home and the purchase of another.</PARA>
<PARA> There are powers contained in sections 16 and 141 of the Social Services Act giving the Director-General of the Department authority to investigate pensioners' private financial arrangements for the purpose of determining pension and fringe benefit entitlement.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Special investment schemes for pensioners are one possibility which will be considered by the Government as part of its ongoing review of retirement arrangements. No specific options are under consideration at this time.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 28 October 1981 (Hansard, page 1720) Senator Georges asked me a question without notice concerning the problem addressed in the Auditor-General's report about the overpayment of benefits by my department.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The Auditor-General reported that the accumulated amount of overpayments outstanding at 30 June 1981 was $45m. The debts raised during 1980-81 amounted to $27.2m which was about 0.3 per cent of the department's total expenditure from the National Welfare Fund.</PARA>
<PARA> Overpayments are due to a number of factors including misrepresentation (a small proportion), mistakes or omissions by clients or delay by them in advising the department about changes in their circumstances. Excess payments are an unavoidable feature of any social security administration.</PARA>
<PARA> The amount of debts raised each year has been increasing, primarily because of increases in rates of payment through indexation and increasing numbers of pensioners and beneficiaries.</PARA>
<PARA> The accumulated amount of overpayments outstanding has also increased. Recovery of debts from people with limited means has to be effected in a sympathetic manner and in accordance with capacity to repay. This is the major constraint on the speed with which my department can recover overpayments.</PARA>
<PARA> The percentage of debts recovered to overpayments raised has, nonetheless, improved progressively from 55 per cent in 1977-78 to 61 per cent in 1980-81. My department aims to continue this improvement, but is not being assisted in its endeavours by union work-bans in some of the department's regional offices, an issue which the Director-General is currently addressing.</PARA>
<PARA> The department has a policy of pursuing recovery of overpayments, and this is being enforced. However, given the nature of many of the overpayments and the circumstances of the individuals involved, there will always be difficulties in effecting recovery quickly.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 18 November 1981 (Hansard page 2266) Senator Button asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Communications, the following question, without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is it a fact that there are a number of illegal television transmitters transmitting programs to the general public in Victoria and Western Australia which are not licensed? If so, what is the Government's attitude to this problem.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> My Department is aware of several such transmitters. They are usually low-power installations used to translate signals from a station whose original signals are too weak for satisfactory reception by a standard receiving apparatus in the area concerned. Unless they interfere with other services, my Department has tried to administer the law regarding such transmissions in a sympathetic and flexible manner. Generally speaking those responsible are notified of the relevant legal provisions and encouraged to submit a planning proposal to the Department so that their service can be legitimised.</PARA>
<PARA> Unfortunately, the planning and licensing process as it presently stands is slow and quite complex. Consequently, a Working Party on Revised Planning Procedures (representing broadcasters, Telecom and my Department) has been established and is scheduled to make recommendations for a less cumbersome system in January 1982. I have also approved circulation of a draft paper entitled 'Self-Help Television Reception for Small Communities', which is directed towards enabling small communities to obtain television reception at minimum cost well in advance of available methods. I have arranged for a copy of this draft paper to be made available to Senator Button for information.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 30 April 1981 (Hansard, page 1541) Senator Button asked me a question without notice concerning the administration of the new health care arrangements by the Department of Social Security.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Social Security is responsible for classifying the disadvantaged groups defined in the Government's health statement.</PARA>
<PARA> For applicants in the low income group, eligibility is determined in relation to the claimant's income over the four-week period prior to his application or prior to the time of his treatment. Once eligibility for a card has been established, the card is issued covering a period of six months. At the expiration of six months, eligibility is reviewed and eligible people are issued with a new card for a further six months.</PARA>
<PARA> Only in specified circumstances is it necessary for the person to return the card prior to the expiration of the six months, for example, where his income in any four-week period equals or exceeds 125 per cent of the specified limit or where there is a reduction in the number of his dependants. The card holder is required to notify the Department if his circumstances change.</PARA>
<PARA> In cases where entitlement is lost, a card may again be re-issued as soon as the eligibility conditions are met and an application has been received.</PARA>
<PARA> A Health Care card for an immigrant or refugee is issued for a period of six months and is not renewable.</PARA>
<PARA> Where a recipient of unemployment or special benefit satisfies the relevant income test, he is issued with a card each fortnight.</PARA>
<PARA> In most cases, Health Care cards are issued by post. Only in cases where a delay would otherwise occur in establishing eligibility is an applicant requested to attend an office of the Department.</PARA>
<PARA> It is estimated that between nine and 10 million cards will be issued in a year.</PARA>

<PARA> These figures have been extracted from records of agencies preceding the AFP.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police has supplied the following additional information.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner and his State Police colleagues have chosen to concentrate their resources, sometimes as joint task forces, in other cases by combining intelligence and staff, on securing evidence to bring about the conviction of financiers and others masterminding drug operations rather than seeking apparent short-term success in terms of quantities seized at the distribution end of the trafficking chain.</PARA>
<PARA> These changed police strategies are in line with the recommendations of the Australian Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs.</PARA>
<PARA> While seizure amounts are down, it is a matter of record that major crime figures have already been brought to justice and lengthy and exacting operations against others are beginning to bear fruit.</PARA>
<PARA> An example is provided by the recent Zampaglione case in Victoria, where State and Federal Police co-operation resulted in the conviction of five offenders for conspiracy to import heroin. The two main conspirators received prison sentences of 25 and 20 years, while two others each received 15 years. No heroin was seized in these arrests but the amount those convicted might still be handling had they not been brought to justice is incalculable.</PARA>

<PARA> Normally my department would expect to have approximately half of its proposals included in the Leasing Program for a given financial year. However, in view of the recommendation of the Review of Commonwealth Functions, the Government's general constraint on expenditure and the urgent need to relocate three of the Department's existing offices (requiring new leases) no new offices will be opened from the provisions of this year's Leasing Program.</PARA>
<PARA> I must point out, however, that five offices have already opened or will open this financial year in respect of leases which we entered into with building owners/developers prior to 30 June 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> Of these five, Knox Regional Office in Victoria opened on 3 August 1981. Belmont (Victoria), Heidelberg (Victoria), Edwardstown (South Australia) and Perth East (Western Australia) are yet to be opened.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister Assisting the Prime Minister has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) While comprehensive information is not maintained, virtually all Commonwealth Government departments are believed now to use visual display units.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Based upon a 1979 survey of actual units installed and anticipated growth, more than 5,000 are believed to be in use for a variety of purposes. Usage patterns vary greatly and it is not possible to estimate the proportion in full time use.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Similarly, it is not possible to estimate the number of operators working on these units full time. Most of the Commonwealth's 73 Word Processing Typists would do so however, while a significant proportion of its 738 Computer Operators, 2188 Data Processing Operators, 1833 Computer Systems Officers and some other classifications use visual display units in various ways. Those figures relate to full time Public Service Act staff as at December 1980.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) and (5) The need for such a survey has not been demonstrated. Health and safety issues associated with the operation of visual display units have been considered by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NH&amp;MRC), which has produced an occupational health guide on 'Vision and Eyesight Tests for Visual Display Terminal Operators' and a draft occupational health guide on the 'Use of Screen-based Equipment'. The Director-General of Health has endorsed the NH&amp;MRC occupational health guide for application to Commonwealth staff.</PARA>
<PARA> In a memorandum issued on 23 October 1981, the Public Service Board advised departments, statutory authorities and staff organisations of the guide and of other authoritative sources of advice on the appropriate conditions for operation of visual display units. The memorandum notes the need for proper consultation with staff when screen based equipment is introduced, in accordance with the spirit of standing Board guidelines on joint staff/management consultation on technological change in the Australian Public Service. In keeping with these guidelines, the Board consulted with departments and staff associations on the issues covered in the memorandum, which include provision for eyesight tests under the supervision of the Department of Health.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has providedd the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Detailed statistics are not available. It is estimated that:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Some 900 wards under the Immigration (Guardianship of Children) Act have arrived since 1976 and that about 320 of these are presently under 18 years. It is estimated these are approximately distributed across the main centres of settlement as follows-</PARA>

<PARA> Queensland-25</PARA>
<PARA> South Australia-30</PARA>
<PARA> Western Australia-20</PARA>
<PARA> Other-5</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Since 1975, some 2,900 refugee children under 18 years at the time of arrival have been admitted in the care of relatives (other than parents). It is estimated that 1,800 of these are presently under 18 years. Distribution by State/Territory is not known. It is however estimated that these are approximately distributed across the main centres of settlement as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> New South Wales-740</PARA>
<PARA> Victoria-600</PARA>
<PARA> Queensland-130</PARA>
<PARA> South Australia-150</PARA>
<PARA> Western Australia-130</PARA>
<PARA> Other-50</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Detailed statistics are not available. It is estimated that 11,000 persons presently under 24 years but between 18-24 years at the time of arrival, have entered Australia since 1975.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The 'special benefits' were payments made by the Department of Social Security under provisions under the Social Security Act.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) I am informed that following an examination of the legal position by the Department of Social Security, it was concluded that special benefits could not, as a general rule, be payable to full-time students.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) This information is not available.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Advice was given to the refugees in receipt of special benefit that existing payments would remain undisturbed for the remainder of 1979 scholastic year but payments would not be continued beyond the end of 1979. Where necessary, counselling was given by social workers from the Department of Social Security or Immigration and Ethnic Affairs.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) While difficulties in this area were brought to my attention soon after my appointment to the portfolio of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in December 1979, records available to me do not show the precise date on which I was first informed.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) There are two general Commonwealth schemes of student assistance under which full-time students in year 11 or year 12 studying towards a matriculation qualification may be eligible for assistance. These are the Adult Secondary Education Assistance Scheme (ASEAS) and the Secondary Allowances Scheme (SAS), both administered by the Department of Education. The two schemes have been in operation for some years. Both include refugee students among their beneficiaries but ASEAS is more likely to be relevant to students who do not have the benefit of support from parents living in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> The provisions of ASEAS are designed to assist adult students returning to secondary study after a significant break. To be eligible, a student must have turned 19 by 1 January of the year for which benefits are sought and must have been away from full-time secondary study for a minimum total period of two years in the previous five. Other conditions relate to such things as residence status, previous attempts at matriculation and tertiary studies undertaken. The major benefit is a means-tested living allowance with a maximum value of $49.67 per week. Refugee students generally qualify for the maximum allowance. Assistance is at present provided for only a single year of full-time matriculation study.</PARA>
<PARA> The Secondary Allowances Scheme (SAS) is specifically a scheme of assistance to needy parents to help them keep their children at school for the final two secondary years (years 11 and 12). The allowance of up to $660 per annum, which has been increased to $726 for 1982, is means-tested on parental income. Where students are supported by persons other than parents those persons may receive the allowance, subject to the usual means test. Refugee students therefore normally qualify for these benefits only if they are in the care of their parents or other persons who satisfy the means test requirements.</PARA>
<PARA> (9) New measures announced in the recent Budget will make the ASEAS and SAS schemes much more accessible to refugee students in future years. From the beginning of 1982 two years of benefits (i.e. for both years 11 and 12) will be available under ASEAS to refugee and other students who have not previously advanced beyond year 10 in the Australian education system. This is in recognition of the difficulties such students have in completing matriculation studies in a single year. The requirement for a two-year break in secondary studies will also be waived in the case of refugee students.</PARA>
<PARA> A change in the SAS provisions will benefit refugee students without parents in Australia if they are in year 11 or 12 but do not meet the requirements for ASEAS. Such students will be able to apply for and receive SAS benefits on their own behalf. Eligibility will be subject to their own income alone and will not take into account the income of persons other than parents who may be providing support. While this change will not provide a full-scale living allowance to enable such students to live independently, it will at least provide some assistance to students attempting to support themselves from other resources. It is also hoped that, in conjunction with another Budget measure in the Social Security area, it may provide greater incentive for families to take unsupported refugee students into their care. The other measure referred to is an amendment to the Social Services Act which will bring certain refugee children within the definition of 'double orphan' and permit the payment of double orphan's pension to their guardians.</PARA>
<PARA> (10) The decision of the Department of Social Security was immediately brought to the attention of State and Territory welfare authorities by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. It was also raised in such forums as the Australian Refugee Advisory Council and the Migrant Settlement Councils and discussed with interested community organisations.</PARA>
<PARA> (11) The Ministers for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Social Security and Education have received a range of representations from Parliamentarians, community and ethnic organisations and schools concerning problems of refugee students.</PARA>
<PARA> (12) The Government appreciates that as a consequence of their particular circumstances, refugees may not always be able to benefit from provisions made for the general community in relation to such services as schooling, unless special measures are taken.</PARA>
<PARA> The adjustments made to SAS and ASEAS in the last Budget reflect the Government's concern to ensure effective equality in regard to access for refugees to senior secondary schooling, as do amendments to the Social Services Act which provide for the payment of double orphan pension in respect of refugees both of whose parents were not in Australia or whose whereabouts were unknown.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Immigration &amp; Ethnic Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs withdrew its officers to Damascus from the Beirut Embassy in October 1978 when continued hostilities and a breakdown of essential services prevented an acceptable standard of service being provided for applicants for permanent settlement in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> While the less involved temporary entry applications, and the answering of personal enquiries about migration eligibility, were functions that could be handled spontaneously, as and when the public could attend Beirut, that centre lacked the stable and predictable working environment necessary for an immigration processing centre.</PARA>
<PARA> Beirut still clearly lacks the necessary operational stability. In contrast, the Australian Embassy in Damascus, a relatively short distance away, has, since its opening in early 1977, proved to be an accessible centre for the majority of applicants from the region, Lebanon, Syria and Jordan.</PARA>
<PARA> Travel to Damascus, like travel to Beirut can be subject to delay and detours; however, travel within Lebanon is generally much more hazardous than in Syria.</PARA>
<PARA> Very few applicants have been unable to attend Damascus during the three years since the Migration Office was attached to the Embassy there.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Since 1978 the Australian Embassy in Beirut has continued to handle the simple applications for temporary entry and to provide general information on migration eligiblity. It closed temporarily on 21 October 1981 pending an assessment of the security situation in Beirut by the Department of Foreign Affairs, but resumed its temporary entry and other functions on 9 November 1981. The Embassy in Damascus remained accessible throughout.</PARA>
<PARA> From time to time the Department receives requests from Lebanese that they be given immigration interviews in Beirut. For practical operational reasons, however the department cannot conduct frequent or regular interviewing visits away from its immigration processing centre. Nevertheless, when valid reasons have been advanced why certain Lebanese applicants could not travel to Damascus, arrangements have been made for interviews to be conducted at the Embassy in Beirut when a Migration Officer is visiting the city. These arrangements will continue; however the department's experience is that the vast majority of Lebanese applying for permanent settlement in Australia prefer to attend Damascus because of the expeditious and reliable service available at that centre.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator Peter Baume</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answers to the honourable senator's questions are as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Radio Frequency Management Division (RFM) of the Department is aware that some revenue may have been forgone because sufficient staff are not available to fully follow up failure of licensees to renew their licences or to take up licences in the first place. Loss of revenue was mentioned in the Auditor-General's report of March 1981 but the amount was not quantified.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Whether or not revenue is being forgone and to what extent, is very difficult to answer. A Radio License fee is charged to cover the costs incurred in licensing and control of the Radio Frequency spectrum. The amount of the fee is set having regard to the costs of the particular level of activity at the time including staff costs.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) It is not possible to quantify any loss in licence fees directly attributable to staff ceiling effects. However, my Department believes that the majority of radio-communications services in Australia are licensed.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) It is not practicable to ensure that all radiocommunication services are licensed as the costs of total enforcement would be prohibitive. This fact has been known to my Department and my predecessors for many years.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The Government allocated additional funds in 1980-81 to enable the RFM Division to pursue activities related to licence fee collection. This, together with an increased emphasis on ADP processing of Divisional data, and rationalisation and streamlining of divisional staff and procedures should effectively increase revenue to recoup these additional expenditures.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) There has been a review of the various activities of the RFM Division. Some staff resources are being re-allocated to ADP and there are re-arrangements of staffing commitments between central office and state offices. This re-arrangement is necessary to develop computer systems supporting a more efficient licensing system.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Statistician classifies Commonwealth Government gross fixed capital expenditure on new assets (viz. capital formation) into outlays by the Commonwealth's public trading enterprises and outlays in the remainder of the Commonwealth Government sector. While current price data for each series are available, the Statistician does not publish constant price estimates of the components of Commonwealth authorities' gross fixed capital expenditure. However, a broad indication of movements in the real value of these outlays can be derived by deflating the current price data by the published implicit deflator for the Statistician's estimate of total public gross fixed capital expenditure (which includes also capital expenditures by State and local governments).</PARA>
<PARA> On that broad basis, the implied decline in real gross fixed capital formation in the Commonwealth Government sector as a whole between 1975-76 and 1980-81 was at an average annual rate of 8 per cent; for the Commonwealth's public trading enterprises the average annual rate of decline was 5 per cent, and for the remainder of the Commonwealth sector 15 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> In interpreting these figures, it should be borne in mind that they do not take into account Commonwealth payments to the States and to local government for capital purposes. For national accounting purposes these are treated as transfer payments. In 1980-81, general and specific purpose capital payments from the Commonwealth Budget to the States, the Northern Territory and to local governments amounted to $2,930m, or $1,180m greater than total Commonwealth sector gross fixed capital formation in that year.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The OECD does not publish constant price estimates of central government gross fixed capital formation by its member countries, nor does it provide either current or constant price series for capital outlays by public trading enterprises. However, an OECD series of implicit price deflators for 'total gross capital formation' for each of its member countries can be used to deflate the published current price data to provide an indication of the real value of central government gross fixed capital formation. These data will be broadly comparable with that part of gross fixed capital formation in the Commonwealth sector other than by the Commonwealth's public trading enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA> The following table shows the estimated change (at an annual rate) in the real value of gross fixed capital formation of central governments over the period from fiscal year 1975 (financial year 1975-76 in Australia's case) until the latest year for which comparative OECD data are available.</PARA>
<PARA> The substantial differences between countries in the size and composition of their central government sectors, as well as the changes in those sectors over time, mean that considerable caution should be exercised in interpreting international comparisons such as these.</PARA>
<PARA> An example of the type of problem which can arise in making these comparisons is that referred to in part (1) above regarding the treatment of transfer payments for capital funding purposes between levels of government. With that problem in mind, the data on movements in central government gross fixed capital formation in OECD countries have been supplemented in the attached table with comparable data for the public sector as a whole (excluding public trading enterprises). Even these latter figures will be affected by the particular years chosen and may not necessarily be a good guide to the underlying trend in every country.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator Messner</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am providing information by way of explanation of the way in which the provisions mentioned by the honourable senator apply to beneficiaries:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Sub-section 87 (3A) of the Repatriation Act 1920 provides that only 40% of any disability pension is deemed to be income for the purpose of the income test used to determine the amount of service pension that an eligible pensioner is entitled to receive. The words 'a payment of an instalment of a pension (other than a service pension within the meaning of sub-section (2) of section 52 of this Act)' are applied to exclude from consideration those welfare-type pensions prescribed in Table A of Schedule 3 of the Act from being treated as disability pensions for the purposes of the sub-section.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (a) Under section 6 of the Repatriation (Far East Strategic Reserve) Act 1956 pensions are payable to eligible members of the Defence Force (and their dependents) for incapacity or death as the result of a member's service with, or in connection with the British Commonwealth Far East Strategic Reserve in the then Federation of Malaya or the then Colony of Singapore. By virtue of section 7 of the Act the provisions of the Repatriation Act, in relation to the payment of pension and other related matters, are made to apply to the Repatriation (Far East Strategic Reserve) Act.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Under section 6 of the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act 1962, pensions are payable to eligible members of the Defence Force (and their dependants) in respect of any incapacity or death that results from a member's service outside Australia in a declared area, such as South Vietnam. By virtue of section 7 of the Act the provisions of the Repatriation Act, in relation to the payment of pension and other related matters, are made to apply to the Repatriation (Special Overseas Service) Act.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Under the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act 1940 pensions are payable to eligible Australian mariners (and their dependants) in respect of incapacity or death suffered by a mariner as a result of a war injury.</PARA>
<PARA> Details of pension payments under the three Acts referred to in this part may be found in the Statistical tables of the Repatriation Commission's 1980-81 Annual Report, pages 33 to 38 inclusive; which was tabled in the Senate on 10 September 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Paragraph 87 (3A) (c) of the Repatriation Act is so applied that only 40% of a pension paid by a country other than Australia, which is similar in character to the disability pension paid under the Repatriation Act to Australian veterans, is considered in the assessment of service pension.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Paragraph 87 (3A) (d) of the Repatriation Act refers to the Domestic Allowance that is payable to eligible widows under the Repatriation Regulations. This allowance is payable, in addition to war widows' pension, at $12 a week to a war widow who has attained the age of 55 years, is permanently unemployable or has a child under the age of 16 years. It is also payable in respect of a child over the age of 16 years who is undertaking full-time education or training and is not receiving an adequate living wage. Other details of this allowance may be found in the statistical tables on page 35 of the Repatriation Commission's 1980-81 Annual Report.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. The increased funding allowed the National Health and Medical Research Council (NH&amp;MRC) to support in 1981 an additional 49 research projects, to award 5 new program grants to provide longer term funding to high quality research teams, and to expand and diversify its research training awards.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The NH&amp;MRC report 'Case for funds for medical research in 1982' quoted per capita expenditure figures on medical research by national grant-giving bodies in 1980 as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia-NH&amp;MRC-$1.11</PARA>
<PARA> U.S.A.-National Institutes of Health-$11.48</PARA>
<PARA> Canada-Medical Research Council-$2.17</PARA>
<PARA>However, the comparison is of doubtful validity because of the different funding policies and roles of the respective organisations.</PARA>

<PARA> (4) The following table gives the State by State distribution of project grants awarded in 1981. It must be noted, however, that the sole criterion for the award of a project grant is scientific excellence as assessed by a complex peer review process.

<PARA> Western Australia-54</PARA>
<PARA> Tasmania-9</PARA>
<PARA> Australian Capital Territory-7</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The cot death research team at the University of Tasmania headed by Dr Megirian is receiving NH&amp;MRC support in 1981 and has in fact been funded each year since 1976. Total funding in this period has been $63,800. In addition, an application last year to the National Institutes of Health in the United States also proved successful and resulted in the three year grant referred to by the honourable senator.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) No. Applications for project grants may be for existing or proposed research. All applications are assessed on the sole criterion of scientific merit as determined by peer review and grants are awarded to projects which achieve the highest ratings.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) All applications received by the NH&amp;MRC receive due consideration. The number which does not achieve a sufficient level of scientific merit to gain support within the funds available varies from year to year. In 1981 some 770 applications were received, and 424 of these were not supported.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The case of Mr D. C. Gray has been investigated.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) (a) The delay referred to by the honourable senator regarding Mr Gray's application for increase was due to the deferral of a decision on his claim, along with those on many others, pending the decision of the High Court of Australia in the case, Repatriation Commission v. Nancy Law. Mr Gray was fully advised about this.</PARA>
<PARA> The decision was handed down by the High Court on 16 October 1981. In the light of this decision, and considering all the medical evidence, the Repatriation Commission has determined that Mr Gray be assessed at the Special Rate disability pension with effect from 12 June 1980.</PARA>
<PARA> As regards payment of Temporary Incapacity Allowance, Mr Gray lodged applications on 14 April 1981, 11 June 1981 and 9 July 1981. These were dealt with without undue delay and advice was forwarded to Mr Gray. He subsequently lodged an appeal on 22 July 1981 and action was taken immediately to review his entitlement to Temporary Incapacity Allowance.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Regard was had to the opinion of Mr Gray's local medical officer. However, any opinion, medical or otherwise, simply forms part of the overall evidence to be considered against the legislative provisions relating to the grant of the allowance.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) A medical certificate may be requested before an application for Temporary Incapacity Allowance is considered. Provision for this is made on the application form and in Mr Gray's case it was completed in respect of each application by his local medical officer. It was considered that it was not necessary to obtain a further report from his local medical officer at that time.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) As I have previously advised in my answer to Question No. 808 (Senate Hansard, 27 August 1981, page 470), the Department of Social Security will meet the reasonable travel costs of an applicant wishing to attend the hearing of his appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal in those cases where it is accepted that the applicant is without adequate means to meet those costs himself.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Social Security Appeals Tribunals are established to advise the Director-General of Social Services upon the proper decision to be taken in respect of appeals made to him pursuant to section 15 of the Social Services Act 1947. In these circumstances it is considered appropriate that the Department should meet the reasonable travel costs of persons appearing before the Social Security Appeals Tribunals at the invitation of the Tribunals and for the purpose of assisting the Tribunals in their advisory capacity. By contrast, the Administrative Appeals Tribunal does not form part of any internal reconsideration process and proceedings before it are instituted at the initiative of the individual appellant. The Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 confers upon the Tribunal no power to order a party to meet costs incurred by another party to proceedings before it. Notwithstanding that fact, it is considered appropriate that the Department should be prepared to meet the reasonable travel costs of an appellant whose financial circumstances would otherwise prevent his attendance before the Tribunal.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Commissioner of Taxation has advised me that the article referred to a taxation office in a capital city where copies of three daily newspapers are purchased for official use in the Valuation Branch.

<PARA> (3) No. Eligibility requirements for registration of publications are set out in the Australian Postal Commission Postal By-laws.

<PARA> Classification as a Category A publication is restricted to four types of organisations and registration is determined according to the dominant aims, intention or conduct of the person or organisation involved.

<PARA> Category A registration is restricted to publications which are:</PARA>
<PARA> published by an organisation, the dominant purpose of which is the investigation or relief of particular disabilities of individual persons. Additionally, the publication must consist mainly of articles relating to that dominant purpose;</PARA>

<PARA> Australia Post has examined the constituent documents and activities of the Apex, Lions and Rotary organisations. Whilst it is recognised that these organisations are interested in and carry out worthwhile work in respect of the relief of disabilities of individual persons, activities of this nature do not rank as the dominant purpose and function of these organisations. Furthermore, their publications generally reflect the wider-based interests of the organisation and are concerned largely with administrative and social matters.

This has been so since the Australia/Netherlands Double Taxation Agreement came into effect in 1975.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The general objective of the Government's foreign investment policy is to seek Australian equity participation to the extent appropriate to the particular circumstances of each foreign investment proposal. There are specific guidelines for Australian equity participation in respect of new natural resource projects.</PARA>
<PARA> Under these guidelines, the Government expects new projects for the mining and production of uranium to have 75 per cent Australian equity and to be Australian-controlled. In cases where 75 per cent Australian equity is clearly unobtainable, alternative proposals incorporating not less than 50 per cent Australian equity will be considered, provided certain conditions are satisfied. Where projects do not have 75 per cent Australian equity, arrangments may be required to increase Australian participation over an agreed period.</PARA>
<PARA> A proposal for a new business or project in the mining (other than uranium), agriculture, pastoral, fishing and forestry industries involving a total investment of $5m or more will, as a general rule, only be allowed to proceed if it has a minimum 50 per cent Australian equity together with at least 50 per cent of the voting strength on the board or controlling body held by Australian interests. Where the Government judges that the unavailability of sufficient Australian equity capital on reasonable terms and conditions would unduly delay the development of Australia's natural resources, projects that are not contrary to the national interest may be allowed to proceed with less than 50 per cent Australian equity. In these circumstances, however, the Government will, as appropriate, seek satisfactory arrangements for Australian equity to be increased to at least 50 per cent within an agreed period. the Government may also seek 50 per cent Australian equity participation in proposed investments in other sectors of the economy, such as those where foreign investment is subject to restrictions, and in cases where the investment is to be undertaken in areas of the economy where foreign ownership and control is extensive.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The expenditure identified in table 1.7 of the Foreign Investment Review Board 1980 Report as originating from Australia represents the expected contribution by Australian-controlled companies and Australian residents to the total expected expenditure associated with all foreign investment proposals approved by the Government. The table indicates that around one-quarter of the total expected expenditure was attributable to Australian investors.</PARA>
<PARA> This statistic relates to total expected investment associated with proposals for foreign investment in all sectors of the economy, and it is not, therefore, indicative of the results that have been achieved in the implementation of the Australian equity participation guidelines that apply to the natural resources sector. In this regard, it is noted that in the two years to 30 June 1981, ten of the fourteen proposals for natural resource development projects that were approved under foreign investment policy provided for at least the guideline level of Australian equity participation; the other four projects were required, as a condition of approval, to meet the guideline before production commenced.</PARA>
<PARA> Table 1.7, of course, only records investments which require approval under the foreign investment policy. The table does not, therefore, provide a measure of the overall Australian/foreign shares in the total investment undertaken in the Australian economy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) to (9) The Yellow Maize Marketing Board for the State of New South Wales (Maize Board) submitted that in September 1979 it adopted an export strategy for the 1980 maize crop and that, in developing and seeking to implement this strategy, it incurred direct costs which it was unable to recoup from sales on the export market (because the entire crop was ultimately sold on the domestic market). It maintained that it should be compensated for these 'export costs'.</PARA>
<PARA> The Maize Board's claim was refused because it did not fall within the compensation guidelines that payments will only be made in respect of total unrecouped expenditure (excluding profits forgone, or reduced profits, and allowances for overhead expenses), after every effort has been made to find alternative markets and where sales had been affected at a loss. Although the 'export costs' were not recouped from sales on the export market, the returns from sales on the domestic market were more than sufficient to recoup the 'export costs' and still provide higher net returns to growers than they would have achieved from the disallowed sale to the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Thus the Government's action did not lead to sales being effected at a loss.</PARA>
<PARA> As figures are not available of the quantity of maize retained on the farm, it is not possible to accurately determine the volume of maize sold in the premium domestic market. However, total Australian production of maize from the 1980 crop has been estimated at 151,000 tonnes, and total Australian maize exports in 1980 were approximately 30,000 tonnes.</PARA>
<PARA> It is unlikely that the export of maize delivered to the Maize Board would have significantly affected prices on the domestic premium market principally because of the much larger quantities of other grains, particularly wheat, that were being sold for stock feed at this time. Even if prices had been affected, however, the Maize Board would have been unable to exploit this situation as all of the maize delivered to it would previously have been contracted for supply to Exportkhleb (I am advised that the disallowed offer from Exportkhleb, the Soviet agency, was for up to 25,000 tonnes of maize (with a minimum of 15,000 tonnes) and that actual deliveries to the Maize Board were approximately 50,000 tonnes).</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The savings/investment identity in a national accounting framework must always, by definition, be equal. Since the demand for investment usually exceeds the availability of domestic savings, Australia is traditionally a net importer of capital which finances a real net inflow of goods and services from the rest of the world. This enables Australia to achieve a higher level of domestic capital formation, and therefore a higher rate of economic growth, than would result from investment generated by domestic savings alone. The supplement to domestic savings, or the increase in net indebtedness overseas, is represented by the deficit on the current account of the balance of payments. In 1980-81, the full rise in private sector investment could not have been achieved unless that level of domestic savings had been supplemented either by a lower level of private consumption and/or government expenditure, or by a larger current account deficit; otherwise, there would have been insufficient savings for the saving/investment identity to be equilibrated at its potentially higher level.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) In this and in a number of similar questions, the honourable senator has requested information on the nature of advice that I have received in relation to passages contained in the Budget documents.

<PARA> (1) Arrangements for storage or disposal of wastes generated at Lucas Heights were given in answer to the HOR Question No. 176 on 2 June 1977.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 11 March 1981 (Hansard, page 491), Senator Thomas asked the Minister representing the Treasurer the following question, without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer and relates to section 36AAA of the Income Tax Assessment Act. Footrot is a serious stock disease and is increasing in some States of Australia. Traditional control methods are expensive, painful to the stock very time consuming, and not always successful. The costs are deductible in the financial year of expenditure. A more satisfactory solution is to sell all susceptible stock on the farm and replace them after a few weeks, by which time the footrot virus will already have died on the farm. The profit made from the sale of those tock is subject to taxation, which in some cases can be about equal to the value of the stock sold. Will the Minister suggest to the Treasurer that he consider amending section 36AAA with a view to stopping the discouragement of farmers from adopting better farming practices.</PARA>
<PARA> The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Section 36AAA was amended last year to enable a primary producer to elect to have the section apply to the proceeds resulting from the compulsory destruction of livestock in compliance with a law for the control or eradication of a disease or from the death of stock from such a disease. As a consequence of the amendment, profit on the disposal or death of the livestock may be deducted from the total proceeds received from the death or destruction that are required to be included in the taxpayer's assessable income and instead be applied to reduce for tax purposes the cost of replacement livestock acquired during the income year in which the death or destruction occurred or any of the five succeeding years. Any profit unapplied at the end of the last of those years is included in the assessable income of that year.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commissioner of Taxation has recently had occasion to review the operation of section 36AAA in relation to the treatment of footrot in sheep and, in so doing, to examine the various State and Territory laws that govern the control of stock diseases. As a result of the review it has been concluded that section 36AAA may be applied in cases where the relevant law makes provision for the compulsory destruction of sheep affected by footrot and where, on the advice of an appropriate official such as a district veterinary officer of a State Agriculture Department, sheep that have been officially quarantined for the treatment of footrot are sold direct to an abattoir for slaughter as the most effective means of eradicating the disease. The section will not apply, however, if the relevant law does not provide for compulsory destruction and a farmer decides to sell affected animals, or if no official quarantine has been imposed.</PARA>
<PARA> Graziers will thus be able to take advantage of section 36AAA to minimize the taxation consequences of any genuinely forced sales for slaughter of the whole or a substantial part of their flocks because of footrot, without the need for further amendment of the section.</PARA>

Mr Bowen said that more than 60 ships around Australia were being delayed by industrial disputes or union bans and that the industry was losing $1m a day, while the loss in exports added many millions of dollars to that figure, to say nothing of the loss of jobs and employment opportunities. As many of these disputes involve demarcation arguments between unions, has the Government considered altering the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to encourage these disputes being resolved by the ACTU and to prevent such industrial disputation spreading to the detriment of the welfare of other workers not involved?</PARA>

It is true that demarcation disputes between trade unions have disrupted Australian maritime and stevedoring operations in recent years with serious consequences for both our export trade and our reputation as a reliable supplier. Such disputes are particularly frustrating and pointless.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has felt that the best hope for successful and enduring resolution of disputes between unions lay with the trade union movememt itself. The ACTU appears to recognise the undesirability of the present situation and has made initiatives aimed at eliminating demarcation disputes. If the self-regulatory procedures which the ACTU is endeavouring to establish cannot resolve particular disputes then unions should make use of and abide by the decisions of arbitral tribunals which in the case of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission has power to grant exclusive rights of coverage. This capacity was conferred upon the Commission in amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act passed in 1979.</PARA>
<PARA> Peak Council concern about this issue has been recognised and discussions between the ACTU and the Confederation of Australian Industry are continuing under the auspices of the National Labour Consultative Council.</PARA>
<PARA> It has been suggested that the facilitation of trade union amalgamations or the formation of industry unions could lead to a reduction of demarcation disputes. While recognising that neither measure would solve the problem completely, the Government is closely examining legislative procedures and provisions in this regard.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 27 August 1981 (Hansard, page 378) Senator Button asked the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whether it is a fact that no implementation details have yet been decided, nor any effects calculated, of the Prime Minister's announced decision of 12 August to drop the 'Buy Australian' policy in Government purchasing. How does the Government reconcile this decision with its frequent advocacy of development of high technology industries in Australia, such as the computer industry which was specifically referred to as an example in a speech by the Minister for Science and Technology in July. Does the United States, by contrast, apply a 50 per cent national duty on all imported high technology brought by the United States Government? Also whether it is not a fact that Telecom Australia is the largest purchaser of high technology equipment in Australia and that that organisation has a policy, or has had a policy, of buying up to 80 per cent Australian Technology.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Administrative Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> On 5 August 1981 the Prime Minister announced in the context of his Statement on Economic Policy that the Government would be acting to eliminate its purchasing policy in preference to Australian goods except for certain defence strategic industries.</PARA>
<PARA> At the time of the honourable senator's question the Government had under consideration its revised preference policy. On 18 October I announced details of the revised policy and associated administrative arrangements. My statement indicated that the Government had decided to include high technology as well as defence strategic areas of industry under its revised preference policy.</PARA>
<PARA> The reduction in Australian preference decision was one of a number of measures adopted by the Government to further its overall economic objective of reducing inflation as a pre-condition for establishing economic growth with increased employment opportunities and higher living standards. However, as the estimated value of Commonwealth Government purchasing represents about 2 per cent of total manufacturing sales in Australia, the elimination of the preference to Australian goods policy is unlikely to have a major impact on the Australian industry generally.</PARA>
<PARA> The United States does not have a purchasing policy dealing specifically with high technology products. The Buy American Act (1933) provides a general preference of 6 per cent to all American products and a preference of 12 per cent to products from 'small business' firms, or from firms in designated 'labour surplus' areas. These preferences are applied to the duty paid price of imported products which are products with less than 50 per cent American content.</PARA>
<PARA> A 50 per cent preference may be applied in the United States Defence purchases of military products as a balance of payments measure. For military products a preference is applied on the basis of either 50 per cent of the duty free delivered price or 6 per cent of the duty paid price of imports which ever is higher.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Communications has provided me with an answer to that portion of the honourable senator's question on Telecom Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Telecom has followed the consistent practice of requiring all of its major telecommunications products to be made by Australian industry. In 1977, when introducing a new system of local exchange switching equipment using stored programme controlled techniques, an Australian content of 80 per cent was stipulated. As a consequence of its dedication to local sourcing, 90 per cent of all telecommunications supplies are obtained from Australian industry sources.</PARA>
<PARA> Telecom is certainly a very large purchaser of high technology equipment in Australia and has done much to foster the local telecommunications manufacturing industry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 15 October 1981 (Hansard page 1268) Senator Gietzelt asked me a question, without notice, in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in the Senate. The question was:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Has the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration received representations from individuals and groups concerning the current state of adult migrant education services? What has been the Government's response to these representations, if any, and what measures are proposed to remedy the problems raised-in particular the demand for adult migrant education far exceeding supply, the low provision of a permanent teaching force in adult migrant English education and the failure of Government policy to reach the Galbally targets concerning adult migrant English and on-arrival English education?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Yes. I have received a number of representations from New South Wales.</PARA>
<PARA> The current level of program activity in New South Wales is meeting for the most part the present rate of applications for English language and information courses. Within the context of some 17,500 persons attending courses and other learning arrangements in the Adult Migrant Education Program at any one time in New South Wales, there were (at the end of October):</PARA>
<PARA> 510 applicants in migrant settlement centres seeking on-arrival courses (of these almost all will have received offers of a place in a course by the end of November), and</PARA>
<PARA> at Community Centres, 437 awaiting on-arrival courses, 472 awaiting full-time on-going courses and 88 awaiting part-time on-going courses.</PARA>
<PARA> Because courses are grouped and start at the same time, persons who apply after the commencement of a course may have to wait up to 12 weeks until the next group of courses commences. Those who apply now (November 1981) will have to wait until early 1982 to commence a course.</PARA>
<PARA> Teachers in the State Adult Migrant Education Services are employed by State authorities, which determine the terms of employment of their teaching staff. For the most part the Adult Migrant Education Services are staffed by full time temporary and hourly-paid teachers. There are permanent teachers in New South Wales, Queensland, South Australia, Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory. A number of the teachers in those services have worked in them for some years. There does not seem to be any undue or abnormal wastage or turnover of staff. Also the Adult Migrant Education Program is a special program of limited size and is thus different to other broader areas of education. That program should be staffed and organised in a way which allows the services within the program to be provided to meet changing needs arising from variations in migrant intake and location. Given this need for flexibility and the mix of full and part time teachers within the services, the most appropriate arrangement would appear to be a core of permanent teachers supported by non-permanent staff as the need arises.</PARA>
<PARA> As a result of the steps taken by the Government subsequent to its acceptance of the recommendations of the Report of the Review of Post-Arrival Programs and Services for Migrants (the Galbally Report), the target for 1980-81 of 15,000 non-English speaking enrollees nationally in the on-arrival program was exceeded. It is estimated that over 16,000 such migrants undertook these courses in that year. Targets given in the Galbally Report for enrolments in the on-arrival program included a component of English language speakers who were to participate in the information aspects of the on-arrival program. The 1980-81 target of 18,000 newly arrived persons in the Galbally Report included information programs for 3,000 English speakers. That aspect of the overall target for 1980-81 has not been met because priority was given to non-English speakers and because of the information services available to English speakers throughout the community and at Migrant Resource Centres.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 21 October 1981 (Hansard, page 1445) Senator Jessop asked the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations and ask whether he has noted a Press report indicating that ICI Australia Ltd has shelved a $500m petrochemical project in Victoria because of high local costs and the rise in the value of the Australian dollar? Is the Minister aware that another prime reason for this decision involved the doubts associated with the capacity of that company to deliver its product on the international market due to the general industrial disruption affecting the Australian waterfront? As my attention has been drawn to other companies in Australia which are in a similar position and which are contemplating withdrawing from Australia-two of them are considering establishing their industries in South Africa and Indonesia because of the assurance that their products can be delivered on the world market on time-I ask whether the Government is proposing to do anything to retain in Australia these industries which are so important to employment opportunities in this country? Also, does the Government propose to do anything in the interest of restoring our credibility as a reliable international trading partner?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations in responding to the question undertook to obtain from the Minister for Industry and Commerce additional information on the precise reasons for the ICI decision not to proceed.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Industry and Commerce has provided the following information:</PARA>
<PARA> ICI's decision to defer indefinitely the development of its proposed petrochemical and chloralkali complex at Point Wilson took into account a number of factors. The decision was reached after two years of detailed technical, commercial and environmental studies costing more than $2 million.</PARA>
<PARA> The feasibility study into the project would necessarily have examined the prospects of selling the corporation's output a number of years ahead. That study would have been influenced by conditions in the world market, and, in particular, by the major structural redevelopments taking place in the world petrochemical industry. This restructuring was sparked off by the oil price increases. It has been accelerated by the present depressed state of the world petrochemical market and the desire by some oil-producing countries to broaden their industrial base through the development of export-oriented petrochemical industries.</PARA>
<PARA> The company's decision should be kept in perspective, reflecting as it does conditions in the international chemical industry. The Chairman of ICI Mr Milton Bridgland has said that there was very little the Government could do to improve the economic attractiveness of the project in the short term.</PARA>
<PARA> ICI has pointed out that continually mounting wage costs and movements in currency values have affected export and import competing industries. The Australian petrochemical industry is presently experiencing severe import competition.</PARA>
<PARA> In respect of wage costs, the company said that excessive wage movements, particularly arising from a shorter working week, seemed likely to have a serious affect on many other cost factors, most importantly construction costs.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 22 October 1981 (Hansard, pages 1536-7), Senator Lajovic asked me, as the Minister representing the Treasurer, a question without notice concerning the effect on inflation of the 18-25 per cent increases in railways fares and freight charges imposed by the New South Wales Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Treasurer has provided the following information in answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The increases in railway fares and freight charges would have a two-fold effect on consumer prices, as measured by the Consumer Price Index.</PARA>
<PARA> First, there would be the direct effect on the consumer price index resulting from the railway fares increase. Public transport fares are a component of the consumer price index and it is therefore possible to derive an estimate of the effect on the consumer price index of an increase in such fares. Second, there would be indirect effects on the consumer price index resulting from the passing on to consumers of some or all of the increased costs faced by various industries as a result of higher freight charges.</PARA>
<PARA> As at the September quarter 1981 rail fares contributed 0.664 per cent to the All Groups consumer price index for Sydney. It follows that the direct effect of an 18-25 per cent increase in rail fares would be to increase the consumer price index for Sydney by 0.12-0.17 per cent. The corresponding effect on the six-capitals consumer price index would be 0.04-0.06 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> However, it is not possible to provide an accurate estimate of the indirect effect on the consumer price index-that resulting from the increase in freight charges. That magnitude would depend on a number of factors, including overall macro-economic policy settings, the degree to which price increases are subsequently reflected in wages, the extent to which road or other transport will be substituted for rail because of the increases and the extent to which import competition restrains the passing on of cost increases.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 28 October 1981 (Hansard, page 1721) Senator Giles asked a question, without notice, as to whether there is provision in the Social Services Act for the collection and utilisation of pension cheques by persons other than beneficiaries and if so, whether it is possible for approval to be given to a proprietor of a lodging house who is not registered to provide any form of medical or custodial care. Senator Giles also asked whether my department's records show possible abuses of such authorisation or whether a specific complaint is required before any investigation is made.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I answered Senator Giles question in part and undertook to have the points raised examined in order to determine whether a more detailed reply was in order.</PARA>
<PARA> Sub-section 40 (1) of the Social Services Act provides in respect of age, invalid and wife's pension that pension shall be paid to the pensioner or, on behalf of the pensioner, to such other person as the pensioner appoints. Similar provision exists in the Act in respect of widows pension and supporting parents benefits. The arrangement is essentially one between the pensioner and the person nominated. When a request is received for payment of a pension to another person, both the pensioner and the other person to receive payment on behalf of the pensioner are interviewed to ensure that each is aware of the responsibilities of both parties. If possible, the interview is conducted prior to the transfer of payments.</PARA>
<PARA> The majority of these payment arrangements are made within a family unit or where pensioners are residents of nursing homes or hostels registered under appropriate legislation, and the arrangements necessarily operate to the satisfaction of both partners.</PARA>
<PARA> There are a number of institutions to which special payment arrangements known as the group method have been approved. Pensioners residing in such an institution may request payment of their pension to the institution. The group cheque is not issued to a private individual but to the appropriate officer of the institution as payee, for example, 'The Secretary'. One cheque is forwarded to the institution covering payment for pensioners residing there who have chosen this option. When considering applications from institutions for inclusion in the group method the following principles are observed:</PARA>
<PARA> the circumstances justify payment by this method rather than to each pensioner individually; for example there may be a large number of pensioners involved or the institution may cater for senile patients.</PARA>
<PARA> each pensioner who is capable of looking after his or her own affairs has given consent in writing to the arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA> Section 43 of the Act provides that where the Director-General is satisfied for any reason that it is desirable for payment of the whole or portion of a pension to be made to any person, institution or authority, the Director-General may authorise payment.</PARA>
<PARA> However it is rare for the Director-General to authorise payment to another person without that person having been appointed by the pensioner. Such authorisations usually only occur where a person is mentally or physically incapable of appointing a nominee or where he is, for some valid reason, unable to manage his financial affairs.</PARA>
<PARA> Arrangements for payment of pension to another person on behalf of a pensioner are reviewed immediately there is any suggestion of abuse of the arrangements in an individual case. Similarly, where it becomes apparent to officers of my department in the normal course of review work that a pensioner is not capable of understanding the arrangements, they are required to satisfy themselves that the authorisation is authentic.</PARA>

<PARA> I undertook to obtain a copy of Dr Lantzke's comments and put them under study, and I provide the following supplementary answer:</PARA>
<PARA> Member countries of the IEA including Australia, were not consulted prior to the release of the speech, nor would that have been expected. The Executive Director of the IEA was speaking in his own name and did not purport to express views on behalf of the Agency as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA> One newspaper report of Dr Lantzke's speech described it as an attack on US energy policies. Having read the speech I find it hard to agree with so colourful a description. The Executive Director did put views which differ in some respects from those held by the US Administration. The extent of Government intervention implied in Lantzke's speech plus his support for East-West energy relations are, I suggest, two areas where the current US Administration may not agree. On the other hand, Lantzke's comments would propably coincide with the views of other member countries of IEA. Overall, they reflect some of the ongoing discussion within the IEA. It should also be noted Dr Lantzke was responding to an invitation from the organisers of the occasion to be 'a bit provocative'.</PARA>
<PARA> Certainly the Government has considerable sympathy with some of his comments, particularly those on the dangers of complacency in the current relaxed conditions in the oil market and the importance of maintaining and intensifying our efforts to reduce dependence on oil.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Health has provided the following information:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government recognises that there are many areas in the paramedical field which play a useful role in the well being of all Australians. However, it would be in direct conflict with the Government's policy of restraint in public expenditure for it to extend the medical benefits arrangements to cover psychology services or for that matter, services provided by a wide range of non-medical personnel such as occupational therapists, orthoptists, acupuncturists, physiotherapists and chiropodists. In fact, the Government receives many representations seeking extension of the medical benefits system to cover all of these services plus other items such as medical and surgical aids and appliances.</PARA>
<PARA> Because of the limited funds available, the Government believes that it should act to ensure that the basic health care needs of all Australians are protected. This it does through the provision of assistance for medical services.</PARA>
<PARA> I have recently received representations on this matter from the Australian College of Private Clinical Psychologists and representations on behalf of clinical psychologists from several honourable members.</PARA>
<PARA> While I have no doubt that clinical psychologists can assist people with specific health problems, and can be cost effective, I also believe that a similar observation can be made about the services provided by other health occupations which do not attract benefits under the Health Insurance Act. Consequently, the issue becomes one of either providing benefits for the services provided by all health occupations or setting criteria and priorities between occupations. The first option would involve substantial increases in costs, as there would be an increase in the utilisation of health services overall. The second is complex and would inevitably result in value judgments being made between occupations to determine to which occupations benefits should be extended. Extensions of this nature would be unlikely to be generally acceptable to the occupations excluded, or to the patients of those occupations.</PARA>
<PARA> In the current financial climate where the need for restraint in Government outlays is of critical importance, it would not be appropriate to consider any extensions of the benefit arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA> In respect of benefits provided by health insurance organisations, the Government has maintained a policy in relation to supplementary benefits tables provided by private health insurance organisations for ancillary services, of largely allowing these private health insurance organisations to determine for themselves the nature and extent of services they wish to cover and, to an extent, the terms and conditions applicable to the payment of such supplementary benefits.</PARA>
<PARA> Consequently, private health insurance organisations could extend and/or introduce a range of benefits for clinical psychology services if they wished to do so. Whether such action is taken, however, is a matter over which the organisations have discretion.</PARA>
<PARA> Very few health insurance organisations in Australia, except in Western Australia, provide benefits for psychology services. However, I understand that the Australian College of Private Clinical Psychologists is in the process of promoting the extension of benefits to cover clinical pyschology under the supplementary benefits tables of those organisations which currently do not provide such coverage.</PARA>

<PARA> I said that I had seen this date and that I assumed he was quoting it correctly, but that I would check the point.

Thus, the CPI for the December quarter 1981 will not reflect any increases in electricity charges in Victoria effective from 17 November 1981; such increases will be reflected in the CPI in the March quarter 1982.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 17 September 1981 (Hansard, page 820) Senator Sibraa asked me, the Acting Minister for Health, a question without notice concerning the future of the North Head Quarantine Station.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Health has provided the following information:</PARA>
<PARA> There is no conflict between myself and the Minister for Administrative Services regarding the future of the Quarantine Station at North Head in Sydney. The honourable senator's question contains a number of statements that are not in accord with the facts which are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> There has been a difference of opinion over very many years between the Commonwealth and the State regarding the ownership of the North Head land. In line with legal advice it has received, the Commonwealth has always asserted its ownership. In the Commonwealth's view, the question of leasing does not arise.</PARA>
<PARA> The entire Commonwealth holding at North Head (a total of 275.4 ha) was included in an agreement concluded between the Prime Minister and the Premier of New South Wales in 1979 concerning the exchange of certain Commonwealth and State lands in New South Wales including the Commonwealth holdings at North Head.</PARA>
<PARA> Under this agreement the Commonwealth undertook to release to the State, in two or more stages, the whole of the Commonwealth holdings at North Head. The 'first release' land of 172.9 ha was released at that time. The 'second release' lands (including the Quarantine Station, the School of Artillery and the Police College) were to be transferred as and when budget considerations permitted relocation of Commonwealth facilities or as the Commonwealth ceased to require the use of such facilities.</PARA>
<PARA> The New South Wales Government did not agree to pay the Commonwealth $5m to relocate the quarantine facilities. Relocation of the quarantine station was not a consideration when the land exchange agreement referred to above was concluded. The Prime Minister had already written to all State Premiers in 1977 with proposals for new human quarantine arrangements which involved, amongst other things, closure of all human quarantine stations (including the station at North Head) with the States accepting responsibility for selected operational human quarantine functions.</PARA>
<PARA> Under the land exchange agreement the New South Wales Government undertook to pay $5m to the Commonwealth as a contribution only to removal expenses incurred by the Commonwealth in relation to the release of the total Commonwealth North Head holdings; such payment to be credited proportionately to a 'pool' as this land was released. The pool was established under the agreement to cover the agreed prices debited and credited as the case might be, of all lands covered by the agreement (including the North Head holdings). The $5m had no relation whatsoever to the provision of alternate quarantine facilities. Indeed the $5m represented a small fraction only of the removal expenses for the School of Artillery and the Police College (estimated costs in 1978; $38m).</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth has not asked the New South Wales Government to build a new quarantine station at a cost of $2m. Rather, the Commonwealth has been seeking to have New South Wales join with all other States in the new arrangements for human quarantine functions referred to above. These arrangements seek to integrate treatment, care and investigation of individual quarantine cases into Australia's health care delivery system for which the States have carriage. There are very few quarantinable diseases of concern which cannot be adequately treated in modern Australian hospital facilities. Under the new arrangements which now operate in relation to all States except New South Wales, States are reimbursed 100 per cent for operational quarantine functions undertaken on the Commonwealth's behalf.</PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth has also sought New South Wales participation in national arrangements which have now been formalised with all other States involving the use of a National High Security Quarantine Treatment Unit nearing completion at Fairfield, Victoria for the treatment of quarantine cases which cannot be safely treated in existing State hospital facilities (for example, suspected cases of viral haemorrhagic fever such as lassa fever).</PARA>
<PARA> Any such cases are to be transported to Fairfield from any Australian location by charter aircraft utilising specially designed microbiologically secure air transit isolators. The evacuation will be undertaken by a highly trained medical evacuation team drawn from the staff of the Fairfield Hospital.</PARA>
<PARA> Until New South Wales indicates its agreement to participate in the proposed arrangements outlined above, the station at North Head will continue to be required for a limited range of human quarantine functions, including the accommodation of unvaccinated persons from Yellow Fever endemic areas for the duration of the six day incubation period of this disease.</PARA>

<PARA> I ask: Who were these people in the Australian Dairy Corporation and what exactly did they do.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Trade and Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> There is nothing I wish to add to the statement I made in the House of Representatives on 22 September in which I expressed my concern about the weight which had been attached by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations to uncorroborated evidence by the former Chairman of the ADC. I then said 'It (the Senate Standing Committee) received ample evidence of the all pervasive continuing conflict of interest and objectives of various members of the ADC Board and Asia Dairy Industries (Hong Kong) Ltd. Because of these conflicts of interest it seems to me that there were many occasions for various sectional interests to withhold information, to disguise the facts and to evade questions about the facts. It seems to me that some parties concerned have, over a long period, become skilled in withholding material facts, in diverting attention and generally circumventing the possibility of an inquiry or interest from the Department of Primary Industry and the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Nixon) and hence from this Parliament.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 19 November 1981 (Hansard, page 2335) Senator Mulvihill asked me a question, without notice, in my capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in the Senate. The question was as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . I wonder what explanation will be given for the failure of the Government to bring in legislation to provide for the case of a resident migrant woman seeking citizenship who is presently denied the right to have her children on her citizenship certificate. My second query relates to the uniformity of electoral registration for overseas people which was promised by giving everyone now a permanent resident uniform entitlement, after an obligatory period, to vote in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has supplied the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The issues covered by the first query are complicated. Children who are under the age of 16 years may be granted Australian citizenship either by:</PARA>
<PARA> being included in the certificate granted to their responsible parent or guardian</PARA>
<PARA> being granted a citizenship certificate in their own right.</PARA>
<PARA> Under the Australian Citizenship Act 1948, the term 'responsible parent' of a child means 'the father of that child or, where the father is dead or the mother has been given the custody of the child by order of a court or the child was born out of wedlock and resided with the mother, means the mother of that child'.</PARA>
<PARA> The current legislation does not prevent a mother from including her children on her citizenship application. However, where she is not deemed to be the responsible parent, under present legislation the children would not be able to be included on her citizenship certificate if her application were approved.</PARA>
<PARA> When an application is lodged by or on behalf of a child under 16, it is the policy to seek the consent of the 'responsible parent'. Where the father is the 'responsible parent' and he refuses consent but the mother persists with a request that the child be granted Australian citizenship, the case is considered to ascertain whether Ministerial discretion to grant citizenship to minors in their own right should be exercised. In such cases account is taken of such factors as the views of the child, whether the child would be disadvantaged by not being granted Australian citizenship and the general family situation including future intentions regarding residence in Australia. If it were decided to grant the child citizenship, the child would be issued a citizenship certificate in his or her own right.</PARA>
<PARA> A review of the Australian Citizenship Act 1948 is currently being undertaken and, in the course of that review, amendments are being considered to eliminate provisions which discriminate on the ground of sex.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) At the meeting on 14 and 15 April 1981 of Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers responsible for immigration and ethnic affairs matters, agreement was reached on the following:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Migrants, irrespective of their country of origin should be treated equally in relation to requirements to enrol, their right to vote at elections for parliament and nominate as candidates for election to parliament</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Australian citizenship should be the basis for the franchise</PARA>
<PARA> (3) No person currently enrolled as an elector should be disenfranchised</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Uniform legislation to give effect to the foregoing should be enacted by the Commonwealth and all States.</PARA>
<PARA> Ministers discussed progress in effecting this decision at their most recent meeting on 16 October 1981.</PARA>
<PARA> Parliament recently enacted the Statute Law (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 1981 which amends the Commonwealth Electoral Act to implement these changes at the Federal level.</PARA>
<PARA> It is hoped to achieve a uniform Australia-wide commencement date as early as possible in 1982.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 19 November 1981, (Hansard, page 2341) Senator Tate asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Trade and Resources, the following question, without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is it a fact that the International Bauxite Association Council had a meeting in Australia in the first week of November? Is it a fact that that Council recommended that, in view of the expected soft market situation for 1982, the price for base grade bauxite should, for references purposes, be set at two per cent of the average metal market list price for primary aluminium and soon for alumina? Do exporters of Australian bauxite and alumina regard themselves as bound by those recommendations? Whether the answer is yes or no, will the Australian Government be using its export controls over bauxite and alumina to ensure that the recommendations of the International Bauxite Association are adhered to in order to further the North-South dialogue to which this Prime Minister is committed, in the interests of those developing countries, particularly Jamaica, which would be well served by a strengthening of the cartel-like operations of the International Bauxite Association?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for trade and Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Council of Ministers of the International Bauxite Association met in Canberra from 4 to 6 November. Australia was represented by the Minister for Trade and Resources.</PARA>
<PARA> The Council recommended that the minimum c.i.f. price index level for 1982 (on an equivalent base-grade basis) for metallurgical grade bauxite sold in North and South America and Europe should remain within the range of 2.5 per cent-3 per cent but in view of the expected soft market situation for 1982 the prices for base-grade bauxite should, for reference purposes, be set at 2 per cent of the average American Metal Market list price for 99.5 per cent purity primary aluminium ingot.</PARA>
<PARA> The Council of Ministers also recommended that the minimum c.i.f. price for alumina during 1982 should remain within the range of 16 per cent-19 per cent but in view of the expected soft market for 1982 the price for 1982 should be set, for monitoring purposes, within the range of 15 per cent-18 per cent of the average American Metal Market price for 99.5 per cent purity primary aluminium ingot.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia has not supported IBA minimum pricing policies and is not bound by the pricing recommendations for bauxite and alumina exports in 1982. Australia's attitude to IBA pricing proposals is set out in a statement of 8 January 1979 by the Minister for Trade and Resources.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government will however continue to administer its export controls on bauxite and alumina in such a way as to seek fair world market prices.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia has informed other IBA member countries that whilst Australia cannot subscribe to the IBA's pricing formulations, Australia will not engage in predatory pricing practices. In this regard, Australia's actions are not seen as being inconsistent with the Government's commitment to the North-South dialogue.</PARA>

If this potentially dangerous situation exists, what action can be taken to overcome the danger?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Transport has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> In my reply to a previous question from Senator Jones on 15 September 1981 (No. S1180), regarding radar facilities at Brisbane Airport, I advised that Brisbane Airport was provided with two radar facilitites, a primary radar and a secondary surveillance radar. While the electronics associated with each of these facilities is duplicated, certain highly reliable mechanical components are not duplicated. These include the antenna of each facility and the common rotator mechanism. Because of the high reliability of these mechanical components, adequate performance is obtained without duplication. None of the common rotator mechanisms of Australian ATC radars has so far failed in scheduled operation. If the rotator mechanism is switched off to allow maintenance to take place, Brisbane operates without radar. This is not a 'potentially dangerous situation' because safety is maintained by reverting to internationally accepted procedural (i.e. non-radar) control.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 28 October 1981 (Hansard, page 1716) Senator Lewis asked the following question, without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations and, in his tenuous link, representing the Acting Attorney-General, is about a Mr Noel Latham who, I am sure Senator Chaney will recall, was the worker at Broken Hill who was denied the opportunity to work in Broken Hill because he refused to join the union which runs that city. I ask: Is the Minister aware that today in the Supreme Court of New South Wales His Honour, Mr Justice Nagle, in a very lengthy judgment awarded Noel Latham damages of $100,000 against 41 of the 75 Broken Hill unionists who were the defendants in the case. Apparently 30 of the unionists were let off, three died and one disappeared.</PARA>
<PARA> Is the Minister aware that Mr Latham has claimed this judgment as the most important social decision given by the New South Wales Supreme Court this century? Does the Commonwealth have laws similar to those under which this judgment was given? If not, will the Government take steps to adopt such laws so that civil protection similar to this may be given to those in Australia who are denied the right to work by militant closed shop unions?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Industrial Relations has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> In the case in question, Latham v Singleton and others, the Supreme Court of New South Wales found that, on the particular facts of the case, the actions of 41 of the defendants in refusing to work with Mr Latham, resulting in Mr Latham's suspension by the Broken Hill City Council, were a threat of an unlawful or illegal breach of contract and constituted the common law tort of conspiracy to intimidate by unlawful means.</PARA>
<PARA> The Court awarded damages to Mr Latham of the amount of $100,000 which was arrived at after consideration of his past, present and future economic loss, the pain, suffering and distress caused to him by the defendants' actions and the question of exemplary and aggravated damages against the defendants for their conduct against Mr Latham.</PARA>
<PARA> The judgment of the New South Wales Supreme Court is an important one, not least because the Court accepted the principle contained in a 1964 House of Lords decision (Rookes v Barnard) which acknowledged the existence in England of the common law tort of intimidation. It has not been clear whether the Rookes v Barnard decision, particularly as applied in the subsequent English case of Morgan v Fry, would be followed in Australia. It is important to note, however, that the Latham decision is at present the subject of an appeal to the New South Wales Court of Appeal.</PARA>
<PARA> On the question of whether the Commonwealth has laws similar to those under which the Latham judgment was given, the fact is that that case was decided on common law issues, as opposed to specific statutory provision. Remedies founded on a cause of action in intimidation or the other so-called 'economic torts'-i.e. conspiracy and interference with contractual relations-may be available in all Australian jurisdictions against unions and/or individual employees who have engaged in industrial action, provided that the necessary elements of the tort can be established. In addition the Trade Practices Act contains a statutory provision which enables a person who suffers loss or damage by conduct of another person (including a registered trade union) that was done in contravention of section 45D or 45E of that Act, which prohibits secondary boycotts, to recover the amount of the loss or damage by action against that other person or against any person involved in the contravention.</PARA>
