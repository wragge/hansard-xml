<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the following petition from 15 citizens of Australia:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>To the Honourable President and Members of the Senate of the Australian Parliament in Canberra assembled. The petition of certain citizens respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That the right to work without discrimination on any ground including, inter alia, discrimination on grounds of race, ethnic origin, pregnancy, marital status, sex and/or sexual preference is a fundamental human right; and</PARA>
<PARA> That it is both the duty and responsibility of society to fully support those denied work and therefore those who are unemployed as a result of society's inability to provide full paid employment should be guaranteed an adequate income without discrimination on any ground, including inter alia discrimination on grounds of race, ethnic origin, marital status, sex and/or sexual preference, or pregnancy.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that appropriate and adequate laws be formulated and passed to outlaw discrimination in Commonwealth employment, in employment of persons by statutory bodies and quasi-governmental organisations, in employment of individuals under federal awards, and in employment of all persons in areas over which Commonwealth and Australian Capital Territory equal opportunity legislation should have jurisdiction; and</PARA>

The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: That there is an urgent need to alleviate the severe hardship and emotional stress caused by the new guidelines used by the Department of Social Security and/or the Department of Health. These state that the availability of work for people with certain disabilities is 'irrelevant' in determining eligibility for pensions.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) That the present eligibility criteria be changed so that factors such as the availability of work are taken into account.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the Minister for National Development and Energy read the internal research memorandum of the Economic and Policy Division of the Department of Trade and Resources entitled 'Resource investment in prospect and the balance of payments-some implications for the economy'? Has he noted the amount the memorandum estimates will actually be spent overseas on capital equipment for mining ventures in Australia? Does this 'leakage', as the memorandum refers to it, represent a reduction in the amount of money that will actually be invested in Australia on Australian projects? Does he accept the estimate by participants in the North West Shelf project that 50 per cent of the investment actually will be spent overseas? Does this mean that on this project alone only half the $4,000m supposedly to be invested in Australia will in fact come to this country?</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you very much. I accept the invitation to peruse the document. I have noted that the newspapers reported that the Department of Trade and Resources had given particular figures. Estimates for the decades ahead show enormous increases in the number of ventures in Australia. As the Senate will know, the estimate from the Department of Industry and Commerce shows that something like $33 billion will be in the pipeline. I draw the attention of those who think that that may be an overestimate to the fact that a recent official publication by the New South Wales Government indicates an investment of $23 billion in that State alone. I say to those who said before that we had overestimated that the evidence is looking as though we have underestimated. Nevertheless, there will be some fallout.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is true that in order to establish the huge infrastructure that will be necessary a considerable quantity of imports of large and specialised capital equipment and goods must occur. Indeed, it is desirable that it should occur. One of the things that will happen is that the nature and character of Australian industry will expand through the need to service this new kind of capital equipment in future. That is acknowledged by Australian industry. The initial importation, apart from anything else, perhaps will ease the balance of trade and the hardening of the currency. Some will find comfort in that. It will not in any way prejudice the long term employment of Australians. A new kind of technological industry will be developed in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter for commercial judgment in the end whether these figures are right. I saw the figures for the North West Shelf. I imagine that a very considerable amount of equipment will come from overseas. We will try, wherever we can, to insist that Australian industry is favoured. We are enormously interested in creating more and more job opportunities in Australia. The very development of these industries will create permanent, new and expanded job opportunities. If I can add more once I have perused the document-I assume that the document is authentic and has been made available for public circulation-I will do so.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. The Minister said in his answer that the figures were a matter for commercial judgment. Are they not also a matter for political judgment? For example, prior to the last election, Sir Phillip Lynch came up with a figure of about $33 billion which would be invested in Australia. It is quite apparent from this document and from part of the Minister's answer that at least half that sum in many instances will not be invested in Australia but will be spent overseas.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In my initial response I indicated two things: First of all, the amount of $33 billion is very conservative. The figure will be much higher. The total figure cannot be predicted at this moment. Certainly, I see a figure of $30-odd billion finding its investment residually in Australia overall. If Senator Button is asking whether a portion of any one investment figure will be taken up in imports, the answer is absolutely yes. That is to be acknowledged. Nevertheless, major and long term investment of at least that order will be generated in Australia because of the need for our own industries to expand to service the new industries. If Senator Button is seeking an offset for the initial imports, he should also put in a contra for the long term development of industry in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YH4">Senator MacGIBBON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations aware of the latest findings by Australian Public Opinion Polls, concerning 2,031 people throughout Australia, that 57 per cent of Australians favour retention of the 40-hour working week? As the Government's responsible stand on this issue appears to have the endorsement of a majority of Australians, does the Government propose to yield to the demands of a vocal minority to halt its campaign of highlighting the economic dangers of the 35-hour week? Will the Government move to eliminate penalty rates for overtime so that those unions which obtain a 35-hour week under State awards are not able to use that 35-hour week as a means of outflanking wage guidelines?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did see a newspaper report of the survey mentioned by the honourable senator in his question and I noted with some satisfaction that 57 per cent of the people surveyed favour retention of the 40-hour week. That is, of course, a very encouraging level of support for the attitude of the Government that it is not in Australia's present interest to see a general reduction in working hours in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have little doubt that the people of Australia will not be shifted from that view by interjections of the sort that we have heard from the honourable senator opposite. I think that the public of Australia understands that, if labour costs go up, it is very likely that prices will go up and that Australia's position generally will deteriorate. Senator MacGibbon suggests in his question that the Government might move to remove the penalty rates which are payable for overtime as a means of offsetting the labour cost increases which would arise with a general reduction of working hours. I doubt whether that would be a practical course of action open to the Government, but I will refer the suggestion to the Minister for Industrial Relations. I think that the suggestion underlines the simple fact that a general reduction of working hours means an increase in costs to industry and, of necessity, a rise in the cost structure in Australia, including the cost of living of individual Australians. Indeed, this is a matter on which honourable senators will hear a statement later this morning. Perhaps I should not attempt to anticipate too much the contents of that statement.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Is the Minister representing the Minister for the Capital Territory aware of complaints that the Canberra racecourse Totalisator Agency Board displayed incorrect information relating to the starting horses in interstate races on Saturday, 21 March, specifically that a horse which subsequently gained second place in its race was shown as scratched on lists displayed by the TAB? Does the Minister agree that punters justifiably would be very angry at being thus misled and the effect this incompetence had on their decisions as to on which horses they invested their money? Has the Minister ordered, or will he order, an investigation of who was responsible for this serious error in a matter on which the TAB should be scrupulously reliable?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Although I am not a great follower of races, particularly in the Australian Capital Territory, I have some information about this matter. I am aware of the complaints of particular punters. I imagine that if I were a punter of note I would be as upset as some of those of whom Senator Martin has spoken. I can confirm the fact that a horse was shown as scratched in the sixth race and that, in fact, that horse ran second. However, I am informed that the TAB has informed the Minister that the mistake was noted and corrected 25 minutes before the start of the race, and that a public announcement of the change was made. I am unable to confirm for Senator Martin whether that in fact occurred in all cases and in all offices. I may need to get some further information about that for her. I understand that those people who feel aggrieved in this matter can take their case to the TAB and have it considered. I understand that such cases will receive sympathetic consideration.</PARA></TALK.START>

Is it true that under the proposed new arrangements the consultative functions of the Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission are to be taken over by a part time advisory council and that its funding functions-what is left of them-are to be taken over by the Attorney-General's Department? How can the Attorney-General reconcile these new arrangements with his speech of 18 February this year when he said, among other things, that it was wrong in principle for legal aid ever to be administered within the Attorney-General's Department? Finally, will he give a clear assurance or undertaking that the Commonwealth's funding of legal aid-in particular the funding of the State commissions-will not fall in real terms following this move?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has taken some decisions in principle in relation to the Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission. I am not in a position to make any announcement in relation to these matters. We have entered into agreements in relation to legal aid matters with four States which have established legal aid commissions and it is necessary to consult with the States in relation to these questions. I am in the process of doing that at present.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Naturally, as Senator Missen quite rightly says, at this stage any changes in the Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission will require the consent of the Parliament. As I have said, I cannot make any announcement of what the Government's decisions will be because they cannot be finalised until those consultations with the States with which there are agreements are concluded and the Government considers the views of those States. However, I want to make it quite clear that there is no intention on the part of the Government to reduce its commitments to the level of legal aid or the commitments it has made in agreements with the States to maintain the level of activity of legal aid. There are no renegotiations in that area whatsoever.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What I said in the speech which I made at a seminar on legal aid held in Melbourne some weeks ago and to which Senator Evans referred-I reiterate it here-was that I am concerned about the administrative costs of legal aid and I would like to see new arrangements, if possible, to reduce the administrative costs because the legal aid dollar is under a fair deal of strain. I want to see that money go as far as possible in giving direct assistance to people who need legal aid rather than it being spent on administration. That is the overriding principle on which I am approaching this problem and on which the Government is approaching this problem. Also, I believe that the Commonwealth has to maintain not only its major funding role, which will be maintained in this area, but also certain functions such as looking at legal aid on a national level, certain responsibilities on a national level, research into legal aid and so on. Obviously there are some continuing functions, none of which are under consideration to be cut out at the Commonwealth level. But certainly, as I said, none of the discussions that are taking place involve any reduction in the actual commitment of the Commonwealth Government to its existing responsibilities for funding legal aid.</PARA>

I think that is wrong in principle. I certainly reiterate that. Of course, the decisions on what funds will be made available and the recommendations to this Parliament have to be made by the responsible Minister on the advice of the Attorney-General's Department.

Will the Minister verify, firstly, that there is racial integration in South African sport at all levels-for example, South Africa's national soccer team consists of blacks and whites; secondly, that a non-white gentleman heads the South African cricket union; and, thirdly, that for more than 10 years athletics in South Africa have been racially integrated?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask a question of the Minister representing the Treasurer. Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the recent collapse of two insurance broking firms, Kinloch (Insurances) Pty Ltd and the One Stop Insurance Shop Pty Ltd, at a cost to their clients of millions of dollars? Does the Minister realise that these are only the latest of a series of failures by insurance brokers which have left hundreds of thousands of ordinary people without the insurance cover for which they paid? Does she also realise that some people with large claims against the failed brokers have been forced into bankruptcy? Why is the Government so reluctant to protect the Australian public by introducing legislation to regulate the insurance broking industry? Why is it still possible for an insurance broker to set himself up without training and experience, to operate without belonging to the partly self-regulatory brokers associations, and to set up a business in one State in Australia despite having left millions of dollars worth of debts in another State? Finally, why has no action been taken on the recommendation of the inquiry into insurance agents and brokers by the Law Reform Commission, despite Senator Carrick's undertaking in 1978 that the Government would make a rapid decision on broker regulation after the inquiry had submitted its report? Will the Government undertake to implement the Commission's draft legislation in the near future?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The Treasurer's attention was drawn to the report referred to with regard to Kinloch (Insurances) Pty Ltd. The Treasurer dealt with a question on this matter on 5 March of this year. With regard to the further questions raised by Senator Chipp relating to the Law Reform Commission's report, I am able to state that this report was tabled in Parliament on 16 September of last year by the Attorney-General. The matters referred to by Senator Chipp lead me to suspect that he understands the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission's report. The statement made at the time of the tabling of that report indicated that departmental officers were undertaking an assessment of the report. The views of the industry associations, the State governments and other interested parties were sought by the Government following the tabling of that report. To the date of the brief that I have on this matter, certain key industry bodies had not made any submissions on the matter and some of the State governments had not responded. I understand that the Western Australian Government intends to introduce legislation in this area shortly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the matters raised by Senator Chipp with regard to the Government's response to the report, I say on behalf of the Treasurer that the Government will consider the options on the matter as soon as practicable following receipt of the submissions sought on the recommendations. Views are held by some segments of the insurance industry to the effect that supervisory legislation would be welcomed and should be introduced. The Government regards the input from all interested bodies, such as the industry groups, as important and as an essential pre-requisite to the making of a sound assessment of the Commission's recommendations. In general terms, when all submissions are received they will be considered, and the recommendations of the Law Reform Commission will be considered by the Government at that time.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Veterans' Affairs will be aware of newspaper reports on Monday noting that a team of eminent Australian scientists, led by Professor Charles Kerr of the Commonwealth Institute of Health, fears that hundreds of tonnes of a toxic chemical which makes up the defoliant agent orange were clandestinely imported and sold in Australia. Does the Minister agree that, if it is shown that such chemicals were imported into Australia, the validity of the Government's epidemiological study of veterans' illnesses will be severely undermined? When was the Minister first made aware of the fact that the inquiry under his jurisdiction was also being frustrated by the Bureau of Customs? The team of scientists referred to claimed that the Australian Bureau of Customs 'has declined to be of any assistance in determining the true nature or origins of the imports from Singapore'. When was the Minister first alerted to that possibility? What steps has he taken to ensure that the Bureau of Customs gives its fullest co-operation to the inquiry under his jurisdiction?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter to which Senator Tate has referred is quite a complex one. If he will just bear with me for a moment, I will explain one or two things to him. Firstly, the material being discussed has a very long name-I will have to use the acronym KTCP-and is in fact a constituent in the manufacture of 2,4,5-T. It is not in itself a defoliant. I am advised that it does not contain any dioxin or poison of that kind. The situation is that there has been speculation that some of this material was brought into Australia in the early 1970s. No information is available to me yet as to how much came in in the early 1970s. I am investigating the matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have been in touch with Dr Peter Hall who is one of the people who brought the matter to the attention of the public by way of an article which appears in the April 1981 edition-I do not know quite how that could be since April has not arrived yet-of the journal Chemistry in Australia. The article made the point-I will obtain more specific information for Senator Tate on this so that he can see it clearly-that if this material was in fact present in Australia and was used in the manufacture of 2,4,5-T which was then spread throughout Australia, it may have had some impact upon the study which is being undertaken by my Department. But I must say that at this stage all this is speculation. There is no confirmation of any facts. I am sure that Dr Peter Hall will confirm that to Senator Tate if he cares to telephone him and discuss it with him. Nevertheless, the honourable senator asked whether I am aware of this; yes, I am. I am looking into the matter further and will obtain further reports on it. At this stage I am not at all clear as to how much material was used in Australia and, in fact, whether it was not destroyed in some way and did not get into the manufactured stage of 2,4,5-T.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I wish to ask a supplementary question because one section of my question was not answered by the Minister, probably inadvertently, given the technical material that he so masterfully put forward. The obscurity in obtaining the facts may be due, as the scientists allege, to the refusal of the Bureau of Customs to co-operate in detailing the origin and nature of certain suspected imports from Singapore. My question concerns whether the Minister has taken steps and, if so, what steps, to verify the complaint of the scientists in that regard? What steps has he taken to ensure the full co-operation of the Bureau in the future?</PARA></TALK.START>

Indeed I am pursuing the matter with the Bureau of Customs. I will then see what the answer is. It may not necessarily be so important to know when the material came in or how much came in as to know what happened to it. It is that aspect which I am pursuing most vigorously at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>

Has the Minister noted an item in today's Sydney Morning Herald reporting that a Soviet satellite in orbit over Australia is being blamed for radio interference on radar screens at Sydney airport for the past few weeks? According to the report the signals block out part of the radar screens. Whilst they are not a danger to air traffic movements they are annoying to air traffic controllers who are subjected to intense pressure during peak hours. Will the Minister institute an inquiry into the possible effects of such interference if it becomes intensified and in particular into the fact that the satellite radio system, according to Transport Australia technicians, is being switched off and on, most likely from the ground?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware of the newspaper article which appeared today and I am aware that the article contains facts as set out by the honourable senator in his question. I think that all those who use Sydney airport and who depend upon the expertise of the air traffic controllers would have been interested in the article and would have wanted the kind of reassurance which it contained, that the air traffic controllers believe it does not in any way affect air safety. However, I am aware of the pressure under which air traffic controllers work. During my previous time in medical practice air traffic controllers quite often presented themselves with stress diseases. It is quite obvious that the occupation is one that imposes considerable stress upon them. The honourable senator asked particularly whether there is a possibility of establishing an inquiry to look at particular matters raised in the newspaper article. I think that such a decision would rest with the Minister whom I represent in this place. Accordingly I will pass on the honourable senator's request and seek the Minister's response.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my question to the Minister for National Development and Energy. The Minister will recall his many statements to the effect that the Rundle shale oil project would be the answer to Australia's energy needs and that it would be producing 240,000 barrels of oil a day by 1988. I ask the Minister: Has there been a revision of his announced target date for commencement of production at Rundle? If so, what is the reason for the revision and what is the new target date?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="783" SPEAKER="Carrick Sen The Hon J.L." NAMEID="2U4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have never stated or seen Rundle to be the answer to Australia's energy needs. I see the development of shale oil and coal liquefaction in the production of synthetic crudes as being a very significant contribution in the decades ahead to overcoming the decline. Rundle, in itself, is one of something like six or seven such projects that are shaping up in Australia. The early advice was that the gross output, that is, including the consumption of oil within the plant itself which would be considerable, would be of the order that Senator McLaren indicated. My understanding is that at the moment there are discussions between the partners regarding any necessity to revise their estimates as to the volume of product output and the time of such production. Such an announcement has not yet been made. It is inevitable that in the months of preparation in the drilling, in the determination of engineering problems and in the testing, there will be revisions. As soon as those revisions are made I imagine they will be made public.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do want to say that the picture for Australia is that the import parity pricing is producing further encouraging discoveries of both oil and gas for Australia. This will mean that we will be able to flatten somewhat what had been a sharp fall away from Bass Strait production in the 1980s and therefore to put off perhaps for some years the major need which inevitably will come for significant reliance on synthetic crudes. As we develop more gas, as we develop more oil and as we find that we can use the Bass Strait wells more efficiently, we can extend the indigenous oil. That, of course, is good news for Australia because it means that we do not have to rely so early upon the huge capitalisation required for the synthetic crudes. But I do remind Senator McLaren that I have also announced from time to time the developments of coal liquefaction in the Latrobe Valley and, of course, such prospects, not yet taken further, as Millmerran in Queensland. They all ought to be put in their positions as being part of an orchestration.</PARA>

The trend may have aberrations but it is establishing prior to the impact of this boom.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Two days ago Senator Button asked me a question relating to the Ministerial Committee on Public Information. When I made a partial and preliminary reply, I thought Senator Button was referring to a newly formed Cabinet committee of that name. So I replied partially in those terms. Subsequently I discovered from him that he was referring to a previous committee. I said that I would seek information and I have done so. The committees with that name are two separate committees, two entirely different committees. The present committee is a Cabinet committee which works entirely as a Cabinet committee without officials or outside persons in attendance. The previous committee was a grouping of Ministers who came together from time to time to discuss general public relations. From time to time those Ministers had with them other persons-members of party organisations including Mr Eggleton. So the answer, firstly, is that from time to time Mr Eggleton did attend those meetings. The nature of those meetings and discussions was not of the kind assumed by Senator Button. They were not in any way similar to the present committee's functions. The committee did not discuss the commissioning of market research or advertising agencies.

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the papers. </PARA>
<PARA>The review of Australia's demographic trends conducted by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has been tabled by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney). It is important that we look at this review and similar reviews which come before the Parliament at various times. This is a review of demographic trends and the implications of such trends for Australia in the next 20 years. As such, of course, it is important to the planning of many departmental processes and the planning of the industrial development of this country in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> Our population, as the document shows, has doubled since World War II and now we have a population of about 14.6 million people. We have the highest level of urban concentrations in the world apart from Hong Kong and Singapore. In recent years about two-thirds of this population increase has been brought about by natural increase and about one-third of it has been brought about by immigration increase. Despite this, our net reproduction rate is still declining basically, as the paper says, because women are making more choices for themselves about whether to work, whether to have families and when they will have families. The increase in the participation rate of women in the work force, of course, is well known. </PARA>
<PARA> Certain factors of the review are important and have important implications for planning in the future. The number of people over the age of 65 years is expected to increase by about two-thirds by the end of the century. The number of people over the age of 75 years is expected to double. On present trends, the proportion of people in the labour force will not decrease but it will mean that there will be an older labour force and, probably, a less flexible and a less mobile labour force. The implications of this for the products which will be demanded of our manufacturing industries and for the conditions of work which will be required for this future work force are serious. </PARA>
<PARA> The number of ex-nuptial births has increased. There has been a notable increase in the number of single parent families as a result both of choice and of what one might call mischance. This tendency for the reproduction rate to fall, for women to make more choices about what they will do outside the home, about working, and for the number of single parent families to increase is a social change which will not be changed by legislative processes in the area of social security or in related areas, as so many people in the Parliament and outside the Parliament would dearly like. It is the result of social change. It is a change which has occurred in all Western countries. It is a change which has occurred as a result of the higher status of women, the higher level of education of women, and is the choice of women themselves. In most cases it is not something which has been forced on them by any legislative process or by any economic process. </PARA>
<PARA> The key to solving the problems of the increasing aged population and the decreasing child population is to have a strong economic base so that we can support people who are forced outside the workforce by age, helplessness or other reasons. What it means is that we must develop our assets and our resources for the benefit of our people so that the wealth which is acquired from these resources can be used to benefit the people of this country who own those assets and resources. The profits of that exploitation should not be moved from this country, nor should they be outside the control of those who live in this country. There should be a conscious policy to concentrate on job opportunities for many disadvantaged groups in the community-single parents, the disabled and the presently unemployed. The implications of some of the answers which we received today and on other days in this place that the resources boom, and the resources boom alone, will solve the employment problems in this community have been quite clearly demonstrated to be false. As Senator Button demonstrated in a question today in giving the facts of the employment which is likely to come from resources development in this country, it is pointless to look to that area and to that area alone without careful planning and careful control of the development of those resources and at the same time protection of some manufacturing industry base in the community. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the problems which arise from projections of demographic trends such as this is that we get the very real predictions that in fact we will have an aging, less mobile and more dependent population and, as a result, it is seen that in the future the number of people who will need support by way of funds from the Government will in fact increase and that the proportion of people in employment who are taxed will decrease. This view is used to promote hysteria and the sorts of nonsense which we see in some of the newspapers in this country when mention is made of a welfare backlash. These people are seen by some not to be contributing to the work force and, therefore, are seen as a burden on the community. But we, as a civilised society, of course, should contribute to their welfare and should ensure that they have the same rights as other Australian citizens. Therefore, we should use demographic trends in a sen- sible way to plan for the future rather than throw up our hands or tear out our hair about what will possibly happen as a result of these changing demographic trends. Many problems will face us. The implications of the expenditure in the area of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney), including expenditure on child care and age pensions, are difficult and obviously create problems, but we can solve those problems by carefully monitoring what is happening, by carefully planning and by not being inhibited by ideological hang-ups about whether we should have public intervention in areas which will clearly be important in the future. I believe the Senate should take note of this report and that we should have a debate on its implications. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I was not going to make any comments on this document at this point. However, because of some of the remarks that Senator Grimes made, I feel obliged to do so. This is a very important document-one of the most important documents to come before the Parliament-and in my view we should at a very early stage have a full scale debate on the Review of Australia's Demographic Trends. As Senator Grimes said, the implications of the information contained in the review are widespread. However, I point to one particular aspect of the report which appears under the heading 'Introduction and Overview' where the following is stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Through the 1970s, the net reproduction rate, the most common summary measure of population replacement (taking into account both fertility and mortality trends), has, however, continued to fall, from 1.39 to 0.92 by 1979. This is below the long-term level of replacement, 1.00. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course, that is a startling revelation. It is something which a number of us realised would occur because of a number of policies and attitudes that are abroad within the community. It is of concern, as Senator Grimes said, that the Review of Australia's Demographic Trends shows that we are likely to have an aging, less mobile and more dependent population by the turn of this century. That has vast implications for our current policies in respect to taxation and employment. Senator Grimes said that the review indicated that one of the reasons for the net reproduction rate decline was that women were making more choice. In fact the Review of Australia's Demographic Trends does not use the word 'choice'. It says that the reasons include 'increased participation by women in the labour force'. That is a vastly different question from that of choice. As I have said repeatedly here, the economic policies of this Government and its Labor predecessor were designed to force married women into the paid work force and to deny them the true freedom of choice. I know that this matter is exercising the mind of Senator Chaney, the Minister for Social Security, and rightly so. These persons should, as of right, have a true freedom of choice which they do not have at this point. As I have mentioned before, one of the reasons for that is the decline in the ability of families to support themselves on one income. An aspect of that, of course, has been the erosion of the value of family allowances by more than 60 per cent since they were fixed in 1976. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, I do not think now is the time to enter into full scale debate on this point. I will flag just one issue. If the trend in Australia is towards an aging, less mobile and more dependent population, is it appropriate to continue with policies that force married women of child bearing age into the paid work force? This matter includes mortgage interest rate increases which are around the corner and so forth. For example, is it appropriate for such a heavy tax burden to be shouldered by salary and wage earners in the pay-as-your-earn bracket if these people are to be a declining influence in the population structure in Australia? I point out to the Senate that receipts from pay-as-your-earn income represented 36 per cent of total receipts in 1960-61. That figure grew to 53.7 per cent in 1980-81. Income from company tax declined, as a percentage of total income, from 19.8 per cent in 1960-61 to the current 14.2 per cent of 1980-81. I think this very important paper will affect policy decisions of the Government and of policy makers in Australia for some considerable time. Like Senator Grimes, I would like to see a full scale debate on this paper at an early stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is not right. The Labor Government, during its reign, never put an advocate into the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to oppose an increase in the national wage; but this Government did. We left it to the Arbitration Commission to judge the needs of the people in regard to the consumer price index and to give a just decision. We never put an advocate into the court. We never did that at any time. We gave massive increases right across the board in pension and social security payments. We gave massive increases in education expenditure. For Senator Harradine to stand in this place and say that it was the policy of a Labor government to force married women into the work force is quite erroneous. I do not know why the honourable senator said that but he probably has his reasons. We did our very best in the three years in government to uplift the living standards of every man, woman and child. I am most disgusted with Senator Harradine who has said that the Labor Party forced married women into the work force. Such a statement might be true of this Government. I agree with the honourable senator on that point because the Government, every time we go to court to try to get increased wages or reduced working hours for those in the work force, opposes that. Senator Harradine is right in that respect. He is completely wrong when he tries to associate the Labor Government with this capitalistic government in trying to reduce the living standards of the workers and return them to serfdom in this country. I hope that when we have a full scale debate on this subject the honourable senator will be able to bring forward some facts to prove what he has said.

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The Opposition welcomes the appearance of the first report of the new National Companies and Securities Commission for the year ended 30 June 1980. But we do note that it has been quite a remarkably long time in its preparation and presentation for what essentially is such a slim volume. We hope that this will not be a forerunner of things to come when the Commission is in full operation and as a result its reports are more eagerly awaited. This report is a slim volume for the reason that it covers only the period from the inception of the Commission on 11 March last year, that is 1980, to 30 June in that year. During that time the Commission was simply being established, gearing up to the administrative arrangements and developing channels for consultation with the various relevant organisations around the country. It had then no substantive legislation to administer and the account given in the report of the activities of the Commission during that period is perfectly understandable and in fact informatively documented. </PARA>
<PARA> A more alarming consideration is that now, some nine months after the period to which this report refers, there is no substantive legislation for the Commission to be administering. Neither of the Bills which were passed last year and amended this year, namely the Securities Industry Act and the takeovers Act properly described as the Companies (Acquisition of Shares) Act, although having been passed by this Parliament and having become Acts has yet been proclaimed into effect because the States still have not passed the necessary complementary legislation to apply the substance of those Acts in the State domain. </PARA>
<PARA> More importantly still, the Companies Bill which is intended to be the keystone of the whole regulatory arch in this area does not appear now to be any closer to fruition than it was at this time last year. The start-up date for the whole of the legislative scheme, we were told at this stage last year, was to be 1 January 1981. Now it is being said that the likely start-up date will be 1 January 1982. The day and the month stay the same; it is just the year that continues to change. There is no doubt that while the Ministerial Council and the States are fiddling in this way, Rome undoubtedly does continue to burn so far as companies and securities law is concerned. Scandals or what look likely to be scandals like the Negri River float for example, continue to erupt, takeovers or profitable non-takeovers continue to take place and in a highly unsatisfactory regulatory framework. There is still a diversity of obligations which ought to be imposed on directors in relation to their responsibilities not only to their shareholders but also to the community at large, which are insufficiently imposed by the present companies legislation and which must be the subject of urgent new national legislation. But still there is no sign of that legislation finally appearing and no sign of the National Companies and Securities Commission actually being given as a result some work to do. </PARA>
<PARA> What is happening now with the companies Bill itself has been a matter of considerable public speculation. My own understanding is that a gutting and filleting operation of fairly spectacular dimensions has been taking place in recent months and that the latest Bill which has been recently agreed upon by the Ministerial Council contains none of the even limited innovations and reforms which were contained in the original discussion draft, which was widely circulated over a year ago, and the Bill that was actually tabled last year. The new Bill, as I understand it, simply represents the lowest common denominator of existing State Companies Act provisions. It may be that it is being hoped that the innovatory process will commence once this new companies Bill is in fact on foot as a piece of legislation and the requirement of unanimity as to its terms is replaced by one of majority agreement only. But we in the Opposition cannot help but greet with profound scepticism the whole process which is now unfolding. We have always taken the view, and we take it again today, that effective far-reaching companies legislation will operate only when the Commonwealth abandons the impossible task of seeking concensus from the self-interested, chauvinist, parochially obsessed States in this country and unilaterally exercises its own undoubted Commonwealth powers. </PARA>
<PARA> We wish the new National Companies and Securities Commission well and we hope that it does in fact succeed in its urgently necessary task of exercising a supervisory role over the whole operation of company and security operations in this country. But on the evidence of the progress to date as revealed in this report and the non-developments since the middle of last year, we can have no cause for optimism whatever on this score. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to this motion might I say that I am grateful to Senator Evans for his not seeking leave to continue his remarks because I believe that when such leave is sought no other honourable senator should then seek leave to speak. It complicates the program and makes things exceedingly difficult.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Until I heard what Senator Evans had to say I had intended to express my enthusiasm at the presentation of the first annual report of the National Companies and Securities Commission and to say that the Senate could congratulate itself insofar as the rather extensive inquiry that was carried out by a committee of the Senate had reached fruition and we now have a National Companies and Securities Commission. The Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange carried out a very exhaustive investigation of the securities industry and found it very much wanting indeed. While that Senate Committee was conducting its inquiries the securities industry regulated itself and showed considerable caution. But anyone who heard what Senator Evans had to say would feel that what was achieved during that rather lengthy period of investigation has now been rendered quite fruitless because, as he said, Rome continues to burn. My impression, knowing the roguery that went on in the industry is that Rome now burns even more vigorously. New techniques have been developed -techniques that achieve the same result, that is, the corruption of the capital raising industry. The securities industry is being corrupted. It is being destroyed. The confidence of the investing community is being undermined. Unless that legislation that will enable the Commission to function is enacted it may be necessary for the Senate to take another look at what is happening. It may be necessary even at this late stage for the Government to review the methods that it sought to use to achieve the establishment of the Commission, that is, by means of co-operative federalism. Obviously to this point it has failed because we have not got the legislation that is necessary for the Commission to investigate some practices which are taking place at the present time and which horrify even me, though I am conditioned to such manipulations by that long investigation that we undertook. The Select Committee recommended that national legislation be enacted. By a variety of delaying tactics the Government, the Liberal Party and some leading members of it in Western Australia in particular, were responsible by this long delay and by forcing a change of government for having the approach altered to one of co-operative federalism. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Evans has pointed out that some of the States have not, as yet, passed the enabling or supporting legislation. It was pointed out by the Committee that that is exactly what would happen; that is, that one of the States would delay the implementation of legislation or would not carry out the necessary amendments to further legislation. The most effective way to control the securities industry is by national legislation and by a national approach because it is a national industry. This Commission ought to be looking at the Holmes a'Court operation. On three occasions Holmes a'Court has engaged in what I have heard described, for the first time, as a profitable non-takeover. It is a phrase which describes exactly what is going on. We learned of this practice in a smaller way. It was called the churning of shares. The values of shares were churned and the insiders knew exactly when the churning would peak, took their profit and moved out. Someone was left holding the baby, to use an old cliche. </PARA>
<PARA> That is exactly what is going on at present. South Australians, in loyalty to a company which they consider to be their own, raced in to protect that company and, of course, the price of the shares went up. At a particular point Holmes a'Court pulled out. Those people who were aware of what Holmes a'Court was doing, the insiders who knew the timing, were also able to take substantial profits. The Commission would investigate the means by which this was done. It would be able to look at this recurring practice and would be able to determine that it was a raid upon the securities industry and a raid upon the pockets of the investors. It would take a look at the situation in South Australia and find out just how many people were deprived of substanial sums of money by the Holmes a'Court operation. But nothing will be done because the Commission does not have the power to do it. It seems to me that the Senate will get very close to referring this type of takeover to one of its standing committees or to a select committee it sets up. This is roguery at its worst. It seems to me also that one could take it further and say that it was done in such a way that the public purse also will be at a disadvantage. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been implied in questions in the Senate that no tax will be paid on these transactions. If the figure of $16.5m is correct, a lot of money is being taken from a lot of people and finishing up in the pockets of one person. That is redistribution of wealth the other way round. This Commission is not in a position to carry out an investigation of the Holmes a'Court operation. I am told that he engaged in this practice in the United Kingdom in regard to the Rolls Royce company. He has done it in Australia on two previous occasions and he can do it on a third and fourth occasion because at present the Commission does not have the power or the legislation to take the necessary action to investigate and to close the loopholes he is using. If that is the case, and if this legislation is going to be delayed continually by the States, this Parliament will have to take the initiative and say: 'We have tried to do it by co-operative federalism and failed. We ought to revert to the Senate Select Committee's recommendation that there should be national legislation'. Failing that, I think it is the responsibility of the Senate, if it cannot refer it to a standing committee or if it is not pertinent to do so, to set up again the Senate Select Committee to investigate, in particular, the Holmes a'Court operations. We cannot allow this situation to go further. I welcome the fact that there is a Commission now. I will also welcome the day when the Commission has the legislation that is necessary to give it the power to deal with the roguery which I have just described. As no one else wishes to speak, I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-The Australian economy is poised to enter a period of considerable growth. The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development has forecast that economic growth in Australia in 1981 will be the highest of all developed economies. The year 1981 represents the beginning of a period of expansion as resources development intensifies and economic growth is consolidated. I regret to state, however, that the benefits of much of this growth will be jeopardised if recent trends in earnings continue and if the union campaign for a 35-hour week is successful. The Government is aware that an estimated 36 per cent of all full time non-managerial employees are currently working less than 40 hours a week. It does not follow, however, that the economy can stand an across-the-board application of a 35-or even a 37 1/2-hour week to the total work force.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Although the Australian economy has achieved some stability over the past six years, that stability would be seriously jeopardised if the shorter working hours campaign was achieved in the near future. It is worrying enough that claims that have a damaging economic impact are made, but this damage is compounded by the fact that trade unions are pursuing these claims by direct industrial action; action which is disruptive to the Australian community and robs the economy of its full potential. Over recent weeks the unions' shorter working hours campaign has received widespread attention. These claims are bound up with the more general issue of wage demands. It is crucial that restraint be exercised. Those engaged in the union campaign seem to ignore the fact that their campaign for reduced hours and their unremitting pressures for wage increases will seriously damage the Australian economy and undermine the benefits of the period of growth. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is deeply concerned about this situation. It is necessary therefore to ensure that all Australians are aware of the threat posed if the current campaign continues and is successful. Reductions in hours of work prima facie lead to an increase in hourly wage costs. Wage costs are the most significant element in unit labour costs, and increases in unit labour costs are a significant element in price increases. I strongly emphasise the Government's concern about the possible growth of unit labour costs in the light of the recent trends in wages and earnings and in view of the number of current claims for shorter working hours. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's primary economic objective is to promote a growth in the standard of living of every member of the Australian community. However, this can be achieved only if the problem of inflation is overcome. The consequences of sustained high rates of inflation are well known to honourable senators. It damages business confidence, curtails investment, reduces international competitiveness and weakens demand, economic activity and employment. Further high rates of inflation have a destablising impact on wage fixation and industrial relations. Wage restaint is crucial in meeting the primary anti-inflation objective. Developments on labour costs could have a significant influence on the course of inflation in the short and medium terms. If growth in money and real wages is not restrained and/or labour costs are added to by reductions in working hours, then clearly the battle against inflation will be made all the more difficult. Every worker knows from experience that a wage increase does mean a price increase. The higher the wage increase, the greater the consequent effect on prices and the living standards of people. </PARA>
<PARA> Since 1974-75 the rate of inflation has been reduced. This has been the result of and a vindication of the Government's policies. Whilst inflation in the year to the December quarter 1980 dropped to 9.3 per cent, this is regarded by the Government as too high. Unfortunately, and this must be understood, there is no prospect of the much needed further significant decline in inflation if the current surge in labour cost is not moderated. In the period since 1978 the acceleration in the rate of growth in award wages, combined with renewed over-award activity, has resulted in significant earnings growth. It is a matter of concern to the Government that there has been such an acceleration of wage movements since 1978. This reflects both increases through the indexation of award wages and increases gained outside national wage cases. </PARA>
<PARA> Award wage increases for work value adjustments began to occur in late 1978 and have gathered momentum so that a very large proportion of the work force has now participated in that work value 'round'. Wage increases of the order of $8 a week have been awarded across a wide range of industries. Additionally, the increasing importance of over-award payments has been reflected in the re-emergence of considerable earnings drift since late 1979. For example, the most recent statistics available indicate that, in the December quarter last year, the series for average weekly ordinary time earnings for full time non-managerial employees showed a 15.2 per cent increase over the corresponding quarter in the previous year. When this is compared with the 9.3 per cent increase in the consumer price index over that period it is quite apparent that employees have made significant real gains over the last 12 months. Clearly such rates of wage increase cannot be allowed to continue without adverse implications for the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is concerned that these labour cost pressures are in the system. We are concerned that some union leaders apparently think there is some bottomless pit into which they can dig for wage increases without affecting the economy or the well-being and the employment prospects of their own members. The lessons of the 1970s have not been learnt well enough by some union officials. But that is not the end of it. Now, superimposed on these excessive wage pressures is the union campaign for a shorter working week. A campaign which, if successful, would lift unit labour costs in Australia by such magnitude as to erode significantly our advances in lowering inflation, erode seriously business profitability, confidence and international competitiveness, reduce employment and generally undermine the return to economic health which is under way. </PARA>
<PARA> Unions are increasingly pursuing their wage demands and their unrealistic demands for a 35-hour week with direct industrial action. This magnifies the economic consequences of the unions' demands. Industry, that is the livelihood of both employers and workers, faces increased costs due to the effects of industrial action and employers face greater uncertainty in planning decisions for the same reason. Their decision on whether to invest in new machinery and equipment, or in new building and construction works, or to expand employment and in-plant training schemes for workers, becomes far more difficult if they cannot make reasonable estimates of the degree to which such machinery, plant and workforce will be idle because of industrial disruption in their own or interdependent industries. </PARA>
<PARA> The Conciliation and Arbitration Commission does not share the view of some unions that the effects of industrial action are not significant and serious. In its national wage case decision of 14 July last, it discounted the increase awarded in specific recognition of the damage caused by the excessive levels of industrial disruption that prevailed. More recently, in its national wage case decision of 9 January of this year, the Commission identified the excessive levels of disputation as one of the factors which led to the suspension of wage indexation. In the latter decision the Commission said:</PARA>
<PARA> Costs to the economy arising from stoppages and bans threaten not only improvements in real wages and conditions but even the maintenance of existing standards. This is not a moral judgment but a matter of hard economic reality.</PARA>
<PARA>The effects, both direct and indirect, of the shorter hours campaign have now been felt in all States and many sectors of the economy. Some, and this is by no means a comprehensive list of the areas directly concerned include: The engineering and metals sector, shipbuilding and repair, mining equipment manufacturing, glass manufacturing, power generation, the brewing industry, and the Altona petro-chemical complex. In relation to the Altona petro-chemical settlement, the Minister for Industrial Relations has already said that it is disgraceful that the form of industrial pressure used by the unions concerned at the complex over such a long period has brought about a settlement so costly to the public interest. The Government intervened in this hearing and strongly argued against the settlement. It continues to oppose the productivity bargaining concept in its application to reduced working hours. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to note that the Commission began consideration of this matter in September 1980 before the last national wage case began. It will be recalled that the Commission was strongly critical of this type of campaign by the unions in bringing down its decision in that case. When the Australian Council of Trade Unions took over the shorter working hours campaign last year it was claimed that direct industrial action would be minimised. It was stated that the ACTU was co-ordinating the campaign and the implication was that it would be less disruptive. Unfortunately for the community and the Australian economy this has not been the case. Take for example the situation in the metal industry. This is a major sector of Australian industry. It has thousands of employers who provide jobs for hundreds of thousands of Australians. It is an industry which in a very real way confronts competition from overseas. It has been disrupted by direct industrial action of some form or another for nearly 12 months now. If the unions think they have a justifiable claim, they should cease this harmful action and submit their claims to arbitration. They have not done so. They are resisting arbitration. That is not an attitude usually taken by groups who believe they have justifiable claims. It is an attitude of groups who recognise the unreasonableness of their position and have to resort to the weapon of duress to try to get their own way. </PARA>
<PARA> The economic consequences of reduced hours of work must be clearly understood. The implications of the campaign are enormous and the public should be made aware of the facts. The Government intends that this be done. The effect of reduced standard hours is best understood by thinking about the costs of producing a given level of output. Assuming that the given level of output requires the same total number of hours of labour input whether standard hours are 40 or 35-in other words that labour productivity is the same-an employer has to pay out more in wages to purchase the required labour input if standard hours are reduced. If a sector which currently works a standard 40-hour week were to move to 35-hours there are a number of courses of action open to an employer. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, he could seek to maintain his level of output by taking on more employees. If he were to do this, unit labour costs must increase. The weekly standard wage remains the same so that the hourly wage rate is higher. As well, an extra five hours labour has to be paid for at this higher hourly rate to maintain the level of output. In this case unit labour costs could increase by about 14 per cent. This is a clear disincentive to the employment of more people and, as I will explain later, gives the lie to arguments that shorter working hours would stimulate the overall level of employment. Secondly, an employer faced with a reduction of weekly standard hours from 40 to 35 could seek to maintain his level of output by having his existing work force work more overtime. This would compound the cost factor in the first example because if the difference is made up with additional overtime the penalty rates involved would cause an added burden on unit labour costs. As a result, they could increase by about 21 per cent. Finally, as an alternative to maintaining output, an employer confronted with such a labour cost rise could allow his output to fall. If he were to do this, no extra employees or overtime would be required but unit labour costs still increase since the same total is being paid in wages but output has fallen. </PARA>
<PARA> If the employer or industry concerned were to accept a reduction in output broadly in line with the reduction in hours worked, unit labour costs could increase by 12 1/2 per cent. Cost increases of this magnitude would clearly have a devastating effect on Australian industry. Now, employers facing an increase in unit labour costs of this order can be expected to increase their selling prices. They may or may not increase them in the same proportion as the increase in unit labour costs, but two things are clear: Firstly, the increase in costs resulting from a substantial reduction in the standard working week would be so large as to ensure some significant price response; and, secondly, if employers do not fully cover their increase in costs, their profits are eroded. This will inevitably reduce the level of economic activity and, consequently, the number of jobs available. The price response is, of course, just another expression for the effect on the rate of inflation. </PARA>
<PARA> I ask the Senate to contemplate the consequences for the CPI of a jump in the rate of increase of unit labour costs-currently in the order of 10 per cent-to something like 20 per cent or 25 per cent if there is a general move to a 35-hour week. The proper conclusion is inescapable to all except those who, for their own selfish purposes, will not admit it. We must consolidate the recent improvements in economic growth which have been reflected in the consistent growth in employment over the past year or so. A higher labour cost input would reduce business profitability and business confidence and undermine the competitiveness of Australian industry; it would inhibit any long term advantage in promoting employment. Inflationary expectations can themselves adversely affect the economy's performance. This is the situation that now confronts us. The realisation of those expectations would be disasterous. In this context, the shorter working hours campaign is particularly ominous. </PARA>
<PARA> Those advocating a reduction in standard hours argue that such a move would create additional employment opportunities and would thus assist the unemployed. Those arguments are simplistic and misleading, ignoring as they do changes which such labour cost increases will cause in the aggregate demand for labour. The avenues for adverse effects on the demand for labour-namely, the impact of the initial increase in unit labour costs on inflation, international competitiveness, profitability and the desire to substitute away from labour-are so pervasive as to ensure that the supposed employment gains will not be realised. It is ridiculous to suggest that a change that would have the effect of dampening aggregate demand, shifting demand away from Australian production, and of increasing the cost of employing labour would actually stimulate employment. </PARA>
<PARA> Those advocating a reduction in hours sometimes argue that the cost increase will not be significant because there could be productivity offsets. Given the magnitude of labour costs mentioned earlier, up to 21 per cent, such productivity growth would have to be extraordinary. Firstly, the rate of productivity growth would have to take a sudden leap to compensate for any significant reduction in working hours and, more importantly, it would have to be sustained at this new, higher level if the reduction were not to have adverse implications in the future. Because it is clear that unions also have expectations of wage increases based on annual productivity growth then any productivity growth to offset a reduction of working hours would need to be over and above the underlying rate of growth in the Australian economy. Clearly it is nonsense to suggest that this is attainable for any large segment of the work force. The flaw in the unions' argument is that on the one hand they say that productivity growth will cover the increased costs, and on the other hand they tell us that shorter working hours are necessary to provide additional employment opportunity. Clearly if productivity were to increase to the extent that there was no increase in unit labour costs, then there would be no need to increase employment. Output could be maintained at existing levels of employment. These unions cannot have it both ways. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one final point about labour costs that I wish to emphasise. It is the fact that labour costs play a very vital role in whether Australian industry is internationally competitive. Any increase in the Australian inflation rate now would be contrary to world trends. Any failure to match a declining trend in world inflation would have implications for Australia's international competitiveness. This proposition can be applied to the economy as a whole or any sector of it. The continued viability of many enterprises and the extent to which they can establish export markets, depends heavily on their competitive position. This applies whether they be large corporations or small businesses. Let there be no understatement of the potential magnitude of the impact of a five hour shortening of the standard working week. It could increase unit labour costs in the industries concerned by as much as 21 per cent. The inflationary consequences of this should be clear to all. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Acting Deputy President, the points that I have made form the basis of the Government's concern. If a close check cannot be held on rising labour costs then Australia's economic prospects are lessened. Because of the high potential costs involved, this applies in particular to working hours claims. If unions believe that they have justifiable claims let them come forward and have them tested by arbitration. Let them come forward and allow both sides of the argument to be put and let the result rest on merit rather than industrial might. The Government expects employers to resist industrial pressures for increased wages and reduced hours. We intend to ask employers collectively and individually to resist such claims. The Minister for Industrial Relations has written this week to three firms which are reported to have conceded shorter working hours. He has asked for details of any concessions they may have made and will be making a report to the Government on appropriate responses. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is heartened by employers' general attitude to date. The Government will be supporting them in their stance with all appropriate means. We intend to approach State governments and urge them to support a resistance to inflationary pressures. It must be recognised that all governments have a responsibility in this regard. We are inviting the ACTU to sit down and talk and we will explain in detail the reasons for our opposition to reduced working hours, higher wage demands and the economic consequences of such actions. We will be taking all appropriate opportunities before industrial tribunals to advocate the need for restraint in handling wages and shorter working hours claims because of the very real implications for the national economy. </PARA>
<PARA> As I indicated earlier the Government's approach to the unions' campaign is one which is strongly supportive of employers who stand up to the union pressure. This is the only responsible action for the Government to take. We intend to take a number of steps to lessen the burden that industrial action over the 35-hour week issue places on companies and firms. We will be requiring Federal Government departments and authorities to act flexibly and sympathetically in connection with businesses that have difficulty in meeting Government contractual obligations because of bans, strikes and other forms of industrial action as a part of the shorter working hours campaign. Pressure will not be exerted on firms in this situation. We will be asking State governments to do likewise. Naturally, we would expect that clients of firms under industrial pressures for reduced standard working hours will also exercise forbearance in calling for the execution of contracts. </PARA>
<PARA> As a Government we will not be pressing for the payment of bills by firms which have been singled out by the union campaign. Equally we will ensure that money owing to such firms by the Government and its agencies is paid promptly. We will be writing to all major Australian companies urging them not to switch orders away from firms faced with industrial difficulties as part of this general union campaign. Such a response plays into the hands of a union campaign of selective bans against some but not all companies in an industry. Clients of these firms must appreciate that a united stance is essential. </PARA>
<PARA> We are prepared to consider other measures to support employers' resistance to union claims for shorter hours. For example, we will consider measures such as the deferment of company taxation payments where companies are experiencing difficulties and other appropriate measures which might be indicated in individual circumstances. This is an indication of the Government's resolve. The Government will continue to ensure that its own authorities resist claims for shorter working hours. We will be asking State governments to adopt a similar approach. Under the Australian system of conciliation and arbitration, organisations, such as unions, gain registration. This confers on them a number of benefits but also involves responsibilities and obligations. The unions should discharge these obligations, cease their campaign of industrial action and work within the objects of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, as I indicated earlier, we will make a concerted effort to bring home to the Australian community, and that includes members of trade unions who are now engaged in industrial action in support of shorter working hours, the economic reality of the situation. The economic facts of life are simple: Australia cannot afford a reduction in working hours at this time. We will be informing the public in some detail of the reasons why. Current wage and hours demands by the trade union movement represent a very serious threat to the emerging economic recovery and lessen the potential advantages that the whole community can enjoy from the exciting projects which are ahead of us in the 1980s. The Government recognises the problem and is prepared to take all necessary steps to meet it. I move:</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has put down a lengthy statement in relation to the current issue of the 35-hour week, as it is described. I want to make some fairly brief comments about the statement and to try to express some of the attitudes of the Opposition towards this overall issue. I remind the Senate that the 40-hour week was established by a decision of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration, as it then was, in 1947. I want to refresh the memories of those honourable senators who have memories about the fact that, traditionally, hours of work in this country have been set by the arbitration tribunals. In 1947 when the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration gave its judgment in the standard hours case of that year, it stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been the historic role of employers to oppose the workers' claims for increased leisure. They have, as is well known, opposed in Parliament and elsewhere, every step in this direction, and this case is no exception. The arguments have not much changed in 100 years. Employers have feared such changes as a threat to profits; an added obstacle to production; a limitation upon industrial expansion; and a threat to internal and international trade relations. Steadily, first in one country then in another, this opposition has been overcome, until great institutions like the International Labour Organization in the international arena, this Court in this country, and the legislatures both here and elsewhere, have declared for the desirability of added leisure. </PARA>
<PARA> And history has invariably proved the forebodings of employers to be unfounded. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not say that that statement in all its particularity is apposite to the statement that has been put down by the Government. But it is an important historical statement on the social and commercial factors involved in the argument about increased leisure for employees which still has a great deal of truth in it. Since 1947 when standard working hours were set by that judgment of the Court at 40 hours a week, working hours have, in fact, steadily been going down. As paragraph 3 of the ministerial statement acknowledges, the consequences of those average hours going down are apparent today. The statement reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is aware that an estimated 36 per cent of all full-time non-managerial employees are currently working less than 40 hours a week. It does not follow, however, that the economy can stand an across the board application of a 35 or even a 37 1/2-hour week to the total work force. </PARA>
<PARA>I make it clear that the Opposition in this place, the Australian Labor Party, is not arguing for an across-the-board introduction of a 35-hour week at this stage. It is not arguing for that at all. The Opposition is arguing that there should be discussions where appropriate in connection with industry by industry arrangements to see where and how shorter working hours can be most profitably introduced for all concerned. As the Senate well knows, and as the statement acknowledges, those discussions have been taking place in various industries for some considerable period. For example, in today's Australian Financial Review there is a very good indication of that. The lead story on the front page is entitled: 'ICI in talks with unions: 35-hr Momentum Builds Up'. I shall read a little of that article which states:</PARA>
<PARA> Major chemical, fertiliser and fibre manufacturer, ICI Australia Ltd, has begun negotiations with the Chemical Workers' Union over the introduction of a shorter working week at the company's plants throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> An ICI spokesman said yesterday the Federated Ironworkers' Association and its chemical workers' sub-branch had approached the company over recent weeks . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The ICI spokesman is then reported in the article as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> We have indicated we are prepared to discuss a gradual reduction in working hours so long as a number of conditions are met, including off-setting costs with productivity increases. </PARA>
<PARA>The article goes on to state how many workers would be affected by that decision of ICI if the discussions which the company projects it will have with the unions, in fact, result in a reduction in working hours. One matter about this Government which I have the greatest difficulty understanding is the commitment-I would say a blind ideological commitment in many areas-to what it calls market force arrangements except where, of course, market force arrangements do not suit for particular reasons. For example, in the famous speech of 5 December 1980 so eloquently read by the Minister for Social Security, Senator Chaney, in Adelaide, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) said:</PARA>
<PARA> I refer rather to a system-</PARA>
<PARA>He was talking about the private enterprise system-</PARA>
<PARA>which, while recognising the necessity for restraint and a degree of Government intervention, is premised on the belief that what produces the best economic and political results is an economy based on private property and income, in which normal economic activity consists of commercial transactions voluntarily entered into by individuals and groups. </PARA>

Of course, it is not an isolated view because, as the Minister's statement points out in the paragraph to which I referred, that a very substantial portion of the Australian work force is now working 36 per cent hours less than 40 hours per week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The ICI matter to which I refer does not have any sort of revolutionary component. It is just consistent with a process which has been happening for a long period. The Opposition sees the important question in this case as being one of determining how lower hours can be most profitably introduced for all concerned on an industry basis. There are two elements, of course, in all of this. The first element is whether the Government believes-as it continually says it believes-in the operation of market forces in these matters and in the rights of companies to determine their own positions about these matters. I suppose Senator Walters is going to tell us that ICI has been stood over by somebody or other. </PARA>

At the end of the statement the Minister has brought down there is a very interesting passage to which I will refer. It relates to both the role of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission and the essential question of who determines what hours and working conditions should be. At page 15 of the Minister's statement, which he read a few minutes ago, the Minister stated:</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Lewis may make all sorts of distinctions as much as he likes, but the fact of the matter is that the Prime Minister of this country has continually exhorted people to go to the arbitration system. The Minister, in reading this statement to the Senate today, again exhorted people to go to the arbitration system. I remind the Senate of the Prime Minister's invitation of 6 July 1979. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I again ask all working men and women to stand up for your own rights. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a good invitation. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> You can support arbitration-that is your right. You and your workmates can see that the union also supports arbitration. There is no need to strike. No need to disrupt work. No need to damage yourselves, your industry or Australia. There is a better way-conciliation and arbitration-the way of the umpire. Australia needs your support. </PARA>
<PARA>That invitation is repeated, as I said, in Minister Peacock's statement in the House of Representatives today and in the statement made in the Senate-'go to arbitration about these things and you can get the umpire's decision'. The implication of it is that the Government will support them. It is now well established that if the decision does not suit the Government there will be no forthcoming support. What happens when the unions or the employers go to arbitration? The arbitration system hears from all parties. It heard from the Government in the Altona case and it heard from the unions and the employers. It made a decision which co-incided with the views of both the unions and the employers and it made a decision which in that case rejected the view of the Government. That is the thing, I suppose-if I may use the expression which I used before-which sticks in the craw. </PARA>
<PARA> What I say on behalf of the Opposition is that this matter of the reduction of working hours should be treated in Australia as it has traditionally been treated by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. If the Government, being capable as it is of participating in the system of putting arguments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, reaches the point of agony where it can no longer abide by the decisions of that tribunal, it has to do something about it as a government. It has to take the matter right on board and decide what it will do as a government if it regards the arbitration system as a suitable scapegoat for all its inadequacies, which is what it has done for years. If it does not like the system that much, it is in its power to do something about it. But while we have the system and the umpire and while the Government talks about the virtues of the umpire and continually exhorts people to abide by the umpire's decision, so should the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The question of working hours in this country has traditionally been determined in that way and it should continue to be determined in that way. In the Altona case the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission acknowledged that reduced working hours can improve productivity in industry. If the Government disagrees with that view it is capable enough, presumably, to argue it in the Commission. The Government's argument on the adverse economic impact of the 35-hour week is weakened if shorter working hours in fact are introduced where the adverse economic impact is least. Let me say-I express a totally private view about this; I am not speaking for my party, necessarily-the adverse economic impact of a shorter working week is certainly different in many small country towns from that in the major cities. That is my view. They are factors which I believe the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission should take into account in determining the reduction of hours in particular industries. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting for luncheon, we were debating the 35-hour week, as I recall. I was trying to make the point that the issue of hours in industry has traditionally been solved by arbitration tribunals and that what we are suggesting is that in this case, when the situation is that 36 per cent of the Australian work force already enjoys reduced hours, in respect of the balance it is essential that there be, if I can put it in these terms, attitudes of mutual respect and a willingness to listen, to understand, to reason and to discuss in an informed way. Those attitudes cannot be created by any party's industrial relations policy, as the present Prime Minister once put it. The question of hours should be determined, as has been suggested, by discussions about the way in which reduced hours could be implemented in particular industries, about the factors which militate against the economic desirability of reduced hours in particular industries, and so on. That seems to us to be the important point-that the Government should really make up its mind whether it accepts the arbitration system as the appropriate vehicle to deal with this or whether it is suggesting that there should be an alternative approach. In inviting the unions to go to arbitration, there is a recognition, one would hope, by the Government that, if that process happens, the Government would accept that decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the factors which has to be taken into account is the adverse economic impact which allegedly would follow from a reduction in working hours. That is a factor which has to be weighed in the balance. It is not possible for a government to determine in respect of every business and industry in this country whether shorter working hours will have an adverse economic impact. It is quite possible to say, as I believe the Government to be saying, that an across-the-board reduction in working hours would have an adverse economic impact, but it should be assessed in terms of merit in respect of each industry to see whether that adverse economic impact is likely to follow. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of things in the statement put down by the Minister call for particular comment. The statement really amounts to a sort of attack on any activity by trade unions-an attack induced by a degree of intoxication obtained from a recent opinion poll. I want to say a word or two about that opinion poll. If we look at a sample poll anywhere in Australia, I think we will see that it is a reality that many of those who pronounce on this question are in receipt of reduced working hours. The greatest opponents of reduced working hours are to be found amongst those who already enjoy them. Even amongst those who are not enjoying reduced working hours, there are many who would say: 'Yes, reduced working hours are appropriate for me but totally inappropriate for the fellow next door'. I think that is a reality of the formation of public opinion on such matters. The statement amounts in effect to something of a tirade, if I can use that expression in a not unkind way, against any improvement in working conditions and against union activity related to those conditions, which is quite a popular catch cry but which is an insufficient analysis of the relationship between a claim for reduced working hours and the alleged economic consequences. </PARA>
<PARA> One particular point in the statement to which I want to refer is the Government's commitment which is expressed in these terms:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's primary economic objective is to promote a growth in the standard of living of every member of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA>I find that somewhat strange used in an argument relating to the discussion of working hours in the context of a situation in which a very substantial majority of people enjoy reduced working hours. If the Government has that commitment to promote a growth in the standards of living of every member of the Australian community, if I might say so again without unkindness, it is not doing very well because the standards of living of the community depend on a number of things which are in turn dependent on government activity. For example, they are determined by such questions as the provision of comprehensive and adequate health services. In the sense of the Australian work force they depend upon such questions as industrial safety, industrial health and relationships between employers and employees-all matters to which the Jackson report on manufacturing industry devoted a lot of attention five years ago now and, as a consequence of which, nothing has happened in terms of what this Government has done to improve standards of living, in the industrial sense, in the work place sense. </PARA>
<PARA> The standards of living of every member of the Australian community are dependent on housing, for example. This Government has an extraordinarily bad record in relation to housing, which is now developing as a crisis situation in Australia. The standards of living of the Australian community are dependent upon the disposable income available to families. Let me just say very briefly on that score that the average Australian family is statistically and undoubtedly in fact worse off as a result of this Government's policies than it was previously. It is at least $16 to $18 a week worse off-paying more in real terms in respect of taxation. For those on incomes over $700 a week income tax has fallen, but for all those below that income taxation has risen. The burden on pay-as-you-earn taxpayers has increased under the present Government. The Government has failed to index family allowances, which has resulted again in an erosion of family disposable incomes by $3.70 a week. The introduction of family allowances was a great achievement-the only one that comes to mind-of the Fraser Government. But in terms of living standards five years later, it has become something of a meaningless initiative. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that the average family now has to pay $7 a week more in health insurance payments than in 1975 to get some level of cover again represents a substantial erosion of the standard of living of every Australian. There has been a cut in disposable income in terms of award wages for PAYE earners. The one income family with four dependent children, and a breadwinner bringing in $160 a week, is now about $25.40 a week below the poverty line. Some people talk of two million people in Australia living below the poverty line. I appreciate Senator Chaney's nod-we could have all sorts of arguments about that-but I do not think the general conclusion, which is supported by the figures on taxation, on health insurance costs, on the erosion of family living standards, and so on, is inconsistent with that figure to any extent. The position of people under the age of 18 on the unemployment benefit has been eroded considerably. There have been changes in the level of average weekly earnings. </PARA>
<PARA> Pensioners living in rental accommodation have suffered a deterioration in their economic situation as a result of the policies of this Government. One could go on and on about these sorts of things. As I understand it, the Australian Bureau of Statistics January income survey showed that in 1979 one million households-single income earners-had an income of less than $67 a week. That is about the equivalent of an overnight allowance of a member of this Parliament but it is the disposable income of some one million households or families in Australia. So when the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peacock) in this statement about the hours of work in the Australian community talks about the Government's objective of increasing living standards in Australia for every Australian and says that the 35-hour week proposition is an attack on the capacity to improve living standards, that may have a grain of truth in it but it is obfuscating the issue in terms of the changes in family living standards which have taken place in Australia in the last five years. So there are a number of rationalisations, as it were, of the Government's position in this statement which do not bear much examination. </PARA>
<PARA> The other thing which I find extraordinary about this statement is that not once in the whole statement is the question of technological change and its impact on the work force mentioned. I appreciate that there are all sorts of views about whether the provision of shorter working hours is the best and most appropriate solution to unemployment induced by technological change. There are all sorts of arguments about the question and I do not for one moment pretend to have all the answers, but let me say this: There is very widespread anticipation by the Australian community as to one of the solutions to the impact of technological change. Many solutions such as job sharing, part time employment, various forms of short shift work arrangements and so on are suggested in a society where the work force has technology impinging on its potential employment on a daily basis. One of the solutions to the problem of unemployment induced by technological change which is frequently suggested and widely discussed in the community is the question of shorter working hours. I find it quite extraordinary that a Minister for Industrial Relations can bring down a statement without any discussion of the arguments relating to that matter because the discussion within the community is very widespread. </PARA>

As honourable senators who discuss these issues with people in the community will know, a lot of people are very anxious and concerned about the impact of technology on the work force and shorter working hours is one of the solutions which is frequently proffered. This is something which, if I may say so in political terms, the Government has running very strongly against it because in a quite sincere and anxious way people are looking for the solutions to unemployment induced by technology. That is, as I say, one of the solutions which is frequently popping up and the statement should have dealt with that argument. I do not know whether the argument that the ultimate consequence of reduced hours would be a greater sharing of jobs in the Australian community is right or wrong, but it is a matter which concerns people gravely and which should have been discussed by the Minister in what purports to be such an important statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the statement there is a lot of talk about the adverse economic effects of an across-the-board introduction of the 35-hour week. These are matters which, as I have tried to indicate, in my view require some degree of expert determination rather than off-the-cuff, kerbside opinions. Of course some of the important questions are also associated with the method of introduction in terms of our society's being a predominantly urban society. I take the view that a reduction in daily working hours from eight to seven is not necessarily beneficial to either the employer, perhaps for economic reasons, or to the employee in terms of social reasons. For example, many people in most large urban conglomerates in Australia have to spend an hour and a half getting to work. It seems to me that work organisation could be far better arranged in the context of reduced working hours than by just reducing the daily hours from eight to seven; for example, by the introduction of a nine-day fortnight.</PARA>

But I am unable to respond to her interjection because I think it falls very much in the realm of speculation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me reiterate one final important point: Insofar as the Opposition is concerned, we are not saying that there should be a blanket introduction of the 35-hour week immediately. What we are saying is consistent with the position adopted by the Australian Council of Trade Unions-that there should be continuing discussions about how shorter hours can be more profitably introduced for all concerned. We believe that the process of a shorter working week is irreversible; that it will take place; that it will provide some solution to some of the work force problems which we presently have in Australia and which the Government refuses to address its mind to; and that the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission is the appropriate body to deal with these claims because it does so on the basis of information before it rather than on the basis of, as I have said, kerbside opinions. The statement is deficient in that it fails to analyse in any way some of the wider issues which are concerning the community and causing a great deal of anxiety, particularly in relation to the implementation of technological change in Australia. The statement is highly deficient. It is strong on rhetoric and strong on arguments which it hopes will appeal to sections of the Australian community. Because of the operation of market forces in this country-an expression on which I think Senator Walters has some sort of copyright and does not like my using-and the operation of the industrial relations system as it has been established and applauded by this Government over many years there will, I think, be a gradual reduction of hours. The Opposition hopes that it will come about in a sensible way which is beneficial both to the employees in industry and to the industries themselves in terms of economic impact. That, of course, can be done only on the basis of informed discussion and inquiry. We commend that course to the Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to join in this discussion on the Government's statement made by Senator Chaney, the Minister for Social Security. Having listened to Senator Button for some time I see a real ray of hope. I believe that the approach that Senator Button has taken is basically responsible. It is certainly along those lines that the Government is projecting its views on industrial relations. Anyone knows that industrial relations are enormously important to this country. It is wholly appropriate that they should be approached and finally resolved through a proper legalistic institution such as the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. It must be said, though, that the industrial legal body must not be approached as a result of massive industrial action and disruption. That sort of thing tends to destroy the real view of people and tends to destroy the accent on the real element concerned. That real element, I believe, was revealed when Senator Button referred to the judgment of 1947 when the 40-hour week became law in this country. He remarked that in this judgment there was reference to the need for more leisure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the surface and, indeed, in fact, no one would dispute that leisure is a very important part of the lifestyle of all Australians. The point that the Government would take would be that the economy's capacity to provide circumstances in which leisure can be increased would be significant. In 1947, apparently, the time had come when that was so. We believe that at this moment that time, in the main, has not arrived. We believe that this country is, for a whole host of reasons, facing a reasonably exciting future. We should be developing a determination and enthusiasm to exploit the circumstances that confront us. There is only one way that the people of this country can fail to enjoy the benefits of those circumstances, and that is if we fail to recognise the economic reaction to certain proposed happenings. </PARA>
<PARA> The introduction of the 35-hour week has been discussed over a long period. I believe the discussion dates back to about 1963. I do not think any Australian would deny that before the 35-hour week can be responsibly introduced in any industry, and certainly not across-the-board, the results of it on the community's capacity to establish and enjoy leisure have to be analysed very closely. I believe that this is the real value of the statement that is before us today. One of the advantages of a democracy surely is that people can freely analyse the facts and influence the course of events. The course at this stage, I believe, must be closely related to events. This statement give a background to and knowledge of facts, a reaction to facts and the results of facts which must be analysed by all Australians responsibly and sensibly if they are to come to a conclusion of what way they are to turn at least in the next decade. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been clearly indicated that Australia's opportunities in the next decade and beyond and her performance to this point are matters that should be developing enthusiasm and not despair. Despair can only come if we take an unrealistic approach to the facts around us. All we ask is that the facts around us in this economy should be properly analysed and that the appropriate authorities, in this instance the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, should be allowed to develop a view of their own that is relative to the economic capacity of this country to provide the sorts of things that Australians, whether union members or not, require and desire. We have every opportunity of achieving those things. I honestly believe that there is only one way in which we will not achieve them and that is if we continue to develop a form of confrontation. If we continue to see a circumstance in Australia whereby negotiation is the result of industrial disruption which has, in the case that has been discussed in this chamber today, resulted in a company or a number of companies losing about $20m there will be a reaction of despair. We cannot afford for that sort of thing to happen. </PARA>
<PARA> The Conciliation and Arbitration Commission has an enormously important task to perform. Its industrial relations record is the envy of many countries. It is our duty to see that it performs its task relevant to the circumstances that surround it and is not impressed by pressures from one side or the other. My problem lies in the fact that some of its determinations and ratifications are due to a circumstance not of enthusiasm and determination but to a circumstance of despair. I believe we have to avoid that above all things. </PARA>
<PARA> In passing, I refer to Senator Button's comment which sometimes comes from certain areas of the community and of the political world, that Australia is in some significant poverty. He referred to the common figure, not classically identified, of some two million people being below the poverty line and so on. I want to make it clear that my experience and the experience of many Australians is that the tens of thousands of us, from the very young to the quite old, who travel to the four corners of the globe every year-many are on four weeks' leave or whatever-come back to this country convinced that Australia is certainly the best place in the world in which to live. I believe that we want to keep it that way. One of the significant ways we can do this is to maintain in our industrial relations, a sensible and constructive discussion before the appropriate bodies and to abide by their decisions. </PARA>
<PARA> Some comment has been made in this debate today on the fact that 36 per cent of the Australian work force is already working fewer than 40 hours a week. The assumption arising from that somewhat bland statement is, that therefore, 100 per cent of the work force could work less than 40 hours a week. I know from what Senator Button was saying that he does not believe that. He said quite distinctly that we are not talking about an across-the-board reduction to a 35-hour week. I was happy to hear him say that because it is an important basis in the discussion of the whole industrial relations situation. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us remember that a very significant part of that 36 per cent of the work force is working outside the controls, as it were, of the Federal Government. Some of those workers would come under the State awards. Indeed, in my State of New South Wales, the working week of power industry workers, and the working week of workers in other industries, has been reduced to 37 1/2 hours and then to 35 hours. The degree of productivity and the cost of power to the community are disastrous. We cannot afford to allow this situation to continue. This is the very sort of thing that, in the longer term, will increase the inflation rate which presently is running down and is one of the best in the Western world. Unemployment will be increased and productivity reduced. Of immense importance, it is the sort of thing that will destroy our competitiveness as a nation in the international scene. </PARA>
<PARA> Australia has one hope of real survival as a great and affluent community and that lies in its capacity to develop on the international scene. By the very nature of our production, techniques and skill and our geographical remoteness, we are dependent on our capacity to achieve, maintain and develop markets overseas. If our industrial circumstance is such that we tend to increase the cost of the labour unit and diminish our productivity per unit, which has to happen if we increase the labour unit cost in this case by either 15 or 21 per cent, our international competitiveness becomes a very great problem and the affluence of every Australian is in jeopardy. I believe that we must be aware of these perils and adjust our negotiations in the industrial relations field with a real reference to the capacity of this economy to afford the lifestyle and leisure which we ultimately aim to achieve. We know that at this time we have between 5 per cent and 6 per cent of the work force unemployed. Fortunately, the inflation rate has been reduced from 15 per cent or 16 per cent to 9 per cent plus. We are on the right economic track in terms of the Western developed world. We are one of the most successful countries in that area. We want to make sure that we keep it that way. Of all the things that the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission has said, I believe I need quote only one point which it made in the national wage case decision of 9 January this year. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Costs to the economy rising from stoppages and bans threaten not only improvements in real wages and conditions but even the maintenance of existing standards. This is not a moral judgment but a matter of hard economic reality.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe that those words are unquestionably true. If, indeed, they become the real and effective basis of negotiation between employers and employees through the process of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, we are not only on the right track but also we will remain on the right track. </PARA>
<PARA> I want to refer in some further detail to the fact that the Government is not opposed to a 35-hour week concept per se for ever and in all circumstances. We are immensely concerned to see that this great community does not dive into an economic circumstance which would ensure loss of productivity and increasing unemployment. We do not want to see ourselves dive into that circumstance by too rapidly or irresponsibly entering into a 35-hour week arrangement regardless of all those basic things that need to be considered. I hope and believe that the trade union movement will concur with this. Let us move into a discussion for a final evaluation of how we go, when and to what extent, through mutual consideration of those economic terms referable to the capacity of the economy to provide the sort of lifestyle that I am sure all of us want and, in some real measure, already have established. </PARA>

The Government is concerned about that and I think that all genuine Australians would be concerned about that. The parties should talk to each other in the appropriate field and arrive at a sensible and responsible attitude. That is how things should be.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If productivity increases only to the extent that costs increase it leaves one in the same position, so we have to examine these circumstances very carefully. Of course productivity is important. That brings me to a further matter to which Senator Button referred and which is equally important, that is, the advent of technology and the effect of these sorts of constant escalations in the wage system, the labour unit cost system, on technology. The effect is to bring technology into our community, into our industry and commerce, at a much greater rate than we are capable of absorbing it. We have to examine the consequences of that with very great care.</PARA></TALK.START>

It is a valuable statement only if Australians examine the real consequences across-the-board of the advent of a 35-hour working week, whether it be today or in 10 or 15 years. It is not a question of being opposed to the concept of a 35-hour working week; it is a question of relating the capacity of this economy on both the management and labour sides, to be able to absorb a 35-hour working week.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the views which have been expounded by my leader, Senator Button. We can see by looking at the statement of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) that it is a sort of cross-fertilisation of industrial myths and economic faults. Senator Scott commented that Australians with an entitlement to four weeks leave could go overseas for a holiday and make comparisons with their homeland on their return. That is reasonable enough, but what he overlooked is that every time there is a substantial gain within the trade union movement it is regarded as an economic minus. Actually Senator Scott, in one of his utterances, referred to the tourist industry. When the trade union movement agitated for and gained long service leave provisions for workers it was actually regarded as a plus for that industry. If that theory is extended to apply to the granting of a shorter working week we will find that people will certainly be more active in their social life and will spend more, which of course would result in increased returns in the retail trade and the tourist industry. I make that point because the central theme of the argument of the Government seems to be that every gain within the trade union movement will diametrically affect the overall wellbeing of the economy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If I may further illustrate my argument, anybody who read a recent issue of Newsweek would be aware of the dilemma of the motor vehicle industry in the European Economic Community in the face of competition from the Japanese. We have been told many times that if we were to emulate the policies of the EEC economically and, more so, if our trade unions were to adopt the responsible attitude of the EEC all would be well. I do not question the right of Japan to compete with the EEC and Australia. The point I am making is that whenever there is a gain for the workers the trade unions are said to be wrong and that is the end of it, but trade union demands are only a minor component of the overall economic picture. We all go to the trade fairs and get the trade journals, so we would know that some State workers got a 40-hour working week in 1947 whereas those who worked under Federal awards still had a 40-hour week in 1948. That was the position over 30 years ago and we would all know about the various labour saving devices and the better tools that are used. How can government blandly say after 30 years that industry cannot afford it?</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button referred to the comments of the Minister on the first page of his statement in respect of 36 per cent of the work force already being on a 35-hour working week. Let us put that to one side for the moment and subtract the residue of the work force. I do not know who prepared the statement for the Minister but he should realise that a dramatic change to the standard working week would not be a major factor. As an example, I refer to the situation in the retail trade. Recently I was talking to an official of the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association. I understand that in New South Wales 50 per cent of that union's members are part time workers. Most of them put in 20 or 30 hours a week between Thursday night shopping and lunch time on a Saturday. That slab of the work force is not caught up in this issue. Senator Scott represents the National Country Party. It is very significant that the pastoral industry achieved a comparable working week with the rest of the work force less than 3 1/2 years ago. As Senator Button has said, there will be fragile areas in which the unions probably will not fight very hard in relation to the gaining of a 35-hour working week. I emphasise again, and it cannot be stressed too often, that for the part time worker in industry a 35-hour or 40-hour working week is not a major factor. </PARA>
<PARA> If I may return to the 36 per cent of the work force who are already on a 35-hour working week or thereabouts, the plain fact of the matter is that in the power industry persons classified as turbine attendants, auxiliary plant operators and so on are able, with technological change, to be responsible for a greater number of job operations, so the numbers in the work force have been diminished. To take my point further, the computerisation of the New South Wales railways signals system and other changes will, according to the responsible union, mean that within the next seven years the number of members will be compressed from about 20,000 to 13,000. It is not on to say to people who perform manual work that the time is not opportune for these changes. In terms of the advances made through technological change, would anybody deny what the introduction of the forklift has meant to industry? As a result, fewer manual operatives are required, whether the forklift is used on the waterfront or in the wool stores. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to another aspect of this matter. Some years ago a dispute occurred in Newcastle between the Federated Ironworkers Association and the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen's Association about the introduction of a string crane, the operator of which is not immobilised in a cabin high above the job but works from the floor. The person performing that work is used by his boss on other duties when he is not needed to operate that crane. I have my own views as to how a person in that working situation has been abused by employers. I am giving honourable senators examples of the numerous changes that have occurred in the last 30 years. </PARA>
<PARA> Speaking in the context of what has happened in Sydney, I call to the minds of honourable senators the emergence of the one man bus concept in metropolitan transport systems. Would anybody deny the change to that system? Would anybody deny a reduction in working hours to people who must negotiate the hazardous traffic problems that are to be found in our massive metropolitan capital cities? When we are not here many of us probably drive, in Sydney or in Melbourne, to work in the morning and home in the afternoon. The people driving these buses on a shift of 7 hours 20 minutes or 8 hours are under pressure all the time. When I first entered this Senate, I pointed out that, if we were not careful, an insidious atmosphere could be created here. I appreciate that Senator Scott, for example, did his share of physical work on his own property and gained a great deal of satisfaction from it. But we are inclined when we are elected to this Parliament to get a little high and mighty, with our well padded buttocks on the soft seats, and to talk about 'them' and 'us'. I mean that remark to be taken seriously. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard reference today to the problem that a shorter working week will create for the boss. But do we ever wonder about the other areas affected? People like Senator McIntosh know the industries in the various States. Let us forget about the major technical changes for the moment and consider the people about whom I am worried. Let us take the case of the woman who is a semi-skilled operator of a small guillotine and who is responsible for cutting up magazines to certain sizes, and so on. She would be a member of a printing union. The boss may say: 'Next week we have a contract to do Penthouse', or some magazine like that. I mention that I have no ulterior motive in taking that as an example. I know of specific cases in which that is what contracts provide. The boss has indicated that he wants to undercut a competitor and he wants the women to work a little bit faster. Many of the women concerned would be in the age group from 35 years to 45 years. Obviously the operation in performing that work involves stepping down, picking up material all the time and so on which requires a lot of extra effort each day. </PARA>
<PARA> What happens in such a situation? This matter was thrashed out when we were considering in an Estimates committee the appropriations for the Department of Health. The fact is that women are employed for some 8 or 9 months in such a job and, when that job cuts out, they will go back to the Printing and Kindred Industries Union to seek another job. The stage is reached with some of those employers that they might as well be picking cattle out of different pens. If they see that a woman has prominent varicose veins, they do not think that she will last the distance. These are matters that we must face up to. The rank and file members of the trade unions see it this way. A member will say: 'I am always going to be in this industry. I think that I am entitled at least to a little bit more leisure'. That is the atmosphere today, and we must face up to it. I repeat that the unions that have achieved shorter working hours already have members who work in heat and dust and under oppressive conditions. </PARA>
<PARA> Some honourable senators may say to me that industry perhaps in many ways is more safety conscious now than it was 20 years ago. If we go into an engineering establishment we may see someone, using a press, who is wearing mufflers to protect him from deafness caused by that industrial occupation. We think that that is a good thing. On the other hand, in his work he is experiencing a sort of cloistered existence. The more one can reduce the period that people spend in such an area in the course of an 8-hour day, the more can be laid at rest suggestions that employers are unscrupulous in what they require of employees. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn my attention to the rubber industry. Let it not be forgotten that the trade unions have never adopted a Luddite attitude in any respect in regard to the cases that I am mentioning. My colleague from South Australia, Senator Elstob, will tell honourable senators that Charlie Fitzgibbon, the National Secretary of the Waterside Workers Federation, had many package deals to ensure the quick turnaround of ships in some of the small ports. It is true that the agreement that was reached on the redundancy of certain waterside worker members was reasonable. The settlement of that matter in one financial year meant that the size of the work force was reduced and the operations became cheaper. That sort of thing is happening in so many areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me follow that line of thought a little further. We talk about our climate and, of course, in many ways it is a nice climate. But again I remind honourable senators of what I said about our talking about these matters as we sit here on our plush red seats. We know that, when one toils in the heat and sun, various industrial hazards are present and one is vulnerable if something goes wrong. The change that is being sought in hours of work after nearly 30 years of waiting is irresistible. If we look at discussions about apprentices and work in occupations where manual effort is involved, the whole idea promoted by the media is that ones son or daughter has to get into a nice air conditioned office. This is very laudable, but I have wondered about this view at times. I am sure that Senator McIntosh will agree with me that there are people who can get nice ice-cold water in their office; they certainly would not have to lose half a day to get it. Yet one can go to industrial establishments on construction sites where for the first month workers battle to get adequate toilet facilities, cold water and other such amenities. Sometimes a stoppage will occur for a few days because of this lack. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me now move away from that area of consideration. A dialogue occurred involving Senator Gietzelt, Senator Scott and Senator Chipp about the intention of the Government to get some sort of a deal. I invite honourable senators to read the submission by John Halfpenny, whose political views do not always coincide with mine, to the tribunal in Victoria inquiring into the media. In that submission, he spoke about the way in which the Press sensationalises disputes. Have honourable senators ever thought that, although a dispute makes the headlines when a stoppage occurs, on other days when the union organiser goes out to a job and achieves a settlement which is not news because it is not exciting. That is happening all the time. It is important that we should remember that that happens because the impression is being created that the unions are asking for more and getting what they want while the employer is being browbeaten. </PARA>
<PARA> As my next example, I refer to the tyre industry. Several years ago, the Dunlop organisation decided that its plant in Sydney should be dismantled as it would be far better and more economic to restructure the Sydney operations in Victoria where Dunlop's main operations were. I do not question that tyre manufacturers in Australia were experiencing extreme competition from South East Asia and Latin America. The unions involved agreed that the Sydney plant should be dismantled. There was no opposition from the various unions. Severance pay was paid to some of the workers. When we talk about severance pay, let us not forget that in some cases this would be the equivalent of about 3 months' wages-and that money soon goes. I had an intimate discussion on this matter with the present Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, Mr Ian Macphee, as he was then the Minister responsible for this area. The fact is that, at the end of that year, that rubber tyre manufacturer was in a better position as a result of going to Victoria and consolidating its activities there. That consolidation was achieved with the assistance of the gesture by the unions involved. Surely that organisation now can meet whatever is the impact of a shorter working week. </PARA>
<PARA> Another important point arises. We have often heard it said here-it is a constant bleat-that workers in Asian countries which are our competitors are underpaid. Whether we like it or not, that was the attitude that I and others had about Japan. Frankly, reasonable amenities are provided for their workers by Japanese manufacturers. Their attitude is different from ours. Some of these manufacturers believe that the employer should provide holiday camps for his workers while in Australia we prefer an adequate holiday loading to enable people to do their own thing. A campaign is being mounted claiming that Australia is headed for economic ruin. Whether an industry is buoyant or in difficulties, the picture that I am trying to paint is the need for an equality of sacrifice by all parties. Let me illustrate what I mean. My authority for my statement is the former President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Mr Bob Hawke, who is now the member for Wills in the other place. </PARA>
<PARA> I have said in this chamber on many occasions that, irrespective of whether an employee receives wage adjustments quarterly or half-yearly, a vital component in wage stability and employee satisfaction is the sudden and massive fluctuations in our rag bag national health system. Workers in Europe are provided with a far better health system than ours. It is true that it is paid for in some way by taxation. The introduction of a comparable scheme in Australia in the form of a levy on one's taxable income, similar to the concept of the Medibank levy, would mean that a process worker would not pay as much as a production manager. But such a system does not apply here with the result that the worker on low wages finds that he is slugged every couple of quarters for an adjustment in contributions to the Hospitals Contribution Fund, the Medical Benefits Fund or Medibank Private. The Government felt that in this matter it would be able to bargain one factor against another. In 1976, according to the then ACTU President, the trade union movement put that concept to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser). </PARA>
<PARA> I know the Government is in a bind. These wealthy private health funds are like an albatross around its neck. They want something and they drive the Government into the ground in order to get it. I have strong views on this matter. My colleague Senator Douglas McClelland and I-with one or two others-remember the big brawl when the Nimmo report was announced. That report on national health, to put it bluntly-I believed in the national Medibank scheme-could have taken the sting away if it had been introduced. I remember talking to the then Leader of the Government in the Senate, Sir Kenneth Anderson. I asked him why he did not grasp the nettle. He said: 'We have to stay this one out. It would cause too much of an upheaval'. It would have caused an upheaval with the private health funds. But there are ways of bargaining. An arbitration judge named Gallagher was appointed to the Coal Industry Tribunal. This was at a time when the miners' union award was before court. The miners had a choice between a substantial wage increase or better long-service leave. Their log of claims involved a sizable wage increase. Justice Gallagher decided that rather than grant union members the full financial impact he would award them considerably better long-service leave conditions. Naturally everybody did not take the long-service leave at the one time. It was probably spread over a 10-year span. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the 35-hour week, some unions will get it fairly soon while others, for various reasons, will not get it. It is an academic question for members of the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association, probably the theatrical employees organisation and unions like that with a high number of part-time employees. Many honourable senators have asked: 'What of the cost factor?' I return to the idea of plucking out figures and what it means. I had not been a member of the Senate for long when there was the disastrous Mt Isa mines dispute. I say 'disastrous' because the situation was that the lead bonus varied with the world price of copper. When the bonus reached a certain stage there was a ceiling. Of course it was expected that the world price of copper would go up. I know that at the time the Australian Workers Union had internal problems and that did not help. There was a devil's brew. </PARA>
<PARA> I remember Senator Branson. Day after day he got up and said: 'This strike is costing Australia $1m a day'. Six months after the dispute was settled an honourable senator from this side of the chamber rose to ask a question. Of course the price of copper was booming. It was a question on notice and the Government waited another six months. We did not have anyone with the tenacity of Senator McLaren to come back and back so that we would get an answer quickly. However, we did get an answer. We discovered that the mining companies in Mt Isa-the new honourable senator from Queensland will agree with me-did not go into liquidation. They became bigger and better and stronger. The purpose of that picture is to tell honourable senators that this report is a mish mash of half truths and economic nonsense. I will be quite frank about the matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I sympathise with the Government in relation to where it gets its economic know-how because we had the same problem when we were in government. A lot of economists would tell us what to do. One fellow, Professor Brian Brogan, had all the answers. I assure honourable senators that the trade unions did not believe him but some other people did, unfortunately. He went to New Guinea. I think the people there were much more aware of him than we were because they hoisted him out of New Guinea. The last I read about him, it was reported that he was writing another paper on tariffs. I suggest to the Government that it should send some of those economists to on-the-job meetings. If they worked on the workshop floor they would soon be told about some of their absurd economic theories. </PARA>
<PARA> In some ways I am pleased that the Government has given us a chance to get our teeth into the matter. I have had over 30 years' experience and nobody can tell me that massive technological changes can be resisted in our work pattern. I suppose it may be argued that some industries will lose. Let me turn to the statement that the unions win everything. I am looking for an honourable senator from Victoria to run-off on this point. There have been several disputes involving reinstatement and the Food Preservers Union of Australia. The union has not won all the disputes. Some of the disputes have got to a very delicate position, whether or not they are winnable. I will not name the newspaper in which I read of this. The point I am making is that somebody said that the unions are like a panzer division-they win all the disputes. I suppose I would insult the Air Pilots Guild if I said that all its members were dedicated to the Australian Labor Party and the ACTU. These people are middle-class militants. These are the people with whom we are dealing. Honourable senators can tell members of the storemen and packers organisation to be patient, but I wonder how they would get on telling that to the highly paid pilots who live on the North Shore, in the electorate of Bradfield and those areas. They do not return socialists to this Parliament. </PARA>

As a matter of fact the aspect of bad management came out a long while later. Whether it was the dockyards in Newcastle or Whyalla, management was pretty slow in endeavouring to retool. It is of no use blaming this matter on the work force. The fact of the matter is that the unions have to have a share in this. I repeat that honourable senators will not stop this tide. I offer this consolation to Senator Scott: The pastoral industry did not bear the full brunt of the 40-hour week and it probably will not on this occasion. I leave those thoughts of, I hope, wisdom with the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am looking forward to participating in this debate because it has been a very interesting one and classically throws up the philosophical difference in approach of the major political parties in this country. In this Senate I have not heard a debate for so long in which the lines are drawn so far apart, in which the remarks of speakers on the Government side of the chamber are 180 degrees in the opposite direction to those of speakers on this side of the chamber. I suppose the situation provides a classic definition of the Australian Democrats. I hope I can put that view in my speech. We would fall in the middle of both approaches which were put here today. I hope I do no injustice to colleagues on either side of the chamber, but it seems to me that Labor Party senators on this side of the chamber are saying: 'We will immediately support the trade union movement for 40 hours pay for 35 hours work'. I hope that I do not overstate the view but that seems to be the position. On the other hand, Liberal Party and National Country Party senators are saying: 'We will not budge one inch from 40 hours pay for 40 hours work'. I hope that I do not overstate their position. Senator Scott was gracious enough to say that a change in working hours must come, but he did not go on to say when or what sort of machinery would be adopted to bring in shorter working hours. I will say more about that later. I think the basis of all this is the iniquitious system.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3V4">Senator CHIPP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator should save his interjection because I will have harsher things to say in a moment or two about the Labor Party. The method of funding political parties brings about this kind of stance and confrontation that we have in this Parliament. Is there any Labor Party senator here who feels totally free to attack some of the more extreme militant trade unions for their outrageous demands? I do not think so and I do not necessarily blame Labor Party senators because most of the funding of the Labor Party comes from trade unions. We know that it is very difficult for the Labor Party-God knows the Democrats can sympathise with it, we being short of funds-to turn around and abuse publicly or take the side against a trade union that is contributing funds for its political survival. It is human nature. I am not being critical; I am stating a fact. Here we have Government senators whose funds, which I estimate to be approximately $3m a year, come secretly, covertly from big business and private enterprise. What view could they support other than one that would maximise the profits of big business and private enterprise?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whilst I think the Labor Party in this debate is properly representing the views of most trade unionists, I wonder-this is rather ironic-whether the Liberal and National Country parties are properly representing the views of business. I have not yet spoken to a responsible business person-a leader in business-who does not say straight out that a 35-hour working week is absolutely inevitable and the more quickly and easily we get to it, the better. I wish this Government would wake up to itself and start meaningful negotiations so that we can move into that situation without disputation. I just wonder about the extent to which officers of Andrew Peacock's Department will go. My unbounded admiration for Andrew Peacock is no secret, but my appreciation of the department which he administers is also no secret. I believe it to be one of the most inefficient and uninformed of the whole 26 government departments. To that extent, I sympathise with Andrew Peacock. As an aside, I just hope that the advice that the Department has given my friend about taking on the Builders Labourers Federation is sound. I wish him luck, but I think it has dug a king-sized hole for him. </PARA>
<PARA> Having said that, I wish to register the astonishment, the incredulity, of the Australian Democrats that in a statement of 19 pages read to this chamber by the Minister for Social Security (Sentor Chaney)-a very important statement on the subject of a 35-hour working week or shorter working hours-the words 'automation' or 'microprocessing' do not appear once. Yet we are talking about something that will affect every human being in Australia within 10 years. Automation and microprocessing will devastate the work market. They will be catastrophic for the number of jobs offering to young people in this country. I am not stating some newly discovered fact. I would have thought that today every economic lecture delivered and every textbook produced was obsessed with the one big question the human race has to face in the next decade: How will we overcome this phenomenon and still have some form of equilibrium in our society?</PARA>
<PARA> Need I remind the Senate again that, among others, Lord Hershfield was in Australia last year specifically to study the effects of automation on the work force in Australia. Lord Hershfield is not a raving, rampant radical. I apologise for the alliteration, Mr Deputy President. In fact, he has been granted a life peerage by Mrs Thatcher for his outstanding work on automation and in particular its effects on the work force. About Australia he said that if within the next 10 years we persist with the present way of life in our industrial and social relations, namely, a 40-hour working week, penalty rates, the sacred cow of the eight-hour working day, casual work and those sort of things, by 1990 all the goods and services being produced today will be produced by 10 per cent of the work force. He is not a raving radical. He is a very conservative gentleman-a scientist, a person who has devoted his life to the effects of automation on the work force. What the hell does that statement mean if it does not mean that in nine years from now, 90 per cent of jobs existing in Australia on this day in March 1981 simply will not be there on 26 March 1990? They will have gone. </PARA>
<PARA> Clearly, Lord Hershfield saw that the existence of microprocesses will create other jobs, but not to the extent of the 90 per cent lost. His estimate is that by 1990 if the situation has not changed, if we preserve the status quo, we will have 40 per cent unemployment in Australia. In that situation-with six out of 10 people being haves and four out of 10 people being have-nots-we could not have stability. That is how serious this problem is. Yet there is not one word of it in this 19-page statement. Is it because Mr Peacock does not know that it exists? Did he have nothing to do with the writing of this statement? Did the Government drag up some moron from a back corner of his Department and tell him to put together 19 pages of words which do a little union bashing and which could be presented in Parliament? Is that how it happened? Does anybody who has read this statement really believe that it is a scientific, well considered and balanced document? Whoever is the author of this statement-I think Senator Mulvihill is as puzzled as I am as to where the authorship lies-ought to be ashamed of himelf. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of automation, let me just say that obviously there must be some band-aid approaches in the short term. I am persuaded that no longer can Australia have the luxury of making it compulsory for people to wait until they are 65 years of age before they can get a pension. I am absolutely persuaded that we ought to reduce to 60 years, as quickly as possible, the age at which a person may voluntarily retire and receive a pension. It should not be compulsory. I am not suggesting for one moment that we tell everybody who is 60 years of age: 'Now that you are 60 you will have to retire and get a pension'. The figures that we have obtained indicate that that proposition would not cost Consolidated Revenue a penny. The extra pensions that would need to be paid would be more than compensated for by the amount we would save in dole payments and the extra taxation we would receive. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to refer to something quite extraordinary. I do not do this to try to score a point against members of the Liberal Party; I just put it on the record to encourage them to think about what unemployment is costing Australia each year. An article in the Australian Economic Review shows the actual and full Budget positions in the third quarter of 1980-81. The actual Budget outcome is a deficit of roughly $1,500m. That is the actual deficit. But if there were full employment there would be a surplus of $5,800m. Clearly, unemployment is costing Australia $7,434m a year-this year. The cost of unemployment to the nation is $7 billion. Some band-aid measures should be introduced immediately. Every unemployed person is costing Consolidated Revenue dearly. We have to look at other matters. </PARA>
<PARA> We must try to persuade trade unions to look at their sacred cows. I believe that sensible members of the parliamentary Labor Party have a duty to say to their branches of the trade union movement: 'Okay, we have fought for an 8-hour working day, penal clauses and casual rates, but are these things not things that we could trade off, so doing better for ourselves in the area of shorter working hours or whatever?'</PARA>
<PARA> I know of the historical reasons for the battle for the eight-hour working day. It was a savage battle and was won totally on humaritarian grounds and for humanitarian reasons. But that was years ago. It is no longer-or it need not be-the sacred cow that it was. The whole thrust of my speech is to suggest to the Senate that this is a vexed problem. Everything that Labor senators are saying contains a great deal of sense. Similarly, what people like Senator Scott are saying contains a great deal of sense. The answer must lie somewhere in the middle. I have done a lot of work on this matter and have discussed it with many people. I will give honourable senators an example. There are several companies in Australia which are well known to me and whose executives are well and favourably known to me. They have enjoyed a magnificent relationship with their work force. They have, in fact, introduced four-day working weeks, which means working 9 1/3 hours a day. For their workers every weekend is a long weekend. The firms pay 40 hours pay for four days work at 9 1/3 hours a day. Someone better than I am at arithmetic can work that out. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you. Every weekend is a long weekend for those workers. What has happened in those organisations has been quite dramatic, and they are sizable organisations. Production has increased because of the four-day working week. On the fifth day other workers clean out the factories and repair the machines. Time is saved on starting and stopping and absenteeism has disappeared. If a worker wants to go to the dentist, he does not take a sickie; he goes on the Friday. The morale on the shop floor has improved markedly. These organisations have palpable evidence that productivity and profits have increased and that absenteeism and sinking morale have diminished.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To my knowledge the three schemes that I know about operate no more. Why? Because the trade unions stepped in and said: 'You should not do this. You are working more than 8 hours a day. You have offended the sacred cow of the 8-hour day'. I say to members of the Labor Party that this acts against ordinary human beings. Of course, the trade unions concerned-I know members of the Labor Party are at a great disadvantage because I know they hold in contempt the politics of people such as John Halfpenny and Laurie Carmichael as much as I do-have decimated and destroyed those arrangements whereby everybody was happy. The boss and the worker were happy, more affluent and better off. Those arrangements have been destroyed by a militant trade union for reasons I could not begin to canvass. Some people in this place would put the view that those trade unionists want to destroy the whole society. Other people here would say that they are dedicated trade unionists who genuinely believe that it is the thin end of the wedge to give away an 8-hour day. I do not know the reason. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Baume has odd tastes in many things. For Senator Walters' benefit I will repeat what the Australian Economic Review estimates as the cost of unemployment. It estimates that at the moment the actual Budget outcome will be a deficit of $1,500m. If we had full employment it would be a surplus of $5,800m. If there were some arrangement between employers and employees the Government could well come in. If employment is to be increased by the introduction of a shorter working week, which it must be, we would reduce that deficit of $1,500m. The cost to the Australian taxpayer of unemployment in this country is now $7 billion. The Democrats believe we ought to be moving towards the introduction of a shorter working week but we believe we should be moving gradually and in a spirit of consultation. I have a great affection for Senator Scott and the gentle and generous way he puts arguments. He was prompted by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) when I interjected: Why does the Government not have consultation with the trade union movement? At Senator Chaney's instigation, Senator Scott quoted the paragraph appearing at the end of page 16 of the statement, which reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We are inviting the ACTU to sit down and talk--</PARA>
<PARA>That sounds good up to that point, but it goes on to state-</PARA>
<PARA>and we will explain in detail the reasons for our opposition to reduced working hours, higher wage demands and the economic consequences of such actions. </PARA>
<PARA>With great respect to Senator Scott, that is not consultation. That is like a teacher saying to a child: 'Come in here and we will talk. I will tell you why you have been a naughty child, how you can be a better child and how you have to behave in this way in the future'. That is certainly not consultation. Proper consultation is sadly lacking in any government initiatives. The Democrats say that the only possible solution to this problem, which is by far the biggest problem facing Australia today, is consultation and negotiation. I have wondered why the unions have gone for a 35-hour week. Why not go for 37 1/2 hours? Why not go for something less? I believe they have gone for 35 hours-in other words they have gone for a big grab-because--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3V4">Senator CHIPP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Five hours out of 40 hours is a big grab. I think the honourable senator has to be honest and admit that. The trade unions know of everything that has happened in the past. There has been a war. There has been suffering and disputation. I believe the rationale of the trade union-Labor Party mind is: 'Let us go for a big one now because there is going to be a war. The forces of reaction will build a brick wall against us. We will have to suffer by industrial disputation. Therefore, let us do that exercise only once and let us go for something big'. If, however, the Government were less stubborn and showed some inclination to consult and discuss, I believe a responsible trade unionist could be persuaded to push for his claim on a policy of gradualism. In fact, the trade unionists with whom I have spoken have accepted that idea in a flash.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I noticed on page 6 of the Minister's statement a remark with which I agree. The bottom of page 6 reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Their decision--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the decision of the employers-</PARA>
<PARA>on whether to invest in new machinery and equipment, or in new building and construction works, or to expand employment and in-plant training schemes for workers becomes far more difficult if they cannot make reasonable estimates of the degree to which such machinery, plant and work force will be idle because of industrial disruption in their own or independent industries. </PARA>
<PARA>I agree with that. But does any industrialist or businessman in Australia today not believe that the trade union movement, backed by the Labor Party, is not fair dinkum about a shorter working week? I would have thought that that has been spelt out with crystal clarity for so long. Does the Government really believe that if it puts people such as Senator Walters in the Senate to give a hard-line speech and say that it will not budge under any circumstances it will make the trade union leaders flinch in terror, cower and back away from their bid for a 35-hour week? Does the Government really believe that? Does Mr Fraser really believe that by, wielding a big stick and by his threat of massive unemployment caused by automation he will force the trade unions to back off? I should think that that is naive thinking, but here it is. I agree with the Minister, employers want to know what is happening so that they can plan ahead. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not know whether the leaders of industry who are good enough to invite me to their luncheons now to discuss these things say different things to the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and to Andrew Peacock from what they say to me. But they say to me: 'For God's sake, let us get some solution to this demand for 35 hours so that we can restore some sort of equilibrium to the economy'. They know that there will be blood on the floor, nationwide, if the Government continues to be intractable. For that reason, I believe that this debate today is an important one and I am appalled that the word 'automation' does not find its way into the Minister's speech at all. I wondered at the gall of the person who wrote this speech. Is this a way to start a public relations exercise on behalf of the Government to woo responsible trade unions? I will be interested to see what Senator Harradine, as a champion of the moderate trade unionists, says about the paragraph at the top of page 9. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> If the unions think they have a justifiable claim, they should cease this harmful action and submit their claims to arbitration. They have not done so. They are resisting arbitration. </PARA>
<PARA>Here is the classic of all classics, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> That is not an attitude usually taken by groups who believe they have justifiable claims. </PARA>
<PARA>Is there any person on the Government side who can hold his or her head up and say: 'We will stand beside that statement'. I will refresh honourable senators minds as to the continuation of the debate which we had here last night on the Commonwealth Employees (Redeployment and Retirement) Act and the Government's action on Determination 503. The Public Service trade unions are objecting to certain aspects of this Act. The Prime Minister, in his own words, said: 'Go to the umpire. Go to arbitration'. They did and they got a decision, Determination No. 503. What happened? The Government now is changing the rules after the umpire has made his decision, and yet here another Minister in another area of industrial relations says: 'Go to the umpire'. In such a sensitive issue with the whole nation divided on whether there should be a shorter working week, we have statements like that. I am sure the author of this paper, whether it was Andrew Peacock, a member of his staff, or a member of his Department would not have had the gall to put that sentence in had he or she known the acrimony and the bad feeling which was engendered by the Government's reaction to Determination No. 503. </PARA>

On the question of productivity, Senator Gietzelt and Senator McIntosh interjected on Senator Scott who is always generous in acknowledging interjections and asked him: 'What about productivity? Is the work force not entitled to share increases in productivity?' I did not disagree with the honest answer which Senator Scott gave. I do not think he disagreed with Senator McIntosh or with Senator Gietzelt. But this statement at the top of page 8 confounds me. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government intervened in this hearing . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is the hearing with Altona-</PARA>
<PARA>and strongly argued against the settlement. It continues to oppose the productivity bargaining concept in its application to reduce working hours. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like explained to me what the Government really means by that. I cannot believe that the Government says: 'Okay, if, by the results of technology or by improved working techniques or by workers working harder or more efficiently, or whatever, we have a massive rise in productivity, the work force should not have at least an equal share in that increased productivity'. To take a literal meaning of that sentence, that is what it means to me. If the Government means that it is not amused by the kind of rubbish which some trade unions have been able to introduce into work practices, and if the Government means that it rejects those practices, I would be with the Government but it has not spelt that out. I shall quote an article by Michael Gordon entitled 'The end of one man, one switch', which was published in the Age this morning. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA> A tradesman has to flick the switch on a machine before an operator will use it. A pencil must be put into place by a fitter before another operator will use monitoring equipment. Bolts on another machine must be unscrewed by a fitter on penalty rates before an operator will clean the machine. </PARA>
<PARA>They are monstrous additions to cost which I do not support. I ask the question: Have the unions been able, by weak-gutted management, to introduce those sorts of irritations into work practices, unknown to or with the acquiescence of management, and then as part of the deal for shorter working hours say: 'Give us shorter working hours or something else and we will remove those work practices'?</PARA>

I do not know the answer but what I do know is that that statement, standing naked and unadorned, that the Government continues to oppose the productivity bargaining concept in its application to reduce working hours confounds my imagination. I cannot understand it because to me it flies in the face of everything which is basic in industrial relations and, in fact, in equity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr Acting Deputy President, the Australian Democrats believe that the only kind of solution that can exist is by consultation among the three parties. To illustrate my point I will use 38 hours because it is an easy figure. I am not saying that 38 hours should be our goal in the immediate future. But if there could be an arrangement between the trade unions and the employers by which a government could say to a representative of the trade unions 'What about working 38 hours and we will give you 39 hours pay. That is a good deal because you will work two hours less and will be paid for one hour in which you do not work. It is a good deal' a trade union leader would probably say: 'Yes, that is a good deal, but my take home pay is one hour less a week, and I cannot wear that'. The Government could well then say: 'We can compensate for that by making the reduced absolute money in your pay packet buy more by reducing sales taxes or by reducing income taxes, or whatever'. In that circumstance the worker will work two hours less a week and is in approxi- mately the same financial position. I think an arrangement like that could be well received. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3V4">Senator CHIPP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Please. The employer would say: 'Just a minute; the worker is doing all right out of this deal. He is working two hours less and getting the same purchasing power. What about me? I have to pay him for one hour a week for which he does not work'. Again the Government could say: 'We could abolish Division 7 taxes, we could reduce double tax on dividends and we could reduce the neat rate of company tax. Therefore, you as an employer can be compensated to a large extent'. It would seem to me that that is a good proposition. We have calculated some rough figures on this. It is terribly difficult to come up with accurate figures, but we have found that Consolidated Revenue, under such an arrangement, would be about the same, that a reduction of two hours in the working week would be brought about, that profitability and productivity would be about the same, if not higher, and that opportunities for hundreds of thousands of new jobs would be created. I have oversimplified the scheme clearly because I did not answer Senator McIntosh's interjection about indexation, but that is the kind of formula the Democrats believe ought to be on the table around which unions, employers and government should be thrashing out this massive problem of future unemployment caused by automation with bona fides, with compassion, with honesty and with some genuine desire to solve something that I believe could well be catastrophic.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What is the alternative? The alternative is what we have seen here today-a view put by this side of the chamber and the trade union movement and an entirely opposite view put forward by the Liberal Party and the business world. There will be confrontation and there will be disputation. Who will suffer? The answer is: Everybody. To me that is the only other alternative. That is why we are pleading with both sides of the argument to come to the negotiating table and to realise that in confrontation there are only losers and no winners. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I agreed with one thing in Senator Chipp's speech; that is, he said he had great affection for Senator Scott and for the gentle way in which he put his argument. It is a pity that Senator Chipp does not emulate his friend. Senator Chipp seemed to be rather bright, in that he debated an honourable senator's speech in this place before it had been made. It is the first time that I have heard an honourable senator pick up and debate a point from the speech of an honourable senator who is following him in the debate. He assured the Senate that I would take a hard line in this debate. He must have tremendous insight! But it is a long time since he was on the Liberal back bench industrial relations committee and perhaps he is a little out of touch. Employers have not come to us and said: 'The sooner the 35-hour week is introduced the better'. As I said, I think Senator Chipp may be a bit out of touch. We are debating a ministerial statement made by the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney). It follows the latest move by Mr Justice Williams to grant a 35-hour week to 840 workers at the Altona Petrochemical Co. Ltd. Mr Justice Williams, following his judgment, is reported in a newspaper to have said:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is one of the cruxes of his decision; the whole decision hinges on it. It has been said many times that the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission engages in conciliation and sometimes emphasises conciliation more than arbitration. It realises that unless it makes a decision that the unions will accept, the unions will just continue to strike; they will not accept the decision put down by the Commission. Therefore, the Commission bends over backwards and says: 'We will make a decision that the employees will accept'. Senator Button told us that his interpretation of market forces was the same as ours. I can assure the Senate that his interpretation of market forces emphasises the forces issue alone and leaves out any marketing. Over the 18 weeks of strike action Altona lost $20m. It then goes to arbitration and says: 'We need a decision'. Is it any wonder that the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, bearing in mind Mr Justice Williams' comment that the Commission is looking at industrial relations, comes down with a conciliation decision that a 35-hour week should be granted to the 840 men? If I were ICI Australia Ltd, I would certainly be looking at that judgment and I would be looking at what the Altona company had just lost. I would be saying: 'If that is to be the decision of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, for heaven's sake let us give in now. Let us not have a loss of $20m before we give in. Let us do it now'. That is the crux of what has occurred to date.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I noted in the Press today that the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission is divided on the productivity bargaining issue. I do not know whether that is true, but we tend to keep on taking notice of what the media says. I am not surprised about that report that there must be some division amongst the commissioners. Everybody must realise that the flow-on will occur, that productivity bargaining will soon be forgotten and that everybody will want the 35-hour week. Everybody believes that there will not be any pay back and that no one will say: 'We will improve our productivity and we will work hard so that we will achieve the same productivity when working the 35-hour week that we achieved when working the 40-hour week'. We are told Mr Dolan was delighted. He has said: 'Right, we are on our way. We will now get a 35-hour week across the board'. He recognises that the flow-on must occur. </PARA>
<PARA> I agree with Senator Scott. I believe eventually the 35-hour week will occur; it must occur. Technological change will give us increased productivity and we will be able to come to a 35-hour week eventually, but now is not the moment. At the moment we are competing with overseas markets and the workers in neighbouring countries are working a 50-hour week or a 45-hour week. How are we expected to compete with that? At the moment we have about 350,000 unemployed. I do not think anybody suggests that an increase in the hourly rate will not interfere with inflation. If workers earn the same amount for working 40 hours as they earned for working 35 hours, there will be a 14 per cent increase in the hourly wage. That must interfere with inflation. If that occurs we will have more unemployment. It is only in the last two years when our Government has been able to bring down inflation considerably-in December last year it was below 10 per cent-that we have seen unemployment decrease. We have found that employment has increased. Unemployment has gone down. Employment is higher than it was in January 1979. Some 279,200 more people are now employed than was the case in January 1979. Unemployment fell by 19,200 in February this year. Because we have been keeping down the inflation rate, we have been able to reduce unemployment. If inflation increases as a result of the 35-hour week campaign, unemployment will increase again. </PARA>
<PARA> The attitude adopted by people such as Mr Dolan seems tremendously irresponsible. He obviously is concerned only with his union membership. Mr Dolan wants his members' standard of living to increase. He does not care at all about the unemployed in this country; the unions never have. As a matter of fact, I know of a case involving a union member who had been made redundant and was unemployed for a certain time. Consequently, he did not pay his union dues. When he was re-employed in the same industry, the union demanded, before he was permitted to take the job, back payment of his union dues for the period he was unemployed. I am sure that Senator Mulvihill would agree that that is not the way unions should go about looking after their members. I believe the unions should be just as concerned about unemployed former union members as they are about working members who are paying their union dues. It concerns me that Mr Dolan is quoted as being delighted about the 35-hour week decision. I honestly think that this will lead to one of the worst situations that Australia has seen. The decision has come at a time when Australia cannot afford the introduction of the 35-hour week. We will only end up with greater numbers of unemployed. The Government is interested in the standard of living of all Australians and that is why it has been doing its utmost to keep down inflation. If inflation is kept down, employment will continue to increase. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision of the Court attacks the basis of business confidence. Business can cope with this decrease of working hours in only three ways. It can let its productivity rate drop and allow the business run down, which is absolutely disastrous for the economy of the country, employ more people or increase overtime. If more people are employed, wages increase by 14 per cent an hour. If overtime is worked at penalty rates, labour costs go up 21 per cent. What would honourable senators do in that situation? Could they, with a business that is just making ends meet, really cope with this additional inflation?</PARA>
<PARA> The 35-hour week is not an isolated issue. It has been associated with large wage demands over the last twelve months. I note that wages went up 15.2 per cent from the December quarter of 1979 to the December quarter of 1980 while the consumer price index rose by only 9.3 per cent. That sort of increase along with lower hours worked would upset the whole economy of any country. The world economy at the moment is in a far worse state than Australia's. The inflation rate is coming down throughout the world. Other countries are trying to get their inflation rates down to the rate in this country. If our inflation rate starts rising again, that benefit we now have will be destroyed. </PARA>
<PARA> Why will the ACTU not take the claim for the 35-hour week to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission? If it did so without first taking any strike action the issue could be arbitrated instead of conciliated; and that, I believe, is the difference between the two sides. The Government is asking the ACTU to take its claim for a 35-hour week to the Commission without any duress being placed on employers. If the ACTU presented the issue to the Commission without the duress of strikes and without the knowledge that an industry had had to do without $20m and if the Commission could arbitrate on the matter instead of just conciliate on it, the Government would believe that the unions really felt that they were presenting a case which had to be answered. Because the unions refuse to do so, we believe that they feel they cannot present a reasonable case which has to be answered and that they can only bludgeon their way to achieving their end. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that employers will have to unite on this issue. If they do not they will be picked off one by one. Each time one section of industry is attacked I believe other sections of the industry will have to close down until the dispute is settled. One industry cannot stay viable while a similar industry is being attacked. The unions concentrate on one company at a time and this, I believe, is the basis of the whole trouble. If the employers decided that when one of their colleagues was being attacked by a union over the 35-hour week issue, they would all close their doors until the dispute was settled, I believe this would rapidly settle the issue. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided in its wisdom to assist the employers to withstand the unions' attacks. It has decided that it will not pressure firms which are being attacked to pay their bills or to fill contracts. I hope other companies will follow that decision. If a company, because it is under union pressure, cannot meet a contract with another firm, that firm should not switch its orders to a company that at the time is working. I also note that the Government has suggested that it may defer the payment of some company tax while an industry is withstanding the pressures of unions. I believe that the unions should take note of what has been going on in the public sphere over this issue. We have had many strikes recently. Members of the public have shown that they have had enough. For the first time we have witnessed large demonstrations throughout the whole country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Sibraa said that the demonstrations were carefully orchestrated. I suppose he would consider that the demonstrations in New Zealand were carefully orchestrated. Nevertheless, even if, as Senator Sibraa says, they were carefully orchestrated, that is an awful lot of people to orchestrate. Australian people have marched in the streets and said that they have had enough. Yesterday's Australian Financial Review carried an article by Mike Taylor headed: 'Public backlash worries unions'. For the first time unions are admitting that they are concerned that the public is seeing them in a certain light. Some of the more conservative unions are backing off and saying that the backlash is of considerable concern to them. Mr Dolan attributes the criticism of his style and of the trade union leadership style just to the Fraser Government. But that is rather typical. He will not take any of the blame himself. He says that the Fraser Government is putting the blame on him and that it is not his fault. Mr Jim Baird, the research officer of the Amalgamated Metal Workers and Shipwrights Union, is concerned about the matter. He says that it appears that conservatism is becoming rife in the work place and that this has led to isolated incidents of shop stewards being intimidated. In other words, the union members themselves are saying: 'We will no longer put up with this radical approach by the shop stewards and our executive'. The unionists are also reacting. The unionists also marched in the streets and said: 'We, too, have had enough'. The Vehicle Builders Employees Federation of Australia found the task of recruiting membership on the shop floor was made very difficult by the backlash from the union members themselves against the radical executive.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; How this country approaches the issue of a 35-hour week will determine the work-style until after the beginning of the next century. The last time there was a reduction in standard hours-from 44 hours a week to 40 hours-was, of course, in 1947. That was 34 years ago. The next time there is an examination of working hours, assuming it bears the same relationship to last time, will be well into the next century. I do not believe that we should apply the criteria of the mechanical age of the 1940s to our consideration of the 35-hour week in the age of automation of the 1980s. I congratulate the Government for at least bringing down this ministerial statement for debate in the Parliament. I am afraid that this is as far as my congratulations go.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The ministerial statement is inadequate in a number of respects but it is inadequate in two major respects; that is, it makes no mention of the issue of automation or of the social aspects which contribute to the problem of unemployment in this day and age and, secondly, it assumes that all unions and, indeed, the Australian Labor Party want an immediate reduction in standard hours from 40 to 35. In dealing with the first inadequacy, I will quote from page 3 of the ministerial statement. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government's primary economic objective is to promote a growth in the standard of living of every member of the Australian community. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a very worthy objective. However, the inadequacy is revealed in the next sentence, which states:</PARA>
<PARA> However, this can be achieved only if the problem of inflation is overcome. </PARA>
<PARA>I should have thought that the Government had well and truly jettisoned that single-minded and simple approach to the problems confronting this nation so far as unemployment and work are concerned. Obviously the problems of the 350,000 unemployed or, if one likes to take the Commonwealth Employment Service figures, the 482,000 unemployed cannot be overcome only if the problem of inflation is solved. I consider it necessary for me to spend a very short time on reminding the Senate of what I said concerning this aspect in a speech I made to the Senate in, I think, September of last year. I said:</PARA>
<PARA> The truth of the matter so far as employment and work is concerned in Australia is not being told. Simply stated, the problem is that there are more people in or seeking paid employment than there are jobs at the same time as new job creation continues to be slashed by technological change. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what I said then. Unless the Government and the people as a whole realise that the problem has a social as well as an economic aspect Australia will have an unemployment rate of over one million people by the mid-1980s. The current preoccupation with economic solutions alone will not overcome the problem. That is why I say that the sentence in this statement which says that the living standards of every member of the Australian community can be achieved only if the problem of inflation is overcome is totally inadequate. It is clear that, unless we face up to its inadequacies, we will see what George Polites, the director of the National Employers Consultative Council, forecast two years ago when in referring to youth unemployment he said:</PARA>
<PARA> If this situation is allowed to continue for any extended period, the economic costs will pale into insignificance compared to the price we will eventually pay in terms of social, economic and political disruption and dislocation. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have repeated time and time again, it is just crazy to allow jobs to be destroyed by the wholesale application of automation and technological change and to force to stay in the paid work force people who have better reasons to be out of the very jobs which could be taken by the unemployed. That has been the burden of my argument, apart from the question of justice, when it comes to support for the family so that mothers who have been forced into the paid work force through economic circumstances can have the true freedom of choice to opt out of the paid work force and make way for others to enter. That is why in the context of this debate it is important to understand that perhaps there are other means of rearranging the work system which will enable persons now in the paid work force in the older age groups to phase themselves out of the paid work force so as to enable the young people to come in at the other end. </PARA>
<PARA> As I mentioned, the second major inadequacy of a number of inadequacies in this statement is that it assumes all unions and the Labor Party want an immediate reduction in standard working hours from 40 to 35. The Labor Party can speak for itself but the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Hayden, is on record as saying last year that such an overall immediate reduction would lead to unemployment. Indeed, the Opposition spokesman on industrial relations and former President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, Mr Hawke, is not in favour of an immediate reduction in the standard hours from 40 to 35. This push was commenced in the mid-1960s. Its purpose at that time seemed to be that a period had elapsed since the last reduction in standard weekly working hours. In about 1970 the reason tended to be that a reduction would assist in overcoming the growing unemployment problem and would ensure that advances in technology would be shared amongst the work force. The validity of those reasons is open to question by various people. For example, in 1970 the number in the paid work force totalled 5,395,600 and of that number 569,000 were part time workers. In 1980 the number of people in the paid work force was 6,246,700 and of that number 1,022,000 were part time workers. An immediate reduction in the standard weekly working hours from 40 to 35 hours, if we are looking at the question of equity, would not reduce the working hours of those part-timers, whose numbers have increased 79 per cent since 1970, but would mean increased pay. So in the sense it would not significantly assist in relieving the problem of unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> In considering the question of the disbursement of profits arising out of automation, it is my belief that we should not establish a privileged autocracy of the post-industrial society, as Paul Johnson described it. These benefits should be shared broadly throughout the community. In other words, why should it be that, just because a fitter works for an oil company, he should enjoy the benefit of a 35-hour week and a fitter who works for a small engineering shop is still required and bound to work a 40-hour week? It does appear to me that the attitude that there should be an overall immediate reduction in the standard working week from 40 to 35 hours is not achievable and, if it is to apply only to certain privileged sections of the work force, it is inequitable. </PARA>
<PARA> It is appreciated that already some 36 per cent of persons are working less than 40 standard hours. If we are looking at this question of hours, why not look at other possibilities? In this sense it is important for the Government not to assume that all unions and the Opposition are for an immediate reduction in the standard working hours per week. Let us assume that with the development since 1947 to the present date there should be a capacity for us again to have a look at the question of working hours. Under those circumstances if it is assumed that the reduction in working hours is equivalent to that of 40 to 35, namely one-eighth, then if one works that over a life span it is possible to have a retiring age of 59. This is assuming that, in general, people start their working life at 17 and conclude their working life at 65; that is a total of 48 years. Because the reduction of standard hours from 40 to 35 hours is an eighth, then an eighth of 48 years represents six years. One could have a look at that option. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not beyond the collective wisdom of the Government, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Opposition and others to see whether the remainder of the work force who are now not benefiting from shorter working weekly hours can in some way benefit in the long term, for example, by this availability of earlier retirement if that is their choice. The method of funding that sort of proposal it appears to me-it is not my proposal, I am just throwing it in and virtually thinking aloud at the present moment-could be achieved in a similar way to the funding of the casual long service leave proposals in, say, the building industry. These are the suggestions which are floating around at present. </PARA>
<PARA> I make it perfectly clear that those suggestions ought to be examined in detail and other suggestions, which I do not have the time to make at the present moment, ought to be dealt with. This requires an understanding by the Government that it should not believe that, just because a few people down at Altona Petrochemical Co. Ltd. got a 35-hour week, this means a boots-and-all approach into everybody and when one sees a head, kick it. I believe it is necessary for the Government to establish some sort of inquiry into this question of working hours, whether it be weekly working hours or working hours over a lifetime. As I said in the beginning of my address, what we do about this subject now will determine the working patterns for the whole of the community until well into the twenty-first century. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am indebted to Senator Lewis for being given 10 minutes to speak on this matter before the debate is adjourned. I appreciate that. What I desire to say will have to be cut short for that very reason. I thought it necessary to enter the debate because of what Senator Walters said. I thought she conveyed the impression that the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission was somewhat influenced or coerced by the action of the unions in that particular dispute. Let me say in justification of Mr Justice Williams, who was a Deputy President of the Commission on that occasion, that I have had a long association with him. I was operating in the Industrial Court in South Australia when he came there as a young lad representing the employers. I recall the occasion when he was eleced as Deputy President of the Industrial Court in South Australia. He said it was the first time I had met him and that I could wish him success in his occupation. He replied that he was appreciative of the fact that he had always represented the employers, but he could assure me and the trade union movement that he would be just and fair in every deliberation. I do not think he has departed from that line. He has been promoted to Deputy President of the Commission. I do not think a threat of union organisation would have deterred Mr Justice Williams from doing what he thought was right and correct and in the best interests of the industry. On that particular occasion he ratified the agreement. His duties involve settling and preventing industrial disputes. That is his job. He can do that only if he is cognisant of the proper working of industry. He cannot give an award under coercion if it is going to bankrupt the employers. He pointed out that an agreement was reached. Senator Walters read from the decision relating to the bringing about of better industrial relationships. Of course the Commission was formed for the very purpose of bringing about better industrial relationships. He stated that better industrial relationships would result in improved productivity. So the loss was not unbearable to the employer. Senator Walters told us they lost $20m. Now she is suggesting that the judge should have refused to ratify the agreement, causing them to lose another $20m rather than progressing and making a profit in their future operations. This is her concern with the employers of the industry. Mr Justice Williams in all his wisdom accepted the position that his duty was for industrial harmony. He was doing that and it was in the interests of industry to see that it progressed. We get an invitation today to carry on this struggle of dislocating industry until such time that conditions get so chaotic that employers cannot afford to resist and before the Commission makes the award. This idea is not new. I direct the attention of all honourable senators to an article in this morning's Age by Michele Nayman entitled: 'The 35-hour war is 60 years old'. This is not new. It never happened with Fraser. The article states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This year is the 125th anniversary of Labor Day, the granting of an eight-hour day to building trades workers. The 48-hour, six-day working week granted in 1856 was a world first. </PARA>
<PARA>It was a world record and Australia led the way by reducing working hours from 60 a week to 48 a week. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The reduction of the building trades working week from 60 to 48 hours was the beginning of a long campaign . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That union campaign went on for some time. The article also points out:</PARA>
<PARA> The first 35-hour week was awarded in Broken Hill in 1921 when underground miners won their claim after an 18-month strike. </PARA>
<PARA>It was the forerunner of what we are now experiencing. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> All other Broken Hill mining employees continued to work a 44-hour week. One of the conditions of the agreement was that the employers could re-open the case whenever they wanted. They never did. </PARA>
<PARA>The Broken Hill companies have not gone bankrupt by introducing the 35-hour week 60 years ago. I will not quote what Bob Hawke, the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peacock) or even what Senator Walters have said on this matter. I will refer to a lesser identity and quote what Mr Justice Beeby said. The article continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Six years later, in 1927, Mr Justice Beeby gave judgment in a case where the metal trades were seeking a reduction of their working week from 48 hours to 44. In support of that claim, Justice Beeby referred to the case in Broken Hill and said that it had been 'conclusively proved that the underground men on the average produced substantially more ore in 35 hours than in 44'. </PARA>
<PARA>Where is the loss of productivity? It took 18 months to win the right to reduced working hours and still produce more ore for the company. This happened 60 years ago? Mr Justice Beeby also said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . One important feature of economic history is that improvements of conditions of employment and standards of living have rarely been the result of concerted concessions by employers. All epochal improvements of the past, the justice of which is not now disputed, have been the result of organised force or of legislation, not of voluntary concession. </PARA>
<PARA>We are experiencing a repetition of this situation. If the Government had any principles at all, it would take note of the statistics-not interrupt the Commission-and not stop what history has told us is inevitable. The article continues:</PARA>
<PARA> The big breakthrough occurred in September 1947 when the Federal Arbitration Court awarded a 40-hour week to all industries. It was the first (and last) time working hours had been altered across the board. </PARA>
<PARA>In all previous cases, the reduced working week had been granted to individual industries. On this occasion, in summing up the opinions, the judges said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . It has been the historic role of employers to oppose the workers' claims for increased leisure. They have, as is well known, opposed in Parliament and elsewhere every step in this direction, and this case is no exception. The arguments have not changed much in 100 years. </PARA>
<PARA>They still have not changed. The judges continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Employers have feared such changes as a threat to profits; an added obstacle to production; a limitation upon industrial expansion; and a threat to internal and international trade relations. </PARA>
<PARA>Surely we are hearing that argument today. The article continues to quote the judges:</PARA>
<PARA> Steadily, first in one country, then in another, this opposition has been overcome until great institutions like the International Labor Organisation in the international arena, this court in this country, and the legislatures both here and elsewhere have declared for the desirability of added leisure. And history has invariably proved the forebodings of employers to be unfounded. </PARA>
<PARA>Now we have reached the stage at which unions are invited to fight until they can force the Commission, which has the responsibility to settle industrial disputes, to grant their claims. It is inevitable that this situation has come about. This Government wants that confrontation, wants to dislocate industry and wants to impoverish employers rather than give anything to the workers. That is not what I say, it is what is stated in every considered judgment of the Commisssion. The arguments used today have been used years and years ago and are repeated on every occasion that this subject is discussed. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, the honourable senator says again that it always has been. We set up the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission to try to prevent that sort of industrial blackmail. What happened at Altona was that as a result of the many demarcation disputes, the companies got to the stage where they were losing so much money that they were prepared to give in. Senator Cavanagh mentioned that many years ago Broken Hill Pty Co. Ltd gave in and that it did not become bankrupt. Of course, BHP did not become bankrupt. But what has been the cost to the Australian community of BHP giving into industrial disputation, instead of making arrangements to arbitrate matters properly in order to achieve a particular result? What would have been the cost to this nation of that 18-month strike that Senator Cavanagh referred to? What would have been the additional cost to the community, over the 60 years, for the steel which is produced in Australia? Nothing is free! If only members of the Australian Labor Party would realise that nothing in this community is free. If we have a 35-hour week, something has to give somewhere. What will be given? We know what will be given because we saw what happened in 1973.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In 1973 the Labor Party took it upon itself to introduce two changes. They were introduced without debate in either chamber and by ministerial decree. I agree that the two matters certainly should have been introduced but they should have been introduced carefully over a period. Firstly, I refer to the 25 per cent across-the-board cut in tariffs and, secondly, equal pay for women. I do not want to argue that those are not matters which ought to have been introduced over a period, but in 1973 both of them were introduced in two blows. There is not the slightest doubt that as a result of both those matters being introduced, unemployment rose 140 per cent in a 12-month period. In other words, the quid pro quo for those two changes was massive unemployment throughout Australia-unemployment that after a period of over 7 years we still have not been able to control. There is not the slightest doubt that if we mark up the cost of real wages in the community by 21 per cent-this will be the cost to employers if this change is introduced- there has to be a quid pro quo somewhere and clearly that quid pro quo will be unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Button smiles at me when I make that statement as if it is not true, but he admitted it. He said that he could appreciate that the 35-hour week would be very harsh on employers in country towns. But if the 35-hour week will be harsh on employers in country towns that means that there will be unemployment in country towns and if there is unemployment in country towns there will be unemployment in smaller industries in urban areas because they will suffer the same penalty. But the Labor Party can see only the big company which discloses so many millions in profits and says that there will not be any effect on the big company. Without the slightest doubt the Labor Party is displaying the same mentality, the same philosophy, the same approach to this debate that it displayed in 1973: Let us kick these big companies which make these massive profits. But what happened in 1973 was that the companies did not suffer. They managed to pass on the cost to the taxpayers of Australia who ended up either being unemployed or paying higher prices for the products. That is what the consequence of a 35-hour week will be-either the companies will end up with fewer employees or the price of their products will rise. We are part of the world economy and we are faced with competition which is very strong from the Asian areas. Let me remind honourable senators of what the Crawford Study Group on Structural Adjustment had to say in its report in 1979. It said:</PARA>
<PARA> Developing countries of the Asian region will be increasingly able to offer a greater variety of light manufactured goods in competition with Australian industries. Over the next decade many other industries including engineering, metal working and furniture manufacturing industries in Australia are likely to face an intense competitive challenge from Asia. </PARA>
<PARA>Can anyone really believe that those industries in Australia will be able to meet an increase in labour costs of around 21 per cent? It is clearly madness to push a labour cost increase of 21 per cent on to those people and expect them to continue to compete with Asian imports. Somehow or other we would have to try to give them massive protection; for example, by way of tariffs or some other system of quotas to try to keep those industries alive. As I say, we have the perfect example of this. Fortunately, the Labor Party was silly enough in 1973 to introduce these things wham, wham, and we are able to see what the consequence of such a stupid move was. If we were to increase unemployment in this community by another 20 per cent, imagine how many people would be unemployed. The figure would be almost unbelievable.

If only you would do some research instead of standing up and telling the media what they want to hear and repeating the headlines for them. But then I acknowledge that he has not enough staff. I do appreciate that as the leader of a third party he perhaps needs more staff but he should do his research. He says silly things like: 'Well, if we cut down to 35 hours a week that will give us an opportunity to create greater employment. There will be more jobs available'. That is an absolute nonsense. Industry cannot afford the cost of an extra 21 per cent on its labour costs so how will that create more jobs? Senator Chipp has come into the Senate and told us: 'If only we could reduce the retiring age by a couple of years that would create more jobs'. Anyone-even the fellows of the ALP who have done their research on that factor-will tell him that that is a nonsense. Senator Button knows that is a nonsense. He has done the research. It just does not happen that you cut off some section of the work force and thereby create jobs for other people. The thing that will create jobs in this country will be productivity growth. What we have to be able to do is to expand our profits and to get more people anxious to make profits, to get more people interested in developing new businesses and to get more people setting up companies-to create more jobs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, 180,000 jobs and it is well worth having a look at, Senator. The way to create jobs in this community is to create development, to have massive development in this community. Certainly there is no way in which any government organisation can create jobs. The Labor Party proved that in the period 1973-75 with its Regional Employment Development Scheme which even it abandoned. There is not the slightest doubt that it is the free enterprise system which will create more jobs in this community. That is what it is all about. To reduce the number of hours that people have to work in order to earn the same amount of wages would put an overwhelming burden on the free enterprise system. Anyone who analyses the period 1973 to 1975 will see that the industry was staggering so much by 1975 that it just could not continue to employ people. The way to create jobs for people is to give back to people the profit motive. If I can come back to the subject under debate--</PARA></TALK.START>

In the first place, and the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Peacock) spells this out quite clearly in his statement, the Government's primary economic objective is to promote a growth in the standard of living of every member of the Australian community, not just those who happen to be working for some strong union that is able to force itself upon the people.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We are doing very well with it. Yes, certainly the Government is doing very well in its object. That is shown by the actual rise in real wages in the last quarter. The rise in real wages for the last quarter of December 1980 was 15.2 per cent compared with an inflation rate of 9.3 per cent. That means that there was a real rise in wages and that means that people had more money in their pockets.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NG4">Senator LEWIS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The working class certainly recognised that fact, Senator McLaren, because they spent very heavily during December and business was extremely buoyant right throughout Australia during December. But, as the Government says, apparently some union leaders think there is a bottomless pit into which they can dig for wage increases. Of course the ultimate result of all their digging will be further unemployment which will be to the detriment of the community. But they do not care about that. They do not care about small businessmen who will go out of business because they are unable to cope with the expenses. They do not care about the small country towns which are dependent upon small businesses to keep them alive. Of course they do not care.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government points out in its statement that a five-hour shortening of the standard working week will increase by as much as 21 per cent the unit labour costs in the industries concerned. I have made some calculations based on that 21 per cent or five-hour shortening. That is equal to an additional six weeks' annual leave. All honourable senators present must be able to remember the cost to the community of the additional one week's annual leave when annual leave was increased from three weeks to four weeks. To add another six weeks' annual leave would be an unbearable cost. That is another example of the sort of cost that would be brought about by the proposal being put forward by the unions. But the significant point is that the Government, in its statement, has said:</PARA>
<PARA> If unions believe that they have justifiable claims let them come forward to have them tested by arbitration. Let them come forward and allow both sides of the argument to be put and let the result rest on merit rather than industrial might. </PARA>
<PARA>I was fascinated to hear both Senator Chipp and Senator Harradine say that there ought to be an inquiry. What need is there for an inquiry when we have an arbitration tribunal? We have asked the unions to come before the arbitration tribunal to put these propositions but, of course, they will not. It is fascinating that Senator Button pointed out in his opening remarks that the 40-hour working week was established by the Court of Conciliation and Arbitration in 1947. He stated that traditionally hours of work have been set by the tribunal. Having said, in effect, that the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission should be the body which determines whether workers should have a 35-hour week, he turned away and somehow or other by a convoluted argument ended up by saying that the unions ought to be able to negotiate outside the Arbitration Commission. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will let Senator Harradine have those words recorded in Hansard. Senator Button went on to say that the Australian Labor Party is not saying that there should be an across-the-board cut in working hours. If he acknowledges that there should not be an across-the-board cut in working hours, surely he is admitting that some industries cannot afford it. If he admits that in relation to some industries, let him come forward and tell us what those industries are. Let the ALP come forward and tell us which industries cannot afford a 35-hour working week. We could then have some discussion about the matter. Senator Button said that there should be discussions where appropriate and negotiations in order to introduce reduced hours where appropriate. Of course there should be discussions, but why not have those discussions before the tribunal?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seems quite clear to me that the Government's request in this matter is very reasonable and moderate. If the unions have justifiable claims, let them come forward and prove them before the arbitration tribunal. It is quite clear that the unions will not come before the tribunal because they know that they can carry on the tactics of blackmail suggested by Senator Cavanagh, which have been carried out for 60 to 100 years by industrial unions. There is continual blackmail of the company concerned, the economy and the taxpayers of Australia until ultimately the company caves in and the people of Australia have to suffer because of it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating a motion for the first reading of six protection of the sea Bills. The moving of such a motion enables honourable senators to speak on any topic they desire. This afternoon I wish to speak on two matters, both of which are of great importance to South Australia. One relates to the problem being experienced by the residents of Coober Pedy and the other relates to the River Murray. I received a letter dated 18 March from Mr Nick King, who is the Chairman of the Mining Committee at Coober Pedy. I am quite sure that all South Australian senators have received a similar letter. Mr King wrote:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Dear Sir,</PARA>
<PARA> This is a submission prepared by the Mining Committee of the Coober Pedy Progress and Miners Association. We wish to bring to your attention the serious situation affecting opal miners. </PARA>
<PARA> Your urgent consideration and response to the matters raised will be appreciated. </PARA>
<PARA>It was my intention to raise this matter on Tuesday in the debate on the first reading of these Bills, but that opportunity did not arise. Again yesterday, because of the consideration of other business, I did not get the opportunity. That is why I am making these remarks now rather than doing so in the adjournment debate. I shall read into Hansard the enclosed submission from Mr King so that the Government may read it and, I hope, take some notice of the plea that is being made not only by the miners at Coober Pedy but also by the other residents and business people who live in that far flung place in South Australia, which we all know is an opal mining town. The submission reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Coober Pedy is facing a crisis. The opal industry is in decline. The high costs of diesel fuel and explosives have made opal mining an extremely expensive enterprise. Many miners are being forced out of the industry because their expenses are too high and not commensurate with their efforts and present prices of opal. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the exorbitant prices, demand for both diesoline and explosives has fallen in the past year. Mining equipment, bulldozers, blowers, tunnelling machines et cetera are lying idle throughout the town and fields. Urgent action is needed!</PARA>
<PARA> Two areas are of utmost concern. </PARA>
<PARA>Those of us who have often visited Coober Pedy know what the miners are talking about when they refer to bulldozers, blowers, tunnelling machines, et cetera. Under the heading 'Fuel Prices', the submission stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Governments fuel Parity Policy is the single most important reason we are paying such exorbitant prices for our dieseline. We request the Government to urgently review the parity policy with reference to the opal industry. And then reduce fuel prices by means of subsidy. </PARA>
<PARA> The rise in the price per litre of diesel sold in Coober Pedy is illustrated by the following table. </PARA>
<PARA>The submission then sets out that, in June 1973, the price of diesel was 5c a litre with road tax exempt. In September 1974, the price rose to 6c a litre or $11 for a 44-gallon drum or a 200-litre drum, depending on whether one likes to talk in the old imperial measures or the metric measures. In September 1976, the price rose to 12c a litre. In May 1977, the price rose to 13c a litre. In May 1978, the price rose to 15c a litre or $29.50 for a 44-gallon drum. In May 1979 the price rose to 16c a litre. In December last year, the price increased enormously to 30c a litre or $60 a drum. From those figures we can see that in the space of seven years the price of diesel has risen from 5c a litre to 30c a litre or from $11 to $60 for a 44-gallon drum. That is an enormous increase. The letter went on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> The opal industry, structured as it is, with no control over its international markets cannot absorb such increases. </PARA>
<PARA> The local Caltex supplier, who in 1979 was the largest distributor of diesel in the State, reports a 45% drop in sales betweeen March-November 1979 and March-November 1980. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a period of just 12 months. The submission continued:</PARA>
<PARA> The Golden Fleece agent reports a 33% drop in sales between 1979 and 1980. The figures for 1981-so far show a further 30% drop from the equivalent period in 1980. The drop in sales is indicative of the effect that fuel price increases have had on mining activity in Coober Pedy. </PARA>
<PARA> Under the heading 'Explosives', the submission stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The retail price of explosives has risen dramatically in the last few years. This, too, has had an adverse effect on many opal miners. </PARA>
<PARA> The following figures show the price increases that have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA>I have not shown this document to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) who is sitting at the table but no doubt he has seen a copy of this letter. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the table in the submission showing the price of explosives. </PARA>

<PARA> The figures for fuel and explosive prices show that it costs almost twice as much to mine in Coober Pedy as it did two years ago. The price for opal has not risen since 1974 yet the value of production has increased many times. </PARA>
<PARA> Opal mining has been an efficient industry. </PARA>
<PARA> We would like the Government to look into the high cost of explosives with a view to granting subsidies, or take action to reduce these costs. </PARA>
<PARA>The submission goes on to give some detail from report book No. 79/111 of the opal industry in South Australia. This survey was carried out by the South Australian Department of Mines. The submission quotes the conclusion appearing in the report at page 28. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> In recent years, opal mining has become a major industry in South Australia, employing over 1,200 full time, and many part time miners. In 1978, an estimated $41.75m worth of precious opal was produced, approximately 80 per cent of the total Australian output and 25 per cent of total mineral production in South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Coober Pedy continues to be the major source of precious opal with Mintabie, for the first time in 1978, replacing Andamooka as the second largest producer. </PARA>
<PARA> Report Book 80/50 gives these figures on Data and Production in 1979. </PARA>
<PARA> It goes on to set out the places and the figures. At Coober Pedy there were 1,000 miners with operating costs of $3.65m and capital investment of $18.46m. The value of production was $32.67m. At Mintabie there were 150 miners with operating costs of $760,000 and capital investment of $6.11m. The value of production was $6.10m. At Andamooka there were 125 miners with operating costs of $60,000 and capital investment of $3.71m. The value of production was $4.52m. The total figures for the three places were: 1,275 miners with operating costs of $5.01m and capital investment of $28.28m. The total value of production was $43.29m. The submission goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> The above data gives an indication of the importance of the opal mining industry to the Australian economy. Apart from the overseas revenue earned from the export of opal and the employment of some 1,300 full time miners, very important consideration must be given to the amount miners have reinvested in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government should institute an impact study of the parity pricing policy and its effects on this industry. Primarily because of increases in prospecting and mining expenses the existence of Coober Pedy, a town of some 5,000 people, is in the balance. </PARA>
<PARA> The Mining Committee of the Coober Pedy Progress and Miners Association extends an open invitation to you to visit Coober Pedy at your earliest convenience to see and discuss the situation. </PARA>
<PARA>Yours faithfully, Nick King Chairman, Mining Committee</PARA>
<PARA>I have been to Coober Pedy on quite a few occasions. My colleague who represents that area, Mr Laurie Wallis, the member for Grey in the other place, goes into the townships of Coober Pedy, Andamooka and Mintabie on very many occasions to look after the interests of his constituents. He is very concerned about what is taking place now at Coober Pedy. Like me, he is making a plea to the Government to give some relief to the people who live in that town by helping them with the prices they pay for their fuel, explosives-and the price of everything that goes with the use of explosives such as cordtex-and all the other things that go into operating the opal mining industry. </PARA>
<PARA> This matter goes further than the mining association writing to members of Parliament. These people have also received a fair amount of publicity in the Press in South Australia and in the national Press in the last few days. They have gone to the extent of trying to draw the Government's attention to their plight by setting up a blockade of the Stuart Highway. An article appearing in the Adelaide Advertiser of Tuesday 24 March, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> A meeting of about 120 residents of the remote Mid-North opal mining town-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, Coober Pedy-</PARA>
<PARA>decided on the blockade on Saturday in an attempt to force the State and Federal governments to either subsidise or strictly control the price of gelenite and diesel fuel. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr James is reported in the article as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . another meeting would be held at 6 p.m. today to decide the final details of the blockade, including the period of the protest. </PARA>
<PARA>I shall not quote all of that article. Another Press statement appearing in the Advertiser of the next day, 25 March, written by Mike Ekin Smyth, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> A rowdy and enthusiastic meeting of about 400 opal miners and townspeople at the Coober Pedy Community Hall agreed to the blockade to focus Federal Government attention on the town's problems. </PARA>
<PARA>The Press statement goes on:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr James said the miners were making a last-ditch stand to maintain Coober Pedy as a viable mining centre. </PARA>
<PARA> The town already had lost about 1000 residents in the past year. Many of the remaining 3500 would leave if they could sell their equipment and property. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr James is reported further as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the progress association had tried to have talks with the Federal Government, but with little success. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the reason these people are now taking the action that they are. </PARA>
<PARA> In today's Australian there appeared an article headed 'Blockade a dig at opal mine costs'. The article is written by the correspondent Peter Blunden. I will not quote from that article because I think I have put the proposition to the Senate and alerted the Senate to the fact-and I hope the Government takes some notice of it-that Coober Pedy is facing a crisis at present. Also, an interview took place on AM on 24 March with a Mr John Thrower whom I know and who has been an opal miner at Coober Pedy for many years. He was interviewed by Mr Peter Rapp. I think that many people who listened to AM that morning would be acquainted with the problem faced by the residents of Coober Pedy. I hope that by the publicity which the residents of Coober Pedy have received in the last week, because the matter has been raised in the Parliament by me today-if my colleague, Mr Wallis, can get the opportunity to speak in the other place he will raise it also-and because the residents have written to every honourable senator, I think, as well as to South Australian members of the House of Representatives, acquainting them with the problem, both the State and Federal governments will see fit to take some quick remedial action to assist those people who live in that outlying area of South Australia. As they have pointed out in the correspondence which I have read out, it is a very valuable industry to the people who live there and it is a valuable means of raising revenue for the State and Federal governments. </PARA>
<PARA> Following on from that, on Tuesday 24 March a letter was written to the Editor of the Adelaide Advertiser by Mr Weiss of Blair Athol complaining about the price of petrol in South Australia. In his letter to the editor he pointed out something which those of us who live in South Australia know already, and that is that South Australia has the dearest petrol of any State in Australia. Last week, as a member of the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources, we met to inquire into the aluminium industry. I had visited Darwin and I found that petrol there was about 5c a litre cheaper than it is in Adelaide. At Gladstone in Queensland there is a similar difference in the price of petrol and again a similar difference in Tasmania. On my way back from Tasmania I did not have the opportunity to go to Melbourne to have a look there, but I understand that petrol is cheaper there too. So we find that South Australia has the highest petrol prices. Of course, this has been brought about by the mismanagement of the present Tonkin Liberal Government and its monkeying about with petrol prices. The residents of South Australia are paying the penalty. </PARA>
<PARA> There is another matter which I wish to bring before the Senate. It is something which has been given a lot of publicity in the last month or so, and that is the quality of the River Murray water. As I have said in this chamber, and I will refer to it again before I sit down, I am very disturbed at the way in which the South Australian Premier and the South Australian Minister of Water Resources are playing foolish politics by shouting from the house tops and trying to lay the blame on the New South Wales Government for the quality of water coming to South Australia. I wish to say at the outset that the Labor Party always has been concerned about the River Murray. The documents which I shall quote from date back to 1973. All honourable senators will recall that it was in 1972 that a Federal Labor Government came into office after the country had been ruled by a Liberal-Country Party coalition for approximately 23 years. It had done nothing about setting up an inquiry into the quality of the River Murray Water. We find that shortly after the Federal Government's election to office we then had a Labor Government in South Australia. I wish to quote from the River Murray Working Party interim report which was set down in the Parliament in September 1973. If honourable senators look at page 3 of that report, under the heading: 'Terms of Reference and Membership of the Working Party', they will see that clause 11 states:</PARA>
<PARA> On March 2 1973-</PARA>
<PARA>That is just four months after the election of the Labor Government-</PARA>
<PARA>at the request of the Premier of South Australia, a meeting was held between the Prime Minister and the Premiers of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia on the River Murray, the powers of the River Murray Commission and problems of water quality in the River Murray. The meeting agreed to establish a working party of senior officials of the Australian and State Governments concerned with the following Terms of Reference. </PARA>
<PARA>I will not quote them because I have already read them into Hansard on a previous occasion. It can be seen that shortly after the election of the Federal Labor Government we showed our concern by setting up a River Murray Working Party to look at the problems of the River Murray. On 10 October a document was tabled in the Parliament entitled: 'A National Approach to Water Resources Management. A Statement of Australian Government Policy by the Minister for the Environment and Conservation, The Hon. Moss Cass, M.P.' That document was dated 10 October 1973. If people read those documents they will see that we have always been concerned with the quality of the water of the River Murray. We set up the Working Party to try to reach some agreement between the three States and the Federal Government to bring about proper control of the River Murray. </PARA>
<PARA> Then, of course, the final report to the Steering Committee of Ministers was tabled in this Parliament in, I think, 1976, but it is dated 1975. Something which I want to read from this report is of great interest and I hope that the people of South Australia will get hold of this report, look at it and will stop blaming the Labor Government of New South Wales for not doing anything about the River Murray. I shall quote from page 9/11 of this report. Honourable senators should bear in mind that when this River Murray Working Party was doing its work we had a Liberal Government in New South Wales. I think Mr Askin was the Premier. Under the heading 'New South Wales Government Representatives' the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> The New South Wales Government representatives consider that the water quality management of the Murray River catchment area can be carried out most effectively by the responsible State authorities for the water within each State. </PARA>
<PARA>At the conclusion of that paragraph it states:</PARA>
<PARA> The New South Wales representatives see no need to expand the powers of the River Murray Commission in respect to water pollution control in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the Liberal Government said at that time. Yet we find the Wran Government being vilified from pillar to post by Mr Arnold and by Mr Tonkin. I will quote some of the things they say. As I have said in the Parliament on many occasions, the only thing they can achieve by what they are doing is perhaps gain a little bit of political support in South Australia. They will not achieve any better quality water by the way they are carrying on. People ought to take the time to read these documents and see the attitude of previous Liberal governments and what they did. The paragraph headed 'Victorian, South Australian and Australian Government Representatives' states:</PARA>
<PARA> It is not considered desirable to have two bodies concerned with aspects of management of the River Murray. It is considered that the interests of all parties would be best served if the institutional mechanism was embodied in the River Murray Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>So there we have it. If the Liberal Government of the time had been prepared to come on side with the Liberal Government in Victoria, the Federal Labor Government and the Labor Government in New South Wales then we would have gone a long way towards solving the problem which we are faced with and we would not find a Liberal Government in South Australia acting in this manner. </PARA>
<PARA> I now wish to refer to what happened in 1979 following that report of the River Murray Working Party. Maunsell and Partners Pty Ltd brought down a report after very extensive inquiries and recommended that certain expenditures be incurred. It recommended expenditure of $75.24m and it listed the categories of works that the money ought to have been expended on and the responsibility for carrying out these works lies as follows: Twenty-eight per cent for New South Wales, 40 per cent for Victoria, 31 per cent for South Australia and one per cent for the River Murray Commission. In all these stories and criticisms we hear today we do not hear the Liberal Government in South Australia levelling one ounce of criticism at the Victorian Government. Yet, according to the Maunsell report, Victoria is putting the greatest amount of salt into the river. Victoria is the State which will have to spend the greatest amount of money. I think that is not fair. As I said before, I think it is time some of these people used a little common sense, pulled their horns in and sat around a table. </PARA>
<PARA> In March 1978 the National Water Resources (Financial Assistance) Bill was introduced into the Parliament. We were told that under that Bill projects under the Government's $200m national water resources program would be authorised by such agreement. I spoke at length on that Bill. That was in 1978 while we still had a Labor government in South Australia, and Mr Arnold was shouting his mouth off through the Press in South Australia about salinity problems. At that very time, the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources was conducting a public inquiry into the Commonwealth's role in Australia's water resources. He never saw fit to make a submission to our inquiry, nor did any other body concerned with the River Murray in South Australia make a submission. The only submissions we got were from three individuals, and from the South Australian Government, under the premiership of Don Dunstan, and the Minister who was responsible for water in that State, Mr Des Corcoran. They were the people who were concerned, not Mr Arnold. Now that he is the Minister of Water Resources, he is running around shouting his head off that something has to be done. What was he prepared to do when we had the inquiry? We never saw him. The Riverland is in the area of my party responsibility in South Australia and I live on the Murray River. I told many organisations and people in the Riverland that we were conducting this inquiry and that they ought to make a submission; the inquiry was publicly advertised. But we did not receive one submission from the Riverland in South Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. They are levelling all the criticism at New South Wales. As I said and repeat, if they are not careful, because of the sovereign rights of the States, we will get nothing done to assist in South Australia. I probably will not have time to quote again, but I will do it on Tuesday when I resume my remarks. This week Senator Carrick said, on I think three occasions in answer to questions, that the States have sovereign rights and that they control their own water resources. That has been spelt out not only by Senator Carrick but also in the report of the Committee of which I am a member and of which Senator Thomas is chairman. These people seem to be too naive or too stupid or they are playing politics, which will not do the residents of South Australia any good.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course, we know that $200m was set aside to be made available to the States on an equitable basis over five years. The States have to put up a certain amount of money and have to pay interest on the money they borrow. It is not a gift from the Commonwealth; the States have to pay their way to get this money. My colleague, the honourable member for Hawker, Mr Jacobi, on 12 March received an answer to a question on notice about how the expenditure of that $200m was going. The question and answer are set out on page 803 of the House of Representatives Hansard for 12 March. The final part of the answer given by Mr Anthony on behalf of the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Carrick) states:</PARA>
<PARA> Expenditure in 1981-82 and 1982-83 will be subject to overall budgetary considerations and the ability of the States to match the level of Commonwealth assistance for approved projects. </PARA>
<PARA>But an earlier part of the answer stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It is estimated that by the end of this financial year a total of $76.625m will have been spent on the implementation of the National Water Resources Program leaving a balance of $123.375m to be allocated. </PARA>
<PARA>Three years of that program have already gone and the Federal Government has spent less than $76m out of the $200m. I am reliably informed that New South Wales is well ahead of the other States in getting money from the fund to control salinity in that State. There again we find that there is little ground for people to level criticism at the New South Wales Government. As some other business is to be presented to the Senate, I want to wind up my remarks this afternoon. Before I seek leave to continue my remarks, I once again make an appeal to those three South Australian senators who raised the matter here this week, to Mr Arnold and to Mr Tonkin to have a little common sense and not to jeopardise any amendments that we might be able to get to the existing River Murray Waters Agreement. I know that Senator Carrick is very concerned about the way the South Australian Minister is carrying on. He is very concerned that he might upset the whole apple cart. A couple of weeks ago I said in this place that the negotiations have reached a very delicate stage. It only needs one fool-a couple of them are about at present-to say the wrong thing and the whole agreement will be put in jeopardy. As there is other business to come before the Senate, I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the papers. </PARA>
<PARA>In moving that motion I would like to make some comments on behalf of the Opposition on the Commonwealth Government response to the report on Aboriginal legal aid which has just been tabled by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume). First of all, I would like to congratulate the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs on its report. I think it was a very comprehensive investigation into what has now come to be recognised as an essential service for Aboriginal people. It is a very basic service which is essential to giving Aboriginal people what we regard as a fundamental right in our society-the right to be equal before the law. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, that right has not yet been achieved by Aboriginal people. We are constantly reminded of that. We were very recently reminded of the unequal position of Aboriginal people in this country before the law in a paper delivered by Mr William Clifford of the Australian Institute of Criminology who pointed out that between 500 and 1,000 Aborigines per 100,000 people were in gaol, whereas the general imprisonment rate for Australia was 67 per 100,000 people. He claimed that Australian Aborigines probably have the highest rate of imprisonment in the world. He pointed out that Aborigines represent only one per cent of the Australian population but 30 per cent of the numbers in prison. Of course, those figures do not reflect a drastically higher propensity to criminal activity by Aboriginal Australians. What they reflect are the appalling circumstances of poverty and disadvantage in which most Aboriginal Australians live and the difficulties of discrimination that they experience under our legal system. I think there can be no debate about the essential nature of Aboriginal legal services, and I am pleased to see that there is a bipartisan position on that. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the overwhelming impression I have from this report is that the present level of resources being made available by the Federal Government to the Aboriginal legal services is quite inadequate. Although the absolute amount has increased since the Aboriginal legal services were begun a few years ago, the funding has not kept up with inflation. Indeed, in 1980 funding was 8 per cent to 10 per cent less in real value than in the year before. Not only have the funds not kept up with inflation in terms of the amount being given, but also the Aboriginal legal services are almost open-ended services. As the services develop and as Aboriginal people come to have confidence in them, so the demand increases all the time and the funding by the Federal Government has simply gone nowhere near reflecting that demand. That is our major criticism of the Government's handling of the Aboriginal legal services to date. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to make some specific comments about matters raised in the report and the Government's response to it. In doing so, I acknowledge the fact that the Government has made detailed responses to each of the recommendations. This kind of government response to parliamentary reports is a welcome improvement on the situation that prevailed previously when reports were left unattended, sometimes for years. As the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs knows, there was a dissent to one aspect of the report by the Labor Representatives on the Committee. It related to the recommendation in the report to charge fees, on a means tested basis, for Aboriginal people seeking the services of the Aboriginal legal services. I simply confirm that the Australian Labor Party opposes the charging of means tested fees mainly because the knowledge that fees were to be charged would discourage Aboriginal people in need from approaching the services. We also recognise and believe that the Government should also recognise that the overwhelming majority of cases dealt with by Aboriginal legal services involve Aboriginal people living well below the poverty line. The introduction of the means test would mean that the number of people actually rendered eligible to pay would be miniscule. One has to consider the machinery needed and the cost involved in imposing, testing for and collecting a fee. We believe the attempts to collect a fee and administer a means test would create an administrative nightmare for the Aboriginal legal services, which, under-resourced as it is, would hamper their efficiency and effectiveness and perhaps erode the confidence of the Aboriginal people in them. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GD5">Senator RYAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a modified response, as the Minister has pointed out, but it seemed to my colleagues on the Committee that the circumstances of people using Aboriginal legal services is such that it would not be worth the effort to collect the fees. I presume that that is what the Government would discover. I have made the point that as the reputation of the legal services improves the demand for services grows. I also point out that the Aboriginal legal services receive claims other than just from people seeking legal representation and they have to meet these claims out of a very small budget. For example, I understand that the Minister wrote recently to the Central Australian Aboriginal Legal Aid Service refusing to provide funds for an appeal in the Huckitta case and suggesting that the funds allocated for the establishment of a legal aid office in Tennant Creek might be diverted to that purpose. That is an example of how, from time to time, claims will be made on the Aboriginal legal services in special cases of this kind. It ought not to be that the Central Australian Aboriginal Legal Aid Service has to choose between pursuing an appeal which, after all, is just a further attempt to get legal justice for Aboriginal people, and establishing a regional office in Tennant Creek the need for which is recognised by all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Another drain on the resources of the Aboriginal legal services, I understand, is connected with the work of the Australian Law Reform Commission, which is currently seeking the views of Aboriginal communities on its report on customary law. We endorse what the Commission is doing, but when I was in Central Australia recently I was told that the Aboriginal legal service there was required to translate the Commission's report into various tribal languages. The translations were put onto cassettes. The service was required to participate in the inquiry with no extra funds being allocated for the purpose. It seems to me that the Government ought not to make these additional demands on Aboriginal legal services without recognising that additional funds will be needed. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to training and staff development. The report recommended that additional funds be made available to Aboriginal legal services to enable Aboriginal field officers to participate in training and that educational institutions develop suitable formal diploma or certificate courses. The Government endorses these recommendations, as does the Opposition, but makes no mention of additional funds. I will ask one question of the Minister now. He can reply to me at his convenience. Does the Government intend that when the field officers go off on these training courses they will be replaced? Just this week I visited the Aboriginal legal service in Redfern. Officers there expressed to me concern that the field officers would go to the training courses, which of course we all want to happen, but no new officers would be provided to replace them. In such a case, of course, the work of the service would be seriously undermined. Along with that anxiety there is the anxiety that the training allowances for field officers will not be high enough to recognise the fact that many of them are mature people with family responsibilities. I have raised this problem of training allowances for people with family responsibilities in other contexts. The Minister knows of my concern. I think it is important, if the training is to be provided, that financial support be provided also, otherwise the best people will not gain the advantage of the training. It would be apparent to the Minister that the people who are best suited for the fairly demanding and sensitive work of an Aboriginal field officer in the legal services would generally be mature people with spouses, children and so forth. I also draw attention to the fact that only 12 Aboriginal lawyers are currently in training. Again I say that this is obviously inadequate. The Government, I believe, ought to respond more positively to the problem of such a small number of Aboriginal people undertaking legal training. </PARA>
<PARA> I notice the specific response of the Government to the recommendation concerning the training and employment of Aboriginal legal staff. The Government says that the employment of Aboriginal law graduates by the Aboriginal legal services is a matter for the Aboriginal legal services to determine. That is all very well. As a philosophy of autonomy for the Aboriginal legal services, I would not argue with it, but while ever there is such a small number of trained Aboriginal legal practitioners it is not really very helpful for the Government simply to say that the Aboriginal legal services can decide whether they want to employ Aboriginal lawyers. If there are no Aboriginal lawyers the decision, of course, is entirely spurious. I would like to see a more affirmative statement by the Government on the need to train Aboriginals as professionals in this crucial field. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly the report recommended the development of opportunities for training Aboriginals, particularly those from the Aboriginal legal services, in management and administration in consultation with the National Aboriginal Conference. We know that in the past there have been administrative and management problems in the development of Aboriginal legal services. I imagine that this recommendation was a response to that. The report recommend that the Government consult the Aboriginal Training and Cultural Foundation and the Institute of Aboriginal Development on the development of suitable management training. I support these recommendations. I have had some contact with both training organisations. They seem to me to be very well suited to undertake this course. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of community education the report recommends that the Government provide financial support to the Aboriginal legal services which take initiatives to develop community legal education materials. The Government's response is that it will consider the matter having regard to overall budgetary priorities. This is the kind of response which appears to many of the recommendations throughout the report. I simply say that I hope that when the Government is working out its overall budgetary priorities it will give a very high priority to this whole area of developing, within the Aboriginal communities, services, trained personnel and an understanding by the community of legal rights. It is a most basic and fundamental right in a democratic system that people have this understanding of the legal services and are properly represented. I became rather pessimistic when I read so often throughout the Government's response to the recommendations that it would all be considered with regard to overall budgetary priorities. I hope that the Minister will be able to ensure that the priority given to this area particularly will be very high. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter of Aboriginal and police relations was documented very adequately in the report. Of course, there was reference to the documentation of cases of discriminatory treatment of Aboriginal people by police forces throughout Australia. In Mr Grassby's various reports to the Parliament I think that he has documented, probably from every State and territory of Australia, episodes of discriminatory treatment of Aboriginal people by police. The Government has made a positive response to this. At some stage I would like to hear from the Minister how the identification of these sorts of problems will continue now that the Racial Discrimination Act has been amended, in conjunction with the legislation setting up the Human Rights Commission, in such a way as to prevent the Commissioner for Community Relations making separate reports to the Parliament. The value of those separate reports, of course, lay in the fact that particular cases of discrimination could be documented and brought to the attention of the Parliament. Now that there will be no separate report, will the Human Rights Commission continue to draw the attention of the Parliament to these issues and continue identifying complaints of discriminatory treatment of Aboriginal people by the police forces?</PARA>
<PARA> I was pleased to see that the report emphasised the inadequacy of statistics concerning Aboriginal people and the legal system in Australia. Again, that is something that has been referred to before. In response, the Government has said that it will establish a means of gaining statistical information, particularly for crime and justice statistics. I strongly endorse that recommendation by the Government and I hope that very little time indeed elapses between the Government's accepting that recommendation and the establishment of a proper system of statistical gathering. Until we have that system, we are, of course, to some extent working in the dark and we have no really sound way of evaluating the success of some of these programs. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the employment of Aboriginals and specialist staff there was a recommendation that the Department of Aboriginal Affairs employ its own senior lawyer to provide legal expertise within the Department. However, the Government did not accept that recommendation. I think that the Government response to the matter of the promotion and career structure for Aboriginals within the Public Service was too complacent. The Government defended its record and pointed to the fact that the Public Service Board is taking action to increase Aboriginal employment opportunities. That action is insufficient. Too few Aboriginal people are being moved through the bureaucracy getting experience and training. There are still far too few senior Aboriginal public servants not only in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and specialist areas but also throughout the rest of the Public Service. I was disappointed that the Government defended its record in that respect. I would like a more affirmative response. Overall, as honourable senators will see, the Opposition welcomes the report and welcomes the fact that in many cases the Government has acknowledged the problems that have been so well documented and in some cases has made a commitment. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I would like to say that it seems to me now that the teething problems of the Aboriginal legal service have been sorted out. Now that the Aboriginal legal services are seen to be a very effective way of bringing some sort of legal protection to Aboriginal people and of reducing the numbers of Aboriginal people ending up in institutions, what is needed is an injection of funding. The current level of funding is inadequate. Many of the recommendations in the report concerning education and training and so forth that I have examples of will require additional funding as will the sorts of special tasks that are allocated from time to time to the Aboriginal legal services. The important thing now we have the report is that we have an appropriate response from the Government in terms of the next budgetary allocation. I heartily urge the Minister to seek such an allocation. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to require that senators for Queensland shall be directly chosen by the people of Queensland voting as one electorate. It removes from the Parliament of the State of Queensland the right to divide Queensland into divisions for the purpose of electing senators and thus puts Queensland on the same footing as each of the other five States in relation to the election of senators. In Australia, we have become accustomed to electing senators on a State-wide basis. This method of selection is used because of a provision in section 7 of the Constitution which specifies that, until the Federal Parliament provides otherwise, senators shall be chosen by the people of each State voting as one electorate. The Federal Parliament has not provided otherwise, so senators are currently chosen in State-wide ballots. It is clear, however, that should the Federal Parliament determine that there was a more preferable method of electing senators it could legislate to have that method adopted. </PARA>
<PARA> The Constitutional requirements in relation to the election of senators for Queensland are more complex. The Constitution allows the Queensland State Parliament to divide the State into senate electoral divisions and to determine the number of senators to be elected in each of those divisions. This provision is embodied in section 7 of the Constitution which, in part, states:</PARA>
<PARA> But until the Parliament of the Commonwealth otherwise provides, the Parliament of the State of Queensland, if that State be an Original State, may make laws dividing the State into divisions and determining the number of senators to be chosen for each division, and in the absence of such provision the State shall be one electorate. </PARA>
<PARA>In Queensland, senators are still chosen on the basis of a State-wide vote, because of two factors. Firstly, the Parliament of the Commonwealth has not yet provided that there shall be another method of selection. Secondly, the Parliament of Queensland has not made any laws dividing the State into divisions. The Queensland Parliament, however, retains the right to divide Queensland into divisions for the purpose of electing senators and to determine the number of senators to be chosen in each of those divisions. Quick and Garran outline in The Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth that this unique provision was inserted in the Constitution because of the 'special circumstances of Queensland, its vast territory and scattered population, coupled with the fact that its population seemed to be naturally growing and developing in three divisions which may hereafter become separate States'. Lumb and Ryan in The Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia Annotated note that the provision 'was designed to assuage the feelings of separateness prevalent in the northern and central areas of the State, feelings which had adversely affected Queensland's participation in the convention activities'. </PARA>
<PARA> It could be argued that although this special provision has been in the Constitution since Federation, it is unlikely that it will be used in the future. The fact that successive Queensland parliaments have seen fit not to establish a divisional structure for the election of senators could lend credence to this argument. Recent events, however, suggest that the part of Section 7 dealing with electoral divisions in Queensland could well be used by a Queensland parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Towards the end of 1979, the Premier of Queensland, Mr Bjelke-Petersen, announced that he would give serious consideration to those provisions of Section 7 of the Constitution which specifically relate to Queensland. At that time, it was reported in the media that electoral divisions in Queensland could be drawn in such a way that in a half-Senate election, three National Party senators could be elected, with the Labor Party and the Liberal Party both having one of their candidates elected. When this matter was being discussed in Queensland in 1979, a three-divisional structure was suggested. Division 1, which would elect one senator in a half-Senate election, consisted of the Federal electorates of Leichhardt, Herbert and Kennedy. Division 2, which would also elect one senator, consisted of the electorates of Dawson, Capricornia and Wide Bay. The third division, which would elect three senators, consisted of the remaining 13 Queensland Federal electorates. Those three divisions could loosely be termed the northern, central and southern divisions respectively. </PARA>
<PARA> After the results of the 1980 Senate election were available, the detailed voting figures in Queensland permitted calculations to be made to determine the likely results if the five senators for Queensland had been elected on the three-divisional basis which has just been described. It should be acknowledged that if the Senate election had been based on a divisional structure, there may have been different candidates and different emphases in campaigning by the major political parties. Nevertheless, calculations made on the detailed results within those three divisions reveal that, all other things being equal, the National Party would have won the vacancies in Divisions 1 and 2 and one of the three vacancies in Division 3. The Liberal and Labor parties would each have won a vacancy in Division 3, giving an overall Queensland result of three Nationals, one Liberal and one Labor. Considering that the actual result in the 1980 Senate election in Queensland was two Labor, one National, one Liberal and one Democrat, the divisional structure would have been particularly appealing for the National Party. </PARA>
<PARA> Quite naturally there was spirited debate in 1979 when Mr Bjelke-Petersen announced that he would give serious consideration to the provisions contained in Section 7 of the Constitution. Mr Bjelke-Petersen would have perceived that public opinion and perhaps his coalition partners would have not been on his side if he decided to press ahead with legislation to have senators elected in Queensland on a divisional basis. It was not surprising that he did not pursue the idea. The point which should be stressed is that the matter was given serious consideration in 1979 and it would be most unwise to presume that no future Queensland Parliament will legislate to set up a divisional structure for the election of senators. </PARA>
<PARA> It should also be kept in mind that it would not be difficult to devise a divisional system-even one which embodied a one vote one value concept-which was biased towards any particular party, not necessarily the National Party. Section 7 of the Constitution could be used by any political party with a majority in the Queensland Legislative Assembly to set electoral divisions which would assist its Sente candidates. If appropriate legislation is not enacted by the Federal Parliament, there is little, if any, doubt that some future maverick Queensland government will use this archiac provision of section 7 of the Constitution. It could choose its timing in such a way that the Federal Parliament would be temporarily powerless to frustrate the actions of the Queensland Government. For example, the Governor-General prorogued the Federal Parliament on 19 September 1980. If the State Government had acted on that day to set up Senate electoral divisions and subsequently issued writs for the election of senators in those divisions, the Federal Parliament could have done nothing until the newly elected Parliament met after the election. Indeed, it would have been required to accept the senators who had been elected under the divisional system. It would be much better for the Federal Parliament to act now, rather than be outmanoeuvred by some future Queensland government which is intent on using section 7 to influence the outcome of Senate elections in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> The passage of this Bill will prevent the Parliament of Queensland from legislating to set up a divisional structure for the election of senators. When this Bill was being drafted, legal advice suggested that the power given to the Commonwealth Parliament to provide otherwise could be interpreted in two ways. One interpretation is that the power allows the Commonwealth Parliament to provide expressly that senators for Queensland shall be chosen by the people of that State voting as one electorate. The other interpretation is that the power simply allows the Commonwealth Parliament to deny the competence of the Queensland Parliament to make laws dividing the State into Senate electoral divisions. This Bill therefore has been drafted to cover both possibilities. Finally, I mention that this Bill would in no way affect the Senate representation of any new State which may be established within the existing boundaries of Queensland. The representation of any new State is provided for in section 121 of the Constitution. That section states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Parliament may admit to the Commonwealth or establish new States, and may upon such admission or establishment make or impose such terms and conditions, including the extent of representation in either House of the Parliament, as it thinks fit. </PARA>
<PARA>The passage of this Bill would in no way alter section 121. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate call on the Government to state its attitude towards the recommendation of the Trade Practices Consultative Committee's Report on the Trade Practices Act and on small business, with particular reference to:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the likely impact of the repeal of section 49 on small business; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the impact of the Report's recommendations on the concentration of market power in the hands of big business. </PARA>
<PARA>On 19 December 1978 the then Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, the present Minister for Education (Mr Fife), referred a matter to a committee which had been appointed by him. Its terms of reference were designed to allow it to inquire into the Trade Practices Act and particularly section 49 of that Act which relates to the complaints which governments have, over the last dozen or so years, had referred to them by small business throughout Australia. I remind the Senate that, although great changes have taken place, small business is still very important and a focal point of the Australian economy. I think it is ironic that two and half years later, and more than a year since the presentation of the report, this Government has failed either to accept or reject the recommendations which I will refer to in that report. Of course, the reasons for this lie in the inability of the Fraser Government to determine whether there is substance in the recommendations of the Trade Practices Consultative Committee, or whether it is prepared to act on behalf of the small business sector of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I also find it ironic that yesterday, when I talked about matters relating to deficiencies in the Commonwealth Electoral Act, I was chided by Senator Martin for not doing something about electoral problems and inadequacies during the brief period, 1972 to 1975, when the Whitlam Government was in power. Senator Martin ignored the fact that for that three years the Whitlam Government was besieged and beleagured by the obstructionist attitude of the conservative majority in the Senate. Under the Whitlam Administration, the Parliament had placed before it the largest legislative program in its history. It seems to me to smack of hypocrisy to be chided because we did not do something about the Commonwealth Electoral Act when on this important question of small business, the Government is not able or does not want to take any action as a result of the report of the Trade Practices Consultative Committee because of the differences in philosophy and ideology within the coalition parties. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government has often stated that it is the friend of small business. In the treatment of this report it can only put its money where its mouth is. The fact is that a report has not been made to the Parliament. There has been no discussion in the Parliament about the recommendations dealing with section 49 of the Trade Practices Act. I imagine the reason for that is that the Government is not prepared or is not game to act upon the major recommendation of the Trade Practices Consultative Committee, because that report recommended to the government of the day the repeal of section 49. Despite all the evidence that was placed before the Committee which dealt with the problems of the small business sector in Australia, this very strange Committee came to the conclusion that section 49 of the Trade Practices Act should be repealed. What does the Council of Small Business Associations say? Firstly it says that it wants section 49 retained. I am sure that that would be the view of the Parliament, of the Australian community and the view of a vast majority of the Australian consumers, who recognise the importance that small business plays in Australia, not only because it provides a competitive base for the Australian economy but also because it is one of the largest employers of labour in our community. I will quote what the Council of Small Business Associations says. It has consistently stated that whilst it:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . strongly supported the retention of section 49 in the Trade Practices Act, it was felt that the working of the section left much to be desired. </PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, we suggest that consideration be given to redrafting that section. Firstly, we must state that we are not asking for price maintenance at either the wholesale or retail level. Discounting is here to stay. All we ask is that discounts, allowances, et cetera, are meaningful discounts which make allowance for differences in the cost of manufacturing and distribution. Many of the discounts being given in today's market-place have no bearing or relationship to specific quantities or cost savings. The Association states:</PARA>
<PARA> The present Section 49 has two parts which appear to create the most problems in relation to small businesses, the first being the wording which follows 49 (1) (D) commencing 'If the discrimination is of such magnitude, et cetera . . . ' through to the end of the sentence. The discrimination may be of such magnitude in, say, for instance, a country town, that it seriously jeopardises the existence of a small trader. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, a small business. It continued:</PARA>
<PARA> However, when this discrimination is related to the market place as a whole it becomes quite insignificant. We suggest that so long as discrimination is proved, action should be taken against the corporate concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, the wording 'recurring and systematic nature' virtually results in a small business having to close down before sufficient proof of the 'recurring nature' has been provided. </PARA>
<PARA>It is no wonder that the Council of Small Business Associations in this country is pressing the Government to strengthen section 49 by taking the steps that it has proposed to the Trade Practices Consultative Committee. It proposed an alternative wording to strengthen the section. It suggested the following wording:</PARA>
<PARA> If the discrimination is of such a nature it is likely to have the effect of substantially lessening the competitiveness of the business or businesses being discriminated against in a market for goods, being a market in particular or the general marketing area in which the corporation supplies, or those persons supply goods. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to give one or two examples of how that system would work. Complaints have been reported to me and, I am sure, to other members of Parliament who have any connections with small business about major takeovers of manufacturers of goods. I refer particularly to a case referred to me about the manufacture and distribution of building materials. It was about a large company in Sydney which took over two smaller companies manufacturing similar goods and then not only ceased to honour the trading arrangements which had been in existence for a considerable time with a number of small retail outlets but also refused to make available to the retail outlets the goods which were normally ordered and supplied by the companies taken over. When consumers entered a small retail store for the purpose of purchasing a particular product they were not able to buy that product. The larger company, having taken over the smaller company, forced the consumers to go to larger market places, to the major retail centres, to purchase the goods required, to the detriment of the smaller retail outlet. It is interesting to note what the Department of Industry and Commerce had to say about section 49. It said:</PARA>
<PARA> A problem with S.49 is that although retained to assist the small business sector, the present provisions do not really protect individual small firms. </PARA>
<PARA>Here we have a Government department acknowledging that the section is somewhat deficient. It continued:</PARA>
<PARA> As indicated earlier small firms can be individually damaged by price discrimination but cannot obtain relief if there is no substantial lessening of competition. </PARA>
<PARA> One way of making it more effective from the point of view of protecting the small firm would be to add an additional concept to the basic test of 'substantially lessening competition', i.e. prevent price discrimination where . . . it has or is likely to have, the effect of substantially lessening competition . . . or of substantially damaging the business of a purchaser of goods of like grade and quality in that market. </PARA>
<PARA>That is the point I stressed in relation to the instance to which I have referred. The change taking place in the market place not only places the purchaser in the position of not being able to purchase goods from where he would normally purchase them but also results in the retail supplier not being able to have the goods supplied to it. That is leaving aside the experience which I am sure every honourable senator would recognise about what happens in the price area itself. </PARA>
<PARA> The Council of Small Business Associations stated:</PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion although S49 in our view is of little value to an individual small business suffering from price discrimination, it appears to have some deterrent effect on this practice, particularly as businessmen realise there is a difference between genuine discounting and blatant price discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet, in the face of these views, the Committee appointed by Mr Fife two and a half years ago still recommended the repeal of section 49. I can appreciate the dilemma of this Government when the Australian economy is such that every day we see in the financial columns of our newspapers reports of drastic takeovers and changes in the market place, of bigger firms swallowing the smaller firms in manufacturing, retailing, distribution and so on. Surely what we are seeing is not acceptable to the Australian community or to this Government. Certainly, it is not acceptable to the Australian Labor Party. Even the conservative governments in South Australia and Queensland are forced from time to time to stop raids of other conglomerates in Australia from gobbling up some of the companies that have long been part of their tradition and are indigenous to those States. Over the last few days we have seen reports of the raid of the West Australian entrepreneur, Mr Holmes a' Court, of the Bell group of companies, upon Elder Smith Goldsbrough Mort Ltd in Adelaide. They show how an individual can make $15m or $16m from a concentration of economic and political clout, to the detriment of small or even large businesses, such as Elder Smith Goldsbrough Mort. What we are seeing is a modern bucaneering approach by the new tycoons of Australian industry, marauding the business sectors of our country, acting as though they are twentieth century pirates in the same way as pirates stole and plundered goods in other parts of the world two and three centuries ago. All of this is not only having a very marked effect upon the capital market and upon the viability of major companies but also rendering it impossible for smaller companies to survive. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 49 is one of the mechanisms that have provided at least some opportunity for small business to survive in the face of this great change that is taking place in the Australian economy. If, according to the Committee, section 49 is not doing anything, why chop it out? Surely a case should be made that it is actually doing harm before it is repealed. That is our submission to the Government. Although few, if any, actions have been brought under this section, there is still enough evidence in the report with which we are dealing to suggest that it has a deterrent effect. Indeed, that was what the Department of Industry and Commerce said in its submission. The companies out in the market place know what benefits them and they want the section strengthened, not just retained. I believe that the Parliament should scrutinise the composition of the Committee that made these recommendations. How, may we ask, could a committee set up to look into the area of small business make recommendations against the submissions by small business itself?</PARA>
<PARA> The Sydney law firm of Allen, Allen and Hemsley, which is surely accepted by accountancy practices in Sydney as one of the major firms working in the trade practices area, has a significant influence on the thinking of the Consultative Committee. The six-man Committee was chaired by Mr R. G. Blunt, a partner in that firm, and Mr A. G. Hartnell, who is currently working for that firm, was a member of the Committee. Whilst having two out of the six members in itself gives Allen, Allen and Hemsley considerable weight, this weight is increased by the fact that Mr Hartnell is a deputy secretary in the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs who is on leave of absence so as to take part in a Public Service-private sector work exchange program. In the Department Mr Hartnell was intimately involved in trade practices matters. His past experience thus makes him the most important single member of the Committee. The other members of the Committee are Mr J. G. Wilson, former head of Australian Paper Manufacturers Ltd, Sir Samuel Burston, President of the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council, Mr T. Martire, a Sydney small businessman, and academic, Dr N. R. Norman. So of the Committee of six appointed by this Government to look into section 49 of the Trade Practices Act only one small businessman is present. </PARA>
<PARA> We can ask why it is that big business did not make submissions. Obviously it found it was not necessary because big business was already represented on the Committee. I note that the report's recommendations on franchising are realistic and worth while and should be implemented. I believe this is an urgent issue and one which the Government should not sweep under the carpet. We are aware of the problems facing small businesses in this country. When we are aware that over the last seven or eight years the number of bankruptcies has increased some 40 per cent in this country, surely it behoves a government that claims to represent the interests of the small business sector in our country to take some action to repeal the section, to strengthen the section or to give the Parliament some opportunity to decide what action should be taken in respect of this important report. </PARA>
<PARA> The report goes on to make some philosophical comments about competition. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Some proponents of competition laws see competition as desirable mainly because it limits the accumulation and use of power by individual (large) firms. Although the use of this power might be limited by direct governmental control, competition is seen as preferable because it replaces the direct influence of big business or government with the impersonal dispassionate control of the market. A broader aspect of this claim is the limiting of the 'social' power of large firms. The justification for this approach would be the conviction that fragmented economic power with many independent proprietors, rather than economic concentration with power wielded by corporate bureaucrats, is desirable in itself. </PARA>
<PARA>Finally, in the conclusion the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> Competition laws should be directed primarily at the behaviour of firms and secondarily at market structure that is inconsistent with the attainment of efficiency and progress. They should be directed at preventing firms persistently behaving in a manner different from that which a competitive market would enforce on them. They should not be directed primarily at achieving the other goals . . . </PARA>
<PARA>What is the evidence that was placed before the Committee? The Committee looked at what was happening to the manufacturing sector of our economy. It made the point that import competition may be of considerable significance to our manufacturing sector. In respect of retailing it said that two-thirds of all of the submissions made by the small business sector drew the conclusion that there was unfair price discrimination. Similarly, in respect of the wholesaling sector, the Committee found that evidence given to the Committee by small business, which in its desire to maintain its viability as part of the Australian economy made similar representations to the Committee on the basis that there was unfair price discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, we are all aware, are we not, that the big companies in the area of discounting are able to provide goods at such a price to the large retail outlets in such a way as to make it impossible for the small businessman to compete at all in the area of prices? So we have the problems of the delivery of goods, of unfair price discrimination and of the big getting bigger all at the expense of the small business sector in Australia. We have seen so much of this develop in the last couple of years that I think it behoves any government that claims to represent the economic interests of small business in Australia to act upon the recommendations of the Trade Practices Consultative Committee or reject them and take on board the submissions which were so properly placed before the Committee by the Council of Small Business Associations of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate deplores the continued persecution of religious minorities in Iran, particularly the large community of Baha'is, and urges that this total abuse of the right to religious tolerance be brought to the attention of the Human Rights Commission of the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA>This debate gives us the opportunity to explore some of the incidents that have occurred in the strife-torn nation of Iran since its Islamic Revolution which overthrew the regime of the late Shah and established a theocracy. The facts which I wish to put before the Senate this evening indicate the extent to which religious minorities in Iran, some of whose positions were allegedly guaranteed by the Iranian Constitution-both the revolutionary Constitution and the earlier Constitution of 1906-have now been set at nought. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall bring also before the Australian Senate a matter which has been considered on a number of occasions by the Australian Government and which relates to the position of the very large Baha'i religious minority community in that country. I will confine my remarks this evening to discussing purely the persecution of religious minorities, although perhaps it is worth noting in passing that other minorities, including, for example, the ethnic minority of the Iranian Kurds also have been subjected to extreme persecution by the current regime. Lest it be thought that I refer purely to one group of religious minority adherents in Iran, I think, before going on to the exact position of the Baha'is, I should indicate the fate that has befallen the Anglican, Catholic and Jewish religious minorities in that country. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn first to the position of the reasonably well-organised and reasonably well-developed Anglican community in Iran. Shortly after the Ayatollah Khomeini and his regime came to power in Iran, a systematic persecution of the Anglican Church commenced. Within a few weeks of the Ayatollah coming to power-in fact in February 1980-the Anglican Vicar of Shiraz, Aristo Sayeh, was brutally murdered by the revolutionary guards. In October 1979, gunmen, again identified as revolutionary guards, burst into the Isfahan bedroom of the Anglican Bishop of Iran, Hassan Barnaba Dehqani-Tafti. He and his British-born wife, Margaret, were subjected to assault and, indeed, were sprayed with automatic pistol fire. Fortunately they survived that attack. However the Bishop's son, Bahram, a few weeks later in fact was murdered. The Bishop's secretary, Miss Jean Waddell, an elderly lady, was arrested by religious guards, being strangled almost to death, she was thrown into prison and brutally treated by the revolutionary guards. She and Dr John Coleman and his wife, Audrey, who were Anglican missionaries in the city of Yazd, were subjected to imprisonment, torture and various other forms of persecution. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, as honourable senators will recall, it was only through the intervention of His Grace, the Anglican Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr Runcie, and his special representative to Iran that these Anglican hostages were fairly recently released from custody. The persecution of Christian groups in Iran continues. In August 1980 Iran ordered that all Catholic priests, monks and nuns had to leave the country within a period of one month. Mr Mohammad Ali Rajai, the Prime Minister of Iran, one of the most extreme of the Islamic fundamentalists, was instrumental in seeking to close down all Catholic religious establishments in Iran. The message which His Holiness, Pope John Paul II, sent to the Ayatollah Khomeini in fact was rejected, and the replies which the Iranian Revolutionary Government sent to His Holiness were offensive in the extreme. The position of the Catholic church in Iran since the revolution has become one of considerable persecution. </PARA>
<PARA> Perhaps not surprisingly the Jewish community in Iran has suffered, and suffered very considerably. The Jewish people in Iran have by and large sought to leave the country, and almost half of the entire Jewish community in Iran has since quit the country in fear of renewed persecution. The Age newspaper of 19 August 1980 reported that Iran's parliament had expelled its only Jewish member, Mr Eshagh Farahmandpur after a two-hour debate which in fact took the form of a trial conducted within the Iranian parliament. Mr Farahmandpur was accused of being an adherent of and a collaborator with international zionist conspiracies. Despite the fact that he had been properly elected to the Iranian parliament, he was expelled from that parliament on no other basis than his membership of the Jewish faith. Lest it be thought that the attack is simply one of a series of indiscriminate attacks upon particular religious minorities, I note that on 4 March this year the Majlis, the Iranian parliament, passed legislation which required that the activities of all parties, societies and groups, including religious minorities, would be regulated by a series of government controls. For instance, clause 17 of that legislation prohibits religious groups from having contact with embassies, political parties and foreign governments without the written permission of the Iranian Government. Such contacts which exist are to be reported in detail to the Iranian Government within a period of 48 hours. </PARA>
<PARA> I mention those things to put into context the fact that when I specifically single out the persecution that the Baha'i minority has suffered in Iran, I do not mean it to be the exclusive illustration of religious persecution by a fanatical regime. The Iranian constitution adopted, as far back as 1906, at a time when Raza Shah was coming to power-indeed the current Iranian constitution recognises this-there is an apparently legitimate place for four religious groups within Iran; for Islam the religion of the overwhelming majority of Iranians, for Christians, for Jews and for those who are adherents of the Zoroastrian faith. I have already indicated the extent to which the Christian and Jewish groups are persecuted by the behaviour of the current regime. It has not been brought to my attention that any persecution of the Zoroastrian community in Iran has yet occurred, but I must say from my knowledge and research of that country and its circumstances, I would not be surprised if that were the case. The Zoroastrian religion is a very old one, established many years ago in Iran. Zoroastra, who is also known as Zarthushtra, was active as a religious reformer in Persia 258 years before its conquest by Alexander the Great. It is a religion based on the position of the chief deity, Ahura Mazda and what I suppose might be called his dialectic opposite, Ahrimar, is a significant religion. Its adherents are a significant group of people in the Iranian community and I have no doubt that they as a religious minority are likely to suffer the same persecution as the Baha'is, the Christians and the Jews. I should now therefore say a few words about the Baha'i faith in particular and draw attention to the specific instances of religious persecution which have been directed against the Baha'i community. Despite the chiding of Senator Evans, I am sure that he would not want to be deprived of the opportunity to expand his knowledge of a particular interesting religious faith which has many adherents in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact, those of us who live in Sydney are aware of its significant Baha'i temple. Senator Sibraa would be aware of the establishment of the Baha'i community and its centre of religious worship at Ingleside in the same Federal electorate, I think, in which Senator Sibraa resides. There are many people of the Baha'i religious persuasion in Australia. They constitute a small dedicated group in Australia. Among the things that undoubtedly are significant to them is the total freedom in which they practice their religious beliefs here and the fact that they are a persecuted minority on whose behalf, as I will demonstrate shortly, the Australian Government has intervened both with the Iranian authorities and indeed with the United Nations. The basic principles of the Baha'i faith are that they believe in the oneness of mankind, as they describe it, in the independent investigation of truth, in the common foundation of all religions, in the essential harmony of science and religion, in the complete equality of men and women, in the elimination of prejudice of all kinds, in universal compulsory education, in spiritual solutions to political, economic and social problems, in a universal auxiliary language, and in the concept of universal peace. </PARA>
<PARA> It is for precisely those views which they hold that they are now subject to persecution in Iran. The fact that the major figures of the Baha'i faith, The Bab-that is his title-Siyyid Ali Muhammed, its first significant figure, Bahaullah its principal exponent-his son and his grandson who were the principal figures in the establishment and development of the Baha'i religion which goes back now about 130 years, were originally members of the Islamic faith, has caused Islamic revolutionary regimes in countries such as Iran to regard them as heretics, as deviants from the true religion and as apostates, and as such to subject them to a high degree of persecution. Under the regime of the late Shah of Iran Baha'is were certainly not encouraged as a religious group, but many of their members, because of their education and because of their inherent skills, rose to occupy positions of significance in the administration of the Shah and as such have been identified on a number of occasions with a regime whose very memory the current revolutionary regime in Iran is seeking to stamp out. </PARA>
<PARA> It should perhaps be indicated that persecution is not new to the Baha'i religion in Iran. Back in 1896 Nasiri'd-Din Shah was assassinated and the Baha'is were unjustly blamed for that. There were a considerable number of persecutions as a result. In 1903 the new regime ordered the massacre of more than 100 members of the Baha'i religion in the city of Yazd. In 1906, during the time of the great revolution in Iran, the members of the Baha'i faith were again persecuted. There was systematic persecution of them in the 1930s. There was persecution of them during the time of the late Shah's rule in Iran in 1955. The current wave of persecution, however, has been vicious. I would like to give a few instances of the extent to which that can be shown to be true. When the former Premier of Iran, Mr Hoveida, was executed and indeed, when the former chief of Savak, General Nassiri, was executed, one of the charges against them was that they were members of the Baha'i religion. Regardless of the role they might have played in supporting the Shah's regime, one of the formal charges against them was that they were associated with the Baha'i religion. </PARA>
<PARA> In May 1980, five members of the Baha'i religion, including Mrs Parsa, a former Minister of Education under the Shah, were executed. In July 1980 two other significant religious leaders of the Baha'i group were executed in East Azerbaijan. In November 1980 Yousef Sobhani and Reza Firuzi, again significant Baha'is, were executed. In January 1980 Professor Hakim, a member of the Baha'i National Council and an internationally recognised medical scientist, was murdered and his property was confiscated by the revolutionary regime. In March 1981 Mr Nafti and Mr Dehgani, again members of the Baha'i National Council, all nine of the members of which are in prison at the moment, were executed. In May 1980 the Sunday Examiner newspaper reported that Amnesty International had expressed its disquiet about the execution of ex-government Ministers in Iran and seven members of the Baha'i faith. The Canberra Times of 24 September 1980, under the heading 'Crusade to purify nation of non-Islamic influence' drew attention to the number of executions of Baha'i members in Iran. It indicated that the purge of non-Islamic groups that was going on had caused 30,000 of the country's estimated 70,000 to 80,000 Jews to flee the country. It estimated that some 70 leading members of the Baha'i faith in Iran had been imprisoned. It identified the fundamentalist Mr Rajai, the Prime Minister of Iran, as a prime moving spirit in this persecution of religious minorities. The Weekend Australian of 13-14 September 1980 again reported the murder of some seven members of the Baha'i faith on the orders of a revolutionary tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> I have already referred to the murder of Professor Hakim. A number of other executions could be adverted to. It is not just that members of the Baha'i faith are being murdered and executed; it is also a fact that they are being persecuted within the framework of the Iranian Government. Mr Rajai, when he was Education Minister in Iran, commenced this persecution of members of the Baha'i faith. Ayatollah Sadoughi, one of the senior members of the Iranian revolutionary establishment, preached what I suppose might be regarded as a sermon in which he asserted that all members of the Baha'i religion were plotting in every city in Iran and were conspiring with the Zionists and with the United States. He urged the faithful, in his words, 'to evict the Baha'is whom you know from all administrative posts and turn them over to the revolutionary prosecutor'. Etelaat, one of the significant revolutionary newspapers, has been pursuing a campaign calling for the dismissal of all employees, the ending of all Baha'i concessions and forbidding members of the Baha'i religion from engaging in any form of paid employment. In the French newspaper Le Monde of 24 June 1980 there is a very significant description of the way in which the persecution of Baha'i members in the Iranian civil service is taking place. I have here a copy of a directive from the Ministry of Education in Iran signed by Mr Rajai, who, as I said, is now the Prime Minister, in his capacity then as Guardian of the Ministry of Education of the Islamic Republic of Iran, in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Ministry of Education which has come into being through the justice of the Islamic Republic of Iran, and the blood and martyrdom of thousands of Muslims, men and women, cannot tolerate, like the previous regime, the existence of followers of the Baha'i sect in its Educational unit . . . In conclusion I would like to remind you that the employment of Iranians, who are not followers of recognised religions such as, Muslims, Jews, Christians and Zoroastrians, in Government Offices is against the law. Therefore, your dismissal--</PARA>
<PARA>This is addressed to a particular Baha'i individual-</PARA>
<PARA>according to the existing law is a minimum punishment. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Baha'is have drawn to my attention the fact that some 50 members of the Ministry of Education were dismissed summarily in the middle of 1980 for their adherence to the Baha'i faith. One of the members of the Islamic revolutionary court, in response to a petition from certain Baha'i women, wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with the instructions of the Attorney General of the country, the Baha'is are not entitled to receive anything; therefore, we are not replying to your petition. </PARA>
<PARA>That was a simple petition asking for the protection of their religious and civil rights under Iranian laws. The Governor of Sistan and Baluchistan wrote in a circular letter:</PARA>
<PARA> Since transactions with the false Baha'i organisation is against the laws of Islam, the Department of Finance is instructed to refuse accepting any vouchers for such transactions . . . Anyone who does not observe this ruling will be severely punished. </PARA>
<PARA>The London Times on 2 July 1980 indicated the extent to which Army officers, for instance, were being told that they were to be dismissed or deprived of their commissions unless they gave up their Baha'i faith. It has been indicated that certain changes of status-for instance, the right to get a passport or the right to get married-may be denied to members of the Baha'i faith unless they are prepared to forego their faith and to make a renunciation of it. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of resolutions have been passed internationally and there have been numerous responses to and protests at the persecution of the Baha'is. The Canadian House of Commons Hansard dated 16 July 1980 records that the House of Commons in Canada passed a motion moved by Mr Geoff Scott in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA> That this House of Commons deplores the continued persecution of religious minorities in Iran, especially the 200,000 Baha'is, and urges that this total abuse of religious tolerance be brought to the attention of the Human Rights Committee of the United Nations. </PARA>
<PARA>That motion was similar in wording to the motion that I have moved this evening. The United Nations Economic and Social Council on 8 September 1980 expressed:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . its profound concern for the safety of the recently arrested members of the elected National Administrative Council of the Baha'is in Iran, and that of all members of this community, both as individuals and collectively;</PARA>
<PARA>The Official Journal of the European Communities in September 1980 recorded a resolution which, inter alia:</PARA>
<PARA> Condemns the violation of the human rights of all religious minorities in Iran, more particularly the members of the Baha'i faith whose rights as a religious minority are not recognised by the Iranian constitution;</PARA>
<PARA>I am glad to say that the Australian Government has been active and forthright in its condemnation of persecution of the Baha'i faith in Iran. As far back as 12 November 1974 there appeared in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette a proclamation issued by His Excellency the Governor-General recognising denominations for the purpose of the Marriage Act 1961-1973. The Baha'i faith is listed there. On 13 September 1979 the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Mr Peacock, writing to the Acting Secretary of the Baha'i National Spiritual Assembly in Australia, said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government is deeply concerned about the situation in Iran in relation to aspects of human rights and the position of ethnic and religious minority groups. The Government shares your concern about the position of the Baha'i communities and reports of confiscation of and damage to their communal property. </PARA>
<PARA>I should indicate that at that stage the chief religious shrines and sanctuaries of the Baha'is in Iran especially the House of Bab in Shiraz had been systematically desecrated by the Iranian revolutionaries and that the free practice and free occupation of the religious shrines in Iran by the Baha'is had been systematically denied to them. Mr Peacock, in a letter of 15 August to the Acting Secretary of the National Spiritual Assembly, indicated that his Department 'shares your view that the situation of the Baha'is in Iran has deteriorated markedly, particularly in the past few months'. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Street, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, indicated on 12 December 1980 in a letter to Mr Bailey, the Chairman of the Spiritual Assembly, that his Department had called in the Iranian charge-d'affaires in Canberra and had made representations to him regarding the persecution of members of the Baha'i faith. In fact, the Iranian charge-d'affaires was called to the Department of Foreign Affairs on 7 August 1980 and has since been called on at least one other occasion for the Australian Government to express its opposition to the treatment of the Baha'is in Iran. On 9 March the Australian delegation to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights meeting in Geneva spoke strongly against the persecution of religious minorities in Iran. We have therefore been on the public record as it were in indicating, at least at a governmental level, our opposition to the persecution of this religious minority. </PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of moving the motion this evening is to invite the Australian Senate, which is part of the Commonwealth Parliament, to associate itself formally with this expression of concern about religious persecution in Iran and with statements that have been made by the Australian Government through its Department of Foreign Affairs. The Baha'is, as a group, do not participate in political activity. It is part of the tenet of the Baha'is faith that Baha'is do not participate in political activity in any country. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TI4">Senator PUPLICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, they do not vote, even in Iran. When the Revolutionary Government proposed a national referendum on the question of the establishment of an Islamic republic the religious leaders of the Baha'i community in Iran wrote to Prime Minister Bazargan indicating that the religious convictions of the Baha'i religion would not allow any Baha'i to vote in national referendums. As I understand it, members of the Baha'i faith in Australia as well do not participate in overt political activity even to the extent of voting. It is a tenet of the Baha'is faith not to involve oneself in anything that is communally divisive, including participation even in democratic political undertakings. I think it is in fact significant that this group is very insistent on having no activity which could be described as entering into partisan considerations, whether in Iran or Australia. As I say, the congregation in Australia is significant. Outside Israel, where at Haifa the principal religious shrine of the Baha'i faith is to be found, and Iran, Australia is one of the half dozen or so places around the world where a Baha'i temple is established and where the members of that faith practice their faith without any degree of discrimination or imposition being made upon them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that it is perhaps unfair to take this matter totally in isolation. I believe that it would be unfair for any implication to be drawn from what I have said that the Islamic faith as such is hostile to the Baha'is or that that faith does not believe in allowing the Baha'is to exercise their own religious practices and beliefs. I think the situation we have in Iran at the moment is an aberration, that it should not be regarded as being either typical or representative of the overall approach of the Islamic people. Time magazine of 28 April 1980 carried an interesting theological discussion under the heading 'Is the Ayatollah a Heretic?' in which a number of Islamic scholars discussed the question of the extent to which the Ayatollah's regime has launched persecutions, his lack of charity towards strangers and his lack of hospitality in the sense that it is understood within the Islamic faith, in fact, marked him out as deviating significantly from the fundamental teachings of Islam. </PARA>
<PARA> My purpose in moving the motion this evening is to seek the concurrence of the Senate in condemning a particular instance of religious persecution. My purpose is to align the Senate with the stand that has already been taken by the Australian Government at Executive level with the Canadian House of Commons, with the Council of Europe and with some of the organisations associated with the United Nations and to indicate that in Australia is a community of people freely practising their religious faith. They are unable to do so in Iran. They are being systemically and vigorously persecuted in Iran. Passage of this motion this evening may not do anything specifically to alleviate the situation as it appertains in Iran at the moment, but at least it is a confirmation and understanding that Australian members of parliament and the Australian Senate understand and unreservedly condemn the persecution that the Baha'is are currently suffering. It seeks to draw to the attention of the wider world community the fact that this persecution is unjustified and that it goes some way in reaffirming one of the absolutely fundamental strengths of Australian democracy and that is the free practice of religion, the free expression of religious views and the tolerance of different religious practices in Australia. I hope that the Senate will find it within its ambit to pass this motion this evening and formally put it on the books of the Australian Parliament, thereby conveying to the Australian Government and the United Nations its expression of concern for and outrage at the situation existing in Iran at present. The Baha'is quest for brotherhood and world peace deserves better; it deserves our support. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate views with grave concern the attempts by the Government to suppress the publication of the book Documents on Australian Defence and Foreign Policy 1968-75 and extracts therefrom, noting in particular-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the far-reaching implications for the future of democratic and open government in Australia if the Government should receive High Court endorsement in this case for its arguments based on breach of confidence, breach of Crown copyright or alleged breaches of the Crimes Act;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the intimidatory and dishonest behaviour allegedly engaged in by Government officials in advising book-sellers and others against whom no injunction had been granted that distribution of the material by them would be illegal; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the absurd and self-defeating nature of the Government's actions to date in this matter both in Australia and overseas which-by virtue of their belated and ineffectual character-have apparently served only to give greater circulation and notoriety to the material in question than would otherwise have been the case. </PARA>
<PARA>Notice of motion in this matter was given four months ago, on 25 November 1980. Subsequent events may appear to have made some of it now inapplicable. In particular, of course, there has been a decision of a single judge of the High Court, not the Full High Court Bench but only Mr Justice Mason, in a splendidly sensitive judgment to the effect that the Government's pretensions with respect to breach of confidentiality and that part of the action which is based on alleged breaches of the Crimes Act are not in fact appropriate to demand the suppression of this book. The other part of the judgment, however, was that the law on Crown copyright would justify, pending a trial on the facts and further consideration of the legal issues involved, a continuation of the injunction in question. But certainly, insofar as Mr Justice Mason's decision did knock out the claims made by the Government with respect to breach of confidence and the alleged breaches of the Crimes Act, the condition of political democracy in this country might be thought to be now a little safer than it appeared to be at the time this motion was originally moved. </PARA>
<PARA> However, as I hope I can indicate in a moment, a great many questions remain unanswered, unresolved or insufficiently answered in relation to this matter. It is my submission that these matters are such that the Senate would now be justified in expressing its concern in the terms of this original motion. However, because the general issues surrounding this topic were, I think, well canvassed at the time-certainly they were set out at some length by me in moving a motion to refer certain matters to the Constitutional and Legal Affairs Committee on 3 December-and because there will undoubtedly soon be another opportunity in this Parliament in the context of freedom of information legislation to canvass the general issues governing defence, security and international affairs matters at appropriately detailed length, I do not propose to go over these general issues of principle again tonight. I simply take the opportunity now in what I will say to remind the Senate of what some of the unanswered questions and unresolved issues are and hope that the Attorney-General (Senator Durack), in reply, will be able to supply some information and set at rest some of the fears which I still have arising out of this action. </PARA>
<PARA> The first question I want to ask is: What precisely is the status now of the Goverment's litigation against Walsh and Munster, the editors of the book and against the Age and Sydney Morning Herald newspapers? Mr Justice Mason, as I said, upheld the continuation of the injunction with respect to the book itself and also with respect to the newspaper publication of the remaining proposed articles in the series on copyright grounds if not on the more substantial and more far-reaching grounds of a particular breach of confidence. Mr Justice Mason directed that the trial of the action proper in this matter to determine whether the injunction should in fact become permanent be held appropriately soon in the New South Wales Supreme Court. The question I have is: What exactly is happening now with respect to that trial? Is the action proceeding at all or is there some prospect of settlement and if so, on what terms? Is it proceeding-and this is the really important question-just on the copyright issue? Is that all that the Commonwealth is proposing to continue to pursue or are all the issues which Mr Justice Mason adjudicated in a preliminary way now to be up for grabs again so that the arguments will be run again in the New South Wales court with the prospect of an appeal going from that court on the questions of law involved to the Full Bench of the High Court? These possibilities are certainly technically open at this stage. What I think ought to be told to this Parliament is what precisely the Commonwealth's intentions are. Is the Commonwealth prepared to rest content with a statement of law by Mr Justice Mason on the crucial issues of confidentiality and the implications of an alleged breach of the Crimes Act as justifying suppression or does it want to pursue unto the democratic death the particular arguments that it was trying to run before Mr Justice Mason? They are important questions and they are ones that if the Commonwealth does answer in the affirmative, if it is trying to do all those things and the Attorney-General confirms that in his reply which I understand he will make to my speech tonight, in my submission the Commonwealth will be justified in being censured in the terms of this motion. </PARA>
<PARA> The second question I have is: What is the status of the action in the United Kingdom against the New Statesman magazine which was, of course, set on foot at the same time-late November or early December last year-in order to suppress the intended publication by the New Statesman of major extracts from the book? Is that injunction which was then obtained on a temporary basis still standing? What is the status of that litigation in the United Kingdom? Is the Commonwealth proposing to pursue the matter to make the injunction permanent? Has the Commonwealth made up its mind in that respect? What is happening? If the Commonwealth is still pursuing this matter against all principle, as I certainly would say and I believe the Opposition would say and indeed a number of individual senators on the other side of the chamber would say, again I believe it is appropriate for the Commonwealth to be censured in the rather polite terms of this motion. </PARA>
<PARA> The third question I have which is relevant to part (c) of the motion before the chamber is: When can I expect an answer to question 151 which I put on notice on 26 November 1981?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, 1981 is overdoing it. I meant 1980. Thank you, Senator, for that very timely intervention. You can always be relied upon to bring accuracy to these occasions. If I may remind the Attorney, the terms of that question are as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) How many copies of the book Documents on Australian Defence and Foreign Policy 1968-75 were put into circulation before an injunction was granted against the publishers, Messrs Walsh and Munster. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) How many copies of the early editions of The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald containing extracts from the book were put into circulation before injunctions were granted against those newspapers. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) How many and which other Australian newspapers and magazines have published extracts from the book. </PARA>
<PARA> (4) How many and which radio broadcasts in various parts of Australia have transmitted material from the book. </PARA>
<PARA> (5) How many and which overseas publications have published and circulated material from the book. </PARA>
<PARA> (6) Is it the case that copies of the book are in the possession of (a) the Indonesian Government; (b) the United States Government; and (c) other governments whose relations with Australia are dealt with in the book. </PARA>
<PARA>The obvious point of that question is to elicit data in support of paragraph (c) of the motion now before us which refers to the absurd and self-defeating character of this litigation which has served only to draw attention and to give notoriety to the documents in question, documents which, it seems, already in fact have been given very wide circulation. Not only do I seek from the Attorney an answer as to when my question will be answered but also I seek from him tonight, if he is minded and able to give them, some answers to those very specific questions that have now been before him to ponder for the last four months. I make the point that surely the Attorney cannot claim that the substance of those questions is sub judice in any respect. I hope that the kind of material sought by way of answers to those questions is the kind of evidence which, to the extent that it is relevant to the trial of this action, the Commonwealth would be able and willing to make available to the court and to provide generally to the best of its knowledge. I cannot see in any way that it could prejudice the Commonwealth's claim for that information to be out and about. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth matter I raise for the attention of the Attorney and indeed the Parliament is relevant to paragraph (b) of the motion before us tonight. I ask: When can I expect an answer to question on notice 152 asked on 26 November 1980? This question sought detailed answers as to whether the Commonwealth engaged in intimidatory behaviour against particular booksellers. I will not read the terms of the question because they are quite long. I simply remind the Attorney that the terms of that question in fact repeated the terms of the question without notice I asked on the same day and which the Attorney in reply decided to take further advice on. The double trouble that I have endeavoured to give the Attorney by putting the question on notice as well as asking a Question without Notice does not, unfortunately, appear to have accelerated the response that I received to it. I hope that I can get a response tonight from the Attorney as to the specific questions of detail there raised. I make the point again, even more strongly in this case, that surely material of this kind cannot possibly be regarded as sub judice in the context of the continuing litigation, if indeed it is continuing, and I hope the Attorney will not be tempted to make any such claim. </PARA>
<PARA> The final matter I raise and on which I seek answers is in respect of the very serious question of intimidation or big brother operations, this time in another guise, by the Australian Government in the context of the allegations made of telephone tapping as part and parcel of the Commonwealth's rather ham-fisted endeavours to suppress the publication. The Attorney will recall that on 2 December 1980 I asked a Question without Notice as to whether there had been tapping of the telephones of Mr Tom Kelly and Mr Jack Graham, senior office bearers of the New South Wales Society of Labor Lawyers, in their conversations, in particular, with the radio station 2SER-FM because it would appear that it was only by such tapping that the information in question could have been obtained. The Attorney gave me a reply on that occasion which indicated that, whilst he was not going to answer the question as to whether there had been an interception, he would answer part of the question as to where the information as to the likelihood of a radio broadcast taking place had come from. On that occasion I asked the Attorney-General a supplementary question, as reported at page 215 of Hansard, of which the Attorney said he would take notice. I ask him tonight for a response to that supplementary question. </PARA>
<PARA> I asked the Attorney-General whether he would make further inquiries as to the source of what he described as the anonymous telephone call to establish, at least to his own satisfaction, whether the anonymous call did or did not emanate from the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation or from some other like body-and would he give further consideration to advising the Senate accordingly. In reply to the supplementary question the Attorney said that 'I will take note of the further question from Senator Evans'. As he has had four months in which to take notice of the question, I ask the Attorney, in all good faith, whether he would be prepared to contemplate tonight giving us an answer and putting at rest the fears, legitimately held I believe by myself and certainly those persons more closely involved in this series of actions, as to where the tip-off in fact came from? I do not propose, as I said, to take advantage of the opportunity this motion gives me to beat the drum any further on the whole issue. There will be later opportunities in other contexts to do that. I simply make the point that the questions raised by this motion are manifestly questions of high seriousness raising fundamental questions of democratic principle. I hope that the Attorney will, in the reply that I understand he is now about to make, respond accordingly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Evans gave notice of a motion to the Senate in November. He moved that motion this evening and supported it with a speech of somewhat longer duration than we anticipated. I am not complaining about that. The motion raises very fundamental questions about freedom of information, protection of Government documents and the legal means by which the Government can protect such documents. It also raises very fundamental questions about the sub judice rule and the relationship between proceedings in Parliament and statements made, particularly by myself as Attorney-General, in relation to proceedings in which I, in my office, am deeply involved. However, Senator Evans has really sought to use the motion as a vehicle to obtain a good deal of information. It is a sort of extended new form of Question Time. I do not mind really on that basis responding as much as I can to the motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am bound to say that the Government will oppose the motion and will do so for reasons that I think I must mention although the matter is not to be debated at any length. The motion seems to suggest that the Government should not be taking proceedings of the kind it took in the High Court at the end of last year and that the Government should not be seeking to use the forms of legal redress which are mentioned there, including breaches of confidence, breaches of copyright or breaches of the Crimes Act, to protect documents which it believes should not be in the public arena. That pertains to parts (a) and (c) of the motion. I do not propose to debate the question before the court on the facts in this case. It would be quite wrong of me to discuss the facts because that clearly would be a breach of the sub judice rule. The courts will decide whether the documents are of a character which amount to a breach of confidence or a breach of copyright. The court will decide also whether the law of copyright is an appropriate vehicle in these cases. I think that is a subject that may well be debated on another occasion. </PARA>
<PARA> Why I say that the Government will oppose the motion is that we believe that there are certain documents in the possession of government which we believe must remain confidential for the workings of government. I think that those on all sides of the freedom of information debate, including those honourable senators on the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, would support that view. I know Senator Evans not only is a member of that committee but from comments I have heard him make recognises that there are such documents in the possession of government which must be protected for various good reasons. They are documents which affect the inner workings of government, certainly for periods when they are highly relevant. There are also documents which would be prejudicial to international relations, to defence and to security and so forth. Mr Justice Mason recognised that fact in the judgment he gave on the interim injunction. I will read from the judgment that Mr Justice Mason gave in the High Court. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the court will determine the government's claim to confidentiality by reference to the public interest. Unless disclosure is likely to injure the public interest, it will not be protected. </PARA>
<PARA> The court will not prevent the publication of information which merely throws light on the past workings of government, even if it be not public property, so long as it does not prejudice the community in other respects. Then disclosure will itself serve the public interest in keeping the community informed and in promoting discussion of public affairs. If, however, it appears that disclosure will be inimical to the public interest because national security, relations with foreign countries or the ordinary business of government will be prejudiced, disclosure will be restrained. There will be cases in which the conflicting considerations will be finally balanced, where it is difficult to decide whether the public's interest in knowing and in expressing its opinion, outweighs the need to protect confidentiality. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not wish to adopt that statement as the absolute correct proposition of law in this matter because obviously the question of law itself is one which ultimately may well be decided in these proceedings. I quote it because in the interim proceedings a very distinguished Australian lawyer and a judge of the High Court has stated a principle which clearly justifies the action which the Government took and which it may be required to take if similar circumstances should arise again. </PARA>
<PARA> These proceedings commenced in great haste, one Friday evening early in November when late in the afternoon of that day information was received in the Department of Foreign Affairs that a book was about to be published. According to the material received the book contained documents of a very sensitive character in relation to the sorts of matters which Mr Justice Mason mentioned in that part of his judgment which I have quoted. Proceedings were taken and an interim injunction was obtained at a late hour of that day from Mr Justice Mason. The proceedings that have taken place in the High Court have been in relation to that interim injunction which Mr Justice Mason continued on the ground of breach of copyright and referred all the issues in the action to the Supreme Court of New South Wales because obviously a great deal of evidence is still required. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are the reasons the Government took the action. Whether or not in relation to the particular documents in this book the Government was justified in taking that action will be, as I said, ultimately determined in those proceedings. The motion that has been moved by Senator Evans really seeks to deny the right of a government to take protective action of that kind in relation to the documents. I understand that he and all those intending to participate in the freedom of information legislation debate would recognise that if documents did fall into that description then the Government would be justified in seeking to restrain their publication. Whether the form of the law as it stands is inadequate obviously is a matter for debate. It may well be that the powers open to a government to give protection to this class of documents even under the most liberal freedom of information legislation need further consideration. As I said, it may be that the law relating to copyright is not the most appropriate vehicle. It may be that the law relating to documents in confidence is not going to prove to be adequate. But there may well be debate about these things and there may well need to be law reform in relation to these matters at some future date. But that is not the issue that is raised in this motion tonight. It will not be the issue that will arise even in the debate on the freedom of information legislation itself. For those reasons the Government will oppose this motion because on the face of it it does appear to deny the Government any right to take that sort of action. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the proceedings themselves, I can provide the Senate with certain further information. In relation to the proceedings against the newspapers, a summons for directions has been taken out in the Supreme Court of New South Wales. An order has been given that all interlocutory steps are to be completed by July this year. The present position is that the Commonwealth has delivered answers to a request for further and better particulars on 18 March and the defendants are required to deliver their defence by 1 April. At the time the Commonwealth delivered its particulars it informed the defendants that the Commonwealth does not intend to pursue the claim based on the Crimes Act. </PARA>
<PARA> In the proceedings against the publishers and the distributors, a summons for directions has been heard and again all interlocutory steps are to be completed by July 1981. The Commonwealth has until 1 April to deliver answers to the defendants' request for further and better particulars. As to the proceedings in the United Kingdom against the New Statesman I point out that the action was commenced in London on 14 November. Interim injunctions were granted and further proceedings were adjourned by consent. That is where those proceedings stand at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to all of these proceedings, discussions are taking place between the Commonwealth and the several defendants in these actions as to the future course of proceedings apart from the steps that I have mentioned. But as those discussions have been taking place without prejudice I do not propose to say anything further about them here. </PARA>

<PARA> Senator Evans also referred to some questions that he asked me. In relation to one of a series of questions-I think it is No. 151 on the Notice Paper-I have given consideration to a draft answer to that question but I have been concerned that it does raise facts which may well be in evidence in the proceedings in the Supreme Court. </PARA>

As Senator Evans is so anxious to have an answer I will have a look at it again. As to the other questions that he asked me in relation to actions by Commonwealth officers, I answered then in principle. Senator Evans had asked me in a question without notice-in fact it is in paragraph (b), as the second limb of this motion-about the actions of government officials advising booksellers in relation to the injunction that had been obtained and endeavouring to obtain their co-operation in not selling the book and avoiding the necessity of having to take proceedings against some large numbers of booksellers. I have already indicated, in answer to a question, why those proceedings were taken. The question on notice calls for a great deal of information. When that is collected, the question will be answered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In regard to the other question that the honourable senator asked me, it does not appear to me that there is any way of finding out who an anonymous telephone caller is. Of course I do not propose to say anything about whether any action has been taken under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act. That is as much information as I can provide in reply to the questions asked by Senator Evans. As I have said it is a rather strange use of a motion to try to obtain further information. </PARA>

I do not want to seek a right of reply but I will make a corrective statement because there is one aspect of Senator Durack's reply which surprises me. He said that I had gone on record as acknowledging the right of the Government to protect from scrutiny its internal working documents, documents relating to defence security in international affairs and other sensitive documents of that kind. I make the point that nowhere have I made any statement in as sweeping terms as that. Indeed, the whole argument about freedom of information is as to whether there are unqualified rights in government to suppress documents of that kind or rather, as I contend and have contended on numerous occasions, whether there are overriding questions of public interest in respect of all those classes of documents which ought to be resolved, where there is a dispute by some independent tribunal and not simply by unilateral government action. I wish to make the record absolutely clear in that respect-if it has not already sunk into Senator Durack-because there is a very serious dispute between us on that question of principle. I would not wish him to engage in any further misrepresentation of that kind, cavalierly or otherwise.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) is of the opinion that Australian families, particularly one-income families, have been financially disadvantaged by the failure of the Government to either increase or index family allowance payments;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) notes the Prime Minister's election night statement that certain things undertaken in the last five years had 'not pleased all people', that his Government had 'heard that message' and that 'we will use all our energies and all our efforts to advance the cause of all Australians and all Australian families'; and accordingly</PARA>
<PARA> (c) impresses on the Prime Minister and the Government the urgent need to take long overdue action to assist Australian families, particularly one-income families and families with young children. </PARA>
<PARA>I shall deal with the paragraphs of the motion as they occur. It is my intention to prove to the Senate that it should be of the opinion that Australian families, particularly one-income families, have been financially disadvantaged by the failure of the Government either to increase or to index family allowance payments. Honourable senators will recall that the family allowance system was established in 1976 when child endowment payments and rebates for children were abolished. Whilst at that time I applauded the Government's move, I warned that unless these new family allowance payments were indexed they would cause considerable concern and serious financial disadvantage to families in the long term. That is precisely what has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) stated recently in an address to, I think, the Institute of Public Affairs in Sydney, in 1976 the cost of the new family allowance program was approximately $700m and the savings to the Government through the abolition of the child endowment scheme and the child rebate scheme amounted to about $650m. In effect, it was a straight swap. In effect, the Government took the money out of the wallet and put it in the purse. I did not object to that and I do not think many other people objected to it. I think it had been noted that the rebate often went to the male taxpayer and was not necessarily spent for and on behalf of the children. However, the fact that these family allowances have not been in- dexed has caused serious disadvantage to Australian families-all families, not just single income families. As the Senate would know, since that time prices have risen, according to the consumer price index, by in excess of 60 per cent. So, as a corollary, the value of those family allowance payments has been eroded by in excess of 60 per cent. Even if we applied to the family allowance the system which is applied for the indexation of pensions we would see that since 1976 family allowance payments have been eroded to the extent of 56 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> A table has been prepared for me showing on a weekly basis the current position of family allowances and what they ought to be. I remind the Senate that an outdated method is used to calculate the increases in pensions. The allowance is paid monthly, but I will use weekly figures as they are the figures that were supplied to me. Currently, an amount of $3.50 a week is paid for the first child. That payment ought to be $5.45 a week. An amount of $5 is paid for the second child. That ought to be $7.80. An amount of $6 is paid for the third child. That ought to be $9.35. An amount of $6 is paid for the fourth child. That ought to be $9.35. For the fifth and later children an amount of $7 is paid. That ought to be $10.95. In other words, a mother with five children has had her family allowance eroded by an amount of $15.40 a week. She is $15.40 a week worse off. I mention and remind the Senate that these figures would have been for November 1980. A further adjustment to pensions will occur in May 1981 and, of course, these figures will then have to be adjusted. So, honourable senators can see that all families have been seriously, financially disadvantaged by the failure of the Government either to increase or to index family allowance payments. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to a statement made by Mr David Scott of the Brotherhood of St Laurence in Melbourne. It appeared in the Sydney Morning Herald of 5 January 1981. The article was headed: 'Level of family allowance linked to poverty'. In the article, Mr Scott made a number of points about the effect that this matter is having on families whose breadwinner is unemployed. The article, speaking of Mr Scott, states:</PARA>
<PARA> He said the present level of family allowances also affected working people with more than two children. </PARA>
<PARA> 'A person with a low income and more than two children is in difficulty,' he said. </PARA>
<PARA> Poverty levels set by the Institute of Applied Social and Economic Research at Melbourne University are based on a formula devised in 1966. </PARA>
<PARA>In the example of a working man with a wife and four children, the poverty level for that family according to the Institute is $195 a week. So, quite obviously, families are in dire straits if the breadwinner is on a weighted average weekly award wage and the family is a single income family. I will deal with the one income family in the third point I will make. </PARA>
<PARA> I now turn to my second point. I request the Senate to note the statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) made on the eve of the election. What did the Prime Minister say on the eve of the election? Two days before the election, on Thursday 16 October 1980, the Prime Minister made a speech in Launceston, Tasmania, in which he pledged to give back petrol rises as rebates or family allowances. The Prime Minister knows why he gave that undertaking and I know why he gave that undertaking. That undertaking was given and it received widespread publicity in the media throughout the length and breadth of Australia. The undertaking was given against the background of adverse polls which were running at that time against the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> An article appearing in the Australian of 16 October 1980 was headed: 'Fraser pledges to give back petrol price rises as rebates or family allowances: OPEC increases will fund tax cuts: Prime Minister says priority to return money to the people'. The article reads:</PARA>
<PARA> In a dramatic bid to counter the vote-winning Labor pledge of cheap petrol, the Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, last night promised to return revenue from increased petrol prices next year to the public in the shape of tax cuts or higher family allowances. </PARA>
<PARA>In the short term although a great many furphies and kites have been flown about tax cuts, the Treasurer (Mr Howard) has said that the tax cuts are not on at this time. In fact, the Prime Minister's statement exists. The revenue from the petrol price increases which occurred from 1 January this year as a result of the Government's oil parity prices must now be returned to Australian families in the form of family allowances as promised by the Prime Minister. </PARA>
<PARA> I had thought that the Prime Minister was about to take some urgent action on this matter when I read the Governor-General's Speech made when Parliament assembled for the opening of the Thirty-second Parliament on 25 November 1980 after the 1980 elections. On page 4 of the Governor-General's Speech, under the heading 'Caring for People', the Speech stated:</PARA>
<PARA> In what I have said about unemployment, youth and the economy, I have stressed my Government's concern with the human dimensions of the issues involved. It believes that the only legitimate yardstick for assessing any policy is not conformity to an ideology, not the strengthening of the state, but the effectiveness of that policy in enhancing the lives of people. This is the fundamental concern of my Government. </PARA>
<PARA>And this is the nub of the matter. The Speech went on:</PARA>
<PARA> This concerns expresses itself in a diverse range of measures to which my Government is committed:</PARA>
<PARA> It is evident in the commitment of my Government to a range of social security and welfare measures which will strengthen the family and through it the basic social fabric of this country. My Government has already introduced a number of measures designed to assist families. It will be looking closely at its policies with the objective of further enhancing the position of Australian families. </PARA>
<PARA>That Speech, read in conjunction with the promise given two days before the election, meant one thing-the Government was preparing to take action before the next Budget to honour its promise. Indeed, shortly before the recent by-elections were held, when the Cabinet was meeting in Adelaide, South Australia, a leak came from the Government concerning its intention to honour its election promise. Headlines such as '$5 Child Boost Plan' were spread across the front pages of newspapers. For example, the Herald of 10 February 1981 carried that heading creating an expectation amongst Australian families that at last the Government would honour its promise. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate again of the promise which, as I have said, was given against a background of adverse polls running against the Government and of the Labor Party's policy in respect of oil and petrol prices. I shall quote from the Australian article which states:</PARA>
<PARA> In a dramatic bid to counter the vote-winning Labor pledge of cheap petrol, the Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, last night promised to return revenue from increased petrol prices next year to the public in the shape of tax cuts or higher family allowances. </PARA>
<PARA>When one reads the fine print a little further down one will see that it refers, of course, only to increases from 1 January this year. The Prime Minister referred to returning to Australian families increased revenue from its oil levies from 1 January of this year. Let us have a look at what has happened in regard to the oil levies from 1 January this year. What has happened is this: On the Treasurer's own figures, the Government expects that the January increase in petrol prices at the pump will return to the Government an extra $170m in this half year. That money is flowing in the back door when it should be flowing out the front door in the form of increased family allowances, according to the promise of the Prime Minister, but it is not doing so. In answer to a question in the Senate on 5 March, Senator Carrick made a response which in fact concerned me very greatly. In reply to the question Senator Carrick said that he was aware of the Prime Minister's policy statement and that he had no doubt at all that it would be implemented, but he then added:</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, it would be a matter for budgetary implementation and therefore, no doubt, will be considered in the present process of putting the Budget together. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Carrick also referred to the Bass Strait oil strike in November of last year. If the Government uses that as an excuse then it is acting irresponsibly and contrary to the expressed promise made by the Prime Minister two days before the Federal election. I say this because although the shortfall in production due to that strike was $171m, the oil is still in the ground, and the Government will, at a particular stage, receive the increased oil levy when that oil comes up from the ground. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is still in the ground. The Government will get the money. The Prime Minister made the promise that any increases arising from increased petrol prices from 1 January would be passed on to Australian families. He did not say that all of the oil levy which is received from Australian crude oil would go to families. Therefore, the comment by the Leader of the Government in the Senate about the loss to the Government on oil levies because of the strike in Bass Strait is in fact irrelevant and does not relate in any way to the promise of the Prime Minister to return the increases to Australian families from January of this year. I repeat: That increase, according to the Treasurer's own figures, this half year will be $170m. What would that mean so far as family allowances are concerned? I have the statistics provided for me by the Parliamentary Library, but they are in monthly amounts. This would result in approximate increases as follows: For the first child, an increase of $5.80; for the second child, an increase of $8.30; for the third child, an increase of $10; for the fourth child an increase of $10; and for the fifth child and later children, an increase of $11.65. That is what it means and that is not yet occurring.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Families, and particularly mothers, are expecting increases in family allowances, and these are long overdue. I am indebted, frankly, to a number of women who have provided information in respect of the family. This group of women who are organised on a nation-wide basis are members of the Women's Action Alliance. These people, together with all Australian families, are concerned that the money is flowing in the back door and not going out the front door. The Government is hoarding it. I do not know the reason. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Chaney, in that same address to the IPA, stressed the importance of the family and also its importance in respect of the care and nurture of young children and the care of the elderly and the care of the sick. He implied that these functions are carried out more efficiently and effectively and less expensively by families than by the state. If families are the cheapest and the best providers of these services then it is in the nation's interest for families to function with economic security and equal opportunity. Today we had in the Senate a review of Australia's demographic trends. That review showed the increased participation by married women in the paid work force and the effect that this and other factors are having on the birth rate. This increase in the work force participation, lower family sizes and the increase in the proportion of single parent families have focused attention on the relevance of the concept of a family with a breadwinner, a dependent spouse and dependent children. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Howard, in a very interesting paper which was presented in the House of Representatives on 12 March 1981, made reference to this question of single income families. He gave a number of statistics. However, any statistics about the family really provide a snapshot of the situation at a particular time. Every family has a life cycle which starts at marriage and proceeds through child rearing to the stage when the children reach adulthood and leave the parental home. Most families will pass through the dependent wife-dependent children stage at some period in their life cycle. So the fact that at any given time the snapshot discloses that a certain percentage of families are of this type or of the other type obscures the more meaningful concept. If we look at the life cycle of families, as a movie film, we will see that most of them will move through this stage at some time or other. Having said that, what does the snapshot reveal at this time? Mr Howard, in his paper presented on 12 March, said that it is worth noting that of the total number of 3,750,000 married taxpayers, some 1,250,000 have dependent spouses. Bearing in mind that I said this is a snapshot, most families will go through that stage if we look at the cycle as a marriage movie. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am reading from Mr Howard's document in which he said that it is worth noting that of the total number of married taxpayers of 3,750,000, some 1,250,000 have a dependent spouse. That is what he said. Of course, many of the 3,750,000 married taxpayers could be men married to wives who are also taxpayers. That is the situation. I mentioned to the Senate that this is the snapshot at this point in time. Married couple families, with wives not in the work force, and with dependent children represent 30.9 per cent of all married couple families and 27 per cent of all families, including single parent families. Quite obviously, not all married couples are taxpayers. For example, there would be a large number of persons receiving social security benefits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When considering paragraph (c) of the motion that I have moved, the question arises as to the incomes of Australian families. According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics document 'Income Distribution, Australia 1978-79: Families', which is the preliminary document, in 1978-79 average annual incomes ranged from $13,280 for families with two members to $20,510 for families with six or more members. The estimated number of families and their average annual incomes, according to the Bureau, were as follows: There were 572,000 families with no income earners, and they received an income of $6,130. There were 1,174,600 families with one income earner and their average annual income was $13,460. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;'Family' is defined in the Bureau's document as having one income, two incomes or three or more incomes. The situation raised by the honourable senator does not arise at this stage until I get to the other figures regarding children. There were 1,583,100 two-income families and their average annual income at that time was $19,280. There were 406,600 families with three or more income earners and their average income was $28,410. The total number of families, according to the figures, was 3,736,900 with an average income of $16,430. What does that tell us about the two-income families? In the period of the Bureau's sample, 1978-79, average earnings per employed male unit were $11,736 per annum. One income families had an average income of $13,460, but two-income families had an average income of $19,280. The net result of that is clearly that single income families-I suppose that is prima facie self-evident-are substantially worse off than dual income families. One of the reasons for the higher participation rate of married women in the work force at present is that the single income family cannot survive. Therefore, the mother or the wife is forced, through economic circumstances, into the paid work force. I referred to that in a previous debate today. But again, it is self-evident.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me just refer again to the Bureau's figures which were released just before the election-I think I used them during the election-on 30 September 1980. A survey was done by the Bureau in Queensland and its report was entitled 'Employed Married Women in the Labour Force, Queensland, November 1979'. The ABS surveyed 184,000 married women in Queensland. Of the sample, 93,300 were responsible for one or more children under the age of 15 years. Of that group, 49 per cent give financial reasons as their main reason for working. It was interesting to note that many of them gave as their reason for working the need to pay off the mortgages on their homes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not wish to delay the Senate, but I must bring up a matter for the attention of the Minister for Social Security (Senator Chaney) and the Senate. It is an illustration of the problems that some groups in the community which have been trying to develop child care centres and which have had Government approval to do so are facing because of the action of the Government in going back on agreements concerning these centres. Tonight I will bring a specific case to the attention of the Senate and the Government. I refer to an undertaking given by the previous Minister for Social Security that the Government would fund a child care centre adjacent to the Australian Government Clothing Factory in Coburg, Victoria, for parents working in the factory and in nearby work places.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The plans for this centre began about three years ago when a group of Italian women based in Coburg, recognising the importance of child care, particularly for women in manufacturing industry, organised lunch time factory meetings and received overwhelming support for their proposal. They found the need of the area to be urgent and of considerable proportions. The initial survey showed that mothers in the five factories visited could make use of a child care centre for 194 children. The working party formed was later broadened to include several unions to which the women belonged, the Centre for Urban Research and Action, the Working Women's Centre and the Coburg City Council. The then Minister for Industry and Commerce, Senator Sir Robert Cotton, claimed that the Government as the employer could not provide the centre in the clothing factory but offered adjacent land if the Coburg City Council would sponsor the project, a proposal to which the Council agreed. A submission was placed with the Victorian Office of Child Care in July 1978, almost three years ago. On 9 March 1979, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, as Minister for Social Security, approved in principle the submission for the building of a 60-place child care centre to cost some $250,000 on the agreed site by the clothing factory. Discussions were held with Vicrail regarding access and with Mr Edmonds of the Department of Housing and Construction, who was to be the architect for the project. Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle wrote on 27 August last year to Mr G. Harman, the Town Clerk of Coburg, assuring the Council that there was no proposal to withdraw the Commonwealth commitment, though she said that if problems could not be resolved she may have to look at an alternative proposal. She said:</PARA>
<PARA> The extent of unmet need for day care in the area is clearly evident, particularly in relation to work related child care for migrant women and the 'Galbally Report'. </PARA>
<PARA>On 16 January this year the Minister for Industry and Commerce, Sir Philip Lynch, agreed to the lease of the Gaffney Street Community Child Care Centre, and there appeared to be no barrier to its going ahead. However, a month ago, Mr Harman, the Town Clerk, indicated that the Department of Social Security was planning a retreat from the Commonwealth's commitment. </PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Social Security claimed then and I have no doubt will claim later that the reason was that the cost has gone up considerably since Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle approved the project. He was therefore seeking the Coburg group's assistance in developing an alternative proposal. The Coburg group does not want an alternative proposal. It has worked for three years in good faith to get a work-based centre close to the factories. The scheme was developed carefully after consultations with members of the community in general, with workers and with unions. It was a project to which a Minister for Social Security gave approval. </PARA>
<PARA> In child care matters organisations which enter agreements with the Government are always held to the letter of any funded proposal. Any attempt by organisations to modify their proposals to any extent frequently put these projects at risk. We should ask why the Minister should not expect the agreed proposal to be the one that the community wants, not a different model presented by the Government on the eve of the work-based centre's construction. Why should there be one rule for those who seek funding and gain funding and another for the Minister and the Government? I suggest that there is ample evidence, admitted by the Government, of the need for these centres in general and this case in particular. I remind the Senate and the Minister of the findings of the research report for International Women's Year entitled: 'But I wouldn't want my wife to work here'. It was a tragic report on migrant women in the work force. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> They-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the women interviewed at the time-</PARA>
<PARA>stated that because of economic and survival pressures they had to work; because of poor education and lack of English they had to work in factories and this meant they had to leave their children. They knew little about child-minding services which may or may not have existed near their homes. Many had few friends or relatives and told us they could not understand why factories did not have child-care services as they did in Europe or South America. They were forced to make unsatisfactory child care arrangements which caused enormous psychological worries and often physical accidents. </PARA>
<PARA>The Jackson report on manufacturing industry looked at both industry and the workers in industry. It stated that child care facilities were one of the factors that impinged on the effectiveness and quality of work life and noted that so far few efforts had been made to allow people and industry to reap potential benefits from new approaches in such areas. I suggest very strongly that we should support the right of the working party of the Gaffney Street Child Care Centre not to have its new approach-a work-based centre in the environment of the clothing factory-scuttled by the Government's change of mind. The Government accepted the recommendations of the Galbally report on migrant services and programs. That report made specific recommendations in this area. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> We recommend that the current child-care policy be reviewed and that the Government give priority to funding child-care facilities at places of work, jointly managed by the employers and the employees or unions. The employer should meet part or all of the capital cost with the Commonwealth providing assistance for equipment and recurrent costs. </PARA>
<PARA>The Gaffney Street project falls within these guidelines. It is exactly the sort of community and worker enterprise which should be encouraged. Governments cannot encourage projects like this by changing their mind right at the death knell after projects have been approved and people have worked hard and vigorously and have sacrificed much in many cases to get something off the ground. I do not believe that the Government should at this late stage cancel its support for the project. I do not believe that it should be offering alternative proposals which the organisation believes are second best. I think it should be held to the guarantee that it gave to the people who have worked so hard. The Opposition opposes this sort of backdown, endorses the proposal of the working party and hopes that the Government will again change its mind and support these people. </PARA>

<PARA>Office of Child Care</PARA>
<PARA>26 February 1981 Dear Mr Harman,</PARA>
<PARA> On 27 August 1980, Senator the Hon. Dame Margaret Guilfoyle OBE, wrote to you in relation to the proposed Gaffney Street Child Care Centre. At that time, Senator Guilfoyle suggested that because of problems associated with the development of this project in the grounds of the Commonwealth Clothing Factory, consideration should be given to the development of an alternative proposal. I am now seeking your assistance in developing an alternative proposal. </PARA>
<PARA> The overriding problem with the proposal as it now stands and one that renders its completion unachievable, is that of cost. On current estimates, the capital grant of $250,000 approved in principle by Senator Guilfoyle in February 1979 would now be inadequate for the construction of a new 60 place child care centre (estimated cost for the completion of this centre could be as high as $350,000 to $400,000). In addition, I have been informed that the centre would be required to pay market rental for the land on which the building would be constructed, and this would place an intolerable financial burden on the operation of the centre. </PARA>
<PARA> Discussions with union groups whose members would benefit from the service indicate that they would be prepared to contribute only $15,000 towards outdoor equipment and landscaping costs. Accordingly, it would appear that at this stage an additional $100,000 to $150,000 might be required to construct the centre, plus additional recurrent assistance over and above that normally required for operational expenses to cover the cost of land rental. Additional funds would also be required to meet the cost of security fencing that will be required by the clothing factory. </PARA>
<PARA> An alternative proposal and one I understand has been raised with you by staff of the Melbourne office of the Department of Social Security, would involve the purchase of two houses near the clothing factory and their renovation to make them suitable for child care. This is the normal procedure associated with the development of centres now that the cost of constructing new centres has increased so substantially. Additional information relating to the purchase/renovation method for the development of child care centres can be obtained from the Melbourne office of the Department of Social Security. The contact officer is Mr P. Harris, Assistant Director Child Care, telephone (03) 669 6302. </PARA>
<PARA> I assure you that the decision to vary the earlier proposal in no way represents a departure from the commitment entered into by Senator Guilfoyle, but appears to be the only method by which a viable child care service can still be developed in the area within the limit of funds available. Accordingly I am seeking your full support in developing an alternative proposal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My advice-this is referred to in the letter-was that the possibility of an alternative proposal was raised not only by Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle when she wrote to Mr Harman on 27 August 1980 but also with him by staff of the Melbourne office of the Department of Social Security. The reason for the alternative proposal being canvassed was, again as was indicated by Senator Grimes, that it would appear that the cost of the proposal had risen from the original level of $250,000, which was the figure of in principle approval by my predecessor, Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, to an estimate of from $350,000 to $400,000. In the view of the officers dealing with the matter this warranted its re-examination, a view with which, on the basis of the facts as I know them, I agree.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will examine the remarks made by Senator Grimes. I will of course consider a telegram which I received today from workers from the clothing factory who advised me that they had held lunch-time meetings on the matter and were seeking the building of a child care centre under the guidelines of the original proposal. I will advise Senator Grimes in due course of the results of that re-examination. It remains a fact that, if the funds made available for child care are spent in dollops of $400,000 as against $250,000, there will be fewer centres built and there will be fewer children serviced. It would be my general intention in the administration of this and other programs to seek the most economical solution consistent with the interests of the people we are trying to help. I think that Senator Grimes acknowledged that the Government had admitted the need of the children involved in this case. I stress to the Senate that any dispute revolves around the means by which we are going to meet the need and not the meeting of the need itself. I will undertake to have the matter carefully examined, bearing in mind the sort of principle that I have just mentioned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (4) My department is not aware of understaffing in Family Day Care Schemes in Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA> The present formula for funding Family Day Care Schemes was determined by the former Minister for Social Security in December 1976. The levels of subsidy have not been increased since that time.</PARA>
<PARA> Consideration of the level of funding will occur in the budget context.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The special needs subsidies available under the formula are specifically available to assist families in financial need to pay the fees for care. Families' eligibility is determined in accordance with a means test. The formula does not provide separate special operational assistance for special need groups such as migrants, handicapped, and economically disadvantaged people. Normally, schemes are able to cater for the needs of these groups using the special needs subsidy.</PARA>
<PARA> Schemes catering for a high proportion of children qualifying for special needs subsidy may apply for additional support over and above the level prescribed in the formula. This option is clearly outlined in the funding guidelines distributed to schemes.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, any scheme catering for disabled children may apply for separate operational grants for specific provision for the needs of those children-for example, payment of a professional therapist, appropriate renovations to premises or the purchase of special equipment. Sponsors would need to demonstrate the need for such special assistance.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) It appears that local government sponsors are able to make a significant contribution to schemes by providing assistance in kind, such as office space free of rental, administrative services, et cetera. However, as stated in the 'Report on the Review of Child Care Services in Tasmania', some Councils, rather than providing support to the schemes they sponsor, charge the schemes from the grants received from the Commonwealth for any Council assistance. I understand that this practice also occurs in other States.</PARA>
<PARA> In these cases local government sponsored schemes are at no advantage compared to community-based schemes. However, it is the Commonwealth's expectation that sponsors, whether community or Council based, make some contribution to the schemes they operate.</PARA>

<PARA> 1. FIBEX (First International BIOMASS Experiment) is the first data collecting effort of the International Program of Biological Investigation of Marine Antarctic Systems and Stocks (BIOMASS).</PARA>
<PARA> FIBEX will concentrate on the study of krill which is a key component in the biological food chain of the Southern Oceans. Krill being the lowest animal in the food chain, forms the diet of larger animals feeding in Antarctic waters. The current series of experiments to be undertaken on FIBEX contain the following elements:</PARA>
<PARA> an investigation of the distribution and abundance of krill using hydro acoustic echo sounding equipment and associated trawling;</PARA>
<PARA> determination of the distribution and abundance of phytoplankton (krill food);</PARA>
<PARA> oceanographic studies to monitor those chemical, physical and biological variables which may influence krill distribution, behaviour and life history; and</PARA>
<PARA> studies on krill swarms, where possible, to investigate their structure, behaviour and interaction with abiotic and biotic environment.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. FIBEX commenced in February 1981 and will operate continuously for one month. The principal regions concerned are the Scotia Sea adjacent to the Antarctic Peninsula and off-shore from the Australian Antarctic Territory.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Argentina, Australia, Chile, France, Federal Republic of Germany, Japan, South Africa, United Kingdom, United States of America and the Soviet Union are participating in FIBEX.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. Provision of $1.2m was made in the 1980-81 Budget for modifications to the M.V. Nella Dan, chartered by the Australian Government, and for the purchase and installation of sophisticated scientific equipment, to enable Australia to participate in FIBEX. Operational and ancillary costs will bring Australia's total expenditure on FIBEX to around $2m.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Foreign Minister has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In general, the policy is to assist, after due investigation, Australian citizens who are in distressed circumstances abroad. The assistance takes the form of the cost of passage to Australia at the cheapest rate available, together with a minimum of funds for incidental costs en route, provided that satisfactory guarantees are furnished by the repatriate and relatives or friends residing in Australia that the full cost to the Government will subsequently be refunded. Wherever possible a deposit against the expenses of repatriation is first obtained from the repatriate and/or the guarantor. Each approach is dealt with on its merits and there is no automatic entitlement to this assistance. Under current guidelines, the grant of assistance is considered more favourably if it is sought on behalf of a person who is:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) in difficulties through unavoidable misfortune (applications from persons proceeding overseas without making provision for their return journey are not usually given favourable consideration);</PARA>
<PARA> (b) a person who left Australia at a comparatively recent date with the intention of returning within a reasonable period (applications from persons who left Australia with the intention of settling abroad or who have been overseas for a considerable number of years are not usually considered favourably);</PARA>
<PARA> (c) separated from family or relatives in Australia, provided that relatives or friends residing in Australia who can assist financially, contribute to the cost of repatriation and given satisfactory written guarantees of repayment in full of the balance of all costs to the Government.</PARA>
<PARA> Disbursements and costs recouped for each of the last five years are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA>Year</PARA>
<PARA>Expenditure Repayment</PARA>
<PARA>$ $ 1976  19,519.19 7,359.56 1977  27,146.90 17,072.12 1978  18,201.25 7,290.46 1979  40,569.86 12,672.87 1980  46,861.36 3,492.17</PARA>
<PARA> It is the policy of the Government to recover expenditure to the extent practicable. In many cases Australians with limited means repay loans by instalments over an extended period. Amounts shown in the 'repayments' column above often do not therefore relate to the expenditure shown for the same year, and recoveries of expenditure shown in the table may be expected to continue for some time into the future.</PARA>

<PARA> Is the Minister aware that the Roche Institute of Marine Pharmacology will close on 1 July 1981 and that this will have a serious and significant impact on Australian science in general.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator McAuliffe also asked if I would investigate this situation to see that Australia's efforts in marine science and pharmacological research are not impaired by the Roche decision. I undertook to refer the matter to the Minister for Science and Technology for comment.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has now advised me that he was aware of the Hoffman-La Roche decision. On 14 January 1981 Dr J. Baker, the Director of the Institute wrote to Mr Thomson, informing him that the Swiss parent company had decided to close the Roche Institute by 31 June 1981.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Foreign Minister has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's questions:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) During my visit to Indonesia in November 1980 I raised with the Indonesian Foreign Minister the allegations concerning the fate of Roger East which had emerged in October 1980. The allegations had previously been drawn to the attention of the Indonesian authorities by our Embassy in Jakarta. The Indonesian Foreign Minister promised that a reply would be given in the near future.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) and (b) A reply has been received from the Indonesian Government. This denies that there was any truth in the allegations about the fate of Roger East which had been drawn to the attention of the Indonesian authorities by the Australian Embassy. When passing this reply to our Embassy, the Indonesian authorities also said that they were unable to shed any further light on the fate of Mr East.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The truth of the information given to the Australian Embassy in Lisbon in October 1980 has been denied by the Indonesian Government (see (1) above).</PARA>
<PARA> (3) No. It is not normal diplomatic practice to release the text of confidential official communications between Governments. However, the main points of the Indonesian reply are set out in (1) above. The account of the circumstances of the fate of Roger East in the Age of 28 October 1980 is substantially the same as information given to the Australian Embassy in Lisbon.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) When it became clear that fighting in East Timor was intensifying, the Government arranged for the evacuation of Australians on 3 December 1975. Mr East was invited to join the evacuation flight, but declined.</PARA>
<PARA> Since then, there have been varying accounts of the fate of Mr East. In the light of these accounts, the Government has sought verification of what might have happened to him. First enquiries were made within days of the attack on Dili. Subsequent enquiries included the following:</PARA>
<PARA> At the Australian Government's request, the United Nations Special Representative, Mr Winspeare Guicciardi, who visited East Timor in January 1976, made enquiries about Mr East's whereabouts.</PARA>
<PARA> The question of Mr East's fate has been raised by the Australian Minister for Foreign Affairs with his Indonesian counterpart on several occasions since 1975.</PARA>

The Ombudsman commented that these figures could be subject to minor inaccuracies as some complaints are about more than one kind of benefit. In addition to written complaints the Ombudsman received 1182 oral complaints about the Department of Social Security. The Ombudsman's records do not enable him readily to categorise the subject matter of oral complaints. The Ombudsman had jurisdiction to investigate complaints in all categories mentioned, and to report if he concluded that there had been defective administration which warranted it.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Ombudsman has not reported to me in respect of any complaints concerning the administration of social security benefits received by him during 1979-80.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Health has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The provision of health services (which include preventive medicine programs) in the Northern Territory is the responsibility of the Northern Territory Government. In response to inquiries made of the Northern Territory Department of Health on this matter, it was indicated that a comprehensive preventive medicine program is implemented through that Department's extensive network of community health centres.</PARA>
<PARA> In this program, particular emphasis is placed on maternal and child health, and on communicable disease control. In relation to maternal and child health, the Department takes antenatal care to expectant mothers in some of the remotest parts of the country and, despite the problems of distance and isolation, maintains a level of immunisation coverage among the children which would compare favourably with coverage elsewhere in Australia. In relation to communicable disease control, special mention is made of leprosy, tuberculosis, trachoma and syphilis. Details of these can be found in the annual report of the Northern Territory Department of Health.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The preventive medicine programs of the Territory's Department of Health are extended to all citizens regardless of race, although the level of activity in any particular component will vary from one community to another according to local needs. To cater specifically for Aboriginal needs, the Department also has a program of training and employment of Aboriginal Health Workers. The latter are Aboriginal people chosen by their communities to undergo training which enables them to provide both preventive and curative services for their own communities.</PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the Commonwealth Government provides finance for several Aboriginal-controlled community health services in the Territory. Although these are mainly treatment-oriented, they provide a preventive medicine component wherever possible.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 25 February 1981 (Hansard, page 80) Senator Mason asked me, as Minister representing the Prime Minister, a question without notice concerning alleged activities of the United States Central Intelligence Agency in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has supplied the following information for answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators should be aware that some sixteen or seventeen enterprises include the words 'Nugan Hand' in their name. Not all are Australian registered and not all appear to have operated within Australia. For instance the Nugan Hand Bank, to which the Leader of the Opposition referred in a question to me on 5 March (House of Representatives, Hansard, page 452), was registered in the Cayman Islands. Nugan Hand Limited, to which Mr Justice Woodward-the NSW Royal Commissioner into Drug Trafficking-referred in his Second Report, was incorporated in Australia. Nugan Hand operated through an intricate web of corporations in Australia and overseas.</PARA>
<PARA> Setting aside sensationalist reports and speculation, the Commonwealth Government is most concerned about evidence of apparently illegal activities by the Nugan Hand group. The Commonwealth Government acted speedily after Mr Justice Woodward recommended that an appropriate law enforcement group should investigate the Nugan Hand group, arising from evidence of its involvement with criminals known to be themselves involved in drug trafficking.</PARA>
<PARA> I took the initiative of approaching the Premier of New South Wales on 26 August 1980, seeking the widening of the terms of reference of the New South Wales/Commonwealth Joint Task Force on Drug Trafficking to enable it to investigate breaches by Nugan Hand of Commonwealth laws as well as of State laws. This special police group is investigating whether there was any criminal activity particularly drug-related, in or affecting Australia, by any persons connected with Nugan Hand activities, and, if so, identifying such persons so that appropriate action could be initiated.</PARA>
<PARA> I also offered the assistance of the Commonwealth to the New South Wales Corporate Affairs Commission in its separate inquiry into the financial affairs of Nugan Hand.</PARA>
<PARA> Turning to allegations of CIA involvement with Nugan Hand, as I informed the Leader of the Opposition on 5 March, any operations of the United States in Australia would be declared to the Australian Government and consequently agreed by the Australian Government. Officers from U.S. agencies working in Australia are declared to the Australian authorities and work with various Australian agencies.</PARA>
<PARA> In this connection I draw the attention of honourable senators to my statement made on 24 May 1977 (House of Representatives Hansard, pages 1695 and 1696) in which I reassured the Parliament that on review the activities of the United States Government in Australia had been found to be fully consistent with the interests and policies of the Australian Government and people. The Government is satisfied with the assurances received from elements of its own administration and from the United States Government, that neither the United States Government nor its representatives were involved in improper or inappropriate activities here. Beyond these general assurances, satisfactory specific assurances on this matter were obtained last year from Australian authorities and the United States Government.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has no evidence that the Nugan Hand group was co-operating with the security services of any foreign power to interfere in Australia's domestic affairs.</PARA>
<PARA> If the honourable senator has any evidence relating to the affairs of the Nugan Hand group I invite him to provide it to the appropriate authorities.</PARA>
<PARA> It has been the policy of successive Australian Governments neither to confirm nor deny speculation and assertions about the Joint Defence Space Research Facility.</PARA>

<PARA> The decision to establish the inquiry was announced on 19 August 1980, in the Budget Speech, when I also indicated that the Government expected the inquiry to report before the 1981-82 Budget. The Inquiry's terms of reference and composition were announced on 18 September 1980. At that time I also indicated that the inquiry would be making and announ- cing its own arrangements for the receipt of evidence.

<PARA> The inquiry called for submissions through widespread advertisements in national and country newspapers around the middle of December 1980 and stated 6 February 1981 as the closing date for the receipt of submissions.</PARA>
<PARA> There was thus an interval of over five months between the first announcement of the inquiry and the closing day for submissions and I believe this period provided adequate time for interested parties to consider, prepare and lodge their submissions.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) The provision of health services in the Northern Territory is the responsibility of the Northern Territory Government. In response to inquiries on this matter, the Northern Territory Department of Health has advised that trachoma is recognised as a serious eye health problem in many Aboriginal communities in the Northern Territory. It is generally accepted that infection in childhood results in eye changes which lead to a susceptibility to recurrent infection and, in some instances, to serious eye damage in adult life. Accordingly, the trachoma control program is being concentrated on children in Aboriginal communities. The program is based on the mass prophylactic use of oily tetracycline eyedrops and is being implemented through the extensive network of community health centres operated by the Northern Territory Department of Health in cooperation with local schools. Eye problems in adults are dealt with in the community health centres and, where necessary, consultations with specialist ophthalmologists are arranged.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) (a) and (b) In the areas where trachoma is hyperendemic, it is too early to determine if there has been a reduction in incidence. However, recent surveys have indicated that there has been a definite decrease in the severity of infections. In this regard, it must be recognised that inadequate community water supplies plays a significant part in the incidence and prevalence of trachoma and the Northern Territory Government has been actively promoting a five-year plan to upgrade water supplies and other basic services in Aboriginal communities. The importance of environmental factors was also stressed in the report of the National Trachoma and Eye Health Program, the recommendations of which included the need for improvement of such factors as housing, water, sewerage and garbage disposal facilities, in addition to improved treatment programs.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator Durack</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 24 February 1981 (Hansard, page 12) Senator Evans asked me the following questions without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Is it the case that character assessments are presently taking place in the Attorney-General's Department whereby all employees, including those who have no access to classified government documents, are being checked for such apparently irrelevant or ill-defined characteristics as 'undeclared homosexuality' or a 'loose tongue'? By what authority, legislative or administrative, are these checks being carried out? Are they being carried out or will they be carried out by any other department? If such action is not directly connected with the protection of highly sensitive classified material, what is the policy underlying such checks?</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Having agreed to further investigations, will the Attorney do two things: Firstly, undertake to table in Parliament forms that persons are being required to fill in and also any supporting documentation governing the procedures now applicable and, secondly, will he tell us what the fate of any member of his Department who refused to give consent to this procedure would be in practice?</PARA>
<PARA> The answers to the honourable senator's questions are:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) For the purpose of this answer officers in my Department and throughout the rest of the Public Service may be put into two categories.</PARA>
<PARA> The first category consists of officers who have or may have access to classified material. In respect of these officers, my Department obtains a security assessment from the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. This clearance is obtained in accordance with the new security procedures adopted following the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Act 1979. In addition, after receiving the consent of the officer, my Department obtains from the Australian Federal Police details of any criminal charges involving the officer pending before a Court together with details of any conviction or finding of guilt which has been recorded against him. Alternatively, the officer is permitted to obtain a certificate as to those matters from the Police Force of each State or Territory in which he resided in the past five years. These procedures are, I understand, followed by all Departments.</PARA>
<PARA> The second category consists of officers who do not generally have access to classified information. The Department does not obtain a security assessment in respect of these officers. However, before a person is appointed to the Public Service, my Department, with the consent of the person concerned, obtains details of any criminal charges pending before a Court together with details of any conviction or finding of guilt recorded against him. Alternatively, the person may obtain a certificate in relation to those matters from the appropriate Police Force. I understand this is the practice followed in all Departments for officers in this category.</PARA>
<PARA> For a short period recently, my Department commenced to apply the procedure used on appointment of the second category of officers to all serving officers. The purpose of this was to provide maximum flexibility in the future deployment of staff.</PARA>
<PARA> The Permanent Head has now concluded that this procedure will not be generally applied to serving officers who are in the second category but may be applied in the case of promotion or transfer of officers to positions of special trust within the Department.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Copies of the forms that persons have been asked to fill in are set out below.</PARA>
<PARA> In the case of an officer in the first category, a person declining to fill in the necessary forms may be regarded as ineligible for promotion or appointment to the position. If the person is already occupying the position, consideration would need to be given to whether he should be transferred to a position not involving such access.</PARA>
<PARA> In the second category, a person refusing to consent to the AFP providing the statement or to provide the certificate from the relevant Police Force mentioned above might be regarded as ineligible for appointment. As explained above, in relation to serving officers, the question will arise in the future only in relation to positions of special trust. A refusal to follow the procedure mentioned may result in ineligibility for promotion or transfer to such a position.</PARA>
