<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to Senator Carrick, partly as Minister for National Development and Energy and partly as Minister representing the Treasurer. Is it a fact that the Treasury submission to the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources identified Australia's steaming coal deposits as a resource whose development could well attract some type of resources tax? Is it a fact that the Queensland Government has accepted an offer by the Winchester consortium led by the British Petroleum company to pay a resources tax in the form of extra levies on steaming coal shipments? Is it also a fact that British Petroleum Australia Ltd is wholly owned by the multinational BP organisation, which is in turn 46 per cent owned by the British Government? Is it therefore a fact that, as a result of the Federal Government's failure to levy a resources tax on behalf of all the Australian people, the high profitability of this venture will be carved up between the Queensland Government and shareholders, including the United Kingdom Government? Why does this Government put the interests of the Queensland and British treasuries before its own?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, sometimes I have some difficulty in understanding some of the honourable senators opposite. Senator Tate will appreciate that submissions have been received from about five departments in recent days. All of them are voluminous and all of them need very careful study. I have to say to him that, whilst I would like to respond-and I will in due course-to that part of his question which relates to my own knowledge of the matter, I have made only a superficial scansion of it as yet. I am aware of the Queensland Government's granting of the Winchester franchise. I am aware that BP has a significant holding in it. I am aware that the British Government has a holding in BP. In fact, in London not so long ago, I discussed that matter with BP. I am aware that the Queensland Government has put on a series of charges, particularly rail freight charges, that I imagine are resource taxes. Fundamentally, the people of Queensland, and therefore the people of Australia, will benefit through the taxation that accrues upon the resources produced being redirected to them. The Senate is aware of the Commonwealth Government's stated attitude to a resource tax. With regard to the position of the Commonwealth Government at this moment, I have nothing more to add to what the Treasurer has said. I regret that I have not read that document. I will do so.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PJ4">Senator TEAGUE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I bring to the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for Transport a campaign being waged by the South Australian region of the Australian Road Federation to urge increased Commonwealth grants for roads. In particular, I note two ARF claims. One is that the Commonwealth Government is reducing, in real terms, the money available to States for road construction and maintenance. The other is that South Australia's share of Commonwealth road grants has declined steadily since 1960 from 11.3 per cent to 8.5 per cent. I ask the Minister: Are these claims true? Will the Minister give further consideration to so applying a liberal federalism approach to road funding that funding for State roads will be and will be seen to be a matter for State government decision and State government accountability to the public?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="555" SPEAKER="Messner Sen The Hon A.J." NAMEID="9I4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="VETERANS' AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can advise Senator Teague that apparently the figures which were cited by him in his question and which originated from the Australian Road Federation are substantially correct. However, the figures cited in relation to the claim of a reduction in real terms are another matter because it does not seem that they have been prepared on a valid basis. The Minister for Transport, I think last year, announced that the Commonwealth would provide grants totalling $3,650m to the various States and the Northern Territory for road works over the five years from 1980-81 to 1984-85. The annual apportionment of these grants involves annual percentage increases of over 11 per cent in 1980-81, 9 per cent in 1981-82, 7 per cent in 1982-83 and 6 per cent in 1983-84 and in 1984-85. These increases take into account both inflation expectations and the responsible economic policies that the Government is pursuing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Mr President, let me give honourable senators a little bit of history on this matter. Prior to 1969, Commonwealth road grants to the States were distributed on the basis of a formula which attached equal weighting to area, population and the number of registered motor vehicles. But since then, the allocation of grants amongst the States has been gradually brought into line with the assessments of the relative road needs undertaken by the former Commonwealth Bureau of Roads. In this context, the proportion of the Commonwealth grants going to South Australia has been in line with the share recommended by that Bureau. As to the advocation of the federalism approach to road funding, Commonwealth roads assistance arrangements to apply after 30 June 1981 are still being considered by the Federal Government.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Minister for National Development and Energy, follows the question asked by my colleague Senator Tate. I ask the Minister: Is it fair to assume that it is the Government's belief that a tax on resources at the Commonwealth level would endanger investment decisions by mining companies? Has the Government made any comparative study of resource taxes imposed by other countries and the effects on mining investment by foreign companies in those countries from which it would draw that conclusion? Is it the view of the Government that a State-imposed resource tax would not inhibit development whereas a federally-imposed resource tax would inhibit development? In asking this question, I refer to a matter raised by Senator Tate, namely, the rail levy in Queensland. I also refer to the very high wage levels paid by the Utah company in its coal developments in Queensland and ask: Is not that, in a sense, an imposition by some body other than the Commonwealth Government of a kind of resource rental tax on that company?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="556" SPEAKER="Carrick Sen The Hon J.L." NAMEID="2U4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is a very healthy thing that there are discussions throughout Australia at the moment on the whole concept of how the individual Australian family can benefit from resources. In the concept of us all seeking to find an answer to that, I think that the dialogue is good, both at the Senate committee level and in probing in Parliament. I believe that studies have been made by the Treasury and the Government of the various resource-type taxes levied by other countries. The Government has, in its own judgment and with the knowledge of the impact of its own taxation at this moment, made the decision that it does not propose to levy such a tax. It has the view that its range of taxes, at the moment, are equitable and are the mix that is likely to create the best yield for Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is true-Senator Button has made a useful point-that the States' imposing of a resources tax is having an economic impact. It would be silly to deny it; it is true. The States are sovereign and they are entitled to levy those taxes. They levy a variety of indirect taxes with or without any judgment by the Commonwealth as to whether those taxes are good or not. I also acknowledge that the high wage levels of the Utah company are a method of distribution of resources. It may well be that the Commonwealth and the States will have discussions at Premiers Conference level on various taxes, and on their nature and impact. This will have to be done over the years if we are to proceed as a Commonwealth. We are a federation. Inside that there are likely to be differences and aberrations. I acknowledge that.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator BUTTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I wish to ask a supplementary question. Firstly, if, as the Minister says, the States are sovereign in these matters-of course they are-and are able to impose what is effectively a resource rental tax, have there been any discussions at the Commonwealth-State level in relation to the Federal-State financial arrangements which would take into account the position of those States not capable of imposing any form of resource rental tax because they have no mining development? Secondly, if there is a study of overseas experience in relation to resource rental tax of which the Government has taken account, will the Minister undertake to table at least a summary of what that study reveals?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="556" SPEAKER="Carrick Sen The Hon J.L." NAMEID="2U4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="NATIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND ENERGY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Again I acknowledge that these are useful probes. The whole question of the financing of the Commonwealth and the States is coming up for review at the next Premiers Conference which, I think, is scheduled to be held in a month or more, before the present financial agreement guarantees expire. There will be a total look at financing. Senator Button will know that the Premiers have met and made some recommendations. Inevitably, I think, the Commonwealth and the States will look at the whole field of taxation. I cannot predict whether there will be discussions as to the impact of resources tax. I imagine that there would be in the free flow of debate at the Premiers Conference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As to the second part of the honourable senator's first question, the Commonwealth Grants Commission has as its primary objective the question of equalisation. Undoubtedly one of its fundamental headaches and problems will be to look at these new and emerging taxes, and the yields that States can have, and to see what may be done for others. Honourable senators must bear in mind that the Commission is at present undertaking a major Australia-wide look at equalisation. Senator Button will know this. He will also know that the basis of it is to bring other States to the standard of Victoria and New South Wales. It may well be that that will have to be looked at in the future and that there will be a substitution of Queensland and Western Australia for the purposes of those kinds of values; but the equalisation would be fundamental.</PARA>
<PARA> I cannot say whether there is any one document dealing with this matter. I draw the attention of Senator Button to a previous inquiry by, I think, Senator Thomas's Committee, the Senate Standing Committee on National Resources, which asked my Department for some objective statements on resource taxes. I think it tabled a document which canvassed the pros and cons of the matter. If the honourable senator seeks further information, I will be happy to provide it to him.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TS7">Senator THOMAS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs. I refer to a question asked on 26 February by Senator Puplick regarding the importation of gold chain in continuous lengths in order to avoid the 30 per cent extra duty. The Minister stated in his answer that representatives of the jewellery industry had provided the Department of Industry and Commerce with detailed information on the situation, which was being examined as a matter of urgency to determine whether the level of assistance for local industry should be referred to the Industries Assistance Commission. Does the 1978 IAC report on jewellery and other precious metal ware cover the situation, therefore precluding the need for an additional inquiry? Will the Minister consider the findings of that report sufficient for a speedy decision to be made?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that, although the goods which Senator Thomas referred to-that is, continuous gold chain-were included in the general reference covering a wide variety of jewellery, precious metal and other items given to the Industries Assistance Commission at the time, in fact no evidence was presented to the IAC in respect of continuous gold chain. The IAC approach was to recommend minimum duty rates in cases where there was no known local production. Of course, the IAC report was considered by the Government in the normal manner as a result of recommendations which the Commission laid down. However, for those reasons the IAC report is not considered sufficient to enable the Government to deal with the present situation, no evidence having been given by local manufacturers. Therefore, as indicated previously in answer to Senator Puplick's question, the importation of chain in continuous lengths at minimum duty rates is being examined by the Department as a matter of urgency to see whether the matter should be referred to the IAC for further inquiry and report.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I direct my two-part question to the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. It deals with the complex question of the acquisition of Australian citizenship. By way of preface, I refer to the fact that an Australian national soccer team played in North and South Korea some years ago. The players wore the green and gold jersey but travelled on British and Irish passports. My colleague, Senator Douglas McClelland, would be aware of this. The government of the day cut corners in order to give the players Australian citizenship; otherwise they would have been disqualified from playing. But that is water under the bridge. Has Sir Arthur George been told repeatedly what the Australian citizenship requirements are? It is not a question of football mercenaries wanting to cut corners. As in the Boden case, just what is being done to convince the Australian Soccer Federation that every time there is an overseas tour it must plan ahead and tell players what Australian citizenship is all about? Secondly, I refer to another case-a sadder one-the Robyn Shaw case. It involves a 13-year-old girl and the problem of the wife marrying a second time and Australia apparently not recognising the parental control of the second husband, which means that the girl is denied Australian citizenship. Will the Minister take this matter on board too because, obviously, some minor adjustment could meet this everyday occurrence?</PARA></TALK.START>

I have some general knowledge only in relation to the soccer players who, perhaps at the last minute before leaving Australia, have had difficulty in obtaining Australian citizenship. It seems to be a reasonable proposition that they should plan and prepare for these tours and obtain citizenship in good time.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Communications. Has the Minister seen the report in today's Australian of evidence given to the Norris inquiry into ownership and control of newspapers in Victoria? I refer to that part of the evidence given by Mr Roger Wilson, the secretary of the Victorian branch of the Seamen's Union and a member of the National Committee of the Communist Party of Australia, in which he said that, during the early 1970s, apart from his present positions he was also a member of the Melbourne Moratorium Campaign Committee; that that Committee did not believe that the Age newspaper was reporting the moratorium campaign in a sympathetic way-I quote Mr Wilson: 'In general we were not very happy in terms of the reporting . . . throughout the nation about our involvement in Vietnam'-and that the Seamen's Union felt it necessary to apply a little pressure to the Age. Mr Wilson claimed that a deputation from the Seamen's Union put it to the management of the Age that, unless its reporting became more sympathetic, its supply of newsprint might well be withdrawn. The newsprint came mainly from Tasmania. According to Mr Wilson's evidence, this caused the reporting of the moratorium suddenly to improve. I ask: Does this evidence before the Norris inquiry put at risk the credibility of the freedom of the Press in this country? If so, what action can be taken to establish the truth or otherwise of the evidence given?</PARA></TALK.START>

Has the Government a firm and unequivocal undertaking from the United States that under no circumstances will B52 bombers carry nuclear weapons over Australia? What monitoring arrangements, other than taking the word of the United States military, has the Government made to ensure that the United States sticks to its agreement? Is it fair to assume from the inclusion of sub-paragraph (VII) of the agreement, which allows for changes in the agreement after consultation, and sub-paragraph (VIII), which refers to our commitment under the Treaty on the Non-proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, that the United States at least has in contemplation the possibility of the aircraft carrying nuclear weapons and has discussed that matter with Mr Street and with the Government?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Prime Minister made it clear that the agreement between the Australian Government and the United States Administration would be that the aircraft staging through Darwin under the arrangements set out for surveillance flights and navigation training would be unarmed and carry no bombs; and there will be no qualifications to that. The Government has looked at the possibility that another nation may wish to raise some other problems as time goes on. It has said that no changes can occur in this situation without consultation and, therefore, without this Government's having the sovereign right to make a decision. This Government has made a clear decision not to permit bombs, nuclear devices or any armament on these aircraft.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the great values of an alliance such as the ANZUS treaty and one of the great values we learned from events in 1942 and 1943 is that there must be a strong working partnership and mutual trust. I would feel very sad if there were a suggestion of bad faith between the governments of the United States and Australia. To my recollection there has never been any evidence of bad faith in anything to which the United States of America has committed itself with regard to this country. I think it is a very good start in defence co-partnerships to presume the goodwill and honesty of one's partner. Indeed, the people of Australia will acknowledge with immense gratitude the co-partnership of the United States from 1942 to 1945. Indeed, the very survival of Australia derived from that. The people of Australia understand that and will applaud this agreement. I am not aware of specific monitoring arrangements. I will refer the matter to the Prime Minister and seek any further information. But my view is that the agreement is clear, that it is enforceable and that nothing can change without the Commonwealth Government's agreeing to that change.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YL7">Senator MISSEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Health. I refer the Minister to the Commonwealth Public Service Board circular entitled 'Smoking in Commonwealth Government Offices' which draws attention to Government policy on smoking in Government offices and suggests action to implement that policy. While I recognise that, in applying Government policy, the Director-General of Health must take account of several factors including a balancing of the rights of smokers and non-smokers, I ask the Minister: How can the Department of Health, Australia's primary health authority, say on the one hand that involuntary smoking, according to medical evidence and by Government recognition, is harmful and can damage health and then propose that the source of the harmful pollution be able to continue? Does the Minister agree that non-smokers and, in particular, those people who are forced to become involuntary smokers have certain rights which need to be recognised and protected? Does he also agree that a compromise needs to be reached so as to allow smokers and non-smokers to co-exist with a minimum of discomfort to each group? What action has been taken by the Government to protect the rights of non-smokers in the Commonwealth Public Service? Has consideration been given to providing smoking lounges with special exhaust ventilation facilities to meet the requirements of the smoking minority?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="560" SPEAKER="Baume Sen The Hon P.E." NAMEID="ME4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="NSW" MINISTERIAL="ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Missen is quite correct in saying that this is a problem of balancing the rights of different groups. It is a problem that requires common sense and compromise. The circular to which he referred was issued under the aegis of the Public Service Board last November by the Director-General of Health in his role as the occupational health authority in respect of Commonwealth employment. The intention in issuing this circular was twofold: Firstly, to draw attention to the Government's decision on the matter, as announced in its response to recommendation 42 of the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare entitled 'Drug Problems in Australia-an Intoxicated Society?'; and, secondly, to achieve a balanced, practical approach to a complex problem that takes into account quite a few factors, including the very wide range and nature of work places that exist in the area of Commonwealth employment and the practical difficulties and high costs that would be involved in structural alterations to buildings or air conditioning plants in office buildings, particularly those leased by the Commonwealth. This circular progresses the intentions of the recommendation from the Senate Standing Committee and the proposal of the National Health and Medical Research Council on the rights of non-smokers, which the Senate Committee endorsed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As stated in the circular, the policy aims to create a non-smoking working environment for Commonwealth employees with provision for those who wish to smoke, rather than vice versa. In this regard the circular, and the policy it disseminates, represent a significant and practical initiative in improving the overall working conditions of employees. As the Government announced in responding last year to the particular Senate Standing Committee recommendation, it has asked the Standing Consultative Committee on Occupational Health Services-a body chaired by the Public Service Board and comprising relevant departments, including Health, and the peak union councils-to monitor the implementation of the objectives set out in the circular. Whilst the reason for the suggestion that smoking lounges with special exhaust ventilation facilities be provided is appreciated, implementation of the suggestion is not practicable at present because of architectural and engineering-apart from cost-constraints.</PARA>
<PARA> As clearly enunciated in the circular, development of specific arrangements within individual work places is a matter primarily to be resolved at each work place, having regard to the general policy and to practicability. That approach is entirely consistent with the intentions of the Senate Standing Committee in making its recommendation. It should be noted, also, that the Committee recognised that there are civil rights to be considered for both smokers and non-smokers. Finally, as the circular was issued only last November, reasonable time must be allowed before the outcome of the actions proposed in the circular can be assessed. The Government has acknowledged the difficulties of applying the policy to office buildings generally. However, as community attitudes to smoking harden, it might be appropriate for further measures to be introduced as the honourable senator suggests.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is addressed to the Attorney-General, concerns an Australian Capital Territory prisoner of some former notoriety in this Territory, Mr Kevin Riordan, who is now languishing in a New South Wales gaol. Has the Attorney yet written to Mr Riordan advising him of the Commonwealth's intention or absence of intention, as the case may be, to prosecute him in respect of an escape from custody in 1975? If the Commonwealth does intend to charge Mr Riordan with this offence, why was no action taken long before this, given that he has been in custody, both in New South Wales and in Victoria, for the last five years? Finally, will the Attorney take into account in determining his attitude on this question, first, the obvious stress which has been caused to the prisoner in question by the Commonwealth's apparent inability to make up its mind on this matter; secondly, the fact that it does appear that courts and prison authorities have recently commented favourably on Mr Riordan's general attitudes and change of attitudes; and, thirdly, the fact that Mr Riordan is now eligible for parole on all other charges for which he has previously been convicted and has some reasonable expectation of being released if the Commonwealth does not put further obstacles in his way?</PARA></TALK.START>

I do not want to go into that matter; but that is, obviously, a delaying factor. In relation to the question of whether a further prosecution will be launched, I have informed Mr Riordan of the decision that has been made in relation to that matter.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Goodness me, no. The decision in relation to prosecution of Mr Riordan was taken by the New South Wales authority under a New South Wales law. It went to a court of appeal which decided that that was not the appropriate vehicle for prosecution for the charge of escaping from custody. I do not want to go into all the details about Mr Riordan here. The fact is that that decision was given towards the end of last year; I cannot remember when. The only possible question of delay has been in relation to whether we would prosecute him for a breach of a Commonwealth statute. As I said, that decision has now been made. The other question is that of his release on parole. There may be some question of delay in that area, but the delay is nothing like the period Senator Evans suggested by way of interjection.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Education.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator CARRICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When I was Minister for Education, the problems of the differences among the States in standards of education and the problems suffered by parents and students in transferring from one State to another were fairly frequent matters for discussion at the Australian Education Council attended by Education Ministers. So the problem as outlined by Senator Martin is well known to me. The matter is doubly important in Queensland, I imagine, because of the large mobility of people from other States to Queensland. The simple answer, of course, is that there is not an attempt to standardise high school curricula. The reason is that under the Constitution the primary responsibility for education rests with the States and it is inevitable that there would be diversity. Nevertheless, there has been a considerable degree of acceptance by the States that they should move towards some minimal principles of standards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Co-operation in curriculum matters occurs at the national level through the Curriculum Development Centre which has been set up to undertake curriculum development tasks and to develop teaching and learning materials for use in schools. The Centre's program involves close co-operation with a wide range of educational authorities and bodies including State catholic and other non-government authorities. I am advised that it is the usual practice in Australia for accrediting authorities to negotiate with tertiary institutions over requirements for entry to their courses. The tertiary institutions have ar- rangements amongst themselves over recognition of academic results. Inevitably, therefore, the Australian Capital Territory accreditation agency has an agreement with the Australian National University which is recognised by all other tertiary institutions in Australia. In summary, an attempt is taking place to get some minimal co-operation among the States to minimise the difficulties of students transferring between the States. But, as it is a recurring problem, I will refer it to the Minister in another place.</PARA>

Telecom Australia intends to introduce a fee of $10 for subscribers with silent numbers; that is, numbers not listed in telephone directories. Will the Minister intervene in this proposal especially on behalf of people such as members of the police force, women living alone, the legal profession, and others who may be victims of nuisance calls and who now will be punished by Telecom as well? Would it not be possible to publish in the directories the name of the subscriber, with the world 'unlisted' instead of the telephone number for persons wishing to retain a private number?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware that the Tasmanian Minister has recently made a number of public statements criticising the Commonwealth Government's intention to require all construction works on national roads to be subject to the tender and contract process. However, that gentleman failed to mention that the Commonwealth is proposing to require that construction works on national roads only be subject to the tender process. The Commonwealth would not require that the tender process be applied to arterial and local roads, which are by far the bulk of the roads in Tasmania. On those roads, the Tasmanian Government will continue to be free to use its normal day labour force. However, in the interests of efficient use of public resources, it would be wise to try the tender and contract system. The Commonwealth is insisting on the calling of tenders for the few construction jobs on national roads in the belief that this will lead to better value for money and so result in more, not less, work being done.</PARA></TALK.START>

This is particularly so when it is recalled that the Tasmanian Main Roads Department is established throughout Tasmania and that no large private road construction contractors are presently established in Tasmania.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Broadly, the points raised by Senator Button can be accepted although he used the word 'downgraded'. Following determinations of the Remuneration Tribunal, the salary levels of Family Court judges have fallen below the relative levels at which they were fixed by the original Family Law Act. In 1976 an amendment was made to that Act which maintained the relativity at that time. However, the Government's policy since it has been in office is that judicial salaries should be determined on recommendations of the Remuneration Tribunal. It has been as a result of a series of decisions of that Tribunal over the years that the present situation has developed. I have had a number of representations from Family Court judges in relation to this matter. Representations were again made as recently as this Monday. I am now giving consideration to what steps should be taken in this year's review of judicial salaries by the Remuneration Tribunal. Of course, it is a matter that will have to be determined by the Government and I am not in a position to say what steps will or can be taken.</PARA></TALK.START>

I am advised that the severe drought, civil disruption, warfare and the movement of large numbers of refugees to normally food deficient countries all have contributed to the food crisis in East Africa. In response, a significant part of our food aid is being diverted to the region. Five countries-Sudan, Ethiopia, Somalia, Uganda and Kenya-will receive almost 70,000 tonnes of food grain valued, with freight, at over $15m from Australia during this financial year. In order to overcome the problems of communication and distribution, Australia has associated its assistance with the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees, the United Nations World Food Program and other United Nations bodies active in the area. Reports both from the WFP and our own representatives show that Australian aid is reaching its intended recipients. Advice received in January from the United Nations agencies indicates a general improvement in the condition of refugees, owing to increased feeding, health care and water supply programs. However, a three-month water supply emergency was declared in Somalia on 5 February because of drought.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter of public importance I have raised this morning is a matter that perhaps the Government hopes will go away. It is a subject which thousands of Australians will want to see thrashed out in this Parliament so that finally order may be brought to one of the key factors of our economy-the domestic aviation industry. This industry has been the envy of other members of the business community for many years. With government approval a private corporation, Ansett Airlines of Australia, and a public corporation, Trans-Australia Airlines, are protected from competition. They operate in a closed world where their customers, the travelling public, have no say. It is a world where they are able, under the present Government, largely to decide their own level of profit by regularly seeking and automatically receiving permission to increase air fares. The public is not told how these increases are justified. Still less is the public given the opportunity to question the basis on which the increases are granted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think that honourable senators should go back some years to review the way this cosy cost arrangement developed and to weigh some of the very strong criticisms levelled at it. Rather than go back to the inception of the two airlines agreement in the 1950s, let us go back to just two years ago. I refer the Senate to the substantial inquiry of the Domestic Air Transport Policy Review published in 1979 as a report to the then Minister for Transport, Mr Nixon. This report is a sort of John the Baptist volume for the report of the Holcroft inquiry into domestic air fares published a week or so ago. I do not seek to attribute any particular virtues to the Holcroft committee of inquiry by describing the former volume as a John the Baptist one. However, it preceded the Holcroft inquiry by several years. It was an expert study-at least it seemed so at that time-of the domestic aviation industry carried out by the Department of Transport. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to draw from the report of the review one comment of great significance to any debate on the two-airline agreement. The review took up the matter of Ansett's involvement in non-airline activities-in other words, Ansett's interest in finance companies and in other investments not related, even indirectly, to aviation. Some of Ansett's subsidiary companies may be said to be indirectly related to air travel, such as the Great Barrier Reef tourist resorts and things of that kind. On page 76 of volume 1 of the report the review committee said that it did not have sufficient information as to whether Ansett's involvement in non-airline activities acted to the detriment of passengers or freight rates or, significantly, whether those activities affected the two-airline agreement; that is, whether they affected Ansett and TAA. The committee also reminded the Minister that he should satisfy himself that the 'airline industry considerations only' should be taken into account in setting fares and freight rates and in deciding matters such as fleet re-equipment. Three and a half years later has the Minister satisfied himself about those considerations? There has been no indication to this Parliament that he has. The matter is still open for debate. </PARA>
<PARA> Talk about Ansett's involvement in non-airline activities became highly relevant with the crash of Associated Securities Ltd in 1979, the year of the commissioning of this report. That company was controlled by Ansett. On its board sat Sir Reginald Ansett, Sir Cecil Looker and Sir Henry Bolte-all members of the Ansett Transport Industries board, all having had bestowed on them knighthoods of ancient orders of chivalry and honour and all of them having had bestowed on them knighthoods which, it is said, can be relatively cheaply obtained in Victoria these days by donations to Liberal Party funds. Associated Securities Ltd was engaged in highly speculative activities which led to losses which have never been accurately quantified. Estimates of those losses range from $18m to $27m and, of course, they were losses which involved many small investors. That incident emphasised just how much Ansett has had the best of both worlds. Not only is it protected by government guarantee but also and at the same time it is free to pursue the most doubtful commercial enterprises and the most speculative of business activities. That sort of activity can be pursued although it bears no relation to the airline industry. It can obviously be sustained, however, by using the enormous cash flow that Ansett gets from its privileged position. </PARA>
<PARA> We will never know to what extent, if at all, air fares were affected by the collapse of ASL. The underwriting of the hairier schemes by the use of airline funds holds great potential dangers. I am reminded that Mr Rupert Murdoch, when he was contemplating buying a newspaper in England, said that one of his rivals owned a shipping company. He said it was highly inappropriate in England for the proprietors of a shipping company to own a newspaper. How does he apply that sort of criteria in the Australian context? Associated Securities Ltd is one illustration of what can happen. </PARA>
<PARA> How much longer must we wait for this Government to develop any backbone to do anything about it? That lack of resolve by the Government is at the forefront of the most recent upheaval in this industry-the establishment and brutal termination of the Holcroft inquiry. What principles have been transgressed by the way in which this Minister and this Government have treated the members of the Holcroft inquiry? The members of that inquiry were highly respected men-the chief executive of Brambles Industries Ltd-one of the largest Australian companies in Australia; Dr Harold Bell, who for many years has been a senior executive of the AMP Society; and Professor Warren Hogan, Professor of Economics at Sydney University. Businessmen and academics of the distinction of those three men are not always anxious to serve on government committees of inquiry because the demands on their time are too severe. </PARA>
<PARA> To accept such a commission inevitably means a sacrifice. They felt that the importance of fare structures in the domestic airlines system of Australia was so important that they were prepared to make that sacrifice of their services as a gesture of public goodwill to grapple with a most important issue for the Australian public. They were prepared to serve on that committee. There is no doubt that they were assured that the inquiry would continue until they were satisfied that they had heard all the relevant evidence and were in a position to make decisions about an industry that has been allowed to become so complex and secretive in its marketing and administrative structure. But what happened? As their hearings proceeded, last September the members of the committee were to get the first inkling of moves affecting their inquiry that were taking place behind their backs. I wish to quote from their letter to the Minister for Transport dated 15 February. It is the letter in which they submitted their report to the Government. It began with the committee members saying that they submitted the report with considerable misgivings. Then they had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> It is also appropriate to record that the Members of the Inquiry felt in some degree misplaced when learning on 9 September that they had been proceeding with an inquiry requiring them to have regard, inter alia, to 'government domestic aviation policy including the objective of increasing competition' in ignorance of the fact that the Government was meanwhile negotiating a new ten-year Two Airlines Agreement. That such an agreement had in fact been signed was first made known to the Inquiry by Ansett, which asserted that in its view some lines of inquiry being pursued by us would be irrelevant in the environment of the new Agreement once ratified by Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA>The committee should have been alerted by that action of the Government and it should have been alerted much earlier on by the Minister for Transport. It perhaps should have realised that its inquiry was regarded by this Government as a stunt. The inquiry had been established prior to the last election only because dissatisfaction about the cost of air fares in Australia was becoming enormous and widespread. So, to head off criticism, the Government set up this inquiry. It is now clear that the Government never intended to take the inquiry seriously. </PARA>
<PARA> As soon as possible after the election on 18 October last year the Government's attitude was exposed for all to see. On 13 November the three committee members met the Minister and he gave them no inkling that the inquiry was to be wound up. Instead, he gave the clear impression that the funds needed to extend the inquiry to mid-1981-a simple machinery matter-would be made available without difficulty. Two things then occurred to change all that. I have already indicated the contempt of the Minister for the Holcroft inquiry by his opening of negotiations with the airlines for a new two-airline agreement. A second event then influenced him to act even sooner than he had planned; that is, the fact that Western Australian members of this Parliament had been putting the heat on the Prime Minister about the level of air fares between Western Australia and the eastern States. I note with interest the fact that not one Western Australian Government senator will be participating in this debate today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would be assisted if you would shut up for a while. Then we could get on with the debate. After a meeting between these members of parliament, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Minister for Transport, the members of the Holcroft inquiry were abruptly told on 26 November that they were to complete their findings by 31 January. The reason given by the Minister was that Parliament would know the recommendations of the inquiry before it ratified the new two-airline agreement which he was drawing up. In a Press statement announcing this Mr Hunt had this to say:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government has asked the Chairman of the domestic air fares inquiry, Mr Holcroft, to conclude his report by 31 January next year so that the Government and the Parliament will have the benefit of the recommendations of this inquiry before proceeding to enact legislation to give effect to a new two airlines agreement . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The cynicism in that announcement is almost beyond belief. The Minister's overriding interest was to get the Parliament to ratify the new two-airline agreement. It was an agreement dictated by Ansett and meekly agreed to by the Minister. He knew that he would not get ratification without a public brawl with Western Australian members of this Parliament. The compromise was that they were given the promise that they would be able to weigh the Holcroft recommendations before they were asked to ratify the new two-airline agreement. The Minister's central concern was and is the ratification of this new two-airline agreement for a period of 10 years in spite of all the doubts which exist in this community about the validity of that agreement in the interests of the travelling public. Holcroft and his colleagues were to be sent packing. They were simply holding up conclusion of the deal that Ansett was demanding. They were of no moment. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of things flow from that. First of all, there has been an attempt by the Minister to deceive the Parliament and there has been vilification of the members of the Holcroft committee because they dared to question the behaviour of a Minister and, by implication, the Government. Snide attacks have been made on the truthfulness and competence of members of the committee of inquiry. It has been one of the most degrading incidents in the public life of this country in many years. Of course, it is also a degrading incident which ignores the whole substance of the problem, which is the level of domestic air fares in this country. The ending of this inquiry enabled Ansett, TAA and the Department of Transport-surely the three most important elements of this industry-to evade close examination. That is almost like running a Melbourne Cup without horses or having a Country Party national conference not passing a resolution about hanging or something of that kind. </PARA>
<PARA> The committee made some comments about the Department's conduct in this matter which I do not wish to quote in detail. They are very familiar, I would think, to honourable senators. If I can summarise, from memory the committee found it passing strange that the Department of Transport was not in a position to give evidence to the committee at an appropriate time. In recent days we have been given information which reveals aspects both of TAA and Ansett that should not be countenanced. I refer to the reports of those two companies which have been tabled in the Parliament. Senator Rae has concentrated on some of the shortcomings of TAA and I follow and agree with many of the arguments which Senator Rae has put about the accounts of that airline. I have in this place identified some aspects of the Ansett operations that I believe fall far short of the standards that should apply to an enterprise operating with Government guarantees about competition and, effectively, Government guarantees about profitability. Sometimes Government members think that we on this side have some sort of obsession about Mr Rupert Murdoch, for example. I assure honourable senators that I have no obsession about him. I have never met him. I understand that he is an outstanding father. I simply make the comment that it is our obligation as an Opposition, whether or not Mr Murdoch be associated with Ansett Airlines, to scrutinise the actions of that airline as it is our obligation to scrutinise the actions of TAA. That is especially so when reports appear in the newspapers like the one in yesterday's Sydney Sun. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> A SECRET letter reveals that Ansett Airlines, through Mr Rupert Murdoch, urged the Federal Government last year to sell TAA to private interests. </PARA>
<PARA> The letter, signed by the Federal Transport Minister, Mr Hunt, was sent to Ansett's joint managing director, Sir Peter Abeles. </PARA>
<PARA> Ansett also urged the Government-through Mr Murdoch-to introduce automatic fare rises for both the domestic airlines, a move which the minister said would have the effect of keeping up Ansett's profits. </PARA>
<PARA>Not to put too fine a point on it, if I might interpolate. The letter continued:</PARA>
<PARA> Both proposals were put in talks between Transport Australia officials and Ansett representatives in negotiations on a new two-airline agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hunt's letter said the talks had followed a meeting between himself and publisher Mr Murdoch, who is the other joint managing director of Ansett. </PARA>
<PARA>As far as I can detect, that report has not been denied. Its implications are clear. Mr Murdoch was dictating to this Government future policy about aviation. While the Minister in his letter appears to be rejecting the move and the more monstrous suggestions contained in it, it now appears that he is in fact in agreement after all with a number of those suggestions. It is little short of breathtaking that a private company so shielded from competition by the government can not only evade public accountability but also can have such a commanding influence over matters of policy. The championing by Ansett of its role as one of free enterprise is, in that circumstance, quite ludicrous. It all comes back, of course, to what we were told in that speech of the Prime Minister on 5 December in which he identified the necessity for choice and options in Australian society-choice and options; diversity under the Fraser Government. What sort of choice, what sorts of options and what sort of diversity do we have when a newspaper proprietor, on behalf of his airline, can nobble the Minister in the way the Minister for Transport in this country has been nobbled in the past few months? Ansett occupies a position that is the envy of other companies in Australia yet it displays no sense of obligation to the public which fills its coffers by the payment of higher and higher air fares. </PARA>
<PARA> We have heard a good deal recently about air fares between Sydney, Melbourne and Perth. Back benchers on the Government side have been expressing concern about that. But their concern, of course, is a little belated, although welcome. One wonders why they have not taken up with the Government the question of empty seats on Qantas planes flying across the continent-2,000 empty seats a week on Qantas jumbo jets which could be occupied by passengers on domestic routes. That has been established, I think, as a matter of practicality. That would mean capital savings--</PARA>

I ask honourable senators to bear in mind that Qantas Airways Ltd offered the two airlines rights to sell its seats at whatever markup TAA and Ansett chose. That offer, of course, was not taken up; it was rejected out of hand. One can only think that TAA and Ansett refused to reduce their aeroplane fleet and cut down direct involvement in that route for reasons of prestige. While they covered their prestige the Australian air travellers and taxpayers had to foot the bill. Surely it is time that the Government began to exercise some influence in this situation and demonstrated that it has both the will and the determination to do what is best for Australians and not what is best for Ansett and TAA.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have sat here and listened to Senator Button's speech in an attempt to gather the drift of his argument in this matter of public importance. As I read it, it is concerned with the interests of the travelling public. I find that it is extremely difficult to establish what, in fact, he is criticising. Indeed, he has been talking about various matters which are sideline matters and are on the periphery of the issues concerning Trans-Australia Airlines and Ansett Airlines of Australia without coming to the major point which is: To what extent has the Australian citizen been hurt or had his interests damaged in respect of the two-airline agreement? Further, are there any arrangements which have detrimentally affected him? These matters have not been established. In fact, Senator Button's speech has been based on an attack, again on Ansett, which has been typical of his activities in the last few day.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;His leading attacks have been on personalities. I mention in passing the Sun newspaper article which appeared yesterday and was referred to in a question which was asked by Senator Walsh and which was raised again by Senator Button in his speech. That question claimed that Mr Murdoch, out of the blue or in some surreptitious way which has become known to the Press, advocated to the Government the sale of TAA. What an astounding proposition that is. After all that had been spread over the newspapers about a year ago as a matter of some importance. There were, of course, subsequent denials by the Government on many occasions of an intention to sell TAA.

Yet, he now comes into this place and asks: To what extent have those profits been affected and therefore prices jacked up to the community because of the effect of the Associated Securities Ltd crash. Clearly he has not his thinking straight. If he accepts that there is a financial statement which sets out the profit and loss associated with the airline's operations he then goes on to say: 'They are affected in some way by ASL's particular problems'.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Clearly what is involved here is that an Australian Labor Party government would seek to implement that platform in such a way that it gains absolute control over the airline industry as it would seek to do by the establishment of an interstate commission in respect of rail and water transport and every other kind of transport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Labor Party stands up here today and claims that, in the interests of the air travelling public, it wants competition. At the same time it is trying to implement a policy which is aimed at destroying the airline industry with the intention of establishing one airline only which can then be totally controlled through its means. That is its objective. Hence, we have this outpouring of criticism against Ansett Airlines and against the personalities connected with Ansett Airlines so as to establish a one-airline policy in this country in such a way as to obtain absolute control of the transport system consistent with its general socialistic objectives. This hypocritical party is about to argue, as Senator Button has failed to do, that there is real interest in the travelling public. Mr Morris, the spokesman on transport in the other place, stood up there and claimed that competition is the best way to assist the travelling public. He was talking about competition in respect of pricing. He knows that if the Labor Party came to office-heaven forbid-there would be no possibility of implementing that proposal because he is bound by the Australian Labor Party platform which states quite clearly that the objective of an Australian Labor Party government would be to set up a monopoly air transport arrangement so that there could be no competition. In addition, there would also be the effects which would need to be taken into account in respect of other transport arrangements. We have already seen how socialist governments in the States regulate road and rail transport in such a way as to ensure that the maximum profits are earned for State-owned enterprises. That is a basic objective of the Opposition Party. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course, the truth does hurt, Senator Primmer. I can understand his sensitivities knowing his predilections on certain left wing matters. I wish now to come to the matters which I believe are important in this debate in an attempt to demonstrate to the public that the two airlines arrangement does work in favour of the public generally. Clearly there have been, through the implementation of this arrangement over a long period, considerable very important safety records. There have been reliable and frequent services through the Australian network. Okay, in some cases it may not have served every location in the way it should have, but on the whole it has been done in such a way that it is for the benefit of the Australian public. The range of fare types which is now allowed is considerable. Of course, the rise in the usage of aircraft by tourists and others, particularly in the last few years and since the advent of the jet aircraft, has been astounding and absolutely amazing. This has led to the opening up of new job opportunities in the tourist areas, particularly those in Queensland. This element, of course, could not have come about except through the competition which has been allowed under the previous airlines arrangement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But let us not dwell on that matter. Let us look at what the proposed new airline arrangements will take into account. A wide range of fare types are already applicable. They include economy, standby, offpeak, group, advanced purchase and night coach and special concessions for children and students. These fares offer a wider range than any that might be made available under other arrangements overseas. For children alone Australian fares are 50 per cent more generous than those available in other countries. Of course, in the general commercial area there is also the 40 per cent off normal arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA> If we care to compare prices with other countries-this is surely the real test as to whether the public is being properly served by the airline arrangements-we find that, for instance, in the United States the economy fare between New York and Los Angeles is equivalent to 8.9c per kilometre, compared with the fare of 8.5c per kilometre applicable between Perth and Melbourne. Does that indicate a significant difference against-not favourably inclined towards-the travelling public in Australia? Of course not. The reverse is true. In fact, it is cheaper to travel from Perth to Melbourne than it is to travel an equivalent distance in the United States. Is that a disadvantage to the public? Of course not. </PARA>
<PARA> The current situation has been arrived at after extensive reviews and these have been spelt out in logical pattern over the last three years. Of course, preparatory to the new airlines arrangements was the Domestic Air Transport Policy Review Committee, which was established in 1977, which undertook studies and which reported a couple of years ago. As we all know, those findings have been laid open to the public and have received remarkable public comment since they were first made available. Of course, there has been the more recent decision to establish the new airlines arrangement. It followed that policy review, but the aim over the last year or so was to have very serious negotiations with the various airlines to ensure that as many points of view as possible were taken into account and, of course, to establish a new basis for competition within a general framework that kept up the standard of airline service to the community which had been established in previous times. Owing to community concern, that was followed by the Holcroft Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares. </PARA>
<PARA> Those two aims have not been inconsistent. The Government made it clear when dealing with the establishment of the Holcroft inquiry that it would appreciate the views of the Holcrost inquiry in respect of air fares and matters of cross-subsidisation in considering the arrangements it would need to come to in the ratification of the airlines agreement. That was a thoroughly consistent approach. Those matters have led to the development of a new policy which will bring even better benefits to the airline travelling public. Quite apart from spelling out those matters, I believe there is one other very significant point to be made about the development of the present airlines arrangement and the way in which it has been occurring. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, I think we need to acknowledge that the whole airline industry, not only in Australia but also overseas, is about to face a very significant period of structural change and development. We know, for instance, that within the next few years we will be seeing in this country the implementation of wide-bodied aircraft which will be able to fly longer, go further and carry more passengers across Australia than ever before. It will herald a whole new marketing opportunity for the airlines. The commitment of hundreds of millions of dollars by both airlines on new aircraft and spares, ground staff and new arrangements, which will involve government in extra expense on airport development and so on, will certainly represent a major change in the way in which government has to handle aviation policy. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I make is whether this is the time to adopt the approach of the shadow Minister for Transport of throwing the whole matter to the winds and declaring an open-go policy-a dog eat dog and may the best man win situation. Such a policy may well achieve the socialist objective of the Australian Labor Party but in the meantime it would thoroughly destroy the golden opportunity we have in this country to establish a new aviation industry which would provide greater benefits for the travelling public and create new jobs in those tourist areas all over Australia at lower costs than would otherwise apply. I believe that therein lies the real interest of the travelling public, not for today, not for 20 years ago and not for last year, but for the future. This Government is concerned about that, whereas the Opposition and its leaders are apparently deadly concerned about achieving their socialist objectives as set out in their platform. </PARA>

However, he would recognise, after one or two moment's consideration, that such arrangements are based on flights coming to Australia from overseas and the seats on these flights would be extremely difficult to fill with domestic passengers when one considers the inconsistent timing, the arrangements at airports to handle people who pass through Customs and the need to mix up those matters.</PARA></TALK.START>

Indeed, Senator Button must agree with those new arrangements as he spoke at great length on them during the debate last Tuesday night.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At least the Senate is discussing the problems associated with and faced by the airline industry in Australia. That approach is very different to the approach taken in the House of Representatives when these matters were sought to be ventilated by the Opposition. The Fraser Government gagged the debate. Having heard the arguments of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) one can perhaps understand why the Government might have taken that position.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Messner spoke for his allotted time and said precisely nothing except he tried to suggest that the Labor Party's platform, which deals with a section of the Constitution which was written in 1900, and which deals with the problems of the transport industry by establishing an interstate commission, in some imprecise and unusual sort of way, would advance the objectives of the Australian Labor Party. When the Constitution was written at that stage I doubt whether the word 'socialism' had even crept into the thinking of the Australian people. At that stage it was nothing more than a flightful fantasy in the minds of the Australian people, least of all the Australian Labor Party. Of course, it is usual for Senator Messner, having no argument to fall back upon, to smear and slander in an attempt to defend the Government's infamous position on this and other issues. After all, it was this Government which in May 1980 set up an inquiry into domestic air fares. By its own admission it was dissatisfied with the state of the industry. That was expressed particularly by Western Australian members. </PARA>
<PARA> What was the purpose of the inquiry? Senator Messner never applied himself to the terms of reference. The inquiry was to be independent and public and its members were to apply themselves to the criticisms that had been advanced by the Opposition. The first meeting between the committee and the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) took place in June 1980. Following that meeting the terms of reference were extended in September 1980. However, the committee from the first moment suffered frustration in the preparation of its work because of the attitude taken by some members of the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Public hearings began in September 1980 and continued right through November 1980. In that period the committee met again with the Minister. On 27 November last the Minister wrote to the committee informing it that the inquiry should report within two months. It was only at that stage that members of the committee realised what a sham they were involved in and to what extent the Minister, the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Government had been contriving to seduce the electorate. Let us look at Tasmania and Western Australia where, according to public opinion polls, the Government was vulnerable and where, on the eve of the 18 October elections, it was pretty clear that the whole arrangement was a coverup for blatant political purposes. The committee was made an instrument for the Government's motivation. Surreptitiously the Government's purpose for the committee was to complete the two-airline agreement which would see Ansett Transport Industries smoothly and profitably into the next decade. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that on the eve of the 1972 elections, when the dogs were barking and the McMahon Government was about to fall, the Government, at that time, concluded the airline agreement without consultation with the Parliament and without having regard to the fact that we would have a new government in office. What has been the committee's response to this? The bitterness of the committee's realisation can be seen in its letters addressed to the Minister. The first letter is dated 1 December 1980. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> It is the considered opinion of the Members of this Committee that to ask it to finalise, within the two most interrupted months of the year,-</PARA>
<PARA>That is December and January-</PARA>
<PARA>a report based on a grossly incomplete input of material from the many parties is totally unreasonable. Moreover, we believe that the impracticability makes a travesty of the description of the Committee as being independent and public. </PARA>
<PARA>The committee was already making suggestions of improper and impossible conditions imposed upon it by the Government. One has only to look at the recommendation in the Holcroft Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares in paragraphs 1.12, 1.13 and 1.14. Paragraph 1.12 reads:</PARA>
<PARA> There was for a considerable period a reluctance on the part of Ansett to cooperate with the Inquiry in a fashion that could be of practical use. </PARA>
<PARA>The written submission of the Department of Transport, belated as it was, and the lack of a written submission by the Bureau of Transport Economics made the work of the committee impossible. I return now to the letter from the committee. It continues:</PARA>
<PARA> We will, however, in the interests of protecting our own reputations and those of our staff, necessarily have to impose the most stringent of qualifications on the findings in our Report. </PARA>
<PARA>It is ironical, is it not, that the committee was subsequently able to make the report that it did. Subsequent to that, the committee heard the most shameful attack on its integrity from its Minister and from the former Minister. It is surely the last refuge of a tottering Minister to try to put the blame on his staff or on a committee that he appointed. </PARA>
<PARA> It is necessary for me to remind honourable senators of the standing of those members of the committee whom the Minister sought to portray as either incompetent or malevolent upstarts. Mr Warwick Holcroft, who is now retired, was the Managing Director of Brambles Industries Ltd; Dr Harold Bell, O.B.E., was the Economic Adviser to the Australian Mutual Provident Society and, of course, Professor Warren Hogan is a distinguished academic and sometime adviser to the Government on economic matters. These men can hardly be said to hold a brief for the Opposition. Yet their integrity and professionalism was such that they could not allow themselves to be compromised by the cynical machinations of the Minister, despite their own obvious and sympathetic political persuasions. So it was that on 27 November last the penny dropped for the members of the committee. The offhanded treatment members of the committee received from the Department of Transport-obviously at the direction of the Minister and the Government-the disdainful submission from Ansett Airlines of Australia and the total brush-off from the Bureau of Transport Economics, all fell into place. </PARA>
<PARA> The facts of the matter were very clear. The election was over. The support of the Murdoch Press was secure. The new two-airline agreement had been signed and was ready for presentation to the Parliament before the Senate could cause any trouble, which will be a factor as from 1 July next. The committee was a liability to be disposed of and that was the action that was taken by the Fraser Government. This then is the atmosphere and the attitude which pervades the Government's administration of the airline system in Australia. It is geared to purely political ends to ensure that the powerful friends of the Liberal Party are kept in the power to which they have been so dangerously accustomed. Whereas it was Ansett in 1972, it is now Murdoch and Abeles who have assumed the power in that empire in that organisation, to ensure that the Liberal Party is the beneficiary of that power and to perpetuate the coalition Government on the basis of that power. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course there is a conflict here. It is certainly not in the interests of the Australian public, least of all those in the far flung parts of our country in Western Australia, the Northern Territory, Queensland or Tasmania, or similarly in the cities of Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra. The Minister has admitted as such, with reference to the Western Australian position, in his circular of 3 February 1981 to Government members. He admits that the price on long haul routes is unreasonably high. Yet Senator Messner has the gall to stand up in this place and defend that situation when there are alternatives readily available as is shown in the Holcroft report. The Government's orchestrated reaction to the impending Holcroft recommendations appears to suggest that it had every intention of maintaining those fares for long haul routes at some reasonably high level. Let me quote from the report. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Almost everywhere the Inquiry has attempted to do this-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, frame practical recommendations on air fare pricing-</PARA>
<PARA>it has run into the virtually impenetrable barrier of the provisions of the Two Airlines Agreement, existing or proposed. </PARA>
<PARA>The committee's report reserves as much criticism for the Department of Transport operating at the direction of Government policy, for its failure to elicit adequate public disclosure of financial and performance data by the airlines. We saw this view substantiated only this week with the tabling of the reports to which Senator Button so ably referred on Tuesday evening. They are the subject of the dissatisfaction of not only Opposition senators but also of Government senators. Can we expect this Government to take heed of the committee's 'disquiet'-'disquiet' is the committee's word, not mine-and bring about changes in the two-airine agreement which would require full and timely public disclosure of the activities of the participants in this protected industry?</PARA>
<PARA> A covert operation, resulting in the signing of a new airline agreement, is being foisted on the Australian public without public debate and in defiance of the Holcroft inquiry. It will result in Ansett Airlines being secure for 10 years in its ripping off of sections of the Australian community. Let me instance one point in relation to the inquiry. Before doing so, I ask: Are Government senators really sincere in their belief that there is no disquiet in the Australian community, that there is no dissatisfaction with the fare structure, the parallel timetables or the lack of competition in the airline industry? Of course, there is such disquiet and dissatisfaction. The question of using excess capacity on Qantas Airways Ltd flights for long haul routes has been raised often enough. This would mean lower fares for people flying to and from Western Australia. However, under the proposed new agreement, Ansett will be able to prevent the use of that excess capacity on Qantas aircraft. The Minister glibly defends the proposal. This committee, which had the express task of looking at air fares and particularly at the problem on the long haul routes, was unable to consider this apparently straightforward manoeuvre. No wonder the Government is faced with a rebellion from its Western Australian supporters. The cat is out of the bag and well and truly running. </PARA>
<PARA> Where are the greater competition and the lower fares which the Government professes to seek? The answer is that they are impossibly locked into the Liberal Party-Murdoch-Abeles-Ansett treasure chest. No Holcroft inquiry will be allowed to unlock that mutually beneficial gold mine which satisfies not only the big corporations but also the funds of the Liberal and National Country parties in this country at election times. The Holcroft committee, despite the hurdles placed before it by the Government, has done the Parliament and the travelling public a great service. It has exposed the pretence carried on by the Minister for Transport, it has revealed the excessive profits being made by Ansett at the air travellers' expense and it has highlighted to all Australians the complicity between the men who control Ansett and this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will recall that during the last parliamentary session the Minister introduced the Australian National Airlines Commission Amendment Bill. It was a phony Bill. That Bill embodied the requests made in January last year by none other than Sir Peter Abeles to the Minister that the financial structure of Trans-Australia Airlines be changed and its profit objectives altered. The major beneficiary of the extra profit that would flow from such an alteration to the airline's structural arrangement would be Ansett Airlines. Increased profits can only be provided by increased fares. Fares have doubled in recent years, slugging the airline passengers from one part of the country to the other. Under that agreement the two airlines must charge the same fares. Where is the competition about which Senator Messner spoke so glibly in his contribution to the debate? When TAA's fares are forced up by this current manoeuvre, Ansett could follow suit. </PARA>
<PARA> The real purpose of the amendment to the TAA legislation, as the Opposition said last year, would be to benefit Ansett Airlines, its shareholders and the power group that controls that organisation. Ansett is already making excessive profits, as the Holcroft committee discovered and exposed. Here is the ultimate hypocrisy of this so-called free enterprise Government. When it is a matter of protecting the interests of those sinister corporate powers which help keep it in government, it is prepared to exercise any amount of crude manipulation and administrative or legislative regulation to gain its ends. So much for the Government's pretence about market forces, about competition and about being concerned about the interests of the travelling public. They mean nothing to this Government when it wants to satisfy the influences and the financial interests of those who put their money into the Liberal and National Country Party money bags every time there is an election in this country. That, of course, is one of the influences that the Opposition is interested in changing. We will continue to challenge this Government and the policies that flow from such undue influence of corporations on the decisions of this Parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -What I thought would be a wide-ranging objective debate on air transport and the interests of the Australian public has turned out to be basically a diatribe against the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) and one of the commercial operators in the domestic air transport scene in Australia. There has also been a diatribe against departments and their officers. One reason for this is the fact that the Department of Transport did not provide evidence to the Holcroft inquiry, the Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares. I think the Department of Transport would concede the fact that it was very late with its submission but I think it must also be known that all through the inquiry it co-operated with and provided information to the Holcroft committee. A similar situation applies to the Bureau of Transport Economics. As I understand it, it never intended to put in a submission. The figures that it prepared for the domestic air transport review had been available all the time. Officers of the BTE were also seconded to assist in the Holcroft inquiry. Criticism has been made of the Department of Transport for not disclosing commercially confidential financial and operational statistics. As I understand the situation the Department is not at liberty to disclose those figures without the permission of the airlines involved. In any case, there was nothing in the world to stop the Holcroft inquiry from going to those airlines and obtaining from them the particular figures that were needed. There have been criticisms. Some are justified but many are not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> If we want to look at the interests of the Australian air travelling public we have to look at the scenario in which the airlines operate. Australia is a land with a population slightly in excess of 14 million people and an area of 7,682,000 square kilometres. Unfortunately, 10 million of those people-70 per cent-live within 35 kilometres of the coast. We have problems with some of our States. For instance, the Northern Territory has a population of only 115,000 people spread over 17 per cent of Australia's land area. Australia is generally recognised as one of the most urbanised countries in the world. The average urban population of member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development is 86 per cent. Only three OECD countries have a higher urban population-Belgium with 94 per cent, Iceland with 87 per cent and the Netherlands with 88 per cent. But, of course, not one of those countries would make a fair sized cattle station in western Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me compare my own State of Queensland with Victoria. I single out those States because I know Queensland and the problems it has. Queensland has a smaller population than either Sydney or Melbourne yet it has nine jet airports operating every day of the week and numerous airports to take aircraft of F27 standard. In Victoria there is one major domestic airport and a few cricket fields scattered around the countryside from which commuter airlines operate. Australia has these problems. </PARA>
<PARA> As against that, there are the economies of scale relating to airline equipment. I have instanced those in previous debates in the Senate. Whereas one airline might have 11 Boeing 727-200 aircraft, a comparable airline in the United States of America probably flies 100 of those, plus Lockheed Tristars, DC8s and whatever else. We do not have those economies of scale in airline equipment. The same position applies to staff. I really think the airlines could do better in their pooling of resources or having another company handling their aircraft in country areas. But we have places such as Rockhampton-my home town-and Alice Springs where we have two companies which have two lots of staff to handle a small number of aircraft. If the traffic density and throughput of aircraft were there, the same number of people could probably handle four, five or six times the volume of aircraft that they are currently asked to handle. </PARA>
<PARA> The form in which this matter of public importance is framed presupposes that the Australian travelling public is hard done by. The question is: By what criteria do we judge that matter? All honourable senators in this chamber, in the pursuit of their duties, are privileged to travel overseas. That travel gives us an opportunity to study how other airlines operate, how the average passenger is treated and how the various fare structures stand up. I think that taking into consideration all the constraints that I have mentioned, most of us would agree that our service is pretty good. It has been generally recognised for some time that our air fares, on the short haul trips, are below those of America and our air fares on long haul journeys are above these of America. In the last few years that situation has been remedied. As a matter of fact mention was made here of the claim that Western Australian senators are not taking part in this debate. Of course only a limited number of senators can take part in this debate but in the period that I have been a senator, the Western Australian senators have put the case quite strongly to illustrate the disadvantage suffered by people travelling to and from their State. That fact was acknowledged long before Fair Internal Air Fares-or whatever pressure group is pressuring them-saw the light of day. Western Australian senators were doing the right thing in this chamber by their constituents. </PARA>
<PARA> From 1974 onwards, it has been generally recognised that this disadvantage existed. Since then, every time that a fare increase has occurred the flag fall charge has risen at a higher rate than the charge for the distance component. Thus passengers travelling on the long haul routes-whether to Perth, Cairns or Darwin-were disadvantaged. Fares to these places have slowly come back to a price that, in the circumstances, is more reasonable. If honourable senators compare American fares with our fares, before deregulation, on similar distances, they will see that our respective fares are line ball. So again I ask: By what criteria do we judge our fares? If honourable senators look at fares in Great Britain or the Continent they will see our fares are considerably lower, despite all the problems that we have in servicing a country the size of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Both Senator Button and Senator Gietzelt have laboured us with a fair bit of criticism-to put it mildly-yet I never once heard an alternative plan. I never heard them say that we were badly done by in comparison with other standards. Nor did they give any indication whether they had a plan, and how it would benefit the travelling public in Australia. They were rather light in making suggestions in that area, but that is part of what we get used to here. Sometimes we do have a good, informative, and objective debate. Unfortunately, this debate deteriorated with the first Opposition speaker and the second Opposition speaker did not help him raise the standard. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators have made much of the use of Qantas Airways Ltd to fly domestic passengers to Perth and Darwin. Let us briefly look at this proposition. Firstly, if Qantas can guarantee 2,000 empty seats across Australia every week, it is flying the wrong aircraft. I have spoken before and not without some justice in this chamber about the hangups that airline companies have on commonality in air frames and engines. At least it is pleasing to see that Qantas has departed from that approach. I repeat that, if Qantas can constantly guarantee 2,000 empty seats across Australia, it is flying the wrong aircraft. The 747 is a magnificent aircraft which has a very low seat kilometre cost but, if Qantas is consistently flying with a large number of seats empty, those costs are not there for Qantas to utilise. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="C67">Senator COLLARD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If honourable senators look at the domestic problem they will see that Darwin and Perth are served by smaller aircraft which gives them a greater number of services. If we put 747s on that route as Qantas suggested in its submission to the Holcroft inquiry-and we know that it has two spare 747s which it cannot sell-we will see a reduction in the frequency of services. I do not think that is what service is all about. Of course we have the attendant problems of how to differentiate between international and domestic passengers when they go through customs and immigration. Qantas would find that it would have those problems at either end whereas now we just collect our baggage, get off the aircraft and go. So there are many logistic problems in that proposal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Again I return to the problem that I look upon frequency of services as an important element in airline services. If we use that excess capacity, what happens when Qantas is delayed overseas? What happens if there is fog at Heathrow airport or an aircraft loses an engine at Bombay? Do we expect domestic carriers to fly empty aircraft there to pick up passengers? What will that do to our air fare structure? There are lots of problems and it is not as easy as it first appears on the surface to provide services to the outlying areas of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> The tone of the debate on the two-airline agreement seems to indicate that the two-airline policy primarily is to protect two airlines. Undoubtedly that is what happens but, as far as I am concerned, the two-airline policy is there to provide a regular, stable, scheduled service to all of Australia. What is the alternative? Of course the alternative is deregulation involving all the problems that we are hearing about from the United States. Frankly I do not think we can afford that. We could not afford the upset in the scheduled services. We want to provide services in a country that relies tremendously on air transport. As honourable senators can imagine, we could not afford the disruption of employment with new firms starting up and going to the wall. In America a large number of cities which have a far greater population than our provincial cities are now going without trunk services. This is a cause for sober reflection. Admittedly, in some instances this matter is being taken up by commuter airlines which use smaller aircraft with a higher seat kilometre cost. This is happening and it has caused major disruptions in a country which has a far larger population than we have. Of course if that procedure were superimposed on a scenario such as we have in Australia, I think the problems arising from it would be something that any government would find very hard to live with. </PARA>
<PARA> Briefly I touch on a couple of aspects of the Holcroft inquiry. Figures have been taken out-I have heard them broadcast-which indicate a $200 reduction in the air fares to Perth and Darwin. I am referring to the figures on page 275 of the Holcroft report. Unfortunately, what has not been taken into consideration by the people using those figures is the first note (a), which states:</PARA>
<PARA> The calculations are based on 1979-80 jet network average cost and traffic data. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course there have been changes in the statistics, operating costs and air fare structure since 1979-80. It is significant to note that part of the major changes that have been involved include the fuel component, which is part of the distance component, that has gone up. We cannot possibly give credence to the idea of the $200 reduction. I am not denying that consideration of the next rises should take into account the fact that the rises should be greater on the short haul routes. Much has been said about cross-subsidisation. I do not think there would be an airline in the world which could completely abandon cross-subsidisation. It would be pretty hard to work out. </PARA>
<PARA> Much has been said about the figures on page 208 of the inquiry's report. What the figures do not take into consideration, as I understand it, is the fact that there are many multi-stage journeys. My journey from Rockhampton to Canberra is a multi-stage one. Those multi-stage journeys during which the aircraft lands and takes off again do not contain a second or third flag fall component. The Holcroft inquiry has rightly addressed itself to this problem. The inquiry has said that where there is a need for a second or third flag fall component it should be absorbed by the whole network, not by the people who are making multi-stage journeys. In effect, the report indicates that there is cross-subsidisation and that it should be reduced and, at the same time, it indicates that there should be further cross-subsidisation. Taking that into consideration, the figures on page 208 should be looked at in a different light. Indeed, I would question whether they are accurate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Honourable senators have just heard a very thoughtful speech. Senator Collard obviously has studied the matter in some depth and is an expert in many of the fields covered by the report of the Holcroft Independent Public Inquiry into Domestic Air Fares. However, I beg to differ with his judgments, although I respect his knowledge of the facts. The Senate is debating a matter of public importance about the failure of the Government to administer the airlines system in the interests of the travelling public. One could canvass the truth of several aspects, but I will name just two. One aspect is the shameful, disgraceful parallel scheduling of flights which has been allowed by weak Ministers of the Parliament, both Labor and Liberal, over a number of years. It is disgraceful and absurd.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Many times I have spoken to senior executives of both Trans-Australia Airlines and Ansett Airline of Australia over an informal lunch and I have said to them: 'A strong Minister-a Minister who had the guts to stand up to you-could force you to change parallel scheduling virtually overnight and you could come to some arrangement'. On every occasion I have had some sort of smiling acknowledgment from them that that would be possible. The absurdity of a situation in which two aircraft take off for a point thousands of miles away within five minutes of each other and land there within five minutes of each other needs only to be stated to be appreciated. I shall say no more about that. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, there is the question of price, of how people in out of the way areas, particularly in Western Australia, have been savagely disadvantaged over a great period through the process of cross-subsidisation. The Holcroft committee confirmed the worst suspicions of Western Australian senators with the disclosure that cross-subsidisation had cost passengers-essentially Western Australians-an additional $19.8m in 1979-80. I pay a compliment to the Western Australian senators because it was essentially their activities, their concern for Western Australians and their realisation of the political implications of the forthcoming Senate election to Western Australia which virtually caused the Government to establish the Holcroft committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me give the scenario. It was an election year. An organisation in Western Australia called the Fair Air Fares Campaigners and the Australian Democrats were getting considerable publicity for their claims about the injustices being done to Western Australian travellers vis-a-vis those who live on the east coast. The Western Australian Liberal senators-quite properly, quite cleverly and quite courageously-confronted the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and said that something had to be done. The Prime Minister, in the early part of 1980, established the Holcroft committee. That is the history of the arrangement. The election was then won, a Western Australian Liberal senator scrambled home by the skin of his teeth, and the Prime Minister then saw no justification for having the Holcroft committee continue. I shall quote from the Australian Financial Review of 4 March a report by Ali Cromie which has been confirmed by journalists such as Peter Bowers. There seems to be no doubt that Mr Hunt gives everybody to understand that the report was due in June or July 1981. I think Mr Hunt concedes that. The impetus for containing the inquiry almost certainly came from the Prime Minister. The report in the Australian Financial Review states:</PARA>
<PARA> Another Western Australian Member said that at the meeting in the Prime Minister's office on November 26, the Prime Minister asked Mr Hunt when the Holcroft inquiry was due to report. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hunt had replied 'June, July or thereabouts,' he said. </PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister then said 'Ralph, tell them to report by January 31,' the Western Australian Member said. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hunt did tell the committee that. The report further states:</PARA>
<PARA> This account of the meeting was verified by a number of Western Australian Members yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a pretty shameful way in which to treat three very distinguished people who gave their time to report on a matter of some significance. It is an act of total political cynicism by the Prime Minister-not by the Western Australian senators but by the Prime Minister-to the Western Australian senators and to the people of Western Australia. One could comment that during the course of the inquiry the Holcroft committee got too close to the truth. It was exposing the question of cross-subsidisation in a devastating way, according to Peter Bowers. It exposed the myth of competition between TAA and Ansett, and denounced the two-airline policy as merely ensuring the preservation of a duopolistic situation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Holcroft committee then called the Department of Transport nothing more than a rubber stamp and mentioned other matters very close to the truth. That was obviously untenable to Mr Fraser as he won the election and won the fifth Senate seat in Western Australia. Perhaps the rudest and crudest act was the signing by the Government of a new airline agreement for 10 years while this committee was receiving evidence and determining its report. I find it to be an almost unbelievable discourtesy and rudeness for a government-I do not blame Mr Hunt; he was obviously acting on the instructions of Cabinet-to do that sort of thing and say to a committee which it has set up: 'Please give us your valuable time so that we can help'. The committee's report also is devastating in regard to the total lack of co-operation given to the committee by Ansett and by the Department of Transport. </PARA>
<PARA> All I have just said is known. What can be done and what should be done now? As far as the airline policy itself is concerned the Press seems to feel that long haul air fares will now be lowered at the expense of short haul air fares. We are all for that, but surely, bearing in mind the exercise of the Holcroft inquiry, the courage of the Western Australian senators, the support on this side of the chamber for a new look at an airline policy, it is just not good enough to bury it like that. I hope that Western Australian Liberal senators will show the courage which they have shown to this point and not just be bought off by a small matter such as that. That is what Mr Hunt said six months ago. I should think they ought to settle for something much better. There are alternatives. </PARA>
<PARA> I have a copy of the Airlines Agreements Act 1952-1973. The Senate will be interested to know that it is a simple piece of paper which states that the agreement between the Commonwealth, Ansett and TAA is approved. The Act is a remarkably simple thing. There are schedules to the Act which are very complicated and very detailed and which set out the various agreements. Section 1 of Schedule 1 states:</PARA>
<PARA> This agreement shall have no force or effect and shall not be binding on either party unless and until it is approved by the Parliament of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>That would mean in simple terms that the Senate will expect a Bill of that description to come before it within the next few weeks because the Government has an obsession with rushing this legislation through Parliament and ratifying this agreement before the newly-elected Senate meets after 1 July. I am sure that members of the Australian Labor Party will not ratify this agreement without some sort of a fight. We will not want to involve party politics in this matter. We hope that senators on the Government side-particularly the Western Australian Liberal senators-will be able to hold up the ratification of this agreement at least until we have some more information. Several options are open. For example we could set up a Senate committee to take over the unfinished work of the Holcroft committee. That appeals to me because I believe that senators of all parties have done splendid work in this area. I am not satisfied with the work of the Government back benchers committee which was set up although I applaud the Government members for involving themselves in that way. But that is not good enough because members do not have the power to call evidence or to force witnesses to attend. We want the Holcroft committee's work to be at least completed. I ask whether it is possible-after reasonable apology to the members of the Holcroft committee-for the Government to ask that that committee be reconstituted, to continue taking evidence and to continue with its report. Of course, that would be the most ideal situation. If this is not possible should the work of the committee be substituted by the creation of a royal commission? The Australian Democrats would not be opposed to that although we lean to the view that it should be members of Parliament, preferably senators, who complete the work of the committee. </PARA>
<PARA> We would like to see questions such as the merger of Qantas Airways Ltd and TAA taken as part of the terms of reference. I would like discussed the points Senator Collard raised such as the impossibility of filling the seats between Perth and Melbourne. I say that this is difficult and of course it is difficult. Of course there are problems, but the job of government is to overcome problems. It is inconceivable that we should have so many spare seats in aircraft flying east-west and west-east each day of the week. During the last election campaign when Mr Jack Evans and the Australian Democrats were leading the push to have air fares examined, Western Australian Liberal Party senators adopted a slogan, 'Only Liberal Senators will truly represent Western Australian interests'. We should not put too fine a point on that. I promise Western Australian senators that within the next few weeks they will have that opportunity to stand up in the Senate and be counted when the agreement comes into this chamber for ratification. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to this matter of public importance, it is a pleasure to defend the fine record of not only the present Government but also of Liberal-National Country Party governments through the years since 1956, because we can see quite clearly and without any ambiguity what the consequences of that policy have been. The end result of the policies followed by this Government is that this country has one of the finest airline systems in the world, if not the finest system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I would like to speak to the substance of this matter of public importance which deals not only with the two airlines agreement or the internal airlines of this country, which I think is a rather peripheral part of it, but also with the external airline-Qantas Airways Ltd. </PARA>
<PARA> Out of courtesy, I would like to deal briefly with some of the points made by Opposition senators on this matter. Senator Button dealt rather tediously with minutiae and irrelevancies. He persisted in his habit of failing to focus and to discipline the very fine intellect that he undoubtedly possesses. Both Senator Button and Senator Gietzelt seemed to be obsessed with Rupert Murdoch. Do they really believe, now that he owns the Times, the Sunday Times and the News of the World, that a dreadful fate will befall the British Labour Party? What a tragedy for them that the British Labour Party is already in the state of disrepair that the Australian Labor Party is in. Senator Gietzelt dealt with the same sort of irrelevancies as Senator Button. It was an undisguised attack on Ansett Transport Industries Ltd and its principals, Mr Rupert Murdoch and Sir Peter Abeles. We heard repetitively the theme of how they were operating against the Australian Labor Party and its policies. What are these people saying? Are they really attacking the two-airline policy? Are they really saying that we need only one airline in this country? Are they saying that they want to see applied the socialist theories and practices which have been applied in Europe and which have taken countries such as Sweden and the United Kingdom to their present levels of economic incompetence?</PARA>
<PARA> We want to see some competition in Australia. We want to see private enterprise operating wherever possible to provide goods and services for the people of Australia because that is our insurance that in the long term those goods and services will be provided in the most efficient and economical manner possible. Senator Chipp was a bit more temperate in his attacks on Ansett, but apart from the matter of parallel scheduling, he dealt mostly with the report of the Holcroft inquiry. With respect to Senator Chipp, this debate is really not about the report of the Holcroft inquiry. It is a debate on the whole question of how airlines serve the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to take a minute to deal with parallel scheduling because clearly it is a matter of annoyance to the Australian people. We have to look at how the two-airline policy has operated in the past when the stipulation that the airlines possess equipment of equivalent capacity and had equivalent fleet sizes led to a situation in which economics dictated that to achieve maximum utilisation of that equipment the airlines had to resort to parallel scheduling. They cannot keep aircraft sitting on the ground and use them for a small portion of the time, particularly in a country such as Australia where all airlines are subject to a curfew at most jet airfields. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has recognised that and times are changing. A very significant event occurred last year when there was a departure from the concept of equivalent fleet equipment in that Ansett and Trans-Australia Airlines made different judgments of what was best for the market. They have now bought aircraft of different sizes. A consequence of that, to provide the economic viability that the airlines need, will be different flight schedules for the Australian people. The Government can take the credit for that because its policy allowed the airlines to depart from the parallel equipment purchase concept. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me deal with the substance of the matter of public importance. What are the best interests of the Australian travelling community? The pre-eminent concern is safety which is something that the Australian people take as a matter of course. When one gets into an airliner, one automatically believes that one will reach one's destination. Everyone in this chamber knows that because no group in Australia uses aircraft and air travel more consistently than members of this Parliament. Air safety in Australia is at a very high level and I doubt that it could be lifted to a higher level. I hark back to the theme put forward years ago by the then Department of Civil Aviation-'safety is no accident'. </PARA>
<PARA> Safety is the consequence of a very complex sequence of events-an attitude of mind of a large group of people, training, economics, the selection of equipment and, above all, the way the government of the day exercises its regulatory control so that safety at all levels is ensured. It is quite impossible to take so complex a situation as the Australian airlines system and de novo impose on it by regulation something that leads to absolute safety unless it has been built up meticulously over the years bit by bit. </PARA>
<PARA> At present that safety is being compromised, not by the Australian Government but by the unions. I refer to the wildcat strikes over the last few years by the Storemen and Packers Union and the Transport Workers Union and their refusal to supply fuel to aircraft at certain airports around this country so that aircraft are consistently operating with higher loads than they need bear to overfly refuelling points to get through their route schedules. This leads to an intangible degradation of the safety of the airlines. What have we heard about this from the ALP? We have heard not a bit, because honourable senators support those same unions. Furthermore, not only are aircraft operating with unnecessary loads but also there is the disruption of the whole of the operational cycle, which comes from operating an airliner on a route while not knowing where the fuel supplies are, and the consequent disorganisation. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point in relation to the best interests of the community concerns the frequency of schedules and the very real convenience that comes from the multitude of schedules that are available throughout the Australian airline system. There is an economy of scale in airline travel-the larger the individual aircraft, by and large, the less is the cost per seat mile. But the larger the aircraft the less frequent is the service and, in one sense, the consumer suffers. That is one of the worries about the move to wide-bodied aircraft for those of us who live in the outlying States of Queensland and Western Australia and in the Northern Territory. Australian travellers have the luxury of a wide variety of schedules when they choose to fly. </PARA>
<PARA> Another important point in the interests of the consumer relates to the efficiency of transport. Here I am talking about the speed factor. Since 1956 Australian airlines have operated the most modern equipment in the world. That has been a consequence of the progressive and far-seeing outlook of Liberal-National Party governments during that period. It is no accident that that has occurred. If we look at other countries where governments have dominated airline transport with a monopolistic one-airline system, we will frequently find that the equipment that is used in those countries is 10, 15 or 20 years older than the equipment that is used in the more advanced countries. The fact that Australian airlines in their choice of equipment are viewed by other airlines in the world as a guide on what to buy is hardly a sign of incompetence in Government policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Another important factor in the interests of the traveller is reliability. The record of on-time departures of Australian airlines is excellent and again that reflects on the policies that the Government through its regulatory authority has exercised over the airlines. The only exception to that record of reliability of any statistical significance is where the unions have intervened and have withheld their services or have taken strike action to prevent aircraft from flying. We have had a very strong lesson of this behaviour over the last month in the dispute involving Qantas Airways Ltd and the secondary boycotts that have flowed from that and which are probably still in operation through the actions of the Australian Council of Trade Unions. I am pleased that the Government stood behind the Qantas management and reaffirmed the right of Qantas management and the management of TAA and Ansett and every other airline operator in Australia to use volunteer staff labour when they are held to ransom by irresponsible unions. If the airlines did not have available to them that facility-a facility that has existed ever since airlines started flying operations in this country-passengers would be locked up in aircraft, unable to open the doors, quarantinable garbage on overseas flights would be unable to be removed, toilets would not be cleaned and aircraft would be unable to be fuelled. The public cannot be held to ransom in this way. It is the duty of management to manage-not the unions or the stewards. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the position of the Australian Labor Party in this problem? I would have thought that this discussion would have been the very last that the Australian Labor Party would have brought up in this place because it links the Australian Labor Party indissolubly with the actions of these irresponsible unions. Not one word has come from within the ALP about the way all of those travellers were held to ransom overseas. People without any budgetary allowance for such problems-by and large frugal people who had saved for years to go on an overseas trip-were being held overseas without any access to money, unable to pay for accommodation, unable to buy food and so on. </PARA>

This is what we heard: 'We do not want Prince Charles as the Governor-General'. No concern was expressed for the public at all.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The fifth point I raise relating to the interests of travellers is the provision of services at reasonable cost. Except for the long distance travellers, I think we have had a record of good costing of fares in this country. In addition, we have had aircraft provided that have been clean and attractive interiors. We have had a very high level of good cabin service. We have had a very efficient booking and ticketing service. In a country with a low population density like Australia and a very vast geographic area, that is no mean achievement at all. </PARA>
<PARA> The airline industry is a very complex industry. It needs continuous attention. It needs continual fine tuning. I have plenty of criticism in small detail on the way in which the airline system of this country operates but, undeniably, the Australian community and the Australian Government can take great pride at the level of Australian endeavour that is manifested today in the airline industry. This country was one of the pioneering countries in airline transport. It is a fair claim to make today, as those of us who have travelled in other countries know, that we still maintain on our internal and on our external airline services a position of pre-eminence in the world in a field in which we pioneered.

The remainder of the report consists of a discussion of work methods of the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies; a description of some of the projects that the Institute has under way or is planning to undertake; and comments on a number of specific issues relating to the social impact of uranium mining in the region. </PARA>
<PARA> The Institute is undertaking a wide range of research activities in the region as part of its task of monitoring developments in the region as they affect Aboriginals. These projects include a compilation of a social history of the Alligator Rivers Region and its people; a number of censuses which will give a clearer picture of the population of the region, its composition and status; a survey of laws and legislation affecting Aboriginals in the region from the beginning of the century to the present; film and photographic records relating to the region and its population; and language studies. </PARA>
<PARA> I note with satisfaction that the latest report from the Institute indicates that some real progress has been made in dealing with those problems which have been commented on by the Institute in previous reports. For example, one of the more complex matters which is being dealt with is the development of satisfactory structures to handle the receipt and distribution of mining revenues received by Aboriginals both from the Ranger and Nabarlek projects. Aboriginals receiving income from the Ranger project have successfully established the Gagudju Association which effectively handles the distribution and investment of funds received. Moves are under way to establish a similar organisation for those people who are receiving payments from the Nabarlek project. </PARA>
<PARA> This matter has been taken up by the Northern Land Council together with the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, and officers of these two bodies have been meeting with Aboriginal people to determine the most appropriate type of organisation for this purpose and to work out methods of representation for the Aboriginals concerned. The Institute project team has made an important contribution to these discussions. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter which has been reported on previously is that of heavy traffic on the Cahill's Crossing to Nabarlek road. Whilst the report indicates that there is continuing concern within the community at Oenpelli about the use of the road, it is nevertheless pleasing to note that agreement has been reached between the Northern Land Council, local traditional owners, and Queensland Mines Limited to reduce future road traffic on that particular road. I am advised that the company has upgraded the barge landing at Wunyu Beach, and over 2,400 tonnes of materials have been brought over the landing, thereby reducing the volumes of traffic using the Cahill's Crossing road. Among other measures taken by the company to reduce traffic on this road are the utilization of an aircraft for general and cargo purposes and an increase in the capacity of some of the tankers using the road. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to draw to the attention of honourable senators comments made in the report regarding alcohol. The point is made in the report that the consumption of alcohol is not a preoccupation of the total Aboriginal community living in that region but is confined to a sub-set within the community. The report also indicates that club facilities at Oenpelli have been improved, and this has led to more acceptable and less disruptive drinking habits within the community. </PARA>
<PARA> The report draws attention to comments made by the Institute in respect of the Plan of Management for the Kakadu National Park. The issue of Aboriginal participation in the management of the park and comments by the Institute have been given due consideration by my colleague the Minister for Home Affairs and the Environment. Whilst the question of participation in park management has not been the subject of any representations from Aboriginal organisations such as the Northern Land Council, the Gagudju Association or the Gunbalanya Council at Oenpelli, the Director of the National Parks and Wildlife Service has indicated a continuing willingness to consult with the Aboriginal people with regard to this matter. The Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service engages in consultations with the Gagudju Association over a wide range of management matters. Recent discussions have been held regarding concern expressed by some individuals about housing, outstations and the culling of horses and buffalo in the park. </PARA>
<PARA> Another area of concern commented upon in the report is the intrusion into Aboriginal land of unauthorised visitors. It is, of course, necessary for people other than local Aboriginals to have permits to enter Aboriginal land. Following action initiated by the Standing Committee on Social Impact, the Committee-which is located in Darwin and comprising senior representatives of the Northern Territory Government, the Northern Land Council, the Institute, and my Department-held consultations with the Northern Territory Police, Aboriginals at Oenpelli, and officers of my Department. As a result of these consultations, a check-point and boom gate will be established on the road leading from the East Alligator River to Oenpelli. Members of the local community will man the check-point, with the support and co-operation of the Northern Territory Police. This will provide real control of road access into Arnhem Land from the west. In other parts of the region, the implementation of the Kakadu National Park Plan of Management will further assist in the control of visitors. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst in no way wishing to understate the difficulties with which the Aboriginal people are confronted in the face of extensive development in the uranium province, I am satisfied that there has been some very real progress made in dealing positively with those matters which are from time to time identified by way of these reports as problem areas. The Institute identifies these problem areas and the Standing Committee on Social Impact determines the action needed to deal with the problems identified. This scheme is ensuring that the adverse impacts of development on the local Aboriginal population have been kept to a minimum. At the same time, the local Aboriginal people are being assisted to ensure that, at a time of their choosing, they are in a position to take advantage of the economic benefits which flow to the Aboriginal people living in that region. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the papers. </PARA>
<PARA>I have moved this motion in relation to Item 2, the Conciliation and Arbitration Act 1904, guidelines relating to the provision of financial assistance under the Act, and Item 3, guidelines relating to the provision of legal or financial assistance other than under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> I welcome the appearance of the documents as an important contribution to the freedom of information and as a contribution to more open and rational decision making than has been the position in this area in the past. I have been nagging the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) to produce the documents ever since I have been a member of parliament and especially in a series of Estimates committee hearings over the last two and a half years. It is always to some degree satisfying as you, Mr Acting Deputy President, would be well aware, to see one's nagging bearing fruit, however belatedly. </PARA>
<PARA> Item 2 concerns financial assistance given under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act in respect of certain kinds of applications, namely, those under section 140 to challenge the validity of organisation rules, actions under section 141 to enforce a compliance with valid organisation rules and under section 159 to inquire into alleged irregularities in organisation elections-the organisations in each case usually being trade unions. Some quite substantial outgoings have been made in recent years under these various heads, in some cases notorious pieces of litigation like the long standing saga involving Messrs Egan and Maher and indeed in some matters in which I was personally involved as a counsel. The appropriation in 1980-81 for this purpose is put at $75,000 which is roughly in line with the kinds of outgoings that have been made available under these heads in the past. Whether, however, those outgoings both in the past and proposed for this financial year represent what should be the position so far as aid and assistance to individuals making challenges under the rules are concerned and are sufficient is a matter of some argument and certainly it is the view of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, which has been closely involved in endeavouring to consult with the Attorney-General in the preparation of these guidelines, that the outgoings have not been substantial enough and that the Attorney has adopted far too cautious and negative an approach in the granting of legal aid in this area. </PARA>
<PARA> The guidelines set out in the document are at first sight reasonably unexceptionable. They refer to considerations of hardship and considerations of reasonableness in all the circumstances of the case. They refer to aid being granted only to individuals rather than organisations and only to individuals to the extent that they themselves are not indemnified by organisations or anyone else. There are further provisions which identify additional criteria in this sort of language, for example, in paragraph 4.2 which reads:</PARA>
<PARA> In determining the amount of financial assistance to be granted regard will be had to what is considered to be a reasonable period in which to conclude the proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA>And again in paragraph 4.3 which states:</PARA>
<PARA> In determining whether financial assistance should be authorised regard will be had to the justice of the applicant's case in relation to the magnitude of the costs likely to be incurred by him in the proceedings. </PARA>
<PARA>There is an inevitable degree of vagueness in those sorts of phrases, but perhaps it is inevitable vagueness given the nature of the case, and I do not stop to take exception to the drafting on those grounds alone. I simply record my gratitude that considerations of this kind are being put openly on the record and identified as considerations which are to govern the discretion of the decision maker and, as a result, can thus be sensibly addressed by parties seeking legal aid. </PARA>
<PARA> I am concerned, and the ACTU and the Labor movement have been concerned, about the vesting of discretions of this kind in the Attorney-General, who may very well not be the best person to make sensible informed decisions as to what the justice of a particular case may be or what might be a reasonable grant of aid in particular circumstances. It has been the submission of the ACTU to the Attorney-General-a submission which I and the Australian Labor Party wholeheartedly endorse-that decisions of this kind ought not to be subject to the sole discretionary decision-making power of the Attorney-General; rather, they should be subject to the certification of the Industrial Registrar-he is the most administratively appealing-or some other figure in the industrial system who can be relied upon to have a sensitive and balanced understanding of what the merits of these sorts of cases are likely to be. For that reason, I regard the guidelines document as inadequate, requiring further consultation and further thought by the Government with a view to its revision. It is a step forward on the present situation, however, and I acknowledge it as such. I simply hope that the Attorney will follow through his originally stated intention of consulting with the National Labour Consultative Council, not going it alone but producing a jointly agreed set of guidelines rather than a unilateral set, which seems to be the case at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> Item 3 on the list of papers is a document which deals with all categories of financial assistance in public interest and test case litigation, other than that which is afforded through the normal legal aid system. It refers to grants of legal aid in Aboriginal Land Commissioner hearings, Administrative Appeals Tribunal cases, Security Appeals Tribunal cases involving Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, racial discrimination cases, Repatriation Review Tribunal cases, trade practices cases, and litigation arising under non-statutory schemes such as public interest and test cases, overseas custody cases, child removal cases and environmental cases. Simply to list the matters with which this guidelines document deals is to indicate just how important the guidelines are, and indeed how wide-ranging any detailed discussion of the document would need to be to touch all the points that should be made. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not propose in all the circumstances to engage on any wide-ranging discussion but simply to make one or two points that arise from the fairly superficial reading of this document that I have had time for. Again, we are dealing with what is potentially a very large area of government outgoings. Some $175,000 has been allocated for this purpose in the current Budget. I simply hope that that money at least will be spent, and that if it looks like being overspent the Government will not hesitate to make further appropriations available. In the last financial year, 1979-80, only $34,700 was spent at the Attorney's discretion in granting financial assistance in all these various categories. To my mind, that clearly demonstrates an excessive caution on the part of the Attorney in granting legal aid assistance in these sorts of cases, and I hope that the document before us foreshadows a substantial relaxation in the Attorney's attitude. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, on the basis of what has necessarily so far been only a superficial reading, the new guidelines seem to be generally more adequate and more acceptable than was the case with the conciliation and arbitration guidelines. Again, however, I wish to reserve any final position in this respect until there has been an opportunity to look at them in more detail. One particular area does stand out, however, as representing possibly a backward step in the provision of assistance by the Government, and I refer to that part of the document which deals with the granting of legal aid in environmental test cases, again a hugely important and growingly important area of public interest litigation. This is the one area in which it is possible to compare in detail the new document with existing practice because this is the one area in which a guidelines document has been formulated and circulated previously. A guidelines document was issued in 1978 by the Attorney-General's Department. A brief comparison between that earlier document and the current one is enough to give me some concern that a bit of a retreat, a bit of backward-stepping, is going on here rather than the forward-looking, more sensitive approach that one was rather led to expect by the Attorney's bringing forward this document. I refer to two examples of the sort of thing I mean. In the new guidelines provision, one of the bases on which the Attorney-General is to exercise his discretion, is described as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> The matter in issue should relate to preservation of the environment or wildlife from damage or destruction adverse to the national interest. Ordinarily the environmental issue will only arise in relation to Commonwealth activity or under a law of the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA>That is to be compared with language, on the face of it similar but in fact rather different, in the 1978 guidelines document, where the equivalent passage states:</PARA>
<PARA> The issue involved must arise within a Federal territory or under Federal law or, if within a State under State law, the issue should affect the national interest or such a substantial public interest as to be of national concern. </PARA>
<PARA>The key difference, of course, is that there is an explicit reference in the earlier document to environmental litigation under State law; whereas the present document, although that could be regarded as being indirectly subsumed in it to the extent that there is reference to litigation in the national interest, does not refer to litigation under State law. What concerns me, and it ought to concern the community, and certainly the Australian Conservation Foundation and the national environment protection movement, is the possibility that these new guidelines will be interpreted and applied by the Attorney in such a way as to limit and to refuse the application of financial assistance to environmental groups and individual litigants in these cases when the legal basis of their action is under State law. </PARA>
<PARA> These sorts of situations arise all the time because many environmental issues are ones that can be pursued at law only through State planning agencies, tribunals and courts. I have on my desk at the moment, and the Attorney will be aware of it, one such application in respect of an attempt to preserve from destruction a small area of parkland within the Dandenong Ranges. The basis of that application to the courts is very much State law, but it is argued that the implications involved for the national interest in the preservation of the Dandenongs are such as to justify a grant of Commonwealth aid. It may be that the Attorney is, and will continue to be, willing to grant legal aid in these cases where some nexus with a larger national interest can be established, but I am concerned, and I am sure many other groups will be concerned, at the removal from the guidelines document governing environmental litigation of the explicit reference to State law. </PARA>
<PARA> One other matter I point to as a further illustration of my concern is the reference to opinions being obtained by counsel as a precondition for aid being granted in environment cases. Paragraph 23 of the new document states:</PARA>
<PARA> Counsel's opinion as to the prospects of success of the proposed proceedings will ordinarily be required. </PARA>
<PARA>In the 1978 document there was a rather more substantial treatment of this issue in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA> Where legal issues are involved the applicant should additionally make available any solicitor's or counsel's opinions on the prospects of success if already obtained. </PARA>
<PARA>This is the key to the difference between the documents:</PARA>
<PARA> Alternatively, and by way of contribution, it may be reasonable to require the applicant to provide counsel's opinion on the prospects of success or it may be decided that as a preliminary step financial assistance should be granted to enable the applicant to obtain counsel's or senior counsel's opinion, depending upon the complexity of the case. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, what is being contemplated here is that a preliminary application for assistance in order to procure the initial counsel's opinion should be acceded to by the Attorney-General before the applicant actually commits himself or herself to embarking on litigation. As a practical matter, in the real world the financial assistance is often needed most at that threshold level when one is getting counsel's opinion to determine whether the matter can justify litigation. Again, it represents a step backwards if financial aid is not to be forthcoming in the future at this stage. It may be that the language of the new document is wide enough and general enough to cover that pre-existing situation. But I am worried and I think a number of groups with a real interest in this matter will be worried that the Commonwealth, despite surface appearances, is going backwards on this issue. </PARA>
<PARA> It is impossible to satisfy everyone in matters of this kind. It may be that on further examination I will be wanting to make some further representations to the Attorney-General and seeking even more substantial provisions than those which I have foreshadowed here today. I repeat that, generally speaking, my attitude and the attitude of the Opposition to these documents is one of approbation of the Attorney-General for bringing them forward and putting his cards on the table in this way. I repeat that this is one of the few occasions on which my main motive in rising has been not to blame but to praise. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator Missen. I had the benefit of receiving copies of the documents, but I did not receive them in sufficient time to have sent from my office in Tasmania detailed information which would have been most interesting to the Senate and, I am sure, to the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) concerning the operation of the guidelines. I do not have a vocadex machine in my office here, so the detailed information could not come up in that way. Bearing this in mind, I discussed this matter with the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Button. He indicated that he would not be moving for the Senate to take note of the paper listed for today and that the matter could be dealt with on the next day of sitting, which would be Tuesday week, at which time, of course, all of this evidence would be available. I agree with Senator Evans that cases such as the Egan case need elaboration and, indeed, exposure because a substantial amount of money was involved in that case.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have been corrected. I should have just said 'elaboration'. Other cases, including the plumbers case, need some elaboration. It must be said that very often the fault lies not with the complainants or with the defendants but with the court. The actions of the court in some cases do mean that costs escalate. The provision of detailed evidence on that must wait for another day.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As Senator Evans mentioned, the Attorney-General has budgeted for $175,000 for the provision this year of financial assistance by the Commonwealth other than under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. I believe that some of the guidelines have been laid down because of financial constraint. The money is not always in the bin. That being the case I cannot understand why the Attorney-General does not go ahead and ask for costs when costs are there for the asking. For example, in the recent case involving the Defence of Government Schools Committee an amount of between $250,000 and $500,000 must have been spent by the Commonwealth in defence of that case. The costs were there for the asking. As I understand it, the Commonwealth has not sought costs. The costs could have been obtained from both the relators and the plaintiffs. </PARA>
<PARA> Among the relators, of course, were stalwarts such as Ian Black, Wally Curran, John Halfpenny, and Bill Hartley. They are entitled to take their cases to court but they must do so having regard to the effect that that will have both on the question of justice which they are attacking and on the taxpayers. On the one hand, I cannot see why the Attorney-General permits the taxpayers to pick up the tab on behalf of the relators and plaintiffs in that case and on the other denies sufficient funds for appeals relating to Aboriginal Land Commission hearings, Administrative Appeals Tribunal cases, Security Appeals Tribunal cases, racial discrimination cases, repatriation appeals tribunal cases, trade practices cases and the cases involving various non-statutory schemes. The mind boggles at why the Government cries poverty when it comes to those cases and does not apply for costs when it wins a case.</PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I wish to make a few comments on behalf of the Opposition on the report prepared by the Institute of Aboriginal Studies on the social impact of uranium mining on Aboriginals. Obviously the topic is a serious and complex one. The Opposition is not at all happy that the social impact of uranium mining on Aboriginals is properly understood or, indeed, that its deleterious effects will be properly redressed. However, I welcome the opportunity to make a comment on this report because when the last report on this topic was tabled my predecessor in this responsibility, Mr Stewart West, was not given the opportunity to speak in the other place. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to comment on the distribution of mining reserves. The disbursement of funds resulting from the Nabarlek agreement is still fraught with difficulties, but investigations are currently being undertaken by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Northern Land Council. However, since the last report the Gagudju association has been incorporated. This association now has one full time employee, a legal adviser, and an accountant and has purchased the Cooinda hotel. It is in operation and its functions are expanding. We concede that all these matters are positive developments, but adequate machinery for the distribution of up-front money from Nabarlek has yet to be established. I point out that the report highlights the desirability of establishing an organisation such as Gagadju in the eastern sector of the Alligator Rivers region to handle the administrative arrangements. It is also worth noting that the report states that only seven Aboriginals are employed at Ranger and five by Queensland Mines Ltd at Nabarlek. Eleven of the 12 Aboriginals are employed in bush regeneration programs and one is an office worker. I make the comment that it seems that little benefit has flowed or will flow to Aboriginal people through employment in the uranium industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter on which I wish to make a few comments is the matter of consultation. The report points out that a survey conducted by the project director found a high level of confusion among Aboriginals concerning organisations and events in the Alligator Rivers region. Aboriginals who had held public office had a much higher level of awareness than those who had not. The Institute is to produce a directory of people and organisations in the region. But I stress that the effectiveness of consultation and communication with traditional Aboriginal people must continue to be an area of major concern and we are not satisfied at all that effective communication is taking place. </PARA>
<PARA> The Institute's major criticism of the Kakadu National Park plan of management was that there was a total absence of any executive or managerial role for traditional owners of the Park in the management of what is, in effect, Aboriginal land. A plan to that effect lapsed when the Parliament was prorogued and it has to be retabled in this Parliament. I urge the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) to take note of the importance of allowing traditional owners to participate in the management of the Kakadu National Park. Although I have received a letter from the Minister pointing out that he has received no representations from Aboriginal organisations regarding that participation, it does seem, nonetheless, to be a desirable development and one which the Institute of Aboriginal Studies has certainly endorsed. I hope that the Minister will give serious consideration to finding ways of allowing traditional owners to participate in the management of the plan when it is represented to the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> On control of land, especially as it concerns roads, the report pointed out that Aboriginal people were very concerned about non-Aboriginal encroachment on roads east of Cahill's Crossing and further and further into Arnhem Land. The Aboriginal people consider that the Ranger-Jabiru development is the cause of these encroachments. Next is the Oenpelli road problem. In 1980 the Minister informed the Senate that after consultation with traditional owners and the Northern Land Council the problem had been resolved. The Institute committee considers that continued heavy use of the road remains a problem and a major matter of concern to Oenpelli people. It is perhaps the most serious direct impact of the Nabarlek mining operation on the local Aboriginal population. To support the report in that respect I can say only that when I was in the Northern Territory recently I had several representations from Aboriginal people from that part of the Territory who were concerned that the encroachments were taking place and that the enforcement authorities were not acting to back up the Aboriginal people when they complained of encroachment. So I also ask the Minister to turn his attention to that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion I say that the Opposition welcomes the fact that this report has been presented to Parliament. It will be of continuing concern to the Parliament, and to the Senate, to see that the social impact of uranium mining on Aborigines is monitored and that where developments are seen to be deleterious some form of redress is taken. I think the Institute of Aboriginal Studies is to be congratulated for its report which is a thorough and constructive one. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I shall make a few remarks about the schedule of special flights for 1 July 1980 to 31 December 1980. I want to remark about some of the information I have been able to gather from that report in the short time I have had to look at it. In my view the guidelines as set out some years ago are not being strictly adhered to. As I have said before in this Parliament, I have no objection to any person travelling on VIP aircraft as long as everybody gets an equal opportunity to do so. Looking at the schedule and the flights of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) I see that members of his own party or of the coalition parties have travelled on a flight on one occasion and the Executive Director, Mr Eggleton, has travelled on three occasions. There might even be more occasions but I have been able to pick up only three. That is a matter to which I object. Looking at the names of passengers with Mr Hayden on the VIP flights I see that no candidates or executive officer of the Australian Labor Party travelled on those flights. If it is good enough for the Prime Minister to take members of parliament, that is members of his party, and his Executive Officer, Mr Eggleton, with him, particularly during the election campaign, then I say that that privilege ought to be extended to the Leader of the Opposition so that he too can take the National Secretary of the Labor Party with him on campaigns if he so desires. He may not want to but he should have the opportunity. </PARA>
<PARA> I am also concerned about whether, when Mr Eggleton travels on these VIP flights, there is, in fact, a recovery cost of the equivalent fare from the Liberal Party of Australia, in the same way as journalists and newspapers have to reimburse the Government when journalists travel on VIP aircraft. I have made the request in the Parliament on numerous occasions that when these manifests are tabled alongside the name of each passenger who travelled the occupation and qualifications of that passenger should appear. When one looks through the list, particularly at the pages referring to the Prime Minister, one can see that there is page after page of the names of passengers who travelled on some of those flights. It would take a couple of years to do some research in order to find out what their occupations are-whether they are candidates, journalists, members of the Liberal Party Executive or whatever. I have made this request before but apparently it has gone unheeded. I make the request again because taxpayers who are financing these flights are entitled at least to know who the Prime Minister carts around the country with him. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, I have been able to pick up three occasions on which Mr Eggleton has been a passenger. Those occasions were during the election campaign. The Government is very much opposed to the proposals put forward by the Labor Party that candidates ought to be financed by the taxpayer according to the number of votes the party receives. Government members violently object to this proposal but they are not adverse to carting their own people around on VIP aircraft at the taxpayer's expense. They are not consistent. I put forward another proposal: Either these people do not go or the Government extends that facility to the Leader and Deputy Leader of the Labor Party. If they want to take some of the executive officers of the Labor Party with them when electioneering they ought to be able to do so, as the Prime Minister does. </PARA>
<PARA> When the VIP manifest was tabled last year I think I picked up that some members of the Prime Minister's own party travelled with him. On this occasion I was able to pick up the occasion on which Mr Katter, the honourable member for Kennedy, travelled from Canberra to Mt Isa and Senator Kilgariff and Mr Calder travelled from Canberra to Mt Isa and to Darwin. It may well be that there was no commercial flight on that day and that they were able to get back to their electorates very quickly. But my colleague, Senator Robertson, may have had to wait some days to get back to Darwin. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The original Human Rights Commission Bill introduced in 1979 was described at the time by all, except the Government's most blindly loyal supporters, as being weak, empty, superficial and dangerous. It has not improved since that time and the Opposition despairs that it ever will improve. In the language of the Women's Electoral Lobby in a recently issued statement, what is needed from a Human Rights Commission is something in the nature of a washing machine to clean up the nation's dirty linen. What we have, in contrast, is a not very efficient refrigerator doing no more than freezing at their present, not very extensive level, such limited rights as Australians already have and not doing anything to significantly improve the situation. The Opposition believes that this Bill should be withdrawn, rethought and redrafted. Copies of the Opposition's amendment to the motion that the Bill be now read a second time have or should have been circulated. It makes clear what the Opposition believes the deficiencies of the Bill to be. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave out all words after 'That', insert 'the Bill be withdrawn and re-drafted to provide for-</PARA>
<PARA> (A) its application to the laws and practices of the States and the Northern Territory;</PARA>
<PARA> (B) the full application, without the reservations and declarations embodied in Australia's ratification, of the rights contained in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights;</PARA>

<PARA> (E) the extension of the Commission's jurisdiction to enable it to enforce the rights contained in the U.N. Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women;</PARA>
<PARA> (F) the expansion of the powers and functions of the Commission to give it a more effective enforcement role, especially in relation to civil and political rights; and</PARA>
<PARA> (G) in relation to racial discrimination matters, the retention of the independent status and functions, and especially the power to report directly to Parliament, of the Commissioner for Community Relations'. </PARA>
<PARA>The 1981 Bill is, in all its essentials, the same as the Bill which Parliament spent so many days-18 in all-debating in 1979 and early 1980. There are one or two minor amendments of some utility. They are to require members of the Commission to disclose pecuniary interests, presumably an acknowledgment to the Bowen Committee of Inquiry Concerning Public and Private Interest, and to remove one basis for the Commission's refusing to exercise its jurisdiction, namely an applicant's lack of sufficient concern or interest in the proceedings. I have no doubt that Senator Missen and perhaps one or two other honourable senators on the other side of the chamber will make much of these sorts of changes in order to preserve something of their self-respect when, as it appears likely, they will not cross the floor in support of either this amendment or any of the potential Committee stage amendments that occupied our attention the last time around. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that, apart from the matters of this kind which are, as I say, of some utility, no basic concessions have been made to any of the fundamental objections to the previous Bill which have been expressed both on this side of the chamber and within the Government's own ranks, namely, its failure to extend to the States; its failure to create judicially enforceable rights of any kind; its failure to give the Commission any effective teeth; and its destruction of the status and independence of the Commissioner for Community Relations, Mr Grassby. </PARA>
<PARA> The only significant difference between the old Bill and the new lies in that group of provisions which extend the jurisdiction of the Commission to possible breaches of rights declared by the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of the Child and the Declarations on the Rights of the Mentally Retarded and the Rights of the Disabled, all of which are designed to defuse the abortion issue which ground this Parliament and indeed this Bill to a halt last year. </PARA>
<PARA> It must be said, although I say it to some extent with bated breath, that it seems this particular result-the defusing of the abortion issue-has been rather neatly and effectively secured by these new provisions. In the original Bill, of course, the focus was solely on the terms of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. No specific reference in the text of the Bill itself was made to the rights of the unborn or anything that could be construed as having relevance to the abortion issue. It was, of course, the intention of the Simon amendment, so-called, to build into the text of the Bill itself a reference to the rights of the child before as well as after birth. The text of the present Bill again contains no explicit provision with respect to the position of the unborn. But it does, as I say, extend in its operation to the Declaration of the Rights of the Child. The text of that Declaration is set out in the Schedule to the Bill, and there is one provision in the preamble of that Declaration in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA> Whereas the child, by reason of his physical and mental immaturity, needs special safeguards and care, including appropriate legal protection, before as well as after birth. </PARA>
<PARA>That is language which seems, on the face of it, to give each side some ice on which to slide. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is in the preamble. I will make that point clear in a moment, Senator. It gives each side the possibility of claiming something of a minor victory and that, after all, is the essence of a successful compromise. The anti-abortion lobby has some language to refer to relating to the protection of the unborn. On the other hand, those who, like me, think that abortion is none of the law's business and certainly none of the Human Rights Commission's business can console themselves with the thought that the language in question is almost completely meaningless and, to the extent that it does have any meaning, occurs only in the preamble, and does not create any substantive right. To the extent that it might be thought of as referring to the existence of some substantive right, it can be regarded as merely consistent with a familiar aspect of present Australian law, namely, that there is some legal protection for the rights of the unborn, quite apart from the abortion context, to the extent that a person who as a foetus was injured, for example, in a car accident, can after birth sue in respect of that pre-natal injury. As a result of considerations of that kind, it seems that neither side has any ground on which to get unduly upset as to either the presence or absence of what, to that side, are offensive provisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is one side effect of this extension of the jurisdiction of the Commission to the rights of children, the rights of the mentally retarded and the rights of the disabled. That is that we now have an extension of the Commission's function away from dealing purely with what might be regarded as the traditional civil and political rights-namely, freedom of speech, Press, assembly and association; the rights of people in relation to the operation of police power and the criminal process; rights to privacy; and rights not to be discriminated against-to what might be described as essentially social, economic and cultural rights. Those are the rights to education, social security, medical care, a decent standard of living and so on. These are the kinds of things which cannot be secured just by governmental goodwill or by a stroke of the legislative pen. Rather, if these sorts of rights are to be secured, that can be done only by some significant mobilisation of community financial resources. As a result, it is not strictly to the point to talk about these sorts of rights being enforced by the Commission, the courts or anyone else. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Missen" NAMEID="YL7">

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to get too bogged down in a semantic argument of this kind. I would say that they are human rights, but of a different character from the traditional civil and political rights which can be readily enforced by commissions, courts and means of that kind. These sorts of rights, although they are in another sense quintessentially human rights, are the kinds of things which, as I have said, demand something more than mere good will. They demand mobilisation of resources-a mobilisation which in the case of many Third World countries, with all the good will in the world, simply cannot be applied. In respect of these sorts of non-traditional civil and political rights a commission is limited essentially to the world of investigation, report, research, education and publicity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition believes that, given this extension which is clearly now envisaged for the Commission's basic activity away from the traditional civil and political rights towards the social, economic and cultural rights, there is at least one additional category of jurisdiction which the Commission now might usefully be given. After all, it is certainly arguable that it will have little else that is useful to do. That suggestion is that the Commission be given the power to investigate and report on breaches of the really big document in the social, economic and cultural rights area. I refer to the 1966 International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights which Australia signed on 18 December 1972 and which was ratified by this Government on 10 December 1975. As paragraph (D) of the amendment states, this document:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . includes guarantees of the rights to form and join trade unions, social security, an adequate standard of living, work, physical and mental health, education and to take part in cultural life . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The importance of these kinds of rights in the depressed conditions in which Australians currently find themselves can hardly be overstated. In compliance with Australia's obligations under this particular Covenant we have already reported at least twice to my knowledge to the appropriate United Nations body, submitting very substantial documents claiming a degree of conformity to the obligations contained in that Covenant. These documents amount to what can really only be described as voluminous apologias in which about the only positive achievements recorded are those that are left-overs from the Whitlam Government. I refer to community health services, aid to disadvantaged schools, the family law legislation and children's service programs of various kinds. </PARA>
<PARA> The sections on Aborigines in Australia's report to the United Nations on its conformity with the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights makes very dispiriting and unpersuasive reading, especially in the light of reports which appear from time to time-the most recent one, from the New South Wales Aboriginal Lands Trust, appeared yesterday-about the deplorable conditions in which Aborigines, not in the Northern Territory or somewhere in the outback but in north-western New South Wales, are now living. Also, it might be noted in passing that the section on juvenile offenders in Australia's 1980 report to the United Nations does not sit very easily with the announcement, again recorded in yesterday's Press, that the New South Wales Government is planning legislation involving up to three days' solitary confinement for young offenders committing so-called misconduct while in corrective institutions. </PARA>
<PARA> I simply make the point that there is undoubtedly plenty to do in this area of human rights and under the specific obligations created by that Covenant. Given that the Commission is the kind of Commission that it is under this legislation-without real teeth-and given that its jurisdiction has already been extended by this new Bill into the area of the rights of the physically and mentally disabled and the rights of children, it seems to the Opposition to be appropriate to take the extra step of giving the Commission a jurisdiction over this area as well. That is the substance of paragraph (D) of the Opposition's amendment to the motion that the Bill be read a second time. It is a suggestion to which we would hope to receive a very serious response from the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> Another significant specific extension of the Commission's jurisdiction which the Opposition, and indeed at least half the nation as well, would welcome, is the inclusion of the 1979 United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, a convention which was signed by Australia in July 1980 but which has not yet been ratified. Paragraph (E) of the Opposition's amendment is the one which specifically refers to this matter. I leave it to my colleague, Senator Ryan, who will speak later in this debate, to indicate what the effective enforcement by the Commission of the rights in this area would mean. She will also spell out, I hope, the Opposition's intention, especially if the Government should reject this amendment, to proceed later in the life of this Parliament with a private member's Bill on the subject of sexual discrimination and equal opportunity. However, all that being said, the heart and soul of this Bill remains the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. It is in respect of the crucially important rights in this area that there is still a disturbing litany of weaknesses in the Government's position. The first, most obvious and most notorious of those weaknesses is that described in paragraph (A) of the Opposition's amendment-that is, its failure to apply to the States and to the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA> It is obvious that while, as I will mention later, the Commonwealth Government itself is no slouch in infringing rights, the really large scale problems in this area are, have been and always will be in the area of the States. However, I will leave it to some of my later speaking colleagues to describe with the loving care and attention that they will undoubtedly give it, for example, the condition of political democracy in Queensland -in the Parliament, in the electoral system and in the ban on street marches, which still exists as a legislative proscription. I will leave it to my colleagues to talk about the incidence of racial discrimination which still exists in this country and which is particularly alive and well in Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory. I will leave it to them to speak on abuses of police power which are alive and well and amply documented in relation to Queensland in the Lucas committee report, in relation to Victoria in the Beach committee report and in relation to Western Australia, New South Wales and elsewhere in the country in the proceedings of numerous judicial hearings. I will leave it to others to talk about the condition of privacy which is very much at risk in every State and Territory in Australia except, in this instance, in New South Wales with its excellent privacy committee machinery which has been so successful in tracking down, identifying and resolving problems in this area. I will leave it to others, too, to talk about the condition of sexual equality which is very much at risk despite, in some instances, the existence of legislation right around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem of the application of this Bill to the States remains the most obvious single weakness in the whole Bill. Until it is remedied by the Commonwealth's adventurously using the constitutional power which I and the Opposition believe and always have believed is available to it under section 51 (xxix), the external affairs power, measures like this Bill will never be anything more than feeble, whimpering, half measures in the human rights arena. </PARA>
<PARA> A less obvious but equally spectacular weakness is that described in paragraph (B) of the Opposition's amendment. The problem here is this: When Australia finally got around to ratifying the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights on 31 August last year after the debate on this Bill in its first incarnation had been concluded, Australia did not do so on the kind of basis which has proved good enough for every other one of the 66 nations which have ratified the Bill. That is to say, it was not good enough for Australia to make, at most, a handful of reservations and declarations-in some instances for other countries there had been no reservations or declarations at all-about the application of the Covenant to Australia. What we did when we ratified the Bill was to do so with reservations or declarations of a significant kind limiting the extent of our enthusiasm for the rights in question. We did this in respect of 14 separate articles out of the 53 in the treaty itself. We refused to accept at all the application of the Covenant to the States-not a position which has been adopted by any other one of the federal nations which have so far ratified the covenant. We refused to accept the application of the one-vote one-value principle to our electoral boundaries. We refused to accept the principle of non-discrimination in the content of the law as distinct from the way in which it is applied. We refused to accept unqualified rights of privacy and we declared that our protection of the rights of free speech, assembly and association was already such throughout the country that 'the right is reserved not to introduce any further legislative provision on this matter'. </PARA>
<PARA> We had the hide to object to 14 separate articles. The only country to make more objections than us was the United Kingdom, with one more objection, making it 15. Most of those objections, when closely scrutinised, had to do with a concern about the parent country, the United Kingdom, not interfering with local laws and customs in what was left currently of its previously far flung empire. Thus, for example, the existence of some rather exotic marriage practices in the Solomon Islands was thought to be potentially offensive to a provision of the Covenant; so, in respect of that one of the 15 declarations or reservations to which I referred was made. But, in this respect, the United Kingdom, still being an imperial power, albeit a pretty tiny one these days, was in a special position not shared by Australia. Australia's 14 reservations are to be compared with an average number of reservations for all the other 65 countries put together of three per country overall. If one excludes, as it may be proper to do, the non-western European countries, one finds that in the case of the western European countries the average is six overall. That might be a more legitimate ground of comparison given that those countries tend to be more honest in acknowledging the rights that in practice they will not observe. So, even by that standard, even by drawing those kinds of lines and looking only at exactly comparable countries, we find that more than twice as many declarations and reservations have been made by us. </PARA>
<PARA> I regard that and the Opposition regards that as a matter not for any kind of pride at all in that we have finally ratified the document, but of national shame that we should have done so in such a shoddy fashion. Indeed, the Government, it appears, was only too happy to keep hidden the terms of that ratification, shoddy document that it is. It certainly was not overtly trumpeted. The terms of it became known to me only in answer to a parliamentary question on notice, the answer to which was given in early December last year. But we find that it is not the original list of rights as everyone expected and which was the case the last time round in this Bill that the Commission is being required to have regard to, to investigate and to report upon. The rights which are now within the Commission's jurisdiction are the shoddy, emasculated, residual list of rights-what is left over after those reservations and declarations, those 14 exceptions, have been taken out. It is just what is left over. It is not the full and original list. This represents a very significant limitation on the role of the Commission, one which has tended to go utterly unnoticed but one which will not go unnoticed so far as the Opposition is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's behaviour in this respect, in ratifying the Covenant on this emasculated and limited basis, is entirely consistent with its whole record and performance in the human rights area. I have been critical, in passing, of the role of the States in these respects but it is even easier to be critical of the human rights record of the Fraser Government itself. One has only to think that the Government which is now bringing us the Human Rights Commission Bill is, after all, the Government which brought us the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation legislation allowing effectively unrestricted spying on Australian citizens, which seems now to be the case with the endorsement, at least, of Mr Justice Wilson even if it was not obvious before that. It is the Government which brought us the creation of the new Australian Federal Police Force without simultaneous safeguards on the exercise of that police power in the nature of a detailed criminal investigation code. It is the Government which has brought the nation atomic energy legislation containing unprecedented penalties for citizens dissenting against uranium mining and processing. It is the Government which has brought us new narcotics legislation with alarming, unprecedented and insufficiently restricted new powers in the police and the courts. It is the Government which has brought us, as we all know, a mass of new industrial legislation of a savagery quite unprecedented in Australian industrial relations history. It is the Government which mounted, albeit in a bumbling and ineffectual way, a major exercise in the suppression of its conduct of the Defence papers case. It is a government which has been guilty not only of positive misdeeds but also of infringing human rights through omissions and inactivities. Particularly conspicuous in this respect has been the Government's failure-the now notorious failure-to use its constitutional power to protect the Aboriginal people of Noonkanbah from the deprivations of the Western Australian Liberal Government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We all have our failings, Senator, but I fear some of us have more than others. The other weaknesses of the Bill, and there are many, can be dealt with, honourable senators may be delighted to know, a little more briefly because they have been the subject of considerable previous attention in both Houses. I am referring to the subject matter of paragraph (C) of the Opposition's amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Bill. In that paragraph the complaint is made that this Bill does not create judicially enforceable rights; rights, that is, which will not only be the subject of investigation and report by the proposed new Commission but also will actually stand up in court; rights which will mean something when weighed against legislative enactments which infringe human rights, when weighed against executive or police behaviour which infringes human rights or attempts to bypass them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not appropriate that there should be judicial enforceability of all classes of human rights. I have already indicated in respect of social, economic and cultural rights that I do not think any reference to judicial enforcement makes any sense at all. But it is certainly appropriate for the full range of civil and political rights which are the essence of this Bill. That has been the Opposition's position all along. I summarise by saying that we believe that the proper approach here is to redraft the Bill in substantive form along the lines of the ill-fated 1973 Human Rights Commission Bill which was not proceeded with because of the opposition to it in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> Paragraph (F) of the amendment makes it clear that the Opposition believes that the Commission needs-again in the context of civil and political rights, where its role should be to do more than simply investigate and report-further powers, including more extensive powers of evidence gathering, more extensive conciliatory powers and powers to initiate litigation when particularly recalcitrant cases are involved. The Attorney-General (Senator Durack) acknowledged, in his second reading speech that this might be the next step in the development of the Commission, but the point is that the condition of liberty in Australia demands something more here and now than the limp, toothless, pussy-cat Commission which is before us in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I refer to paragraph (G) of the Opposition's amendment. Perhaps the most dangerous feature of the Bill is involved here. I refer to its emasculation of the independent status and functions of the Commissioner for Community Relations. Whatever the Government may say about the continuation of the formal powers under the Racial Discrimination Act, about their preservation in the structure of the new Commission-the Attorney-General makes these points in his second reading speech-the reality is that the existing Commissioner, Mr Grassby, is not to be made a member of the Human Rights Commission in the sense of being a full status commissioner. He will not retain the power to report independently to Parliament, as he has done so vigorously and effectively over the last five years. He will lose to the new Commission as a whole the power of deployment and detailed control of the staff resources notionally under his wing. These matters were debated at great length last year and in 1979 when the then Racial Discrimination Amendment Bill was debated and passed. I do not propose to repeat those arguments here in any detail. However, this point gives me an opportunity to state our attitude with respect to the other measure which is being debated cognately-the Racial Discrimination Amendment Bill 1981. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is, on the face of it, a small technical measure which merely changes a reference in last year's Racial Discrimination Amendment Act from the Human Rights Commission Act 1980 to the Human Rights Commission Act 1981. On the face of it, that is not the sort of thing anyone is likely to want to make a fuss about. But the reality is that because the racial discrimination amendment legislation and the legislation creating the new Human Rights Commission are so closely inter-related and involve as they do, the integration of the Office of the Commissioner for Community Relations into the Human Rights Commission, because that integration cannot proceed and will remain inoperative unless and until this small machinery measure is passed today and because the Opposition does not now, any more than it previously did, accept the basis on which that amalgamation is proceeding, it is our intention to oppose the Racial Discrimination Amendment Bill 1981 outright, as we did with its predecessor last year. </PARA>
<PARA> The Fraser Government is fond of posturing internationally on the human rights stage. Because it is thought to be to our diplomatic advantage to do so, we have been profoundly statesmanlike in talking about human rights abuses in southern Africa, some Middle Eastern states and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics. Equally, when it has been thought to be advantageous diplomatically, economically or militarily to ignore human rights abuses, we have resolutely turned a Nelsonian blind eye as a nation to those abuses, never more obviously than in the case of the Philippines and Indonesia and to a lesser extent in the case of Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand and South Korea. The same applies to the legislation before us today. The only reason Australia is enacting this legislation, the only reason that this Government is bringing it forward, is that the Fraser Government thinks that by doing so, by being seen to be implementing the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, we will be able to cut a better, more genuine, figure on the international stage. In the process we are hypocritically ignoring the real abuses which do exist in the Australian human rights scene, nowhere more obviously than in the States of this nation. In doing so we are showing, I fear, just how accurate was, for example, the statement on 26 January 1981 of the President of the Queensland Young Liberals, Mr George Brandis, who was reported as saying of the Fraser Government:</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government has got to get serious about its commitment to human rights . . .</PARA>
<PARA> Over the last five years there's been a lot of talk about the rights of the individual, and sadly little achievement. </PARA>
<PARA>I endorse those remarks that come from deep within the bosom of the party. The passage of this Bill, unamended as I fear it is likely to be at the conclusion of the second reading debate, will continue that unhappy tradition to which the President of the Young Liberals has referred. </PARA>

<PARA> It is not my intention to repeat the full range of criticisms which I made of this legislation when it was debated in 1979 and the analysis of it which I made on 8 November 1979, other than to say in relation to the criticisms that I have made about the non-application of this legislation to laws of the States that that is a position which I still hold and a position to which I will say something later in my remarks today. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be remembered in recalling the history of this piece of legislation that it foundered on the disagreement which developed between the Senate and the House of Representatives on the so-called Simon amendment. The Human Rights Commission Bill 1981 has come forward as a compromise proposal between those who thought that it was necessary to write into the legislation specific references to the rights of the child which other people interpreted as an attempt to write into human rights legislation some binding anti-abortion point of view and those who believe that it is unnecessary to make any reference to that particular subject within the terms of the Human Rights Commission Bill. The compromise that effectively has been reached has been to include within the Bill Schedule 2, which refers to the United Nations Declaration of the Rights of the Child, and, to pick up several other points of criticisms that were made, Schedule 3, which refers to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of the Mentally Retarded, and Schedule 4, which relates to the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of the Disabled. </PARA>
<PARA> I accept that as a perfectly fair and proper way in which to go about reconciling different points of view which exist in the Australian community. It is a perfectly fair and proper way to seek a balance between those whose opinions on human rights and the definition of the term 'human rights' differ markedly. As far as the Declaration of the Rights of the Child is concerned, the Declaration per se is one which I have always supported and have always thought was a perfectly proper declaration and I have no problem accepting its terms and indeed its spirit. The fact that I do not interpret all of the words in the declaration as meaning precisely the same as other people does not detract from my point of view. </PARA>
<PARA> The second thing I say about that declaration is that I believe it is important, whenever possible, to give some sort of domestic legislative effect to all of the international convenants to which Australia has become party. If we become party to international convenants or to United Nations convenants and declarations-whether they be the principal one with which this Bill is concerned or whether they concern the rights of the child, the rights of the mentally handicapped, the rights of the disabled or indeed international obligations under the Antarctic treaty or whatever it happens to be-I am in favour of giving them some form of domestic legislative basis. I think that this is something which has been accomplished by this Bill and is another reason why I support the proposal now before us. I next turn to the reservations made by Australia in the ratification process and, in particular, to the reservations which relate to Article 50. Honourable senators will recall that Article 50 states:</PARA>
<PARA> The provisions of the present Covenant shall extend to all parts of federal States without any limitations or exceptions. </PARA>
<PARA>In the ratification process the Australian Government declared as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia advises that, the people having united as one people in a Federal Commonwealth under the Crown, it has a federal constitutional system. It accepts that the provisions of the Covenant extend to all parts of Australia as a federal State without any limitations or exceptions. It enters a general reservation that Article 2, paragraphs 2 and 3 and article 50 shall be given effect consistently with and subject to the provisions in Article 2, paragraph 2. </PARA>
<PARA> Under Article 2, paragraph 2, steps to adopt measures necessary to give effect to the rights recognised in the Covenant are to be taken in accordance with each State Party's Constitutional processes which, in the case of Australia, are the processes of a federation in which legislative, executive and judicial powers to give effect to the rights recognised in the Covenant are distributed among the federal (Commonwealth) authorities and the authorities of the constituent States. </PARA>
<PARA> In particular, in relation to the Australian States the implementation of those provisions of the covenant over whose subject matter the federal authorities exercise legislative, executive and judicial jurisdiction will be a matter for those authorities; and the implementation of those provisions of the Covenant over whose subject matter the authorities of the constituent States exercise legislative, executive and judicial jurisdiction will be a matter for those authorities; and where a provision has both federal and State aspects, its implementation will accordingly be a matter for the respective constitutionally appropriate authorities (for the purpose of implementation, the Northern Territory will be regarded as a constituent State). </PARA>
<PARA> To this end, the Australian Government has been in consultation with the responsible State and Territory Ministers with the object of developing co-operative arrangements to co-ordinate and facilitate the implementation of the Covenant. </PARA>
<PARA>Whilst that might be a fair enough statement of executive judicial and legislative divisions of power within Australia, it seems to me, nevertheless, to shirk somewhat the responsibilities which one would have thought a national government would assume in terms of its relationship between itself as a national government and other national governments throughout the world. As I said on the last occasion when I was speaking on this piece of legislation, regardless of the catalogue of woes which Senator Evans would want to lay before the Parliament, the essential assaults on the civil and political liberties of Australian citizens are those assaults which occur as a result of State legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> It is State legislation-whether it be street march legislation, the right to tamper with mails, the right to intercept the mail of people in mental hospitals, or the disgraceful State mental health Acts around Australia-which is clearly the primary example of the way in which the citizen has his civil and political rights infringed upon. This criticism has been made, I think, quite forcefully in a recent statement put out by the International Commission of Jurists which has sought to make two points. The first point that it makes is that it believes, as I have said, that the assaults on the rights of the citizens which take place under State law should in fact be overridden by the Australian Government making use of the powers which it has under the foreign affairs head of power of the Constitution and through the operation of the Human Rights Commission. It also goes on to make a point to the effect that it believes, for a number of reasons which we will come to in a moment, that the way in which Australia has made its reservations are themselves contrary to law and, in particular, contrary to the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. Another point I wish to observe at this stage is made by way of criticism by the International Commission of Jurists. In its statement it reported:</PARA>
<PARA> We are critical of this reservation . . . It may, we believe, be regarded by other nations as 'fundamentally inconsistent with the object and purpose of the Covenant' so as to be legally void. Other nations may also decide to object to the reservations. </PARA>
<PARA>The statement then goes on to quote Mr John Dowd, a Liberal member of the New South Wales State Parliament who is also the president of the Australian section of the International Commission of Jurists. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Dowd pointed out that such other federal states as Canada, West Germany and India felt no need to attach a similar reservation when they ratified the Covenant. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that to a large extent, in terms of the protection of civil and political rights, one might be in a position to discount the views of the Indian Government from time to time. But I think the fact that comparable federal nations such as Canada and West Germany have not found it necessary to enter this federal reservation is a point which ought to be borne in mind and indeed a point which I think is legitimately criticising the attitude which the Australian Government has taken. The body of the International Commission of Jurists report goes on to state as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, in view of the fact that the subject matter of the Covenant concerns matters largely within State jurisdiction, implementation of the Covenant is and will remain in the hands of parties other than the party responsible for signing and ratifying the treaty. The only action that the Australian government will take is to consult with those states . . . </PARA>
<PARA> There is no undertaking implicit in this statement, which is simply concerned with administrative methods of communication. Nor does it affect the basic premise that in many areas implementation of the Covenant will be the responsibility of the States and that any co-operative arrangements will be made within this framework. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed, the Federal Attorney-General, Senator Durack, when announcing ratification on the 5th August 1980, stated as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Although they (the States) can't do so as a matter of international law, they are assuming and agreeing to the principles of the Covenant with the reservations that we are making. It is essentially up to those states and the Northern Territory . . . to exercise those responsibilities under the Covenant, insofar as it applies to their own laws and practices under them. </PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate to say that it is one thing for a State or for a Territory authority to say, with all due pious regard to the Commonwealth or to the Commonwealth Attorney-General, 'Yes, we give you our undertaking that we will observe the terms of the international covenant', when in fact we know full well that Governments such as those of Western Australia and Queensland have no intention whatsoever of abiding by some of the civil and political rights which are laid down as being appropriate in this international covenant. The International Commissioner of Jurists makes a point which I mention in this debate in the hope that the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) might be able to reply to it. I do so as a person who is not a lawyer but who accepts that a criticism is being made by the ICJ that I would like to have included in the record. If, in fact, the criticism is wrong, I would appreciate being advised in due course by the Attorney-General that the criticism is ill-founded. The criticism by the ICJ is based on its belief that the reservation made by the Australian Government is contrary to article 19 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties-and I quote:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . which preclude reservations which are incompatible with the object and purpose of the Treaty. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, if the reservation in effect amounts to a failure to perform the essence of the Covenant, then it may be argued that it is a breach of Article 27 of the Vienna Convention on the law of treaties which states that</PARA>
<PARA> 'A party may not evoke the provisions of its internal law as a justification for its failure to perform a treaty'. </PARA>
<PARA>Article 19 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties reads:</PARA>
<PARA> A State may, when signing, ratifying, accepting, approving or acceding to a treaty, formulate a reservation unless:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the reservation is prohibited by the treaty;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the treaty provides that only specified reservations, which do not include the reservation in question, may be made; or</PARA>
<PARA> (c) in cases not falling under sub-paragraphs (a) and (b), the reservation is incompatible with the object and purpose of the treaty. </PARA>
<PARA>I would value the Attorney-General's comment as to whether the criticism is legitimate. It is not that the ICJ alone makes the criticism. Mr James Crawford, senior lecturer in law at the University of Adelaide, makes precisely the same point regarding Article 19 of the Vienna Convention in a paper he has written. The paper states:</PARA>
<PARA> Even if Art. 50-</PARA>
<PARA>That is referring to the principal covenant-</PARA>
<PARA>is not interpreted to prohibit a federal reservation, similar considerations tend to show that such a reservation is contrary to the object and purpose of the covenant (including Art. 50). Such a reservation, in Australia's case, would exclude most of the important rights in the Covenant from the scope of direct federal responsibility, and would thus emasculate their force for Australia. Further, grave problems of reciprocity would arise. A unitary State would be in a fundamentally unequal position vis-a-vis Australia, since it would have no reserved State domain of its own to rely on. A federal State would need to determine whether the principle of reciprocity of reservations applied to its own reserved domain, or to the range of matters within the Australian State domain (as interpreted from time to time). It is not clear which would apply. </PARA>
<PARA>Then a most interesting point is made, particularly in relation to Article 50. Mr Crawford states:</PARA>
<PARA> A strong argument can thus be made for the invalidity of a ratification accompanied by a federal reservation. Even if this argument failed, or most States did not in practice object, it would be open to any present or future State party to object on its own behalf and to exclude its participation in the Covenant vis-a-vis Australia. It is not difficult to imagine the Soviet Union-there is an interesting point-(which sponsored Art. 50) making such an objection, in which case Australia would have no standing to challenge the Soviet Union's violations of the Covenant. Even if there was no such objection, Australia would be limited to protesting those Soviet violations within its central legislative authority (since the Soviet Union is itself formally a federation). </PARA>
<PARA> It seems then that a federal reservation could well be invalid, and even if it was not, would substantially dilute Australia's position and standing under the Covenant. It would thus tend to defeat the foreign policy purposes which impel Australian ratification in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA>I would like to hear the Attorney-General's comment on this. It has been remarked about places such as West Germany and Canada that no other federal states have made such reservations. Indeed, when looking at the operation of other international covenants, it is interesting to note specifically what section 64 of the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms states. It reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. Any State may, when signing this Convention or when depositing its instrument of ratification, make a reservation in respect of any particular provision of the Convention to the extent that any law then in force in its territory is not in conformity with the provision. Reservations of a general character shall not be permitted under this Article. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. Any reservation made under this Article shall contain a brief statement of the law concerned. </PARA>
<PARA>Despite that, European nations have managed without those sorts of reservations to enter into an effective ratification of the European Convention. They have established international judicial machinery under it. Even states like Great Britain have been quite happy, despite its historical tradition of separateness from Europe, to allow the European Court to pronounce on questions of civil and political rights in Great Britain and Northern Ireland. I also want to make the point that I regret the Australian Government has decided not to lodge a declaration under Article 41 of the Covenant. Such a declaration would allow the Human Rights Committee to receive and consider complaints made by one national government against another. Canada, New Zealand and a number of western European nations have made such declarations. Twenty-two nations have also ratified the optional national protocol to the Covenant whereby individuals may send petitions to the Human Rights Commission. Australia has not done so. I also ask the Attorney-General whether it is proposed at some future date to make a declaration under Article 41. If this is not proposed, why is this so? What is the current thinking behind the Government's decision not to lodge such a declaration?</PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make only one or two other brief points. The first is that perhaps if one does a little digging, one might find a little gold. A point is raised in the Bill-I make no more of it than to put it on the record-in respect of the functions of the Commission. Under the heading 'Functions of the Commission', clause 9(1)(c) states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . on its own initiative or when requested by the Minister, to report to the Minister as to the laws that should be made by the Parliament, or action that should be taken by the Commonwealth on matters relating to human rights. </PARA>
<PARA>I pose the question that if the Commission on its own initiative thinks that the Commonwealth should make laws regarding the position of, for example, Aborigines in the Northern Territory or Western Australia, does it have the right to come to the Commonwealth Parliament and the Attorney-General and make those recommendations? In other words, does the clause operate, in fact, to allow a little more scope than one otherwise would have thought?</PARA>
<PARA> I am glad to see the removal of what was clause 10 (4) (f) in the previous legislation. In the 1979 Bill clause 10 (4) (f), in relation to complaints, stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Commission may, in its discretion, decide not to hold an inquiry as a result of a complaint if-(f) the complainant does not have a sufficient interest in the subject matter of the complaint. </PARA>
<PARA>By the time the Senate had finished with the clause it read 'the subject matter of the complaint is not of sufficient concern to the complainant'. The Bill, in its third form, removes that restriction all together. I am glad to see that. I am sure that my colleague Senator Missen, who was instrumental in making that original change and pushing for its deletion would be pleased. I think that the amendment to the Bill in fact strengthens it. Having said how much I worry about the reservation made to clause 50, I want to say that there are three other reservations which I am very glad to see placed in the Bill. I am very glad to see the reservation regarding Articles 2 and 26 which is cast in such a way that it allows the Commonwealth to make laws specifically for the advantage of Aboriginal people. We say in the reservation:</PARA>
<PARA> The provisions of Articles 2 (1) and 24 (1), 25 and 26 relating to discrimination and distinction between persons shall be without prejudice to laws designed to achieve for the members of some class or classes of persons equal enjoyment of the rights defined in the Covenant. Australia accepts Article 26 on the basis that the object of the provision is to confirm the right of each person to equal treatment in the application of the law. </PARA>
<PARA>I think it right that we make that reservation so that our own laws which positively discriminate in favour of classes of people do not themselves come within the scope of critical comment. I am even more delighted by our reservation to article 19, which reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia interprets paragraph 2 of article 19 as being compatible with the regulation of radio and television broadcasting in the public interest with the object of providing the best possible broadcasting services to the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA>The felicitous inclusion of the phrase 'in the public interest' is one to which attention will be drawn time and again, I suspect, should any attempt be made to weaken the term 'public interest' as it appears in broadcasting and television legislation, which may be the subject, I understand, of some future concern to this Parliament. Having made the point in our own reservation that we are prepared to regulate broadcasting and television in the public interest, we will see the public interest become a central figure of debate elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> I make only one passing comment on the Racial Discrimination Amendment Bill. When the original Bill was last before the Senate, I was one of those Government senators who voted against the third reading. I still regret that our numbers were one short. Had we had one more, the numbers would have been equal and that Bill would not have succeeded. I do not resile from the views I had at that stage about the position of the Commissioner for Community Relations. I do not know whether I follow and accept the point put forward by Senator Evans, that is, that failure to pass this Bill at this time to change the references from the 1980 legislation into references to the 1981 legislation in fact has the effect that he claims. Therefore, I cannot see that the point he makes about dividing and opposing the Racial Discrimination Amendment Bill, which, as I said, only changes the date from 1980 to 1981, is a matter of substance in the way in which he put it. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by saying that I am one of those who is prepared to make progress slowly. To get something on the books which can be useful, which at a later stage may be the subject of expansion and the powers of which can be tested and to get a commission into operation and a piece of legislation in place, no matter how imperfect one thinks it may be, are an important first step. Therefore, I am glad to be able to support the passage of this legislation through the Senate. If the comments made on both sides of the chamber about the significance of using Commonwealth power to attain civil and political rights for all Australians, regardless of where they live, come forward once again and the States, despite the assurances given by the Attorney-General, do not play ball in terms of providing those civil and political rights for their citizens, I hope that as time progresses we can look to an expansion of the functions of the body which we will shortly be establishing, and, I hope, the Commission will have a great deal of success, a great deal of public support, a great deal of parliamentary support and a significant role to play within the Australian community. </PARA>

Certainly one feels that we have been through this series of arguments many times. Therefore, in the interests of expediting the passage of this legislation, which I believe to be extremely important, I do not intend to dwell on matters already covered by Senators Evans and Puplick. Suffice to say that I maintain, as does the Opposition, that the reach of the Commission in its being restricted to the Australian Capital Territory and matters arising under Federal laws, in the fact that none of the rights to be the concern of the Commission are judicially enforceable and in the fact that many reservations were given by the Australian Government when it adopted the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to my mind impair the efficacy of what we are doing. However, I believe the Bill ought to be passed into law as soon as possible in order that we may move from the limbo in which the Australian Government's response to the clear needs of the Australian people is at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>

I am anxious that this legislation, even in the truncated form that no doubt it will take, should pass into law as quickly as possible in order that we may move from the limbo in which Mr Peter Bailey and his staff are placed at the moment into a situation in which the Commission has the full status of being established by the will of this Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I confine my remarks on the Bill to the extension of the jurisdiction of the Commission to enable it to deal with a new series of declarations. In other words, rather than being confined to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the human rights to which the Commission may have reference are extended to include, amongst others, those rights which are recognised by such declarations as the Declaration of the Rights of the Child, the Declaration on the Rights of Mentally Retarded Persons and the Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons. I think that this is a very significant and important advance in this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate will recall that in September 1979 I introduced for debate a motion concerning the International Year of the Child. In that debate I said, amongst other things, that it was important that this Parliament, along with all the other Australian parliaments, took practical, concrete and effective steps to ensure that the child, the most vulnerable and defenceless person in the community, was given adequate protection, whether that protection be given by way of criminal law involving penal statutes, civil statute law enabling a child-or someone on its behalf-to sue for damages when some harm is done to it or by an encouragement of the common law in its growth in the protection of the child. I pointed out that in the preamble to the international Declaration of the Rights of the Child these words occurred:</PARA>
<PARA> Whereas the child, by reason of his physical and mental immaturity, needs special safeguards and care, including appropriate legal protection, before as well as after birth. </PARA>
<PARA>I pointed out then, as I repeat now, that in many instances our present legal system is deficient in ensuring that protection-not only in respect of the child after birth. I outlined some of the cases of child abuse, sexual abuse, including incest, and so on which we know occur in the community and which could detrimentally affect a young child. I also pointed out that our legal system inadequately dealt with the protection or securing of the rights of children who were born, for example, physically or mentally defective as a result of suffering some injury within the womb. For example, there is no national legislation and no accumulation of State legislation adequate to deal with a recurrence of the thalidomide incident. Honourable senators will recall that children were harmed in the United Kingdom, in this country and in many other countries as a result of their mothers taking a drug-I think it was a sedative-which had been inadequately or negligently tested and put on the market by the pharmaceutical company concerned. Certain damages were secured for the children as a result of a series of legal and political manoeuvres, but all the settlements, as I recall, were out of court and there was no actual testing in the legal sense of the right of the child to recover damages for an injury suffered whilst within the womb. </PARA>
<PARA> We know that some of the common law jurisdictions are moving in a way which enables a child or someone acting on behalf of a child to recover damages when a child within the womb is injured as a result of a car accident in which somebody else has driven negligently or in a blameworthy manner and injured the child, the child being found on birth to be defective as a result of the injuries. Much more difficult questions arise as to what should be the position, what should be society's response, when a pregnant mother negligently drives a vehicle and it is involved in an accident as a result of which the child within the womb suffers an injury. Then there is the case of a mother who deliberately defies medical advice and continues, while carrying the child in the womb, to take excessive alcohol or drugs of some form or misuses medication which impairs the physical or mental well-being of the child and that becomes apparent after birth. There are many instances of situations in which our community is inadequately responding to the need to provide legal safeguards for the child before as well as after birth. I hope that with those brief comments I have indicated that the matter goes well beyond the question of abortion which has occupied so much of the time of this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that what is attempted in this Bill is a correct response to the preamble to the Declaration of the Rights of the Child. I believe that Senator Evans may have made a comment which suggested that because the part of the preamble from which I have quoted is merely a preamble no human right is conferred. Of course, in speaking of the need to secure special protection for the child and the need to erect legal safeguards, it is recognised there that there is an obligation in the national community to provide those safeguards. Where one has an obligation one has a corresponding right. I think it is fallacious to argue that when in the Preamble an obligation is clearly cast on the national community corresponding rights are not also created in the child who, as I have said, is vulnerable and defenceless before as well as after birth. The merit of this legislation as opposed, for example, to the Simon and Martyr amendments which were moved on previous occasions, is that there is no 'too close' definition such as would be appropriate if we were dealing with a criminal statute. In that situation, in order to maintain our own integrity and to ensure that the community knew exactly what was being made subject to penalty, one would need to go into all sorts of arguments about conception and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> In this legislation we are dealing in a very proper manner with the matter of giving to the Commission a very general mandate, among other things, to inquire into and report upon when occasion arises the adequacy or inadequacy of acts or practices within the Federal sphere which impinge upon the rights of children whether before or after birth. It seems to me that this is entirely in harmony with the suggestions that Senator Lewis and I were making during debates on previous occasions. I believe that in this legislation we have the opportunity of which Senator Chaney spoke in his remarks on the legislation on a previous occasion. We have an opportunity to enhance the quality of debate surrounding the protection of the child. Until now it has not really been a feature of the discussion within the Australian community. It has been conducted in an atmosphere of emotion and, as I have suggested, has concentrated somewhat too narrowly on abortion. One needs to be sensitive to a far wider range of issues. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that a commission which is composed of persons of integrity and of commitment to the notion that the Australian family as a whole needs to recognise that within it there are those who cannot speak for themselves and those who are defenceless and vulnerable-for example, children-will make available to this Parliament reports which will then enable us to take the proper political responsibility of ensuring that adequate legal safeguards are brought into operation within the Australian Capital Territory-within the sphere of Federal laws in the first instance-but then perhaps using them as models at the very least for State jurisdictions to adopt in order to secure human rights in this area I am speaking of, particularly for the vulnerable and defenceless children within our community. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the defects which I have mentioned and which are such that I have to vote for the amendment which has been moved by Senator Evans, the features of the Bill which are new will, in my mind, so enhance the work of the Commission that we ought to try to expedite the passage of the legislation so that we will see the Commission in operation as soon as possible. </PARA>

I voted against it because I was aware of the Government's desire to ratify the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and I thought that the Human Rights Commission Bill was quite inadequate. I thought that if it were rejected by the Parliament the Government, still wishing to ratify the covenant, would be forced to bring in a more effective Human Rights Commission Bill. In that, somewhat to my surprise, I turned out to be completely wrong. The Government ratified the Covenant without the passage of the Human Rights Commission Bill. I found that surprising.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Except on the matter of abortion, to which I will come in a moment, the Bill now before the Senate is essentially the same as the one debated previously. My objections, of course, remain. Those objections were firstly, the lack of any effective or any enforcement power at all given to the Human Rights Commission; secondly, the power given to the Minister to by-pass the Commission and give its power to the States; and, thirdly, the use of conclusive ministerial certificates given by the Attorney-General to prevent disclosure of documents in certain listed areas such as would prejudice security, defence and international relations or permit the revelation of communications between a Minister and a Minister of a State, Cabinet documents and so on. I do not object to their not being disclosed. But I do object, as I did when I was a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs, to the Minister's decision being conclusive and not being examinable by any body such as the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. That provision remains in the Bill now before us. Most of all, my concern was that the scope of the Bill does not cover State laws under which most potential infringements of civil and political liberties must fall. It seemed to me then and it seems to me now that what we are doing is not in accordance with the Covenant to which we are adhering. Article 50 of the Covenant states:</PARA>
<PARA> The provisions of the present Covenant shall extend to all parts of federal States without any limitations or exceptions. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph 2 of Article 2 of the Covenant states:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . each State Party to the present Covenant undertakes to take the necessary steps, in accordance with its constitutional processes and with the provisions of the present Covenant, to adopt such legislative or other measures as may be necessary to give effect to the rights recognised in the present Covenant. </PARA>
<PARA>There is an attempt to do this in this present Bill under clause 11 by providing for the making of co-operative arrangements with the States. I agree that there is something to be said for this approach as a first step. Surely we should be able to co-operate effectively in this matter of human rights. After all, as has been pointed out by Mr Justice Kirby, despite the great differences of history, culture and language, European countries have been able to produce a European convention on human rights. The Council of Europe has produced more than 100 conventions on such diverse subjects as extradition, the legal status of migrant workers, transplantation laws and the suppression of terrorism. Can we accept, in our federal system, that we can achieve less than a formerly disunited Europe? I do not think so. It must be admitted that the present approach in this Bill is rather timid. Even if the joint Commonwealth-State organisations are set up they will not necessarily deal with the civil and political rights of State laws. </PARA>

For how long will this failure be compatible with our responsibility under the Covenant to take the necessary steps to give effect to the rights recognised in the Covenant in all parts of the Federation without any limitations or exceptions? Because, despite what we said in our reservations, we do have the power to override the States to make these rights effective. We must not hold ourselves out to the international community as being powerless in this respect.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, under the foreign affairs power without a doubt. We may not choose to use it, but we must not pretend that we do not have it. In this fundamental respect though, I do think that the present Bill goes as far as is politically feasible at the moment. But that is not the end of the matter. The history of this type of co-operative approach is not very encouraging. There have been successes, but not many. As a State senator I am an ardent defender of the decentralisation of power, when this is appropriate, for good administration or for political freedom. But when a State is abusing civil or political rights or is refusing to have examined whether it is abusing civil or political rights, I believe that this Parliament has a right and a duty to act. When the Bill was considered by the Senate last time, I asked for an assurance from the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) that if after a reasonable period, say three years, it was obvious that the co-operative arrangements were not working, would he be prepared to use the power that this Parliament has under the foreign affairs power to make these rights effective. As a member of the international community in good standing, to use the Attorney's own words, I do not see how we could do less. But I received no such assurance. Therefore, I voted against the Bill when it was considered last by the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it is a five-year clause under the so-called sunset legislation, but that is a very long time for considering this matter. I do not think we should, in ratifying the Covenant, have to wait for five years before the Parliament can consider again whether the workings of it are satisfactory. I do not think that is an acceptable time span. What has happened, of course, is that, in August last year, the Covenant was ratified. I am afraid that rather torpedoed the approach I took that if we did not pass the Bill the Government would be forced to bring in a better one. It ratified it without being able to get from Parliament a Human Rights Commission Bill. It ratified it with important reservations. These have been mentioned by previous speakers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will concentrate on one aspect. We have purported to attach a general reservation to the effect that constitutional processes of Australia preclude implementation by the Federal Government of those provisions of the Covenant affecting matters over which the States have jurisdiction. I do not think that is true. I think we have the power if we choose to use it. I accept that we do not choose to use it at the moment. I do not think it is correct to say that we do not have the power. Incidentally it is important to note that other countries with federations, such as Canada and West Germany, have not thought it necessary to place such a reservation in their covenant. In the Attorney-General's statement about ratification he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Although they--</PARA>
<PARA>He was referring to the States-</PARA>
<PARA>can't do so as a matter of international law, they are assuming and agreeing to the principles of the Covenant with the reservations we are making. </PARA>
<PARA>It is essentially up to those States and the Northern Territory to exercise those responsibilities under the Covenant, insofar as it applies to their own laws and practice under them. In effect, while accepting our obligations to extend the rights of the Covenant throughout Australia, we have, at the same time, asserted that our responsibility for implementation of those rights is limited to those matters where we exercise jurisdiction as the Federal Government. In my view-I am fortified in this view by a report by the International Commission of Jurists-this may well be in breach of international custom. In fact, as the International Commission of Jurists pointed out, this may well be in specific breach of Article 27 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties which states:</PARA>
<PARA> A party may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as a justification for its failure to perform a treaty. </PARA>
<PARA>Like Senator Puplick I would be very grateful if the Attorney, in his response, could deal in detail with his attitude to that provision in the Vienna Convention. I hope that the Government will keep in mind, when watching the development of the Human Rights Commission's activities and of the performance of the States in this field, the provisions of the Vienna Convention. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the matter which bedevilled us and which, in fact, we were unable to resolve-the so-called abortion issue, which was raised because of an amendment to the previous legislation which was passed by the House of Representatives. I think Senator Evans summed this up very fairly when he pointed out how it was being defused by including, as schedules to the Bill now before the Senate, not only the Declaration of the Rights of the Child, but also the Declaration on the Rights of Mentally Retarded Persons and the Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons. I am sure we all remember that those amendments, which I believed were ill-considered, stalled the progress of this Bill when we considered it before. As I construed the Human Rights Commission Bill which we dealt with before, it did not prevent the Human Rights Commission, at its discretion, from considering the rights of unborn children and of the mother and of the father. </PARA>
<PARA> I was worried-I opposed the amendment for this reason-that the amendments were not really intended to give or would not have the effect of giving the Human Rights Commission this power which it did not need as it already had it but were designed to use the Human Rights Commission as a propaganda forum for a particular point of view on one issue of human rights. For that reason, at the time I opposed the amendments. I am satisfied now that the subtle changes introduced by the Attorney-General have, in fact, achieved a satisfactory compromise. It will be possible, as I believe it always was, for the Human Rights Commission to look at these important issues of the rights of the unborn child but not to have its proceedings totally disrupted by being used as a propaganda forum for a point of view on one aspect of human rights. For that reason I applaud what the Attorney has done in this field. I now support the passage of this Bill. I do not believe it is a good Bill but it is better than nothing. Although, in my view, it is a weak and timid Bill, it is the best we can get at the moment. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the amendment so ably moved by my colleague, Senator Gareth Evans, to the Human Rights Commission Bill. I wish to make some remarks particularly concerning paragraphs (E) and (G) of the amendment which the Opposition has moved. We are engaged in a very disappointing episode in this chamber this afternoon. After the lengthy debate in both chambers over a number of months concerning the need for human rights protection in this country, we have finally been presented by the Government with legislation for a commission which will do nothing to enforce human rights and very little indeed to monitor some of the worst abuses of human rights in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is no longer a matter of dispute that there are serious violations of human rights of many kinds in Australia. I say that recognising that in relative terms Australia is one of the more progressive and humane societies in which one can live. We know that. I notice, Mr Acting Deputy President, that you nod in agreement. Indeed, the trade union movement which you have so ably represented for many years has been one of the reasons why workers in this country and their families have a higher standard of freedom than exists in many other countries in the world. But we are not content to rest on our laurels. We must admit that among certain disadvantaged groups, in particular the Australian Aboriginals, there are gross and continual violations of human rights. As I said, it is profoundly disappointing that now, when legislation in the human rights area finally comes before the Parliament, the Government is not, in fact, bringing in anti-discrimination legislation. We are not setting up a human rights commission with any executive powers to enforce the provisions of the various international conventions referred to in the legislation. We are simply setting up a commission which will be able to monitor, investigate and report upon some violations of human rights in this country but not upon all violations. </PARA>
<PARA> We have many criticisms of the present legislation and the more significant ones are embodied in our amendment. Of course, our main criticism is that there is no effective power in the legislation to protect human rights. The Human Rights Commission will subsume the Office of the Commissioner for Community Relations and deprive it of its statutory independence and right to report directly to Parliament. I will have more to say about that matter later. The Bill does not apply to the States of Australia and, of course, it is in some States of Australia-notably Western Australia and Queensland-that the most serious violations of human rights concerning Aborigines take place. The Commission's jurisdiction does not extend to the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women which was signed by the Government at the Mid-Decade Conference for Women held at Copenhagen in 1980 nor does it extend to the International Convenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. It will provide no monitoring at all of violations of the rights of women in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Walters seems to disagree; so no doubt she will support the amendment moved by the Opposition which will make specific reference to the convention concerning discrimination against women. If she is concerned to see women protected she will have no choice other than to support our amendment. Of course, the Labor Government had embodied in the Racial Discrimination Act a section enforcing the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. However, the effectiveness of that Act has been seriously eroded by the legislation before us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With the passage of the Human Rights Commission Bill, we will have a body which will make some attempt to monitor provisions of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the United Nations Declaration of the Rights of the Child, the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Mentally Retarded Persons and the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons. But, as I have said, two very important conventions are ignored. However, one of the two most important inadequacies concerns the effectiveness of the Human Rights Commission with regard to the protection of people who are discriminated against on the grounds of race. Until now, the Commissioner for Community Relations, Mr Al Grassby, has been a very effective voice in bringing to the attention of the nation discrimination on the basis of race experienced by people living in Australia. He has been able to report to the Parliament. He has done so regularly and his reports have been very important documents to which the Parliament has had to pay some attention. He will lose this independent right and, of course, in so doing, he will lose his effective voice for all those persons who are discriminated against on the basis of race or ethnic origin. </PARA>
<PARA> As an example of the effectiveness of Mr Grassby's work, I will refer to his 1980 report to the Parliament in which he examined discrimination against Aboriginal people in a wide range of areas important to their lives and dignity. He documented discrimination through the legal system, by the police, in the area of employment, in housing, in hotel services, in the media, in health services and in education. In the 1980 report of the Commissioner he also saw fit to devote one entire chapter to racial discrimination by the Western Australian Government and the Queensland Government. On 3 December last year in the Senate I raised the matter of human rights violations by the Queensland and Western Australian governments. These matters, of course, have been raised not only by honourable senators in this place but also by Aboriginal people in various international forums. Indeed, Australia has been reprimanded in reports coming from international organisations for its treatment of Aboriginal people, particularly in the States of Western Australia and Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Grassby's findings revealed that racial discrimination against Aboriginal people in both States is widespread and, worse than that, it occurs with the compliance of the Queensland and Western Australian governments. In response to inquiries by the Commissioner for Community Relations into a matter of alleged racial discrimination by the Department of Mr Hassell, the West Australian Minister for Police and Traffic and for Community Welfare, Mr Hassell stated:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the government of the State of Western Australia is not a matter over which you have, or ought to have, the slightest jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Hassell went on to tell Mr Grassby that it would be quite fruitless for Mr Grassby to raise such matters as racial discrimination in employment with him again. This was the response of the Western Australian Minister despite the fact that section 6 of the Racial Discrimination Act binds Australia and each State. I think this section of the 1980 report of the Commissioner for Community Relations which refers to Mr Hassell and his response, highlights the fact that when no enforceable powers are provided for the practical application of legislation such as the racial discrimination legislation or, now, the Human Rights Commission legislation, State governments which are hostile to the spirit of that legislation simply refuse to co-operate. On 27 May 1980 the Attorney-General, Senator Durack, wrote to the Commissioner for Community Relations on the matter of complaints he had received from the Western Australian Premier, Sir Charles Court, about a report on racial discrimination at Fitzroy Crossing issued from Mr Grassby's office. Senator Durack stated:</PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter of some concern that a document issued out of your office should give rise to criticisms of this nature. </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly it is a matter of some concern to the Fraser Government. The Fraser Government is concerned, but what is its concern? Its concern is to avoid any possible embarrassment to its political allies in Western Australia and Queensland. Its concern is not to protect human rights in those States and its concern is certainly to avoid any confrontation with those States when they refuse to act in the spirit of Federal legislation. For these reasons, when we see the human rights commission legislation coming before us with no powers over the States we feel, of course, totally pessimistic about the effectiveness of such legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The concern of the Fraser Government with regard to human rights seems to be much a promotional concern. It seems to be very much confined to the ability of the Prime Minister, Mr Malcolm Fraser, to parade himself in international forums as some sort of champion of human rights. When it comes to the real test of his and his Government's intentions with regard to human rights, when he is put to the test, as in the examples I gave from the Commissioner for Community Relations report, he simply backs down; indeed, the Attorney-General actually chastises the Commissioner for Community Relations for daring to expose the behaviour of one of his political colleagues. Is it any wonder that the Opposition feels very disappointed and very pessimistic with the human rights situation in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I pass briefly to the other area where there is an exclusion of concern for human rigths. This is the area concerning women. Women seem to be the only group identified as disadvantaged who have not been explicitly included through the Convention referring specifically to them in the proposed legislation. There is specific recognition now of racial minorities, children, the disabled, and the mentally handicapped but not of women. Surely we do not need to argue in this palce the need for protection of women against various forms of discrimination. </PARA>
<PARA> This very week in this Parliament we have had very large delegations of women who are part of the women's refuge movement in this country. Any honourable senator who took the time to meet with those delegations and to discuss their problems must be, as I was, horrified by the enormous discrimination that many women still experience, by the enormous disadvantages that many women-the sorts of women who end up in women's refuges to seek some sort of temporary shelter-have to experience. One has only to go through the whole area of housing, access to employment, access to legal services, access to accommodation, access to credit to purchase a home, treatment by State housing commissions and so on to find an overwhelming dossier of misery and discrimination. Those are the circumstances facing some women in this country. Yet despite the Government's making such a fuss and attempting to draw unto itself such kudos for signing the Convention in Copenhagen, it seems to find it unnecessary to attach that Convention to the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I make mention of the media statement put out a couple of days ago by the Women's Electoral Lobby, a body which has been extremely active in the last 10 years in the defence of women and in promoting improvements in the status of women. Of course, the Women's Electoral Lobby actually advocates voting against the Human Rights Commission Bill. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill as drafted confers no further rights on women, aborigines, other disadvantaged groups, or anyone at all. </PARA>
<PARA> A Commission set up under the proposed legislation would be ineffective, inconsequential and would have no teeth. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill has so many exclusions to the obtaining of information by subpoena that it is almost impossible to make a case. If you overcome this hurdle your case can be disallowed as against the public interest. Persons who are subpoenaed can refuse to testify on the grounds of self-incrimination . . . unlike the procedures laid down for Australian Royal Commissions. </PARA>
<PARA> There are no real sanctions in the Bill-the commissioner can write a letter to the culprit or table a report in some future Parliamentary session. The Bill does not provide the right of appeal to the judiciary. </PARA>
<PARA>I find it necessary to agree with the following conclusion of WEL:</PARA>
<PARA> The Bill is window dressing by the Australian Government to fool other nations into believing that Australia is carrying out its obligations under the Convention on Human Rights. </PARA>
<PARA>The failure to provide specific reference to the Convention outlawing discrimination against women will mean that there will not be regular and consistent monitoring of the sorts of discriminations I have averted to. I believe that this will mean that there will be even a greater need for Federal anti-discrimination legislation. I wish to make some brief remarks on that matter. </PARA>
<PARA> At this stage three States-South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria- have already introduced anti-discrimination legislation and there have been moves towards it in Tasmania. Queensland and Western Australia have evinced no intention at all in this regard, nor has the Northern Territory. Because of the failure of some States and the Northern Territory to take any steps to provide legislation to protect women against discrimination, I assert that the Commonwealth Government ought to enact anti-discrimination legislation. It clearly has the powers to do so in some areas and the outstanding and apparent area in which the Commonwealth Government could enact anti-discrimination legislation is in the area of Commonwealth employment which, of course, is a very large and significant area of employment for women and one in which women experience great difficulty in obtaining equality of opportunity. One has only to look, for example, at the employment practices of the Department of Defence to see how discriminatory the present Commonwealth Government is as an employer. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe there are other areas where the Commonwealth Government has constitutional powers. They may have to be tested through the High Court, but I believe they have constitutional powers to outlaw discrimination in finance and banking. Of course, these are extremely crucial areas because so many women are discriminated against by lending institutions in their attempts to secure a home for themselves and their families. The Commonwealth Government clearly has some powers. I think those powers would be extended very readily if it were willing to do so; unfortunately, it is not. </PARA>
<PARA> Given the problems in those States which will not legislate to protect women against discrimination, the Federal legislation could take precedence. Federal legislation could cover areas not within State powers but could also apply in those States where there is unlikely to be any State enacted legislation. The objective of that legislation would be to ensure that in areas such as education, training, employment, taxation, the social security system, access to finance and access to the law, people were not discriminated against on the ground of sex alone. Where such discrimination did take place, the law ought to provide the victim with an effective remedy. </PARA>
<PARA> I foreshadow, at this point, that I will be moving a private member's Bill after July in this place because I am so concerned at the inaction of the Government in this respect. In the meantime, I urge all honourable senators to look very seriously and carefully at the second reading amendment moved by my colleague, Senator Gareth Evans. In particular, I exhort the Attorney-General to adopt our suggestion that the Copenhagen Convention, the Convention outlawing all forms of discrimination against women, should be appended along with the other United Nations conventions. If the Attorney-General is not willing to do that, I would be very interested indeed, as would all the women of Australia, to hear his explanation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last August, along with 65 other countries, the Government ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. As a result, we are now committed to set up some mechanism to ensure that the Covenant is observed. It has been debated in many places that this is not necessary, that we in this country do not need the sort of legislation that is now before us, that its provisions only overlap other areas, and that Australians have recourse to ombudsmen and common law. This may well be. I do not believe that it will overlap in this area. Clause 10 sub-clause 4 of the Human Rights Commission Bill sets the matter out very clearly. If the Commission believes that some other remedy in relation to the subject matter of the complaint is reasonably available to the complainant or that the subject matter of the complaint could be more effectively or conveniently dealt with by some other statutory authority, the Commission may, in its discretion, decide not to hold an inquiry as a result of a complaint.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The proposed Commission will set up a system of which I believe the ordinary man will be able to take advantage. I refer to the person who would normally shrink at the thought of resorting to legal action, who would not know how to go about it and who would believe that all that would do would be to cost him, and cost him dearly, in dollars. The main feature of clause 12 is that the Commission's emphasis should be on informality in the settling of disputes and that it should not be bound by rules of evidence. This, I believe, is the benefit and the beauty of this Bill. The ordinary person will be able to have a complaint investigated without having the concern and worries of finance or the concern and worries of the legal aspect of what that person believes has been discrimination against him. That clause also enables the Commission to keep a person's name confidential if it believes that this is necessary. The Human Rights Bureau set up by the Government in August as an interim measure has proved that this legislation is necessary. It has already received complaints and requests for information in the general field of human rights. The cost of running this Commission will not be great. We have been assured by the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) that he expects its annual cost to be $850,000. </PARA>
<PARA> Human rights legislation has been debated in this chamber many times. We first debated it on 25 September 1979. It was again debated on 13 November 1979. It was again debated in February, March, April and May of 1980. Senator Evans spoke on it again today. I just made a quick check and ascertained that he has already spoken for a total of three hours and 24 minutes on this legislation; yet he was able to speak for another 34 minutes in the debate today. That is not something that I aim to achieve. I believe that we have debated this Bill very thoroughly. As has been stated today, the subject of the disagreement between the two Houses was the rights of the child. The debate became an abortion debate. I agree that in the end it was a debate on abortion. I believe that the Government has come to a very happy decision. I commend it for that. It has been able to put to all those people who were involved in that disagreement a compromise or, as Senator Hamer says, a subtle difference. I am not sure what the subtle difference is-perhaps he can explain it to me later-but I for one am very happy with the decision. </PARA>

<PARA> 4. Whenever possible, the mentally retarded person should live with his own family or with foster parents and participate in different forms of community life. The family with which he lives should receive assistance.

<PARA> Proclaims this Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons and calls for national and international action to ensure that it will be used as a common basis and frame of reference for the protection of these rights:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. The term ''disabled person'' means any person unable to ensure by himself or herself, wholly or partly, the necessities of a normal individual and/or social life, as a result of a deficiency, either congenital or not, in his or her physical or mental capabilities. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. Disabled persons shall enjoy all the rights set forth in this Declaration. These rights shall be granted to all disabled persons without any exception whatsoever and without distinction or discrimination on the basis of race, colour, sex, language, religion, political or other opinions, national or social origin, state of wealth, birth or any other situation applying either to the disabled person himself or herself or to his or her family. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. Disabled persons have the inherent right to respect for their human dignity. Disabled persons, whatever the origin, nature and seriousness of their handicaps and disabilities, have the same fundamental rights as their fellow-citizens of the same age, which implies first and foremost the right to enjoy a decent life, as normal and full as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. Disabled persons have the same civil and political rights as other human beings; paragraph 7 of the Declaration on the Rights of Mentally Retarded Persons applies to any possible limitation or suppression of those rights for mentally disabled persons. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. Disabled persons are entitled to the measures designed to enable them to become as self-reliant as possible. </PARA>
<PARA> 6. Disabled persons have the right to medical, psychological and functional treatment, including prosthetic and orthetic appliances, to medical and social rehabilitation, education, vocational training and rehabilitation aid, counselling, placement services and other services which will enable them to develop their capabilities and skills to the maximum and will hasten the process of their social integration or reintegration. </PARA>
<PARA> 7. Disabled persons have the right to economic and social security and to a decent level of living. They have the right, according to their capabilities, to secure and retain employment or to engage in a useful, productive and remunerative occupation and to joint trade unions. </PARA>
<PARA> 8. Disabled persons are entitled to have their special needs taken into consideration at all stages of economic and social planning. </PARA>
<PARA> 9. Disabled persons have the right to live with their families or with foster parents and to participate in all social, creative or recreational activities. No disabled person shall be subjected, as far as his or her residence is concerned, to differential treatment other than that required by his or her condition or by the improvement which he or she may derive therefrom. If the stay of a disabled person in a specialized establishment is indispensable, the environment and living conditions therein shall be as close as possible to those of the normal life of a person of his or her age. </PARA>
<PARA> 10. Disabled persons shall be protected against all exploitation, all regulations and all treatment of a discriminatory, abusive or degrading nature. </PARA>
<PARA> 11. Disabled persons shall be able to avail themselves of qualified legal aid when such aid proves indispensible for the protection of their persons and property. If judicial proceedings are instituted against them, the legal procedure applied shall take their physical and mental condition fully into account. </PARA>
<PARA> 12. Organizations of disabled persons may be usefully consulted in all matters regarding the rights of disabled persons. </PARA>
<PARA> 13. Disabled persons, their families and communities shall be fully informed, by all appropriate means, of the rights contained in this Declaration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Evans, in a very peculiar fashion, has been able, to his own satisfaction anyway, to decide that the Declaration of the Rights of the Child can be divided in two-the first part being the Preamble. I am not quite sure of the second part but it is the rest of the Declaration. He has said that the Preamble does not matter anyway; it is just the rest, whatever the rest happens to be, that matters. However, in the document I have had incorporated in Hansard, the Declaration of the Rights of the Child as proclaimed by the General Assembly of the United Nations on 20 November 1959, resolution 1386, includes the Preamble.

I believe that, under this Bill, I am perfectly equal to my male colleagues in the Senate and have an equal right to go to the Commission and lay any complaint that I feel I am justified in making. If Senator Ryan does not believe that she falls in that category, that is her problem. She spoke about the disadvantages faced by the women who are part of a convention that is in Canberra at the moment and who sat in Kings Hall yesterday. I do not know how many honourable senators saw them. Certainly, they would not speak to any of my male colleagues. They would not even speak to any male reporters.

I believe that we could well have an equal number of complaints to put before the Commission as any other group would have. I believe that Australia is one of the countries in which human rights for all, perhaps with the exception of the unborn, are considered to be the normal way of life. This Bill sets an example in identifying to all the countries of the world the priority that we place on freedom for all human beings.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Missen for yielding to me. My comments will be very brief. I understand that it would help the Government if this Human Rights Commission Bill were passed. I, along with other honourable senators, spoke at length on a similar Bill on 13 November 1979. The Bill before us today is essentially similar to that one, with a few amendments. It pleases me less than the original Bill. I want that put on the record. I complained on behalf of the Australian Democrats that the original Bill was weak and lacked teeth and did not apply to the States. I said that it did not contain a Bill of Rights and many other matters. I am sorry to say that this Bill is even weaker than that one. For that reason the Democrats will support the amendment moved by the Opposition to the motion for the second reading.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the last occasion I congratulated Senator Evans and Senator Missen on their speeches. On this occasion I congratulate Senator Evans and agree essentially with most of what he said. Had I spoken after Senator Missen, I am sure that I would be congratulating him similarly on his thoughtful contribution. The Democrats are firm in their support of the thrust of the various amendments that the Australian Labor Party has put forward. In particular, we believe that the Bill should be withdrawn and redrafted to provide for its application to the laws and practices of the States and of the Northern Territory. Surely it is in those areas that 95 per cent of breaches of human rights take place. Some States, notably Queensland and Western Australia, are more notorious than others for allowing the violation of civil rights. </PARA>
<PARA> We are very apprehensive that this Bill, with its companion Bill, will destroy or emasculate the Office of the Commissioner for Community Relations. I do not hold any brief for anyone now in that organisation, but the Australian Democrats believe that it has performed a valuable service and is capable of exposing racial discrimination in Australia. I repeat what I said on 13 November on behalf of the Australian Democrats. We strongly oppose the emasculation of this organisation and its virtual destruction. I could go on for some time, and I have notes and a speech prepared to do just that. However, as it would be essentially a repetition of what I said on 13 November I will just say for the record that the Australian Democrats are deeply disappointed that the Government has not made the amendments suggested by Senator Evans, Senator Missen, Senator Puplick, me and many other speakers during the debate in November. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak yet again on the Human Rights Commission Bill and the additional amending Bill, the Racial Discrimination Amendment Bill. The discussion on these Bills has been a long saga, dating from November 1979. On that occasion I made a lengthy speech in which I was highly critical of the Bills and of the extent to which we were proceeding to implement the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. I did not think the Bill was adequate then, and I do not think it is adequate now. I have at all times been pledged to the implementation of the policy of the Liberal Party, put forward at elections, to proceed with the establishment of a commission which investigates breaches of rights, which investigates laws and 'acts and practices' and which proceeds to report to the Parliament. I was not happy, and I am still not at all happy, about the deficiencies in this Bill. I will refer to them in a moment, and they have been referred to already today. It is a Liberal commitment to implement the policy in this way and not by means of a bill of rights. We pledged in the 1977 election and again in the last election to proceed with this type of legislation. Consequently, my decisions on these matters are hedged around by the commitment I believe we have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I have come to the same conclusion as did Senator Tate today; that is, this Bill should be passed into law as soon as possible. We should expedite the passage of the Bill, and I will attempt to do that by not supporting the amendment moved by the Australian Labor Party, many aspects of which are highly commendable but which I believe would have the effect of ensuring that we did not get a Human Rights Commission in this country for some considerable time. We endeavoured in debates more than a year ago to amend the legislation. In fact, with the additional amendment in this Bill today, I think that some six of the 12 amendments I moved on that occasion have now been incorporated in the Bill by the Government. The major matters we sought to incorporate into the legislation then we recognise have not been successfully incorporated. </PARA>
<PARA> The changes that have now been made in the Bill are such that they will overcome some of the problems and certainly some of the controversy which has surrounded this legislation. We have discussed the terms of the Bill reasonably and relevantly in this chamber, I think, but on two occasions debate in the House of Representatives has been devoted almost entirely to a battle on the subject of abortion. The amendments moved in that House concentrated entirely on that aspect of the Bill. They lifted part of a preamble from one of the declarations that is now in the Bill and proceeded to highlight that and to require the Human Rights Commission to concentrate on that activity. I and others fought against that proposal, and we are glad to see that so far it has not been persisted with. As others have pointed out, the Government has incorporated some three declarations in this Bill. While I listened to Senator Walters I thought that perhaps we might also have an extra declaration, the declaration of the rights of the sexual minority, namely, men. However, we have not gone that far. Senator Ryan has also pointed out that the covenant relating to the elimination of discrimination against women is not amongst the declarations included. Like her, I hope that speedy action will be taken to include that covenant. </PARA>
<PARA> The three declarations included in the Bill-the Declaration of the Rights of the Child, the Declaration on the Rights of Mentally Retarded Persons, and the Declaration on the Rights of Disabled Persons-have been supported by this country. We have voted for them and we applaud their inclusion. I certainly have no objection to those declarations being included as documents to be looked at by the Human Rights Commission. I probably do not accept the same interpretation of those documents as some of my colleagues do, but I believe that they are worthwhile documents, worthy of consideration in the deliberations of the Commission. From that point of view, we could have no possible objection to the action the Government has taken in including them in the documents to go before the Commission. There was always power in the Bill for the Government to incorporate further documents, or international instruments, as they are called. That would require a process of agreement by the States but I hope that the other documents referred to today will also be included by way of that process. </PARA>
<PARA> A great deal has been said today about the ratification of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights and the way in which we have done this, with a record number of reservations. There are 14 reservations in all, and I think that some of those reservations are of great importance. The reservation under Articles 2 and 50 relating to our position as a Federal state, refusing to include responsibility in regard to the laws of the States, is very serious and one which I regret very much. A number of reservations have been strongly criticised by the International Commission of Jurists, and I believe validly criticised. I will not repeat the criticism made by my colleagues Senator Puplick and Senator Hamer, who have mentioned aspects of this reservation. I agree with their points, but I wish to mention further aspects. We have not made the declaration which would allow interstate complaints, that is, complaints between various states of the world, to be made and dealt with. We have not made the declaration that would enable that to be done. What is more, we have failed to ratify the Optional Protocol to the covenant under which individuals may appeal to the Human Rights Commission. I do not know why we have not done that. As a country with a pretty good record on human rights, I believe that we ought not to have such poverty of spirit that we will not allow individuals to take their complaints against our country to the human rights machinery of the United Nations. Ratification is important because under the terms of this Bill the Commission is to consider the covenant in the light of what is ratified by Australia. Our failure to ratify the optional protocol restricts the ambit of the activities of the Commission. I believe that the particular restrictions under Articles 2 and 50 of the Federal clause are such that this matter is very serious. I will quote another aspect of the commentary on the ratification of the International Commission of Jurists. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The general reservation covering this gap is considered to be not just insufficient but at best voidable if not void abinitio rendering the ratification itself null and void. </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Puplick at more length has discussed the way in which this may conflict and probably does, with Article 27 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties. I suggest that grave doubt exists as to whether our ratification is a valid one. Certainly it is one in which we will be very much criticised by councils of the world because I think we have not taken full steps to implement this Covenant. I believe that in the ratification there is a great deal of deficiency regarding our activities. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matters of change in the Bill now before us which I think are of some interest include one which has been mentioned today and which is now excluded, namely clause 10 (4) (f) of the Bill. This provision originally restricted persons who wanted to complain to the Commission against human rights activities. They needed an interest-an expression which has a legal meaning and which would be restrictive. I sought to have this clause removed when the Bill was debated here in 1979. The Attorney-General (Senator Durack) then substituted what I thought was a somewhat improved expression of concern but which did not have the same restrictive legal meaning. I am now pleased to see that the Government has taken that clause out altogether, so that means that complaints and complainants need not show an interest. The interest in human rights should be sufficient in itself and we should not impose conditions restricting people from approaching the Commission to get justice. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer to another alteration to this Bill which I do not think has been mentioned today and that is that the Commissioners' terms of office are not to exceed five years. That clause is put in to be consistent with the 'sunset' clause. That clause was originally inserted in the Bill on the initiative of my colleague, Senator Lewis. Consistently with that clause a term not exceeding five years is included. In a small way these changes improve the Bill but grave deficiencies still remain. Quite apart from the ratification problems we have the problems of State laws. I am concerned, not that we want to interfere with State laws or force a change and override the States but, as was tried previously-unfortunately, the Government indicated that it would not accept this-I see a need for the Commission to be able to investigate State laws, to compare State law with other State laws and with Commonwealth law, and to be able to criticise those differences. In the course of this criticism I say this: It may well be that even with the Bill as it now stands, there is some power in the Commission to investigate some State laws. I do not know whether the Commission will have the courage and initiative to do that. I draw attention to a statement which was made by Mr James Crawford, a lecturer in law at the Adelaide University. In a speech to a convention last year he stated. </PARA>
<PARA> As to matters presently governed by State law the only relevant head of jurisdiction is s.9 (1) (c), which refers to 'laws that should be made by the Parliament . . . on matters relating to human rights'. Now it is quite clear that this is not restricted to matters on which the Commonwealth has already legislated, which are covered by s.9 (1) (a). Therefore it must relate to proposed reforms on matters within Commonwealth power but presently governed by State law. It follows that the Commission can investigate, with a view to proposing reforms, any subject matter of State law provided that the Commonwealth can legislate for it. So the question becomes: what is the extent of Commonwealth legislative power over matters covered by the Convention?</PARA>
<PARA>It may well be that there will be some room for investigation in areas which at present are covered by State laws but over which the Commonwealth has some power. I hope such powers will be exercised by the Commission. Nonetheless, so far as we are concerned, both in regard to laws and investigation of acts and practices there are very grave restrictions on the area in which the Commission can act. It is unlikely that it will step into any area of State law unless it specifically has that power given to it in the Bill. I think that this will prove to be a deficiency in the Bill and one which after some time will require amendment. There is still no provision for civil remedies. However there is a provision that, after a person has gone through all the trouble of making a complaint and being heard, possibly a report will be made and the report will come to this Parliament, where we may or may not take any action. I think it is a grave deficiency that no civil remedies are provided in this Bill as there are under the Racial Dicrimination Act. In time this will be shown to be a deficiency which needs remedying. There remains the criticisms we made on previous occasions, such as the possibility of by-passing the Commission under clause 11 of the Bill. Likewise, remains the deficiencies-what I call the freedom of information deficiencies-mentioned by Senator Hamer. This includes the conclusive certificates, the ability to keep from the Commission facts and documents which ought to be before it and the secrecy provisions which I hope will be altered when the freedom of information legislation is finally passed through this chamber. These are continuing defects to the possible and useful development of this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> We have heard a number of criticisms of this Bill from the Women's Electoral Lobby. I agree with WEL that a Commission set up under the proposed legislation would be ineffective, inconsequential and without teeth. I hope that the criticisms the Lobby and I have made will prove to be not as great. I do not agree that the exclusion of information is such that we cannot necessarily expect the Commission to do an effective job. I think that the criticism by WEL about disallowing public interest has been misconceived. I think it has misread the clauses in the Bill. Nonetheless the criticisms which it made are very substantial. Apparently the Women's Electoral Lobby overlooked the fact that clause 10 (4) (f) has been removed from the Bill. Nonetheless, I believe that the criticisms made to us by organisations means that we must be even more vigilant in the implementation of this Bill. We will have to watch it very carefully in the next few years. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course reference has been made to the second Bill, the Racial Discrimination Amendment Bill. This Bill alters only the dates. Last year we had a considerable debate on this Bill. A number of us opposed the Bill and sought to defeat it because it had the effect of taking the Commissioner for Community Relations from his separate position, submerging him into the Commission-it did not make him a commissioner-and very much inhibiting his power of report to the Parliament. That decision was made. A vote was taken in this chamber and the Bill passed in both Houses. It would be pettifogging now to try to hold up this legislation by not voting for an amendment which merely changed the date from '1980' to '1981'. I for one will not do that because I want to see this legislation come into operation. I accept, most regrettably, the racial discrimination aspect of this legislation. I have sought to defeat it, but having failed to do that I do not intend to trivially hold things up at this time. As I have said, many of us are committed to the legislation and are committed to seeing some implementation of the Covenant. When I spoke here on 8 November 1979 I said:</PARA>
<PARA> If my amendments are not adopted we will be passing something that will be a weak, sickly Bill. I would rather that that be done as a first step. At least we would learn whether the Bill can be effective. It is even possible that I could be wrong; that the Bill could be better than I now believe it to be. I am an optimist but I would rather see a commission of some weakness set up than nothing at all. </PARA>
<PARA>That continues to be my position and my commitment to my constituents. One does not accept that one can always obtain what one wants in the Parliament. I believe that the amendment which the Australian Labor Party has put forward today is very attractive in its way. There is very little in that amendment with which I do not agree. I believe that most of the criticisms advanced against the Bill are sound, but to redraft it and to have it sent back and thrown back again would, I believe-I have reason for this belief-mean that we would not see a commission operating for probably some time. </PARA>

It will be a commission which can highlight these breaches which will turn up-even without the specific power. We know of certain human rights restrictions which we know operate in various dark corners of this country. We know that facts will come forward as the result of the Commission's work. I believe that one cannot take a hole-in-corner attitude. One cannot just throw this Bill back and be sure not to succeed. We must however be more than ever vigilant, and ensure that, in the somewhat slender and weak condition in which this Commission starts, we in the Parliament recognise that we have a continuing obligation to monitor its course. We must see that the reports and examinations by the Commissioner for Community Relations, though he cannot report independently, are coming to light for the public and the Parliament.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am very pleased that the Senate has obviously supported the new proposals of the Government in regard to this Human Rights Commission Bill to widen its charter to include reference to the declarations of the rights of the child, of the mentally retarded and of the disabled. That is the major new initiative that has been taken by the Government in regard to this measure, and it is one which I trust will now be accepted not only by the Senate but also by the House of Representatives and will enable the Human Rights Commission to be established.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It has been a great disappointment to me that it has taken so long to achieve that purpose. Soon after I became Attorney-General I undertook the task of endeavouring to establish this Commission. My first disappointment was that after very lengthy discussions with the States when there seemed to be some chance of them forming a joint Commonwealth-State human rights commission, that was not possible. Then, of course, when we embarked upon the course of confining the Commission to practices under Commonwealth laws, that attempt was frustrated by a division between the two Houses. </PARA>
<PARA> I am very pleased indeed that honourable senators on both sides of the chamber seem to support those new proposals by the Government. It is a disappointment to me, however, that the Opposition has seen fit to move an amendment which in effect, will defeat the Bill because the amendment would not allow the Bill a second reading. The Bill would require redrafting along several lines which the Government has made quite clear that as a matter of policy it will not accede to. Even though there are some members on the government side of the chamber who are disappointed about those matters, I am very pleased that Senator Missen, Senator Puplick and Senator Hamer, who have been critical of some aspects of the Bill, see the wisdom of establishing the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> I think the Parliament has generally underrated the significance of establishing a Human Rights Commission which has very wide powers and it is proposed now even wider powers. Senator Ryan has expressed her criticism, and indeed the Opposition has included in its amendment the view that the powers and the functions of the Commission ought to extend to the United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women. The Government has not included that aspect because that Convention has only recently been signed by Australia. At the moment we are discussing with the States the basis on which that Convention could be ratified. The Act will contain powers by which the charter of the Commission can be extended to include covenants of that kind, and, indeed, the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights as well if it seems appropriate at some future time to include them. However, we believe that the Commission should be established at this stage with a charter along the lines which we have delineated to see how it operates in those areas before we move to other fields which in due course may well be added. I do not propose to canvass again all the arguments. Time is running out. I hope we will be able to pass this legislation by this evening because there is some other business to attend to, as I understand it, before the suspension of the sitting for dinner. </PARA>
<PARA> I will mention one matter that has figured quite prominently in this debate. It concerns the ratification of the International Covenant by the Government last August. I think the significance of that step taken by the Government has been underrated and too great an emphasis placed on reservations and declarations made at the time. The major reservation has been referred to as the reservation to a Federal system. I think that to some extent, however, that reservation has been misunderstood because it is made quite clear:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia accepts that the provisions of the Covenant extend to all parts of Australia as a Federal State without any limitations or exceptions. </PARA>
<PARA>We have assumed at the international level the obligation for the Covenant's applying to Australia as a whole. As I have pointed out, this obligation will be implemented at a Federal level by the Commonwealth Parliament and at the State level by the State parliaments. It will be implemented in accordance with our Federal system. The obligation exists as one applying to the whole of Australia. Australia will have to report under Article 40 about the methods by which it is observing its responsibility. That is one of the major reasons why we have established-and the States have agreed to establish-the Ministerial meeting on human rights so that the obligations under the Covenant of both Federal and State governments can be discussed. I hope that, if there are difficulties, they can be solved. I believe that the reservation is consistent with the Vienna Convention mentioned previously. All the advice I have received from public international legal experts and experts from the Foreign Affairs Department leads me to believe that the reservation as such is valid and in accordance with that treaty. Article 27 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties states:</PARA>
<PARA> A party may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as justification for its failure to perform a treaty. </PARA>
<PARA>That does not deal with the reservation at all but with the observance, application and interpretation of the treaty. We recognise that. It is a fact that we cannot invoke the provisions of an internal law to justify non-performance of the regulation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We would have to report this. As I said, we would have to explain what we are seeking to do in order to conform with the Covenant. The significant point is that as a result of very lengthy discussions with the States over 18 months or more we obtained the agreement of the States to the ratification of this Covenant. Both the Federal and State governments took the responsibilities being assumed under this Covenant very seriously indeed. That is why there are a number of specific reservations where we say we cannot accept certain responsibilities.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We have not assumed an obligation in regard to the specific reservations. Therefore, we have not acquired the obligation to implement them at this stage. I think those points cover the major new matters introduced into this debate. As I said, although I am somewhat disappointed in not having the time to cover some of the major issues again, I have done so in the past as indeed other senators who have spoken in this debate have done. I refer to what I have said in the past in relation to those major issues. I believe that the Parliament is taking a most important step in passing this Bill and in establishing a Human Rights Commission which I believe will prove to be a major initiative by the Government. Mr President, I trust that the Senate will defeat the amendment and give passage to the Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The statement read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this statement is to provide the Senate with an opportunity of debating our present taxation system and more specifically, to explain in detail the reasons why the Government decided a short while ago not to introduce a broad-based indirect tax. This statement does not announce changes to the tax system or to existing levels of taxation. I hope it will contribute towards a more informed and objective debate on the subject of taxation. Such a debate cannot occur unless the Government plays its part in disclosing its own thinking and makes available essential information. This statement is intended to do that. No economic subject excites quite the level of interest as that of taxation. Few subjects produce such little common ground between different sections of the community. In many ways our existing taxation laws represent an uneasy and not altogether logical compromise between conflicting interests and pressures in the community. It seems on occasions that the only area in which there is broad agreement is that taxation should be reduced. </PARA>
<PARA> The taxation system is an integral part of our economic structure. As such, tax changes cannot take place in a vacuum. Taxation, government spending, budget deficits and inflation are all directly connected. Coping with them is part and parcel of the task of running a modern economy. The Government's views on taxation cannot be divorced from its underlying philosopy. We are, and have always been, a Government that believes that individuals should be free to make their own choices and that private enterprise should be given room to play the leading role in the development of the economy. This leads us inevitably to the view that the Government's role should be as small as is consistent with providing the basic environment within which individual freedom and private enterprise can thrive. Unless taxation changes are consistent with and achievable within the existing economic framework they will frustrate, rather than serve, the Government's economic objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> The most dominant influence on the level and shape of our taxation system is of course the size of government. Those in the community who espouse the cause of bigger government are in fact arguing for still higher taxation. Unless debate in Australia on the subject of taxation fully acknowledges the direct link between levels of taxation and levels of expenditure that debate can have little meaning. Taxation cannot responsibly be reduced unless the room for those reductions is provided by reductions in government spending. This Government is prepared neither to finance additional expenditure, or reduce taxation, through the inflationary process of expanding the budget deficit. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst opinion as to the desirable shape of our taxation system will vary sharply in the community it is possible, I believe, to state some broad goals. I believe it essential that any taxation system be fair, efficient and, to the maximum extent possible, complement the general economic policies of the Government. In saying that a taxation system should be fair, that immediately implies that it should be fair in the sense that all of those on whom parliament imposes an obligation to pay tax should in fact pay tax. This, of course, leads to the subject of tax avoidance and evasion to which I shall return later in this statement. </PARA>
<PARA> The concept of fairness also implies that tax should be levied according to capacity to pay. The extent to which this principle should apply must in turn be tempered by the recognition that if marginal tax rates become too high, adverse effects on incentives occur with consequent loss of economic efficiency and productivity and greater resort to tax avoidance. The criterion of efficiency requires that not only should the system be administered in an efficient manner but governments should avoid changes which, although providing certain gains, involve complicated and cumbersome administrative procedures to operate, thus impairing the overall efficiency of the system. It is, of course, fundamental that the taxation system ought to complement the economic policies of the government of the day. This involves a whole host of considerations, including the effect of different forms of taxation upon inflation, incentive, investment and economic activity, and the balance between different sectors of the economy. Achieving this objective will often involve a judgment about a requirement or change which might serve one particular area of economic policy but not necessarily another. Such a judgment was very much involved in the Government's recent consideration of whether or not a broad-based indirect tax should be introduced. </PARA>
<PARA>International Comparisons</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>Whilst any international comparison has its defects, no discussion of the Australian taxation system is complete without some comparisons of the level of tax in this country with that in the rest of the world. Those comparisons show that, overall, Australians are less heavily taxed than people in most industrialised countries. The most recent figures published by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development are in respect of 1978 and show that total tax revenue at all levels of government as a percentage of gross domestic product averaged 35.8 per cent for the 22 countries for which data are available. For Australia the figure was 28.8 per cent. Only four countries had a lower overall tax burden. </PARA>
<PARA> The comparable figure for the United Kingdom was 34.5 per cent, the United States, 30.2 per cent, West Germany 37.8 per cent and socialist Sweden a staggering 53.5 per cent. This fact does not show that Australian taxes should be higher. Indeed it is our objective to reduce them further. In the Government's view this fact reveals that Australia has a strong tradition of dealing with many aspects of individual security in the private sector. The Government believes that its own objectives of limiting the role of government to encourage a vigorous private sector in Australia are in harmony with the dominant values of Australians expressed in this statistic. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table showing these particular comparisons. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; However, it is important to bear in mind that although we rely rather more heavily on personal income tax than other comparable countries, our absolute levels of personal income tax are lower than the OECD average. Once again, to illustrate from Table 1 the OECD average for personal income tax was 14.5 per cent of GDP in 1978; the Australian figure was 12.6 per cent of GDP. As Table 2 shows, in 1978 Australia ranked ninth of 22 member countries in terms of reliance on all types of consumption taxes, but were twenty-first in terms of 'general' or sales taxes, and on other taxes such as excise and customs duties and levies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This difference reflects Australia's large collections from 'specific' taxes such as the crude oil levy and traditional excise duties on beer, potable spirits, tobacco products and petroleum products. Together these yield almost three times as much revenue as sales taxes. Moreover, these specific taxes, together with sales tax on motor vehicles and parts, account for over 80 per cent of our total taxes on goods and services. Since 1978, of course, the contribution from the crude oil levy has risen sharply and in the current year is estimated to yield almost 10 per cent of Commonwealth taxation revenues. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, therefore, our overall tax burden is lower than the average of the industrialised world. We do, however, rely rather more on personal tax as a source of revenue, although our level of personal tax is still lower than the OECD average. To the extent that we collect revenue through indirect taxation, such collections tend to be concentrated on a very limited number of consumption items. </PARA>
<PARA>Trends in Taxation and Expenditure</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> It has been the common experience of western countries during the past 25 years for both expenditure and tax to rise as proportions of GDP. Australia has been no exception to this general pattern, although a number of particular observations can be made about our own experience. In the post-war period up to 1973-74, there was little change in Commonwealth tax receipts as a proportion of GDP, although the proportion of State and local tax receipts roughly doubled during that period. However, Commonwealth tax receipts rose from 21.3 per cent of GDP in 1973-74 to 23.2 per cent of GDP in 1975-76, during which time Commonwealth expenditure as a proportion of GDP rose from 24.6 to 30.7 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA> During the five years this Government has been in office, Commonwealth tax receipts as a proportion of GDP have risen from 23.2 per cent to an estimated 24.8 per cent in the current financial year. During this period, however, in contrast to the earlier period, there has been a substantial reduction in the deficit. This is due in large measure to the expenditure restraint applied by this Government. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a table providing relevant information. </PARA>

<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Since its election the present Government has initiated a number of major reforms and improvements to the taxation system. The standard rate system introduced in the 1977 Budget provided a significant reform to personal income tax. The number of steps in the rate scale was reduced from seven to three. Some 225,000 people, including many pensioners, were freed altogether from the liability to pay tax. These changes removed many of the adverse effects on incentive which existed under the rate scales they replaced. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; At the time of establishing this new rate scale about 90 per cent of taxpayers were on the standard rate and the top of this step was sufficiently high to permit average wage earners to earn substantial additional amounts of income, for example, from overtime, second jobs, et cetera, and still attract only the standard marginal rate. Whilst there has been some abatement of these advantages over the past three years, 80 per cent of taxpayers are still on the standard rate and the top of that step is still about 20 per cent above average weekly earnings. Whilst it is of course a taxpayer's marginal rate that is relevant to decisions to earn additional income, this rate does not indicate the percentage of a person's income payable as tax. Because of the zero rate on taxable income up to $4,041, taxpayers on the standard rate pay significantly less than 32 per cent of their income as tax. Similarly, a taxpayer on a higher marginal rate has an average rate considerably less than his marginal rate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Thus, although the maximum marginal rate of 60 per cent begins at a taxable income of $34,478, the average rate for a taxpayer without dependants does not reach even 50 per cent until his taxable income reaches $85,335. An individual on average earnings-which in September 1980 were $13,941 per annum-has an average tax rate of 22.7 per cent.

In the business sector the investment allowance has provided major incentives for all sectors of Australian business and has no doubt played its part in the enormous private sector capital investment now under way.

Various proposals have been put to the Government to allow full income splitting for all married taxpayers.

<PARA> To respond in part to what it saw as an imbalance in the tax system against single income families, the Government increased the dependent spouse rebate last year by 34 per cent from $597 to $800 per year. In all our analysis of changes to the taxation system, we should never lose sight of the impact of inflation upon a progressive tax scale. I can best illustrate by pointing out that in 1954-55 the maximum marginal rate began to apply at almost 18 times average earnings. By 1969-70, it begain to apply at 8 times earnings; by 1975-76 at 2.8 times average earnings; and by 1979-80 at 2.6 times average earnings. The dominant influence producing that trend has clearly been the effect of high rates of inflation on money incomes, which was particularly severe during the early 1970s. </PARA>
<PARA>Recent Review of Taxation Mix</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The Senate will be aware of the announcement by the Treasurer (Mr Howard) last November that the Government had decided to examine certain options for change to the present taxation system. We particularly had in mind whether the time had come to shift a greater burden of the revenue raising effort towards general consumption taxes, thus enabling reductions in personal income tax. The purpose of that exercise was to assess the desirability of altering the mix or combination of taxes, to the extent possible, in the context of reducing the overall burden of taxation; it was not to bring about an increase in the overall taxation burden. In conducting this examination the Government already had available to it a wealth of material canvassing options for changes to our system. These included in particular the very comprehensive Asprey report completed in 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as receiving advice from the Treasury and the Australian Taxation Office, the Treasurer sought the views of a number of industry groups as well as those of the trade union movement and the Government's Taxation Advisory Committee. The Government was conscious when it commenced its examination that there were strong arguments both for and against greater reliance on indirect taxation. The arguments for a change included:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) greater community sensitivity towards personal income tax, being as it is the most visible form of taxation;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) the economic advantages of a different mix of taxation, particularly if a greater reliance on indirect tax takes the form of applying to a broad range of goods and services. I cite particularly the need to avoid disincentive to saving, investment and risk taking and to obtain greater flexibility in demand and revenue management;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) indirect taxation is somewhat harder to evade and avoid than personal income tax; and</PARA>
<PARA> (4) the possibility that revenue from the crude oil levy would grow less rapidly in the years immediately ahead. </PARA>
<PARA>The major arguments against a change were seen as-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) the effect of any change on the consumer price index, particularly at a time when inflationary expectations are delicately balanced;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) the consequences of any additional anti-inflationary measures the Government might find necessary to apply;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) the regressive effects that certain forms of indirect taxation can have, although these effects will vary in intensity according to the items included in any broadened indirect tax base. </PARA>
<PARA> There were essentially three options for change. These were extending the coverage of the existing wholesale tax to additional goods and also imposing a tax on selected services; introduction of a general retail sales tax, that is a tax paid by consumers at the final point of sale; and a value-added tax which would be imposed at all stages of the production and distribution chain for goods and services. A multi-stage VAT was rejected fairly quickly because it would have imposed an enormous paper work burden on both taxpayers and collecting authorities. A retail turnover tax had some strong arguments in its favour, particularly its lack of bias on expenditure patterns and its ability to generate substantial revenue from low rates of tax. </PARA>
<PARA> It was calculated that the potential value in any one year of sales of goods and services to consumers was some $70,000m and after allowing for those items which for constitutional or practical reasons it would be very difficult to tax, it was believed that the potential base for a retail turnover tax on goods and services was in the order of $55,000-$60,000m. However, a retail turnover tax would have involved a very extensive licensing system, and the necessity for a significant increase in the number of taxpaying units-perhaps as many as 350,000-and administrative staff-perhaps 3,500. There was the further complication that a period of two years would have elapsed before a retail turnover tax on goods and services could have been fully in place. </PARA>
<PARA> We concluded that, if we were to broaden the indirect tax base the simplest method would be to extend the existing wholesale sales tax to some goods now exempt and to impose a tax on selected services. Administratively, the former would be quite straightforward and could be implemented quickly; in the main it would involve a small number of relatively large businesses with developed accounting systems. </PARA>
<PARA> The supplementary tax on selected services posed rather more difficulties and could have taken more than 12 months to implement, depending on the number and character of the services that might be taxed. Although the practical problems posed by an expression of the wholesale tax base and the introduction of a tax on selected services would have been considerably less than those involved in the other options before the Government there were, nonetheless, a number of difficulties involved in such a change. </PARA>
<PARA> There was of course the very basic question of whether there should be any exemption in a broadened wholesale tax base. For example, were 'basic foodstuffs' to be exempt and, if so, which ones? Should prescribed medicines be included? Should goods subject to excise be exempt? Should inputs to further production such as building materials be exempt? In this connection, it is worth noting that if food and clothing, for example, were exempt this would more than halve the coverage of expenditure and thus the revenue base. </PARA>
<PARA> There was also the problem of the rate structure. Whilst a single rate of tax would have been very attractive from an administrative point of view, the graduation in the existing wholesale tax scales suggested that goods and services which could not properly be regared as necessities should be taxed at a higher rate than commodities seen as essential to everyday life. The introduction of a tax on selected services would, of course, have broken new ground. That, of itself, would have involved the difficulties of educating the large number of new taxpayers and recruiting and training administrative staff. There were also some problems to be resolved on how to avoid double taxation of goods which form part of a service. </PARA>
<PARA> It should also be noted that given certain constitutional and other constraints, the base for taxation of services is somewhat more limited than might be imagined. For example, some obvious candidates like betting and gambling are already the subject of state taxes, while interstate passenger and freight movements fall outside the Commonwealth's taxation powers. In addition, it would have been undesirable to tax public services such as those provided by educational institutions and hospitals. </PARA>
<PARA> Throughout its consideration of this issue, the Government remained firmly of the view that if a shift towards greater emphasis on indirect taxation were to occur, it should be accompanied by a noticeable reduction in personal income tax. The Government was aware when it commenced its examination that any increase in indirect taxation would affect the consumer price index. However, it was not until detailed projections of likely price effects as a consequence of particular levels of indirect taxation and also the cost to revenue of compensating personal tax reductions became known that the total implications of a shift towards greater reliance on indirect tax were fully appreciated by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> There was-and perhaps still is-a fairly widely held view in the community that a quite noticeable reduction in personal income tax can be achieved through a relatively modest increase in reliance on indirect taxation. That, regrettably, is not the case. Let me illustrate by describing the considerations which finally led to the Government's decision. In deciding whether to broaden the wholesale tax base or to retain the status quo, the Government was caught in the dilemma of not wishing to move towards greater reliance on indirect tax without providing a noticeable offset in personal tax reductions whilst being anxious to minimise the inflationary consequences of collecting additional revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> It soon became apparent that both of these objectives could not be achieved. It was not possible to raise sufficient additional indirect taxation to provide noticeable personal tax relief without adding to the consumer price index in a major way. For example, to reduce the existing personal income tax scale by one cent at each step would cost the revenue $610m in 1980-81. Therefore, to convert the existing 32/46/60 rate scale into, say, a 27/41/55 rate scale, a total cost to revenue of about $3,000m would be involved. As a general rule, each additional $500m raised through indirect taxes results in direct and indirect additions to the consumer price index of almost 1 per cent. Furthermore, there are additional flow-on consequences for the consumer price index through the wage system which are hard to quantify. </PARA>
<PARA> There was the disturbing possibility that the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission could not be persuaded to discount effectively for the price effects of a shift towards greater reliance on indirect taxation. It will thus be seen that in order to have raised sufficient revenue to bring about the personal tax reduction I have mentioned, the direct and indirect price effects would have been about 6 per cent, with at least the strong possibility of substantial additional flow-on consequences via the wage fixation system. </PARA>
<PARA> I should emphasise that the example of reducing personal taxation which I have just used does not in any way misrepresent the cost to revenue of various changes to the burden of personal income tax. For example, full tax indexation in 1980-81 would cost the revenue about $1,000m. A $100 increase in the tax-free threshold would cost $200m and a $100 increase in the dependent spouse rebate would cost $170m. Apart from these revenue considerations there would also have been a noticeable addition to expenditure as a consequence of the automatic indexation of pensions and benefits-in the order of $75m for each 1 per cent addition to the CPI-as well as the costs of any other compensatory action which may have been thought necessary in respect of those on low incomes. In reaching its decision, the Government naturally gave thought to future revenue trends. This involved not only making certain assumptions based on likely growth in the community, but also having regard to the fact that under existing policy, proceeds of the crude oil levy might begin to level out in real terms in the next couple of years. It should be said that these projections are necessarily difficult to make and reflect a large number of assumptions and judgements. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian economy is now growing very strongly. Provided the right economic policies are continued, the prospects are for reasonable levels of sustained growth through the 1980s. As I am sure the Senate will appreciate, the impact of this on revenue collections from the existing taxation base is quite considerable. One of the by-products of greater economic activity is an increase in taxation revenues as the tax base grows. Whilst, once again, projections are difficult to make with precision, there is gathering evidence that the growth in prospect in the Australian economy over the next four or five years will prove stronger than had been anticipated even 12 months ago. As a graphic illustration of this, the indications are that private sector capital investment in 1980-81 is likely to grow by about 20 per cent in real terms. These developments endorse the view that, provided rigorous expenditure restraint can be applied and maintained in the years immediately ahead, a responsible fiscal outcome can be achieved without a rise in the overall tax burden. It should nonetheless be noted that even in a situation where the overall tax burden did not rise at all, or even fell, personal income tax would under present policies be likely to assume a greater share of that burden. </PARA>
<PARA> Important though these practical difficulties and future revenue considerations were, the fundamental reasons for the Government's decision was its concern at the impact on inflation and inflationary expectations of any significant shift towards greater reliance on indirect taxation. This Government has fought long and hard to restore domestic economic conditions of growth and stability and to retrieve this country's international reputation as a low inflation, economically stable nation. There is no more conspicuous hallmark of these achievements than our continued ability to contain inflation. Perceptions and expectations assume great relevance in economic matters. Rightly or wrongly, no economic indicator is more universally regarded as a barometer of a government's success or failure in economic management than the consumer price index. Therefore, and despite obvious advantages from many other points of view, the Government came firmly to the conclusion that the inevitable squandering of the gains made and maintained in the fight against inflation in recent years was a price it was not prepared to pay. </PARA>
<PARA>Other Taxes</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> No statement of this kind would be complete without some reference to other forms of taxation. Unlike most other OECD countries, Australia does not impose any general capital taxes at the federal level. Other OECD countries levy one or more of capital gains taxes, net wealth taxes or death duties. Australia does not have a capital gains tax or a net wealth tax and, as I noted earlier, the Commonwealth has ceased levying gift and estate duty and of course the States have either removed or substantially cut back their probate duties. With the exception therefore of taxes on specific forms of property, such as local government rates and State land taxes, Australians are very largely free of capital taxes. If the experience of other countries is any guide, general capital taxes are unlikely to raise substantial amounts of revenue unless imposed at very high rates. If that were to occur, there would be a real risk of undersirable effects on the tax structure and the economy. It is a plain fact that if any capital gains tax were to exclude basic holdings such as the family home, then in order to yield large amounts of revenue it would be necessary to impose it at a quite significant rate on other assets. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is opposed to the introduction of a resources tax. It believes that many of the advocates of such a tax ignore the disincentive effect such a tax would have on investment and development in Australia. They also ignore the contribution which companies earning very large profits make towards Commonwealth and State revenues through the existing tax structure. This occurs not only through company tax but also royalties paid to State governments. A recent mining industry survey showed that, of 81 mining companies questioned, government charges and taxes represented 56 per cent of the companies' pre-tax operating profits and that the companies involved paid a total of $1,113m to different governments in 1979-80. </PARA>
<PARA> The tax system is not the only mechanism through which the Government can ensure that Australians receive a fair share of the development of our natural resources. Our foreign investment policy, which will be fully applied, requires as a general rule Australian equity participation of at least 50 per cent Australian ownership, or 75 per cent Australian ownership in the case of uranium projects. Recently questions have been raised as to whether sufficient opportunity exists for the small investor to participate in resource development. It is undeniable that in recent years there has been a marked trend towards larger equity holdings by institutions at the expense of the individual investor. The taxation system is frequently blamed for this development and it may well be that the existing taxation treatment of inter alia dividend income has discouraged the small investor. The matter is not, however, free from doubt and such evidence as is available suggests that the trend I have mentioned has occurred in those countries which treat dividend income more generously than does Australia as well as those which have a similar approach to ours. This matter has been the subject of submissions to an investigation by the Campbell Committee of Inquiry into the Australian Financial System. The Government will await with interest the views of that inquiry on this subject. I should make it plain that the Government is anxious to respond in an appropriate way to the desire of individual Australians to participate in our development. </PARA>
<PARA>Tax Avoidance</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>A conspicuous feature of this Government's approach to taxation has been its uncompromising attack upon tax avoidance. The Government is determined to deal with those who seek to avoid payment of their fair share of taxation. Such people push the tax burden more heavily on to the great majority of citizens who are responsible taxpayers. They are justifiably resented. The Government's record on tax avoidance and evasion is evidence enough of its resolve to bear down on it. Since 1977, nine Bills incorporating some 24 legislative measures against income tax avoidance arrangements have been introduced. Other amendments have been enacted to deal with sales tax avoidance arrangements. More measures directed against income tax avoidance have been announced in four separate statements issued by me in the past year. All areas of avoidance have been tackled. We have acted both against schemes creating deductions and against schemes which attempt to shield income from tax. We have adopted a policy of banning the carry forward of paper losses from schemes entered into before the operative date of remedial legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Decisive action has also been taken against tax evasion. Last year, the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act was passed into law. This legislation was an entirely appropriate and necessary response to fraudulent conduct designed to prevent the collection of lawfully payable tax. It contains penalties of five years gaol and fines of up to $50,000 for those who act, or aid or abet someone to act, to prevent the collection of lawfully payable tax. Honourable senators will be aware that the Government has been engaged for some time in the task of re-writing section 260 which is the general anti-avoidance provision of the Income Tax Assessment Act. Those who criticise the time taken do not appreciate the significant task involved in this exercise. The Government has the twin aim in this area of devising an effective anti-avoidance section whilst not getting in the way of legitimate commercial transactions and arrangements. The balance to be struck is a delicate one and considerable care is required if both these aims are to be realised. </PARA>
<PARA> The work on section 260 has involved not only officers of the Australian Taxation Office but also the obtaining of advice from private counsel. The Treasurer has also sought the advice of the Government's Taxation Advisory Committee which in the 12 months of its existence has provided invaluable private sector professional comment upon taxation legislation. The process of re-writing section 260 is near to an end and the Treasurer hopes soon to present it to Parliament. Proper time will be allowed for comment before Parliament is asked to approve the new section. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent days the Treasurer has told the House that section 136, which deals in principle with transfer pricing arrangements by certain companies, is also under review, particularly as a consequence of the decision of the High Court last year in the Commonwealth Aluminium Corporation Ltd case. The case appears to indicate that the power of the Commissioner of Taxation to fix an arms length price is considerably less than previously believed. I repeat previous assurances given to the Senate that this Government will remain tenacious in seeking out and dealing with taxation avoidance arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>Debate on taxation can never be wholly conclusive. It is an inherently controversial subject. Opinion as to the appropriate shape of our taxation system will vary sharply throughout the community. It has not been possible for me in this statement to canvass all aspects of our taxation system. I have, however, endeavoured to put consideration of our taxation system into a better perspective and to state some of the realities which must be accepted if sensible debate on taxation is to occur. The most dominant reality is that governments cannot tax less unless they spend less. </PARA>
<PARA> This Government remains committed to further reforms to, and where possible reductions in, levels of taxation. Progress towards these goals cannot proceed in isolation from the general conduct of economic policy. To the extent that we are successful in achieving our economic goals, so we shall be successful, I believe, in achieving our broad objectives in the area of taxation. I present the following paper:</PARA>

Senator Young did that repeatedly.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On the matter of co-operation in the business of the Senate, I certainly would have appreciated it if the Government had been able to tell us precisely when this statement was to be introduced. Since about half past four this afternoon I have been trying to get a statement through the Opposition Whip from the Government about when the statement would be introduced. As far as I know we were never told. We certainly were not told unless it was in the last few minutes prior to the suspension of the sitting for dinner. The Government is in control of the business of the Senate. I think it is quite reasonable to expect that the Government, when it is bringing down an important statement like this, will let the Opposition know at the beginning of the day's sitting precisely when that statement will be brought down. No such courtesy was extended to us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The statement has all the marks of what my colleague the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) once described as a cut-out-and-paste job in relation to an energy statement which was introduced by Mr Newman a few years ago. It appears that there is a fundamental dichotomy in the statement. Half of it appears to have been written by the bureaucracy-it is written in descriptive and dispassionate terms. The other half appears to have been written in the political office of the Treasurer (Mr Howard). It is, of course, political propaganda. I think it is most appropriate that in the copy which I received and which, at least, some others received, the pages which contain the tables and which constitute the appendices, are upside down. I think that is most appropriate because, in several instances, the statement proper does, in fact, stand truth on its head. The first example of that can be found on page 4 where it states:</PARA>
<PARA>This fact--</PARA>
<PARA>That is, the fact that Australian taxes, by comparison with other Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development countries, are not high--</PARA>
<PARA>does not show that Australian taxes should be higher. Indeed--</PARA>
<PARA>The statement has the audacity to assert--</PARA>
<PARA>it is our objective to further reduce them. </PARA>
<PARA>This clearly asserts, of course, that the Government has reduced taxes. The fact is acknowledged three pages later-presumably this is one of the dispassionate sections written within the bureaucracy-on page 7 that:</PARA>
<PARA> During the five years this Government has been in office, Commonwealth tax receipts as a proportion of GDP have risen from 23.2 per cent to an estimated 24.8 per cent in the current financial year. </PARA>
<PARA>On page 3 of the statement we have the false implication that the Government has reduced taxes and has the intention of further reducing them. On page 7 we have the dispassionate admission that, in fact, taxes as a proportion of gross domestic product have increased by 1.6 per cent while this Government has been in office. The only additional thing that ought to be added, of course, is that taxes as a proportion of GDP are higher right now than they have ever been in the country's history. The Government has the audacity to imply that it has reduced taxation and will continue to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> That passage on page 7 is immediately followed by an assertion that the reduced deficit which has been estimated for this year but which does not look like being met, at least not for the full magnitude of the estimated reduction, is due, in large measure, the statement states, to expenditure restraint. The reduction in the deficit, if it is finally realised, will be almost precisely equal to the increase in the crude oil levy. The reason the deficit has been reduced has nothing to do with expenditure restraint because expenditure, in fact, in real terms, has increased by at least 3 per cent and is entirely a function of the large increase in taxation contained in this year's Budget. </PARA>
<PARA> On page 8 there is a reference made to table 5, one of the appendices to the statement, which purports to compare rates of tax applying under the schedule which applied prior to 1977 and rates of tax which apply now. Of course, since the calculations of tax paid made no allowances for the fact that the same money income in those different periods is a very different real income, the superficial impression generated by an examination of that table is that, in fact, taxes are substantially lower under the present schedule than they were in the pre-1977 schedule. It would have been even more dramatic-I wonder why the Government did not do this-if it had included the 1950 taxation schedule without making any allowance for changing money values over the period. The misleading effect which the Government is trying to get across would have been even more startling if that sort of fallacious comparison had been made. A few pages later, getting back to the section which it would seem the bureaucracy wrote, it states:</PARA>
<PARA> In all our analysis of changes to the taxation system, we should never lose sight of the impact of inflation upon a progressive tax scale. </PARA>
<PARA>This is an appropriate time, I think, to refer to a question asked by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Hayden) on 25 February. He reminded the Prime Minister of his 1975 policy promise when the Prime Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> We will fully index personal income tax for inflation over three years . . . It will make government more honest with your money. </PARA>
<PARA>That was the bold rhetoric of 1975. When the Leader of the Opposition asked whether tax indexation had been abandoned the Prime Minister replied:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . it has been difficult for the people of Australia to understand the benefits of indexation in terms of a policy of tax reductions. </PARA>
<PARA>I want to pursue that point a little more. The assertion by the Prime Minister that a policy of tax indexation is a policy of tax reduction, an assertion which is repeated on several occasions throughout the statement although not in precisely that form, is again fallacious. The plain truth is that unless the taxation schedule is fully indexed, anything less than full indexation is, in fact, an increase in taxation. </PARA>
<PARA> There are numerous assertions of the Government's alleged activity in the area of tax avoidance. Certainly, plenty of legislation has been put up to the Parliament. Plenty of other Acts have been wheeled up to the Parliament which open up additional loopholes which the tax avoiders and evaders may exploit. One of the recent examples of this, currently in the pipeline, is the taxation rort promised by the Prime Minister for film making. Originally this was costed at $2m. Now, by admission of the Treasurer only yesterday, it is costing at least $20m. If the legislation is to be as loose as has been forecast, the cost of it, at least in the first financial year, is more likely to run into hundreds of millions of dollars. Certainly the Government has done all those things but the plain fact remains that it refuses to take the one simple step which would be effective against tax avoidance and that is, the credible threat of retrospective legislation. In spite of the activity-there has been activity in terms of the number of Bills wheeled up to the Parliament-the plain fact remains that the leakage of the revenue due to tax avoidance is greater than it has ever been and it appears to be still rising. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Given recent changes on the High Court Bench a new section 260 might have more chance of standing up than the old one would have had. But a credible threat of retrospective legislation would kill the tax avoidance industry stone dead. On page 3 of the statement there is really an apologia for tax avoiders. It states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The extent to which this principle should apply-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, capacity to pay income tax and so on-</PARA>
<PARA>must in turn be tempered by the recognition that if marginal tax rates become too high, adverse effects on incentives occur with consequent loss of economic efficiency with productivity and greater resort to tax avoidance. </PARA>
<PARA>In more simple language the argument being put forward is that high marginal rates of taxation are a deterrent to effort and an incentive to tax avoidance. I will deal with the latter point first. It is again a fact that the maximum marginal rate of tax, presently 60 per cent, is the lowest it has ever been since uniform taxation was introduced in 1942. Yet in spite of that the leakage of revenue because of tax avoidance is greater than it has ever been. The reason for that has nothing to do with marginal taxation rates. It has a great deal to do with the bizarre judgment of the High Court of Australia and with the present ethical standards or the standards of fiscal morality which prevail in public life. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party of Australia was exposed publicly as a speculator in land through insider trading. He took measures to avoid tax on the profits gained. He was readmitted to the Ministry and again became the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party. The Deputy Leader of the Country Party, on his own admission, still has custody of $200,000 misappropriated by his father. The Prime Minister's relatives, apparently with the connivance of the Premier of Victoria, received loans at an interest rate of 4 per cent in ways which, if not illegal, certainly were highly irregular. The present Prime Minister presides over the lowest ethical standards that any Australian Prime Minister has ever tolerated. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn to the alleged disincentive effect of high marginal tax rates on effort. It is peculiar, given the stress placed on this argument by the Government and its supporters, that they never bother to mention that the effective rate of taxation for pensioners earning more than $20 a week is, in fact, 82 per cent because of the combined operation of getting into the bracket where income is taxable and the fact that their pensions are reduced by 50c for every additional dollar earned. The effective rate of taxation for pensioners earning more than $20 a week is 82 per cent. We hear nothing about that from the Government, yet the Treasurer puts his name to an assertion that the present marginal tax rate of 60 per cent is a significant disincentive to work. The position of the unemployed who earn more than $6 a week is even more striking. Their effective marginal tax rate is 100 per cent because every dollar earned above $6 a week reduces their unemployment benefit by--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because they incur some expenses in earning the income; that is a fair point, too. On page 10 of the statement there is a reference to primary producers. It reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Tax averaging provisions for primary producers have been improved and enable primary producers to even out the inevitable fluctuations in taxable incomes which occur in rural Australia. </PARA>
<PARA>It does not specify what those improvements have been but I will elaborate on what they presumably are. The evening out in fluctuations in incomes presumably refers to income equalisation deposits which would be an equitable and sensible measure had it not been sabotaged and undermined by the ill-considered amendments which the Government made to tax averaging provisions in 1977. In 1977 after the very hasty changes to the tax schedule had been rushed through the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, apparently with little or no consultation with the tax experts at the Treasury, the Government was under attack from the farming sector. The Government then introduced an arrangement under which primary producers, if their taxable income in a year was lower than the five-year average, would have their tax liability assessed at the current year's income. If their taxable income in a particular year was higher than the five-year average, their taxation liability was assessed at the rate applicable to the average income instead of the actual higher income. I suppose that probably sounds a bit complicated to people who are not familiar with that matter, but I thought it was beautifully summed up at the National Agricultural Outlook Conference held at the end of January by none other than the Secretary of the Treasury, John Stone. Professor Lloyd of the School of Agriculture at Melbourne University attacked this report that had been written into the Income Tax Assessment Act in 1977 by the Government. The chairman of the Conference proceedings asked Mr Stone whether he would like to make a comment. He said: 'No, I have no comment to make other than to say that the present system is one of heads we win'-that is, the farmers win-'and tails all other taxpayers lose'. That rort has been under attack at the National Agricultural Outlook Conference. It was under severe attack at a seminar conducted by the Rural Adjustment Unit of New England University a few months before. Its removal has been explicitly recommended in a report that came from that institution. Before turning from Mr Stone, I note from the Treasurer's other statement today that:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Stone has assured me that in accordance with long-standing convention regarding public servants commenting upon policy issues, it was not his intention to publicly advocate or infer support for-</PARA>
<PARA>The statement continued. It can be seen very clearly from the example I have just quoted that Mr Stone was commenting on a policy issue which, indeed, is not at all unusual for him. He has been travelling around the country for the last couple of years delivering highly political speeches in respect of government policy. He gets into trouble with the Treasurer, however, only when he is reported making comments that are critical of or in disagreement with government policy. There is dispassionate reference in the statement-so I presume it was written by the bureaucracy-to the fact that no Federal capital taxation exists in Australia, that State capital taxation exists to only a negligible degree and that Australia is one of the very few countries, if not the only country, in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in which this applies. I think an excellent indicator of the moral poverty of this country is the fact that that is one of its proudest boasts when two million Australians live in poverty. The statement repeats that the Government is opposed to a resources rent tax although I note for the record the considered answers today of the Minister for National Development and Energy, when he, like John Stone last Friday, knew exactly what he was saying. Senator Carrick certainly indicated that as far as he was concerned a resources rent tax was still an option which was open. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that until now the Government has refused to impose a resources rent tax has led to many absurdities and has helped to create situations which the Government, according to its own value judgments, finds quite distressing. It is predictable that into a tax vacuum, such as that which the rejection of a resources rent tax has induced, somebody else will move and this has happened. The unions have moved in. Most dramatically in relation to the Utah Development Co. coal fields and the Utah employees of central Queensland, the unions are taxing away a portion of the economic rent which the Government has refused to collect. The current campaign to obtain a 35-hour week in high profit industries which with their low labour requirements are capital intensive, likewise is an attempt by the workers in those industries to tax away in the form of reduced working hours for themselves, the economic rent which the Government refuses to collect. The States are moving in with concealed, crude and inefficient attempts to appropriate economic rent by means such as excessive rail freights in Queensland, the Northern Territory's proposals to change the royalty provisions at Gove and, of course, more recently I think the Winchester coal project in southern Queensland. It has produced the absence of a sensible, rational resources rent tax. Such a tax has not been opposed, to my knowledge, by any economist in Australia other than those who have direct associations with the mining industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The abdication from the introduction of a resources rent tax has produced such idiocies or absurdities as the advocacy by the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Baume) last Thursday night that an export tax should be imposed on unprocessed raw materials. That is the full resurrection of Tudor mercantilism. That is exactly what Tudor mercantilism was based on. It was based upon embargoes on the export of raw materials which could be further processed in England. Its resurrection is being advocated by a Government member who has some pretensions to understanding in this area. I also note for the record that he recommended a similar tax on livestock exports. It puts him in the same bed as members of the Australasian Meat Industry Employees Union who are attempting to restrict the export of livestock so that it can be further processed-that is, killed and dressed-within Australia. The Government's abdication of responsibility in this area has certainly produced some strange bedfellows. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, I really do not know why the Government has made this statement. Caught by the historical imperative, perhaps, that it said it was going to introduce the statement, it felt obliged to do so. Possibly of equal or greater importance, I guess it did so to explain away the posturing of the last couple of months about how it was going to change the whole basis of the taxation system. Again, as it has customarily done in spite of its tough rhetoric, when confronted with significant opposition from people who were opposed for one reason or another to fundamental changes in the taxation system, it backed down to these pressures. The statement certainly does not constitute either an accurate assessment of the present taxation system or any sort of rational indications as to how it may be improved. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> -I enter this debate on several reports, some with application to foreign affairs, to consider our attitudes towards the Association of South East Asian Nations region, that is, what used to be called South East Asia. I have listened with some disquiet to some of the earlier speakers in this debate. They seem to feel that there is nothing much wrong in the ASEAN area, that it is now relatively placid and peaceful and is likely to continue in that way. That attitude, I believe, based on the facts of the past and the present, is dangerously unperceptive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is certainly a fact that South East Asia appears to be relatively peaceful after the storm of revolutions and civil wars that plagued that region for several decades. I would contend that it is mainly an appearance rather than a reality. We cannot look back on those decades of war, I believe, with any complacency, nor can we be assured that the conditions which created them no longer exist. Our involvement in Vietnam was part of a tragic adventure, the net consequence of which has been to extend the communist world so that it now includes the whole peninsula which was once called Indo-China, all of Vietnam, Laos and Cambodia. In other words, we were in any terms the losers by that process. </PARA>
<PARA> I think it is important for us to analyse why we were the losers by that process. Actions should, I believe, be primarily judged by their results. It is not good enough to say: 'We tried; we were wrong: But at least our motives were good'. Those are the sorts of things that are being said again now. People say: 'It did not work last time but maybe it will work this time'. I suggest that this attitude is not safe in today's world. Any effect which has diminished the free world or destroyed even a struggling and inadequate type of democracy, is not an effect that can be applauded. </PARA>
<PARA> When one looks back on the history of South East Asia, it is quite evident that simplistic theories like the domino theory, which was quite the vogue at one time-it asserted that one nation would fall to communism if its neighbours fell-have to be ignored as the dangerous, simplistic nonsense that they are. Nations are not dominoes; they are complex entities much less bound by general principles than we would like to imagine and much more conditioned by their own peculiar history and their own state of society. </PARA>
<PARA> If there appears to me to be any universal theme-I have made something of a study of this area-it must be that communism extended in Asia where there was a suitable climate in which it could prosper. I think that climate can be identified fairly easily and has lessons for us in the ASEAN region again. Indeed, a similar type of pattern applied in all of the ASEAN countries that have become communist since the end of World War II. The scenario was pretty much the same everywhere. It was found in those nations in which there was a gross disproportion of wealth, where often much of the wealth was in the hands of a few families with acute problems of landlessness, dictatorial government-often, indeed, of those wealthy families-widespread social injustice or a lack of any of the normal services that a state should provide its people such as medical care, social services and education, and a close association of the ruling junta with a military force designed not so much to protect that nation from outside aggression but to keep its own people in subjection. That was the case in China, Vietnam and Korea. The communist revolts in Malaysia, Luzon and Java-for instance, the Madiun affair-were caused not by any domino effect but by the poverty, landlessness and sheer despair of the majority of people in that area. They were driven to it by what seemed to them to be the force of necessity of their own circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> Through you, Mr President, I shall give honourable senators an analogy. A bad tennis player will beat himself with little effort on the part of his opponent. I believe that that analogy might be applied to the attitudes of the West over the last two decades towards the spread of communism in Asia. Speaking of the West in its generality, which includes Australia, we have too often supported the unpopular military juntas and we are still supporting them now. What we fail to see, I think, is that just as military juntas have fallen in the past in the spite of our assistance, so those we are now supporting will also fall. History does not change. Cause leads to effect. I believe that there is nothing we can do about that. Granted that fact, we can assume that further trouble is only a matter of time. Can we afford the risk of associating ourselves with that kind of problem? Can we afford a situation in which Australia slowly becomes separated wholly from Europe and America by a steadily-growing group of communist states to our north? Can we not say that those who over the last 40 years or so have presented us with solutions to the spread of communism have not always been wrong? They have been wrong to the extent that every exercise they have prompted us into has led to a defeat. Their solutions were wrong. I think it is time that we understand that. </PARA>
<PARA> If we look again at our experience in Vietnam, it ought to demonstrate that fact to us. The military effort poured into that country was enormous. By any reasonable assessment it should have prevailed; yet it did not. The only way that it could have succeeded-I think this is generally admitted-would have been, in effect, to destroy an entire nation and its people. If we reach the stage where our policies have that sort of end, I think we all might as well turn on the gas oven, because there is no future for the world or any nation in it if our policies and aims can only go that way. </PARA>
<PARA> A study of the early history of Vietnam-I refer to the period between the end of World War II, when a provisional independent government was set up in Hanoi, and the fall of Dien Bien Phu-shows a trend which ought to be of great interest to us in our assessment of the ASEAN region as it stands now. Of course, that trend has an equally important application in central America. I believe that the situation there is probably analogous to the ASEAN situation. Before the French reoccupied North Vietnam, the Communist Party-then basically the Vietminh, which had been a resistance movement during the war-was very much a minority in the independence movement, which included many other elements including the Roman Catholic Church. According to Donald Lancaster, who is an authority on that period, Ho Chi Minh himself appealed at that stage to the French: 'Given me some weapon against the extremists. You will never regret it'. But Admiral Argenlieu and the French hawks were determined to reimpose the colonial era. </PARA>
<PARA> The effect of this was to begin the war, that same tragic war in which we and the United States were eventually involved. That war and the conditions it brought gradually and steadily increased the influence of the Vietminh. Gradually all nationalists were forced into the arms of the communists and the communists came at last to dominate that independence movement. The rest of it is history which is familiar enough to all of us. That process is something which may well happen again. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I am trying to make is that every effort we make in Australia, which is a democracy, to sustain and encourage democracies in the ASEAN countries will be in our own interests in the long run. If we try to sustain and to help military juntas and military solutions, we will be contributing to further defeats which might eventually encompass our own defeat. I think we should consider that thought. There is a tendency for nations, especially happy nations like our own, to believe that they are immune from the processes of history and that terrible things happen to other people but not to them. Of course, history teaches us that that is not the case. It seems to me that this is so obvious a lesson of recent history as to be virtually axiomatic. </PARA>
<PARA> From that background, let us look a little more closely at the ASEAN nations of the world today. What do we find? We find that the huge majority of the ASEAN population-in Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines-live in conditions which are becoming steadily worse, not better. In the Philippines, standards of living, education and food supply are deteriorating. Child mortality is on the increase. There is a gross financial disproportion. Nothing effective has been done about the problems of landlessness and poverty in the barrios. In Manila persists a government which uses armed force against its own people to maintain itself in power. In Jakarta the generals, corrupt, autocratic and self-seeking, impose themselves on South East Asia's largest nation in exactly the same way. </PARA>
<PARA> I still have many contacts with Indonesia and I can assure honourable senators that most Indonesians regard their Government with fear and hatred, and with good reason. Poverty, disease, bad housing conditions, and economic disproportion flourish throughout the archipelago. Of course, we have seen an act of the most blatant and unjustified aggression in recent years in the takeover of East Timor. Indonesia had no rights whatsoever to it historically, ethnically or in any other way. That has been associated, tragically, with an act of virtual genocide against the Timorese people which we in this country, to our eternal shame, have tolerated. It is a black page in the history of this country that we allowed that to happen to a small and weak neighbour which made many acts of generosity towards our own servicemen during World War II. So our act of treachery was all the greater and all the more unforgivable.</PARA>
<PARA> Thailand, once a graceful, prosperous nation which could export rice, is now in the throes of a population explosion which is forcing more and more people into poverty and even starvation, especially in the remote impoverished north-east region which borders Laos and Cambodia. Here again a military junta maintains itself by turning its weapons against its own people. In other words, in all these places the tinder is there ready for the spark. Just as in China, Vietnam, Korea, Laos, Cambodia and Cuba, it is only a matter of time. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that I sound as if I am preaching a gospel of despair and I do not want to do that. The real point I wish to make is that where ASEAN is concerned, I believe we in Australia have a special obligation and duty to encourage in every way we can forces that might restore democracy and self-determination. We have a special duty to set our forces against the forces of suppression, evil and dictatorship and a special duty to speak out against these things. Yet we tend not to do that. We tend to accept them. We would not accept them in our own country, but we accept them there. </PARA>
<PARA> I have tried to show that for reasons of history such an active role on our part can be seen purely as one of our own self-interest. We cannot afford to go on backing or encouraging losers. We cannot go on countenancing social conditions which we know, or should know perfectly well, are ideal for the propagation and continuation of communism. If we believe in freedom and if we believe in our own system of democracy, we should try to ensure that as best we can, without undue interference in the affairs of other nations, we encourage those values elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> I worked for a number of years in South East Asia. At one time I was an adviser to a Thai Cabinet Minister. I suspect that sympathetic interest from this country would be taken pretty much at face value. We would be given much more credence and credibility than I believe we think we would. Our example, I think, is looked at keenly. If we show signs of accepting the terrible lack of values which occur in South East Asia, I think those countries would see it as tacit approval. We might also have that on our conscience. I use this debate to criticise the Government for its apathy, its spinelessness in foreign affairs and its apparent inability to recognise these forces of history which I assure honourable senators there is no escape from, except to change one's attitude to cope with those forces in a proper way and a constructive way. </PARA>
<PARA> It is against this background of instability, of fragile, ineffective and dictatorial regimes which dominate most of the peoples of the ASEAN region, that I believe we must regard with alarm recent tendencies in the United States to revert to the philosophy of the past, the disasters of the 1960s, the use of military solutions, the willingness to plunge whole populations into chaos and to contribute to the deaths of tens of thousands of innocent people in the name of world zonal rivalry. This is a failing procedure. It is something which I do not believe we can accept again in terms of sheer cold expediency. Of course there is a humanitarian reason, a moral reason, for objecting to these horrors, this butchery of innocent people who are often too ill-educated and too badly informed to know even what are the forces that are destroying them. I know that honourable senators have the humanity and compassion to recognise that. </PARA>
<PARA> The reason for this speech is to reiterate that, purely in our own self-interest and that of our allies, it would be stupid, dangerous and self-destructive to think that a return to the policies of the past will do anything but damage us. Hence, I appeal to the Government to begin, as soon as possible, to use its good offices, in association with other interested middle powers, to try to modify in every way we can the extreme attitudes of the new Reagan-Haig Administration in the United States. We must start in San Salvador. There is a strong parallel between San Salvador and the past problems of the ASEAN countries. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely the aim there ought to be to end the conflict, to get that small country away from the zonal conflict, if necessary under the aegis of the United Nations, and allow it to work out its own destiny through a referred process of self-determination. If the President of the United States and the Russian leaders wanted to do so they could do something which would probably save the lives of scores of people every day-thousands of innocent people in totality-and be doing something worthwhile. I do not know whether honourable senators had the opportunity of listening to the Australian Broadcasting Commission's P.M. program tonight, which gave a most harrowing account by Alex Brody in San Salvador of what is happening there. Young people in their teens are lying about in the streets with their heads cut off or their feet cut off and showing evidence of torture to their bodies before they were killed. </PARA>
<PARA> An account was given of two young men who had nothing whatsoever to do with the revolution and who allegedly owed money to a woman. She denounced them to the national guard. She arranged a meeting at a bus stop with the two young men. The national guard came along and the two young men were shot in the back of the head. The woman was then asked whether three other young people who had been casually standing at the bus stop were in fact guerrillas. She was so frightened that she said yes. Those three men were then taken away, tortured and killed. I will not spare honourable senators the details of the situation in that country. Another account was given of bodies lying in the streets and of a photographer going by and seeing one being eaten by a dog. A little later in the day that body was being pulled to pieces by vultures. </PARA>
<PARA> We are a small country, too. It could happen here if we allow the system of small countries being dominated and ruled entirely by the zonal conflict to continue in the world. I appeal to the Government to consider these matters carefully, not to sit passively by, not to allow our friends in the United States to feel that what they are doing is right. The world is full of strong people who have sycophants around them who say: 'You are right. Of course you are right. We agree with you' even though they know it is not true. It is not an honourable role to pursue. It is not a right, proper, honest or moral role. We should speak to our friends, if we are true friends, and say that we disagree, that there may be other ways, that there may be a middle course. The Australian Democrats are afraid that if everybody sits passively and allows the world to drift again into a conflict which could, for the reasons I have given, grow into another running sore such as Vietnam then we can only expect worse trouble than we have had before. </PARA>
<PARA> If the ASEAN countries, particularly-there could be an extension there if we have this philosophy on a global basis-are to have any hope of more equal, democratic and prosperous communities, the demand there, more than anything else, is for peace. That is the thing that is needed more than anything else. The most dangerous thing that can happen to those societies, the thing which will breed an extension of communism faster and more surely than anything else, is war and military measures. If we cannot see, from the history of the last 30 years, that that is true then we are too silly to continue to survive as a nation in this world. The ominous words we hear from time to time from Washington, from President Reagan and from Secretary Haig that threaten conflict and war rather than peace are tragic. I think it demonstrates a misunderstanding of what the world needs at this stage. I wish I could feel confident that those uttering those words have a clear understanding of the likely results of that conflict and war. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will confine my remarks to the report brought down by the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. As a member of that Committee I would like to record my compliments to the Chairman, Senator Sim, under whose excellent chairmanship the Committee has worked together as a team since 1976. Each member has contributed in his own way and, with a different approach to the many terms of references and under Senator Sim's able chairmanship, has brought down recommendations which have been supported by the Committee as a whole. We will miss Senator Sim when he retires later this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I should also like to take this opportunity to thank the five Association of South East Asian Nations for the hospitality and assistance they afforded to Senator Sim, Senator Primmer and myself when we visited those countries in April last year to collect information for the ASEAN report. Other members of the Committee who have spoken on the report have made reference to the mistakes which were made over the International Civil Aviation Policy agreement. Qantas Airways Ltd came in for its share of criticism, especially from Singapore. I dare say that mistakes were made on both sides, and Singapore, when it found itself in a rather bad negotiating position immediately donned the cloak of ASEAN. I think it should be made quite clear by the ASEAN nations that they have a responsibility too, and that is to say when they are acting as an economic bloc and when they are acting bilaterally. That is a responsibility which they should face up to. I do not entirely blame Qantas for acting bilaterally when it does not know the rules of the game which ASEAN is playing. I am quite sure that Singapore Airlines Ltd, when it is negotiating with European countries in regard to their airlines does not negotiate with the European Economic Community and would be quite annoyed if any member of the European Economic Community suddenly dived for the cover of the EEC without Singapore Airlines knowing. Singapore seems to want it both ways. It also claims to be a Third World nation, but I have doubts about that.</PARA>
<PARA> During the Committee's inquiries into the question of financing Asian students who attend Australian universities, there was quite a bit of discussion. I agree with my colleagues that we should increase the number of talented students we sponsor from the less privileged families in South East Asia. However, I point out to the Senate that we can do a lot more effective work to assist to train some of the young men and women in the manual trades in Thailand and in Indonesia. It is all very well training academics and having a troop of chiefs but not enough Indians. When these people return to their country they find that there are not enough trained men for them to work with. I feel that we could do a lot more in that area. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee had the opportunity, while it was in Bangkok, to visit a school which was set up by the International Labour Organisation. Instructors were supplied to teach the instructors on trade training methods for the young men and women in Thailand. We found that they were very much in need of funds. They wanted only simple technical books. They were not getting the trade training which we would get here in Australia, but what they were taught were the basics of the trade which would equip them for the industrialisation of that country. Both Germany and Japan were assisting in every way possible, and a lot of credit went to Germany and Japan because they saw the potential there. I am afraid that Australia is lacking very badly in its level of assistance in the training of some of these young people in the manual arts. We should have a lot more craftsmen in those countries and we can do a lot more towards training them. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate Committee report was originally tabled in December 1980. There was correspondence between the President and the Committee with regard to the availability of finance for travel. I should like to say a word or two on that subject. Senators take a great pride in the committee system. Indeed, when one listens to most honourable senators talking about the parliamentary system one finds that they seem to hold the committee system very high in their list of priorities. One must give credit to the Government for issuing a directive to Ministers that they should reply to recommendations contained in committee reports within six months of their being tabled. However, that directive is not always complied with. </PARA>
<PARA> The lack of funds for travel reduced the role of the committee to a rather farcial one. Let me explain what happens in regard to a committee such as the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. The committee secretary inserts notices in the national papers seeking submissions from organisations or from individuals who feel that they have something to contribute in the field of foreign affairs. Only a small section of a community is deeply concerned with foreign affairs. Many people are not willing or are not able to contribute. The number of people is cut down further when they find that they must come before a committee or transfer their thoughts to writing. As Senator Primmer said when he spoke to the report, they are inclined to see things through Australian eyes. If one cares to check the list of those submissions and the people who put in those submissions-apart from government departments whose submissions we could not do without and to which we look forward on each occasion-one seems to meet, on a repetitive basis, the same half-dozen academics. I am not belittling them. In fact we are much indebted to them for their points of view. But it becomes a very different story when the Committee has contact with those who have been personally involved in an area covered by a particular term of reference, when the committee meets people on their home ground when they feel completely at ease and when they can communicate with the members of the Committee on their own terms. I assure honourable senators that it becomes an entirely different ball game. Again, if one reads the submissions before one has exposure to a topic and then reads those submissions after one has exposure to the topic, one sees the matters entirely differently. For example, the way in which we see Australian-ASEAN relations and the way in which the people living in the five ASEAN nations see them are quite different. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer the Senate to the statements made by Senator Sim and the late Senator Knight to the Senate that Australian ignorance of neighbouring states and peoples is considerably regrettable. Our ignorance is almost overwhelming and at some future time could react seriously against us. I should just like to refer to what Professor Kernial Sandhu said. He was of the opinion that Australia's standing in South East Asia was not as high as one might imagine. He felt that on a bilateral basis Australia could talk with equality. However ASEAN countries see themselves as an association, and when being dealt with as an association they feel that they have a greater power than Australia. He equated this with the situation of America and Europe being looked up to as greater powers than ASEAN. However, Australia, irrespective of her Anglo-Saxon attitudes, was not considered an equal to ASEAN. </PARA>
<PARA> I feel that the difference between each ASEAN nation and ASEAN as a group is something that is not appreciated by most Australians. It was quite clear to most of the members who travelled to the ASEAN nations that the Australian image was not as great as we imagined it to be. For example, there was little knowledge of Australian politics in South East Asia. An awareness of Australia was sadly lacking there. Professor Kernial Sandhu went so far as to say that if there was any great interest in Australian politics in South East Asia and if there were any Asians who had studied Australian politics in Australia, he would be prepared to employ them tomorrow. So there is a necessity for us to try to project our image a lot more than we do. Understanding is like friendship; it is a two-way process. We met many people who had an appalling lack of understanding of what our social and political set-up was. Some people still place us as part of the European or American scene. We were convinced more than ever of the necessity for Australia to project its image a lot more. In the report we suggested that films were one of the most effective ways of projecting the Australian image in South East Asia. </PARA>
<PARA> I will deal for a moment with our relationship with South East Asia, how we are understood and should be understood. I will quote from a speech that was given by the Australian Ambassador to the Philippines, Richard Woolcott. He was the man left holding the baby, so to speak, during the brutal annexation of East Timor by Indonesia. At the time when a caretaker government was in power here, he was placed in the most unenviable position of being left with that problem on his plate. At a lecture he said:</PARA>
<PARA>Where, then, does Australia fit into this regional picture at this time? Australia, as an isolated continent, of mainly European social origin at the southern end of the world, faced, until relatively recently, three choices in its search for an identity in the world. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, we could have tried to cling to the perception of Australia as a western outpost in South East Asia, in which case we would probably now be seen as a sort of Anglo-American step-child which never really grew up; a second-hand transplated society, in danger of losing its momentum before it decided what it really wanted to be. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, we could have sought to retreat into our own vast and relatively remote continent. We could have tried to turn our backs on the problems of our less fortunate and more populous neighbours. We could have attempted to isolate ourselves and sought to live a bucolic, inwards-looking, materialist, self-satisfied, apathetic and pleasure-seeking national life-like innocent nihilists drifting in a remote southern Squaresville of our own making. </PARA>
<PARA> Or, thirdly, we could work to become a distinctive, tolerant, co-operative, accepted and well regarded middle power, in the world community at large, but especially in the region in which we live, the Asian and Pacific region. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that we all like to think that we fall into the third category outlined by Mr Woolcott. But in order to fall into that third category, we have to live up to high moral principles which sometimes I wonder whether we are capable of doing. I believe that we try to live up to his image in many fields. However, in the field of aid I think that we fall somewhat short of the principles that Mr Woolcott pointed out. Senator Primmer, on 4 December, informed the Senate about our concern in regard to the lack of study into the social consequences of our aid projects. We did not have much time to take a close look at the projects in the Philippines but I remember one or two senators making a report on our aid projects there. They made a glowing report but I do not know how deeply they looked into the social impact of the projects. I certainly think that we should take a closer look at our aid programs there. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the social consequences of those schemes is something that, if possible, I would like to see the Committee take on board in its terms of reference. It should have a closer look at our aid programs. Senator Primmer gave one or two illustrations of aid being given to Indonesia through an agriculture research project near Bogor. There were one or two instances where we felt that the assistance which should be helping people was not doing what we had hoped. For example, we felt that the assistance given to the people in most need-the workers-fell rather short of the desired objective. The particular program that gave me most concern was that in Trengganu. The Trengganu hydro-electric project involves the building of a large dam, the creation of a lake in the rain forest area, eight saddle dams and a variety of other infrastructure including access roads. When we looked at this project I questioned the offices of the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation about the social impact of the project on the local fishing industry. They did not seem to have many answers to my questions. What I had on my mind at the time was what happened in Sardinia when the Russians built the Aswan dam. People who were making a living from the fishing industry in Sardinia were deprived of their living because of the deprivation of silt caused by the building of this large dam. Hundreds of kampongs around the area in Malaysia will be affected by the building of the Trengganu dam. </PARA>
<PARA> Because I was not satisfied with the answers from SMEC I started to make some investigations when I returned to Australia. The information that I looked up suggested that the Trengganu project was investigated and approved as a matter of urgency because the electric power produced was required for the national grid system by 1982. A series of feasibility studies were initiated in 1974 by the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation in association with the Malaysian Engineering Corporation. However Malaysia decided that it wanted the project started as soon as possible and, before a proper feasibility study was completed of the Trengganu area, it started to build the dam sites and everything else associated. I realise, of course, that we could get out of that situation by saying that the responsibility falls squarely on the shoulders of the Malaysian Government. After all it was its decision. But if we are interested in aid and the effectiveness of aid, we should also be concerned about the social impact of that aid. </PARA>
<PARA> A further report in 1978, four years after the project had started, was commissioned by the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation. It commissioned Environmental Planning Associates to look into the social impact. If honourable senators read its report, they will see that there is a lack of information on which to make a full and detailed assessment of the social impact on the fishing industry of that nation. I also had a look at the report that came from the Australian Development Assistance Bureau. In its most recent annual report it briefly discussed the problems of environmental issues and development projects. The report stated that there is a growing international concern that attention should be given to the environmental factors in the development of aid programs. I wonder just how many of our aid programs we have looked into thoroughly, especially with regard to their environmental impact. </PARA>
<PARA> Again I plead with honourable senators that we allow the Committee to look more closely at our aid projects. I am not in the least satisfied that we have studied this aspect through to a logical conclusion. I feel that projects are a waste of money if they do not benefit the people they are intended to benefit. I feel that in Malaysia thousands of people will be thrown out of work and lose their livings because of the fishing industry there. Therefore, I think we should look more closely at the environmental impact of all of our aid projects. Indeed, I would go as far as to suggest that the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation has a permanent environmental officer on its staff. This is something that the Corporation does not have at the moment. I feel quite strongly about that subject and believe that such an officer should be employed. I will close on that note. Once again I compliment Senator Sim on his chairmanship of the Committee. He will be missed when, later this year, he retires. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join the debate to speak briefly. I welcome the opportunity to speak in this general debate on foreign affairs. I join with other honourable senators in paying my respects to Senator Sim who has now made, as he described it, his last speech on this subject in this place, although I will believe that when I see it. We have all admired his sometimes independent approach to the subject of foreign affairs and his informed contribution to such debates even though sometimes we have differed mildly with his opinions. On 26 February, several contributions were made to this debate on foreign affairs papers on subjects which ranged in some cases around the world several times. Among these contributions was a speech by my colleague, Senator Wheeldon, and on the same day, incidentally, comments by Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle in her capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Senator Wheeldon at the end of his speech made the following statements which I quote from Hansard:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We have to face the fact that the era of detente is over. We have to face the fact that no longer does our major like-minded country, the United States of America, believe that it is possible to secure peace merely by netogiation; that it can be achieved only if the United States greatly increases its strength. This places greatly different burdens and greatly different requirements upon us, whatever one's opinion may be of some of the other views I have expressed during what I was just saying. Things are not what they were before the elections of last November; they are now quite different and Australia will have to find a way to accommodate itself and to influence the new course of events. </PARA>
<PARA>One cannot help but agree with Senator Wheeldon's last remarks even if many of us would disagree with some of the remarks made earlier in his speech about various regions in the world. Certainly we do have to reassess our position; we certainly have to realise that things are different. Although we cannot throw out the possibility of detente quite as freely as Senator Wheeldon did, we certainly have to accept that we have to accommodate ourselves to a new set of circumstances. The problem that I have found, and the problem I think Senator Mason found when he was speaking in the debate, is that the Government has learned nothing. The Government has not adapted itself to the new set of circumstances of the post-Vietnam era. In fact, the Government retains its policy of agreeing with everything that the United States does and says be it in respect of Central America or Asia. I believe that this can be demonstrated by the Government's approval of the United States increasing its military aid to El Salvador and decreasing or ceasing much of its aid to countries like Nicaragua because it believes that most of the arms going to El Salvador in fact come from or through Nicaragua. </PARA>
<PARA> Like Senator Mason and other honourable senators in this place, I think that this is a dangerous attitude for the United States. It is even more dangerous, I believe, for countries like Australia just to accept that attitude and not try to influence. It seems to me that the Government's view is that we must unquestionably accept the views of the world, of President Reagan and of General Haig and therefore unquestionably accept the United States approach to El Salvador, to Central American countries in general and, more recently, to South American countries. We must accept that attitude of the United States that claims that it will support any country which proclaims itself anti-communist no matter how repressive or what sort of dictatorship governs there. The simple fact that these countries call themselves anti-communist or the United States has a suspicion that Cuba or any other communist country is supporting a revolution in such a place is enough reason for the United States and countries like Australia to interfere. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me unfortunate that people on both sides of politics in this country and indeed, in other countries, take such a selective view on foreign affairs and particularly on human rights around the world. The implication seems to be that depending on one's view there is a difference between torture in a right wing country or torture in a left wing country and that invasion of sovereignty of a country of the same political persuasion is not all right but that the invasion of sovereignty of a country of the opposite political persuasion is okay. Guns in the streets of San Salvador or Tehran are worse than guns in the streets of Prague or Warsaw. I do not think there is a need, or is it desirable, for countries like Australia to take sides because as a small country we should condemn, in my opinion, the destruction and diminution of human rights wherever they occur. As a country we should protest when our alleged ally, Malaysia, gaols two members of parliament, members of the Democratic Action Party, a democratic party and member of the Socialist International. They were gaoled without trial and kept in gaol by a Minister. We should not remain silent, as I believe this Government has remained silent, when that sort of thing occurs in our region. We should not remain silent or passive as we have at first the threatened hanging and then the gaoling of people such as Kim Dai Jung any more than we should remain silent at the treatment of dissidents in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics or at the treatment of political prisoners in any communist country in the world. While I share the view that those who support democracy should support each other, that does not mean, I believe, that they should support regimes which abuse human rights, indulge in torture of citizens or act to deprive people of socialist rights through repression or even inequality because they follow a blind opposition to communism. Nor should we remain silent in the face of the abuse of human rights in any country, for similar reasons. To do so, to support governments and groups for such reasons, has the effect of driving those fighting repression into the camps supported by other totalitarian regimes. I have heard Senator Wheeldon argue persuasively in this place that the United States attitude was a factor in driving Castro's Cuba firmly into the communist camp. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It does little good to ignore French intervention in other areas. We certainly should not, and do not, ignore intervention by the USSR in both Europe and Asia in that sort of situation. I believe the problem is further complicated by the fact that national pride and national feeling are potent forces in most of the countries that are involved in the sorts of internal conflicts which led to the situation in El Salvador. Those who believe it is their duty to fight repression, murder, torture and social inequality in their country-who would deny that it is their duty to do so-are nationalistic as a rule and have no desire to see that internal repression replaced by external repression. To introduce a foreigner to interfere in the affairs of the country, be he from the United States, the Soviet Union or anywhere else, frequently causes a coalition of disparate groups interested in self-determination and in proudly developing their nation. That, I believe, leads us to the problem that is present in El Salvador, a country in which I have a personal interest because of my friendship with people from neighbouring Nicaragua who recently were involved in a similar struggle.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> El Salvador is a tiny and poor country with a population of about five million. It is the most densely populated country in Latin America. It is a country beset by poverty, by lack of services, by incredible differences between rich and poor and by inequitable land distribution. Fifty per cent of the arable land is owned by 300 families and power has been basically in the hands of 14 or 20 families for some 50 years through military dictatorships. If we add to that presence for many years, and still, of a government controlled, quasi-military force-the ORDEN-which was described aptly in newspapers in Australia recently as a series of goon squads, which started in the days of the infamous President Umberto Romero and which has been repressing people throughout the countryside out of control for many years, there are in that country all the prerequisites of a revolution. Since the 1930s all so-called leftist parties have been labelled communist. Ruthless activities have been used to suppress those alleged communists. Well documented stories of mass murder, of torture and of repression in the community have emerged and have been unquestioned in the Western Press and by those who have made a study of the area. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly in 1979 President Umberto Romero was overthrown by another military dictatorship and President Jose Duarte, who was a christian democrat politician, as Senator Wheeldon has said, was brought back and installed. But he is utterly dependent on and constantly under the threat of the military which in fact runs the dictatorship in that country. The activities of the ORDEN continue, and torture, murder and repression have been commonplace. Unemployment remains at 50 per cent and the situation is and obviously has been desperate. President Reagan's response to this is to increase military aid, to send in military advisers and, if necessary, to send in American troops in a show of strength because of the alleged Cuban supply of arms-I do not doubt that the Cubans have been assisting in the supply of arms in this area-and because of the assistance and support allegedly given by other communist nations. I think it is worth while pointing out that not only nations from the Soviet bloc have supported the efforts of guerrillas and others in El Salvador to overthrow the Government and to improve conditions in that country. Many European countries, including West Germany, Sweden and others which are considered friendly to this nation, have given support to their brothers and sisters in a movement in El Salvador because one of the parties involved in that movement is a compatriot party in Socialist International. </PARA>
<PARA> No one denies the presence of Cuban-supplied arms in El Salvador. But from looking during the last few years and the last few weeks at documents and publications from right across the political spectrum and from looking at overseas newspapers, I can find no suggestion at all, as was suggested two weeks ago in this place, of the presence of Cuban forces in El Salvador. But there is ample evidence that both United States arms and advisers are in the country supporting the regime. We hear a lot about what is said by various people closely involved in the situation in El Salvador. I think it is worth while examining some of those things. I wish to quote the words of Professor Jeanne Kirkpatrick, President Reagan's Ambassador to the United Nations. She summed up the dilemma which faces those who would want to support the United States action unquestioningly when she said:</PARA>
<PARA>If we are confronted with the choice between offering assistance to a moderately repressive autocratic government which is also friendly to the United States and permitting them to be overrun by a Cuban-trained, Cuban-armed, Cuban-sponsored insurgency, we would assist the moderate autocracy. </PARA>
<PARA>As Senator Mason said, that is the sort of thing that was said to justify the intervention in Vietnam. The implications of this are clear: Any repressive dictatorship such as that recently of President Somoza in Nicaragua-he was President for 37 or 40 years-will be supported by the United States if its opponents are supported by the Cubans. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At least President Carter had the right policy there.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9V4">Senator GRIMES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Carter certainly had more concern for human rights and, therefore, took a different policy. But other people close to the scene and equally concerned had different things to say. Archbishop Romero, who was murdered in his church for condemning the junta-inspired murders, said just before his death in February last year:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>Instead of promoting greater injustice and peace in El Salvador (military aid) will no doubt sharpen the injustice and repression against the organisations of the people who repeatedly have been struggling to gain respect for their most fundamental human rights. The present junta have resorted to repressive violence, producing a total of death and injuries much greater than in the recent military regime. </PARA>
<PARA>His successor, Archbishop Rivera y Damas, said on 7 September last year:</PARA>
<PARA>Five thousand five hundred people have been murdered since 1 June-80 per cent by the army and national security forces and the remainder by parliamentary death squads with army protection. Twenty-seven thousand families have been evacuated, ten priests have been murdered and churches have been sacked and desecrated. The repression we are now suffering is worse than the sadism and bloody cruelty in the days of President Romero. </PARA>
<PARA>Robert White, former United States Ambassador to El Salvador who was sacked because of his views, was described in scathing terms by members of President Reagan's group as a social reformer, which apparently has become a pejorative term in the United States today. He has been an outspoken critic of the United States policy of propping up the junta. He has said that such policies are wrong and will drive those people desperately trying to hold a position of social, economic and political reform through democracy and persuasion, to the far Left because of the hopelessness of the situation. On his return to the United States the former ambassador has repeatedly said, from direct knowledge of the place, that the real threat in his view is from the extreme Right. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> There is no demonstrable need for putting United States military advisers into El Salvador. It would put El Salvador in the position of being a vassal State. </PARA>
<PARA> The issue is not military aid. The issue is how you are going to supply military aid to a military force that is killing and assassinating thousands and thousands of people down there. </PARA>
<PARA>Many other organisations in the world have repeatedly warned of the dangers of a new Vietnam situation arising if the United States does not stop supporting repressive, unpopular and totalitarian regimes because they happen to say that they are anti-communist. It is hopeful that Willy Brandt, the President of Socialist International, an organisation which has persistently called for talks and a reasonable and sensible solution to the problems in El Salvador, is at last being called in to assist in trying to end this difficult and dangerous situation. He has said, Amnesty International, the church and people with knowledge in the area have said that if the United States continues to support every repressive, dictatorial, murdering and torturing regime in Central America, it will lose all the respect of those seeking to assist the abused, the starving and the downtrodden people of this benighted part of the world. If such aid, with our support, goes automatically to those who say they support the United States while standing literally on the bodies of their countrymen they will receive no respect. We cannot intervene directly. We cannot, as an individual nation, have much of an effect on this situation. But we may be able to, I believe, in combination with others, by taking a consistent attitude to the abuse of human rights and the abuse of human freedoms everywhere, be it in communist countries or in non-communist countries. We may be able to play some part, as I hope Willy Brandt can play some part, in reaching some sane and sensible solution to the sorts of problems which occur in El Salvador. </PARA>
<PARA> What is certain is that if we follow blindly the policies which are being pursued now we put ourselves in the position of being an inconsequential nation, blind followers of our masters as are the satellites of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics for that matter. This path, I suggest, has a great danger of leading inevitably to another Vietnam situation which no one wants to see again. Therefore I suggest and hope that we will not persist with the foreign policy in this area that I fear the present Government will persist with if we can judge from the statements of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), Mr Street and the statements relayed by Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> I hope that we do take an independent stance as a freedom loving nation, of condemning the abuse of civil rights and freedom wherever it may occur. I am pleased that, unlike the situation which existed in the days of Vietnam, the editorials in the newspapers in this country-in the Canberra Times, the Age, and the Sydney Morning Herald which are respected newspapers-have questioned and in many cases condemned the sort of stance we are taking. The Government is seen internationally in this situation as speaking for all of us in the Parliament from all sides of the political spectrum in this country. I believe the Government should take a closer look at, analyse and be more careful about the attitude it has taken to the situation than it has up until now. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to participate in the debate this evening on this series of reports on science and the environment and in particular, to relate the remarks that I will make to the annual report of the Department of Science and the Environment and the annual report of the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. The subject that I wish to put before the Senate this evening is one which, I think, has not been considered by the Senate before; that is, the question of the administration and regulation of genetic engineering in Australia at the moment and the proper role of the Commonwealth Government in the control and regulation of what is, in fact, likely to develop as one of the great growth industries in the whole world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is not just that we are dealing with matters which are themselves purely commercial or, indeed, purely scientific, because the first point to make, I think, is that in essence these debates are ethical debates. We are, for instance, dealing with questions such as the legal and moral aspects of test tube babies. We are dealing with the legal and moral aspects of genetic manipulation and the possible creation of new forms of life. Mr Justice Gordon Samuel of the New South Wales Supreme Court several months ago drew attention to this problem when, in writing in the journal called Quarterly, published by the University of New South Wales, he indicated that he saw a need for comprehensive legislation on the question of the legal and moral aspects of test tube babies. Consideration should be given to the enormous questions, for instance, of their exact legal parentage, their inheritance rights, the relationship between them and their natural parents and between them and what one might call their surrogate parents. To that extent this debate is a serious ethical debate and undoubtedly the Commonwealth, which has made great steps in a number of these fields-for instance, in its legislation about removing the stigma attached to illegitimate children-will have to face up to its legislative responsibilities in these issues. At the moment treatment of disease, and treatment of cancer in particular, is one of the things at the forefront of medical research. </PARA>
<PARA> In a number of areas it is believed that the recent discoveries in genetic engineering may bring about some hope for people suffering from currently terminal medical diseases. But, at the same time, we are now in a situation of seeing, for instance, in the United States that experiments are taking place using new genetic discoveries on human patients without regard to the normal standards which are required in these matters. For instance, in the very learned journal Science on 24 October 1980 it was indicated that two patients suffering from the disease thalassemia had been treated with a new genetic discovery by researchers at the University of California in Los Angeles without the endorsement of the University's Human Subjects Use Committee. In other words, a medical discovery, potentially life-saving for diseases such as sickle-cell anaemia, already is being used on patients without regard to the established patterns of proper use of new discoveries and drugs on human subjects. It has often been speculated how quickly we will move towards a Brave New World situation. I was intrigued, if not disturbed, to read a report last December in the Sydney Morning Herald, and I will quote to the Senate part of that report:</PARA>
<PARA> A Shanghai newspaper claimed this week that a chimpanzee, artificially inseminated by scientists with human sperm, was three months pregnant when the Cultural Revolution put a stop to the experiment in 1967. </PARA>
<PARA>Discussing the experiment, the report referred to the comments of Dr Ji, the head of the scientific unit:</PARA>
<PARA> Dr Ji said a 'near-human ape' would be able to serve mankind. It would have a higher intelligence and therefore could perform simple tasks. It could also be taught to speak. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know whether there are any grounds for believing scientific reports from Shanghai, but certainly the reputation of the Chinese Academy of Sciences is one not to be discounted. However, if we are to believe that experiments of that sort are under way, we would want to be sure that in Australia the work that is being done is being done within what we would regard as ethical guidelines. I shall speak later about the work being done at the John Curtin School of Medical Research at the Australian National Uiversity into the breeding of certain animals and the development of animals by the manipulation of their genetic qualities and characters. It may be that the report about genetic engineering in China does not need to be taken too seriously by this Parliament, but it raises questions in view of the fact that these things are now theoretically within the technical competence of medical researchers in the field of genetic engineering. The fact that frogs and lesser animals have already been bred in this sense and that the techniques available are themselves not different in kind, although they are in degree, from those being used in experiments touching on human beings, needs to be of concern to this Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The second question that arises, although at this stage it may not seem immediately related, is the question of Australian patent law and the impact it will have on the medical profession and on genetic engineering in general. This issue arises because we are talking about procedures, we are talking about experiments, we are talking about processes which may yield hundreds of millions of dollars to somebody holding a patent over them. The Hoffman-La Roche patent rip-off on valium looks like kids' play in comparison with what might be the situation not just with tranquillisers but with life-saving drugs. This matter came to a head in the United States with the work of an Indian scientist by the name of Chakrabarty, who was working on the development of a microbe called pseudomonas which would be used to eat oil spills, in effect. Essentially, a bacteria which consumes hydrocarbons on the surface of the water would be released into an area polluted by oil, apparently doing no harm to the sea environment but capable of eating the oil spill. </PARA>
<PARA> Needless to say, it was believed that there was a potentially very significant commercial benefit to be gained from all this, and an attempt was made to patent the discovery and the life-form pseudomonas. The magazine Science, reporting this in April 1980, was very concerned that the matter should be settled finally in the United States courts. Since 1793 the United States has had a fairly complicated but also fairly open-ended scheme of patent legislation. The appeal went backwards and forwards between the lower courts and the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals and the Patent Office in the United States. The Court of Customs and Patent Appeals batted both cases back to the Patent Office, with the ruling that the claims for the patent should be allowed. It indicated that it could not be the intent of existing patent law to deny patentability to something just because it is alive. Indeed, the court said:</PARA>
<PARA> We do not see any reason to deprive it or its creator or owner of the protection and advantages of the patent system by excluding it from the (statute's) categories of patentable inventions on the sole ground that it is alive. It is because it is alive that it is useful. </PARA>
<PARA>The court went on:</PARA>
<PARA> In short, we think the fact that microorganisms, as distinguished from chemical compounds, are alive, is a distinction without legal significance. </PARA>
<PARA>The matter was eventually tested in the Supreme Court of the United States. In a five to four decision, the court ruled in June 1980 that life forms could be subject to patent. Chief Justice Burger said:</PARA>
<PARA> We are told that genetic research and related technological developments may spread pollution and disease, and may result in a loss of genetic diversity, and that its practise may tend to deprecate the value of human life. </PARA>
<PARA> These arguments are forcefully, even powerfully presented; they remind us that at times human ingenuity seems unable to control fully the forces it creates. </PARA>
<PARA> The grant or denial of patent on microorganisms is not likely to put an end to genetic research or its attendant risks. </PARA>
<PARA>Two points arise from that United States decision. The first is that because of our entry into international co-operative patent arrangements there will be some patents granted in the United States which will have applicability in Australia. In the other place on 19 February 1980 Dr Klugman put a question on notice to Mr Newman, who at that stage was responsible for productivity, in which he asked, among other things:</PARA>
<PARA> Does Australian patent legislation allow for living organisms to be patented?</PARA>
<PARA>At page 985 of the House of Representatives Hansard of 19 March 1980 Mr Newman replied:</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian patent legislation does not specifically exclude inventions concerned with living organisms from patent protection. The criteria for accepting an application relating to a living organism is therefore the same as for any other invention. </PARA>
<PARA>It is quite clear that Australian patent legislation allows the patentability of life forms and the discoveries which may be made by Australian genetic engineers. I think this Parliament needs to ask itself whether that is the accidental consequence of the legislation or whether it was the intention of the Australian legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am wondering why we need the plant rights legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TI4">Senator PUPLICK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Georges raises a most interesting point. Given the operation of Australian patent laws, why has the debate about plant variety rights reached the levels it has? It seems to me that patentability of living organisms is exactly the same as patentability of living crops in that sense, and the debate about plant variety rights may already be a debate settled in Australian law. Those who are getting worked up about the plant variety rights debate may well find that they have to go back a little further to do their homework. The important thing about genetic engineering in this sense is the sheer size to which it can grow in financial terms. The genetic engineering companies that have gone public are the highest fliers on Wall Street. They are the boom stocks, in the way that Kodak and Polaroid and Xerox were the boom stocks, in the way that IBM was a boom stock for many years in terms of its internal shares. It is quite clear that small companies have been making enormous profits from this development.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For instance, early in 1980 Inco Ltd, which is a fairly small company in the genetic development field, sold its stake in Genentech Inc., for $5.2m. The value of that package of shares would now be well in excess of $15m. Let us look at the sorts of things which are under investigation. Brazil, for instance, has been using genetic engineering techniques to develop alcohol as a fuel. The Cetus Corporation, a major research corporation, has been doing research on yeasts and other substances. Genetically engineered yeast could improve fermentation. As I will mention later, there is even a proposal to develop interferon, which was described in the latest issue of Newsweek. The article referred to the development of micro-organisms to combat malaria and hoof and mouth disease, as it is called in the United States. One of the companies involved is the Monsanto Chemical Company. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA> A Monsanto spokesman says the company plans to ''develop and evaluate'' the use of bacteria to synthesise chemicals that now require expensive, energy-intensive processes. And Inco has a direct stake in research that Cawthorn describes as ''bordering on science fiction''-the use of bacteria in mining. </PARA>
<PARA>Within the genetic engineering field a process is developing for the use of bacteria in mining. In fact, bacteria would be released into soils, mines and various places that bear minerals. We would allow the bacteria to extract the mineral or the substance concerned out of the ground. The prospect of releasing large amounts of bacteria for the purpose of commercial mining again is a matter which currently appears to be totally unregulated by any legislation in Australia. Enormous financial possibilities are at stake. The development of synthetic insulin will bring about a change in a market which is currently worth more than $100m a year. That is the size of the insulin market. It is currently in a state of total confusion because of the breakup of the existing insulin sales arrangements by people who are starting to market commercially produced insulin-produced by technical processes-instead of by processes which are currently cumbersome and expensive and which rely in the first instance upon the production of certain animal materials for the insulin to be extracted. I have said that a number of companies are now involved in the genetic engineering field which are already public companies. I will cite just a few of these companies. Genentech Inc., which was founded in 1976, is probably the leader in the field. It is seeking to make commercial quantities of interferon which is alleged to be the wonder drug for the defeat of cancer. The Cetus Corporation was founded only a decade or so ago. There is also Biogen SA of Geneva. The Genex Corporation started in 1977. The battles are going on between the companies for the services of leading scientists around the world. They are now not merely scientists; they are Nobel prize winners, and they are becoming instant millionaires because of their discoveries in the field of genetic engineering. The patents that accrue to them are reshaping the way in which scientific work is being done around the world. The Australian Financial Review of 15 April 1980 carried a report stating:</PARA>
<PARA> The British Government has been urged in a report from its scientific advisers to treat biotechnology-including genetic engineering-as seriously as it treats micro-electronics. </PARA>
<PARA>I raised this matter by way of a question in the Senate on 21 April 1980. I asked the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Thomson) for some information about the extent to which Australia is supporting research in biotechnology. I received a lengthy letter dated 20 June 1980 from Mr Thomson in response to that question. I seek leave to have that letter incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The letter read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Minister for Science and the Environment Parliament House, Canberra, ACT 2600 10 June 1980 Dear Senator Puplick,</PARA>
<PARA> In his response to your question concerning biotechnology, which you asked in the Senate on 21 April 1980, Senator Chaney advised that he would arrange for additional information to be provided. This letter is intended to fulfil his undertaking. </PARA>
<PARA> The article on biotechnology in the Financial Review of 15 April 1980 dwelt on the recommendations of a particular Report prepared in the United Kingdom. My Department has not yet obtained a copy of the Report and thus the following information should be viewed in that context. </PARA>
<PARA> From the article it would appear that the U.K. Report focussed on that part of biotechnology which is, or will be, dependent upon genetic engineering or more precisely on what is becoming known as recombinant DNA technology. This involves adding to or changing the genetic make-up of an organism such that it performs a new or improved task of value to man. </PARA>
<PARA> As an example, research is at an advanced stage in attempting to persuade a bacterium to produce human insulin. Once successful it will be possible for this bacterium to be produced in large batches and the insulin separated out. Thus, a ready supply, on whatever scale, will become available and dependence on the far less satisfactory and relatively rare animal insulins will be unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1978 the Executive of the CSIRO commissioned an investigation into the role of the recombinant DNA technique in research. The Report, released in July 1979, concluded that the application of the technique was already of immense value as a research tool and within the near future would be likely to produce commercially viable opportunities in applied microbiology. Other applications were also likely but the time scale was considerably longer. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted that to our knowledge no research group has produced commercially viable amounts of products by this technique. At the same time the CSIRO study clearly indicated that the potential range of application was broad and that Australia should be able to develop expertise and technology in particular areas and thus obtain world markets. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of Commonwealth departments and agencies have been monitoring the progress of research involving the recombinant DNA technique for several years. The Departments of Science and the Environment, of Health and the CSIRO have been prominent in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition the Australian Academy of Science has been most active in this area. It has not only operated a peer group monitoring system but it has taken a lead role in the evaluation of the potential of this technology. It has received the Government's support in performing this role. </PARA>
<PARA> The Academy is currently undertaking a comprehensive review of this subject area with a view to formulating recommendations on the safe exploitation of new opportunities in genetic engineering. This study has been underway for some months and I am advised that the Report will be available to the Government shortly. </PARA>
<PARA> Upon receipt of this Report it is the intention of the Government that a policy covering the safe exploitation of this technology will be promptly developed. </PARA>
<PARA> Neither the Financial Review article nor your question was limited to recombinant DNA technology. Thus, it is appropriate to make some comment about biotechnology in general. As you will appreciate, biotechnology encompasses an extremely broad range of processes. All industrial processes involving living organisms or their active products fall within the definition of biotechnology. </PARA>
<PARA> In this broader context the CSIRO has been active in biotechnology for many years. Some of its current programs include the production of fuel ethanol from sugar beet, the conversion of agricultural waste into gaseous and liquid fuels and the use of micro-organisms to enhance oil recovery from oil wells and oil shale. </PARA>
<PARA> I am advised that the Department of Productivity is materially assisting a number of biotechnology programs as part of its more general industry assistance activities. In particular two projects have received public interest funding under the Industrial Research and Development Incentives Act, namely the commercial development of both the 'bionic' ear (University of Melbourne) and enzyme laballed immuno assay systems (Royal Prince Charles Hospital, Brisbane). </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, therefore, the Government is aware of the recent research advances involving the recombinant DNA technique and, in co-operation with various experts, has been monitoring advances and is proceeding towards the development of necessary policies for the safe exploitation of these advances.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have said that this development appears at the moment-if one had purely taken note of the companies I have mentioned-to be very much one that does not concern Australia. Yet the truth of the matter is that Australian scientists are at the forefront of research in genetic engineering. Regrettably, as with so many of our major scientific advances, they are not receiving the support from governments and from institutions which one would have thought they ought to be given. For instance, a report of the Sydney Morning Herald a few months ago stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A young Australian scientist is emerging as a leading researcher in a biological revolution that is expected to have far-reaching medical, industrial and social consequences. </PARA>
<PARA> Dr John Shine, of the Australian National University, has, with a team of American scientists, succeeded in genetically engineering bacteria to ''manufacture'' a promising therapeutic drug. </PARA>
<PARA> It is beta-endorphin, which researchers believe could prove valuable in the treatment of pain, some illnesses, high blood pressure and diarrhoea. </PARA>
<PARA>One reads in the Weekend Australian magazine in January 1980 of the work of a young scientist, Dr Jim McInnes, and a Dr Ray Harris of the South Australian Institute of Technology. They are involved in research on interferon which, as I said, is currently supposed to be the world's great new wonder drug. It is enormously expensive just to produce a few grams. These doctors say that in the work they are doing in the United States they are on the verge of producing interferon 'by the bucketful'. It will cost thousands of dollars compared with millions of dollars spent in the United States. Yet Dr Harris and Dr McInnes find that, typical among these situations, their work is in jeopardy because of the lack of government support for medical research. </PARA>
<PARA> What will happen? Australian cancer patients will be required to pay enormous sums for access to interferon treatment because the patents for the drugs are held in the United States when in Adelaide people are at work producing the substance in large quantities and at low cost. It is possible that they could get the patent for their process under Australian legislation but they cannot complete the work because there is not a few extra hundred thousand dollars allocated for medical research. One sees in the United States the major work being done at the University of California on genetic engineering. The team there is led by an Australian scientist, Dr John Baxter. Undoubtedly, he is working there because the contribution that he has to make is appreciated far more in the United States than in Australia. The National Times in its weekly issue for 27 July to 2 August 1980 led with the heading: 'Genetic engineering; Australia misses out'. Unless we are very careful about the role of the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories, the role of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and the role of the Department of Science and Technology in Australia we will deprive ourselves as a people and as a nation of enormous benefits not only as individual human beings but also in terms of patents and medical cost savings. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bulletin on 3 March 1981 carried an article entitled 'Australia's biotechnology bid' in which Dr John Hurrell and his colleagues at the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories in Melbourne state that they believe they were making great strides towards the development of a technique to detect early warning pains and symptoms in people who are on the verge of a heart attack. That is a point that ought to be fresh in the memories of many honourable senators. Heart attacks do not occur just among our colleagues. They are the greatest single cause of death in Australia. A group at the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories says that it is on the verge of making some breakthrough in the process of recognising the danger signs at an early stage. Dr Hurrell said:</PARA>
<PARA> The need to get our foot in the biotechnology door is becoming more urgent. </PARA>
<PARA> The head of the Department of Immunology of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute, Dr Graham Mitchell, explained the concern which he and his colleagues have about the lack of funds which is preventing scientists of great quality in Australia from taking the next step, which is important. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will recall that last year, I think it was, we passed amendments to the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Act. We agreed that the previous restriction on the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories in undertaking research-it had previously been limited I think to non-biological areas-should be opened up and that the Laboratories should be allowed to get into new fields. We said that that would be done by regulation. Statutory Rule No. 7 of 1981, Commonwealth Serum Laboratories regulations, describes the sorts of things that the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories in terms of classes of pharmaceutical products are allowed to get into. They now include: Agents derived from blood and tissue and synthetic analogues of such agents, agents derived from micro-organisms and synthetic analogues of such agents, agents for parentathal therapy into toxic agents, immunological agents, and laboratory agents and devices. So, we have within the very considerable resources of our own Commonwealth Serum Laboratories the facility to go ahead and do some of this work. </PARA>
<PARA> Again I refer to an article in the National Times. It was headed: 'Australia ready to test Interferon as cancer cure'. Again it refers to the work of the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories in Melbourne and the plan to begin the first Australian clinical trials of interferon in the course of the next couple of months. Dr McCarthy, the director of CSL, also stated that, in the longer term, CSL plans to study interferon as a treatment for multiple sclerosis in conjunction with other conventional methods. Other studies of multiple sclerosis had recently begun in the United States. </PARA>
<PARA> We are miles along some of these tracks. I refer to some of the work being done with animals at the Australian National University. Immunology researchers in the John Curtin School of Medical Research at the ANU recently announced that they had produced the world's first mixed species twin cattle consisting of a European species, Bos Taurus, Fresian calf and a Brahmin calf of the completely separate Indian cattle species, Bos Indicus. The unique animal specimens were produced by the transplant of a Fresian embryo into the uterus of a Brahmin cow who carried the foreign offspring together with a normal foetus of her own. This facility for what is called tetraparentalism-that is to say, an animal with four parents-is, again, on the frontier of international research. Again, it is languishing in Australia because we are simply not paying attention to these Australian scientists whose work is on the international frontier and who are entitled to look to the Australian Government for financial and other support to help them push those frontiers forward a little more. </PARA>
<PARA> The final points that I wish to make relate to the question of the regulation of all of this work and the concerns that are being expressed about genetic engineering and what we are to do about genetic engineering. An article published some time ago in Fortune magazine gave me some cause to stop and think. It was entitled: 'The Cloning Era' and was written by Gene Bylinsky. The important thing that I learned from that article was that this work at a plant level has been going on successfully now for two decades. In fact, in 1960 the Cornell biologist, Frederick C. Steward, had started to grow plants-in this case it was a carrot which he grew from a single cell of a pre-existing plant. That was 20 years ago. Work on animals started in the 1950s and, in the early 1960s, clones-in this case, only of fairly lowly clawed frogs-were actually produced by him. I am talking of the early 1960s. In 1975, scientists came very close to producing cloned animals in rabbits, grown from single cells. So, it cannot be said by anybody that the technique is suddenly new, that we have not had an exposure to it, or that we have not had time to take in its consequences. </PARA>
<PARA> Individual genes have already been synthesised. The first work in this area was reported in 1970 by a team headed by Dr Khorana of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Again, that was 10 years ago. On reading in a scientific journal entitled Across the Board an article headed 'Should scientists play God', I was staggered to find a cartoon by the famous cartoonist Dan Barry who drew the Flash Gordon cartoon series of the early 1950s, in which cartoon interferon was identified as a drug. In fact in this case it was going to be used, I think, to cure a traveller suffering from deep space plague. I repeat: That was in the early 1950s. Interferon, which Time and Newsweek are now carrying as their front cover series of the great wonder drug of the 1980s, almost 30 years ago was being talked about in some of the literature and picked up in the esoteric literature as having some potential value in medical research. </PARA>
<PARA> The United States National Research Council in terms of talking about elaborate equipment, that is to say, what is called recombinant DNA engineering stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The magnitude of the breakthrough provided by recombinant DNA is hard to estimate. </PARA>
<PARA>It in fact changes the very nature of the thinking that we ought to be bringing to the question of medical research and to the question of the cure of diseases like cancer and the production of useful bacteria for industry and for commerce. The question is to a large extent: Is anybody in the Australian Government giving the slightest bit of attention to regulations or to procedures which ought to be followed as far as the control, let alone the support, of this sort of research is concerned?</PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will recall that many years ago a mild panic ensued in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The city fathers at Cambridge, Massachusetts, passed some municipal regulation or ordinance, the aim of which was to prevent genetic engineering being undertaken at the nearby Harvard University. Scientists in the United States started to become very panicky about this situation. In 1971, the scientists, Robert Pollack and Paul Berg, suddenly became very jittery about the whole matter. They called a conference in 1973 known as the Gordon conference, which recommended to the American scientific establishment that there be no further work done on genetic engineering. In 1975 the so-called Asilomar conference was held in California. Scientists from all over the world came to it, including Australian scientists, and agreed to what in fact was a scientific moratorium on work on genetic engineering, much the same as Einstein and Fermi had at a later stage urged scientists of the world after the Second World War to get together to put a moratorium on further development in nuclear engineering. In 1975, this was taken to be the correct way in which to go about things. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, some people fought very publicly against it, James Watson, the famous Nobel Prize winner, being one of them. In Australia, that action has led to the establishment of a committee at the University of Melbourne of which Professor Max Charlesworth was the chairman and which produced a report on genetic engineering. It came to similar conclusions. In its report, the committee recommended:</PARA>
<PARA> The Open Inquiry has concluded that the benefits promised from recombinant DNA research are not so clearly advantageous to society that the immediate prosecution of the work is essential. Its potential impact has not yet received sufficient attention. We therefore believe that: there should be a further halt on all work in the field of the recombinant DNA research to permit the evaluation of the potential impact. </PARA>
<PARA>That is somewhat of a Luddite view, I believe, and has been seen to be so since that date. In fact, since that date the pendulum has gone in entirely the other direction. James Watson, of the famous Watson and Crick double-helix Nobel prizewinning team, is reported in the bulletin of the atomic scientists as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> I believe we should quickly and resolutely abandon any form of recombinant DNA regulation. </PARA>
<PARA>The United States has recently reported that approximately 85 per cent of the experiments now covered by the National Institute of Health guidelines on recombinant DNA research would be exempted from most of the rules under a proposal recently approved, by a vote of 10 to 4, by the recombinant DNA Advisory Committee. The same has happened in the United Kingdom. The interesting thing about what happened in the United Kingdom is that it happened after the report of a select committee of the British House of Commons. This matter was looked at by a select committee on science and technology of the House of Commons. It gathered the debate together, it investigated the matter and it made recommendations. Its recommendations were, by and large, to ease the restrictions that had occurred in the United Kingdom. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I turn to what Australia has done about this matter. The Academy of Science has been most active in this field. In its symposium in 1979 entitled 'Scientific Advances and Community Risk', a significant paper was presented by Professor G. L. Ada of the Australian National University entitled 'Genetic Engineering Research: Evaluation and Containment of Potential Risks' in which he laid down some of the issues for significant debate. That went on to be built up into a report, under the chairmanship of Professor Fenner, which was issued in 1980. Recommendation No. 1 reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The federal government should establish a Surveillance Committee to supervise all work with recombinant DNA in Australia. This Committee should have a Scientific Subcommittee. </PARA>
<PARA>I do not know how many honourable senators have noted that the Government in fact has announced it intends to do that. An article in the Sydney Morning Herald of 26 July 1980 states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government is to set up a committee to supervise genetic engineering research and its industrial uses. </PARA>
<PARA>I wrote to the Minister for Science and the Environment, Mr Thomson, and suggested that if in fact there was going to be a committee to supervise genetic engineering research and its industrial uses it should have on it representatives of the Commonwealth Parliament. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard a letter from the Minister for Science and the Environment to me, dated 23 October 1980, in which the Minister makes some response, essentially saying why at this stage he does not believe it appropriate for members of parliament to be appointed to committees of this sort. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The letter read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>MINISTER FOR SCIENCE &amp; THE ENVIRONMENT</PARA>
<PARA>Parliament House, Canberra, ACT 2600</PARA>
<PARA>23 October 1980</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Chris,</PARA>
<PARA> Thank you for your letter of 28 July 1980 in which you sought more information on, and made some suggestions, about, the composition of the new committee which is to monitor recombinant DNA research and development in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I am conscious of the need to balance any conjectured hazards against the potential value of the technique's applications. As you will realise, this will require highly technical assessments of the available data on the technique and wide consultation concerning the actual terms of any guidelines. I see this being an on-going interactive process. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that it is highly desirable to establish the committee as soon as possible. To achieve the minimum delay, the structure adopted for the new committee draws heavily on past experience and follows closely that recommended by the Australian Academy of Science's report. The committee itself will in the main examine issues related to primary and secondary industrial research and application of R-DNA techniques. A scientific sub-committee will monitor basic research in a similar manner to that conducted to date by the Academy of Science's Committee on Recombinant DNA molecules. </PARA>
<PARA> I am attracted to your suggestion of having one or two members of Parliament serve on the committee. My attention has been drawn to a number of monitoring committee models in use overseas and I have noted that some involve general community and parliamentary representatives. However, as I am sure you will agree, your proposal constitutes a major policy option which has implications beyond this subject. It would fall outside the arrangements already agreed to by the Government and would need to be brought before Cabinet. I am reluctant to do so now because it would mean a delay in appointing the committee. </PARA>
<PARA> When I again bring this matter before the Government I intend to canvass a number of more general policy questions. For example, I expect to raise the possibility of creating programs for actively encouraging the commercial application of recombinant DNA techniques. It is not possible, however, to obtain Government decisions on such matters at present. As you know significant proposals must be the subject of extensive consultations and perhaps negotiation among Ministers and their departments before submissions can come to Cabinet for decision. </PARA>
<PARA> In summary, therefore, let me indicate sympathy with your suggestion, advise you that it will be seriously considered but that the arrangements which have been already agreed to by the Government do not readily allow for such an initiative at this time. </PARA>
<PARA> Your interest in this matter is appreciated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In conclusion, if Australia is standing on the threshold not only of a major series of scientific breakthroughs but also breakthroughs which have contained within them major commercial considerations which touch upon research, which touch upon Australian patent legislation, which touch upon the role of the Parliament in regulating these matters, which touch upon the enormous commercial benefit to be gained, which touch upon a situation which may be lifesaving for hundreds of thousands if not millions of Australian and which may, in fact, be another step in freeing ourselves from technological dependence upon the United States, the United Kingdom, the Swiss drug companies or whoever it happens to be, it seems to me to be unfortunate that the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia has not given any real consideration to this matter in the course of what is now 30-odd years of exposure to the development of genetic engineering and its offshoots. Within the course of the last 10 years major public debates have taken place in the United Kingdom and the United States and a House of Commons select committee dealt with this matter five or six years ago; but this Parliament has not even started to come to grips with any of the issues which seem to me to be of significance.</PARA></TALK.START>

It will be seen in reading the Minister's reply that he says that he wants, in fact, to respond to the Academy of Science's recommendation and to establish the committee and a scientific committee fairly quickly. I am extremely critical of the decision that is made that says that in setting guidelines, which are not purely scientific guidelines but are also ethical guidelines, and guidelines about the industrial, commercial, patent use of advances in scientific research and technology, it should not be thought appropriate that the Commonwealth Parliament could have direct input or direct representation on that sort of committee. I see it as a completely proper role for the Commonwealth Parliament or for members of the Parliament interested in scientific matters to be able to play. I hope that in making this contribution on the number of scientific reports which are before us this evening I will indicate to the Minister and perhaps to anybody else in his Department who takes these matters seriously that there are some members of the Parliament who try to keep at least a brief on these things and that the Government simply cannot expect the situation to continue without the scrutiny of the Commonwealth Parliament, the way that it has done for the last 30 years.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate the second reading speech in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>The continuing policy of the Government is to strengthen the parliamentary system and to enable Parliament adequately to review the activities of government administration. In recent years the Government has taken a number of major steps in this area. These include the establishment of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure to allow for closer examination of the effectiveness and economy of public expenditure in the delivery of Government policy, and the expansion of the Public Accounts Committee's charter to bring within its purview the accounts of statutory authorities and other government bodies. The Bill now before honourable senators provides a similar expansion to the role of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works. </PARA>
<PARA> The current Public Works Committee Act 1969, provides as a general rule that a public work to be undertaken within Australia or an external Territory for a Commonwealth department and estimated to cost more than $2m, shall not be commenced unless it has been considered by the Committee. The major thrust of this Bill is to bring the works of the statutory authorities, instrumentalities and other bodies as well as overseas works, under the purview of the Public Works Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> Some authorities and types of works will continue to be exempt from the Act because of their special nature. The works of the Northern Territory Government and the Administration of Norfolk Island are exempted because of the relationship between these administrations and the Commonwealth, while Commonwealth works in these territories will continue to be subject to Public Works Committee review-these arrangements are parallel to provisions in the Public Accounts Committee Act. Similarly, the works of bodies established jointly by the Commonwealth with the States or other countries are exempted, as are overseas aid works because of their bilateral nature. </PARA>
<PARA> The works of the tertiary education institutions in the Australian Capital Territory are already subject to careful examination by the Tertiary Education Commission. These works are therefore exempted to avoid duplication. The National Capital Development Commission and the Parliament House Construction Authority are also exempted because of their specific legislation and functions. </PARA>
<PARA> It is recognised by the Government that certain authorities which trade, or which provide services and compete with the private sector, require considerable autonomy and flexibility. In some cases their investment proposals and financial and consortium arrangements should not reasonably be subject to an external review. The Bill therefore enable regulations to be made to exempt such authorities from the Act. It should be noted that provision is made for specific works of authorities which are not subject to the Act to be declared examinable by the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains a number of other amendments to improve the workings of the Committee. The Committee is being given the discretionary power to conduct inquiries in private, and in respect of urban land development works the Committee may report without an inquiry. Repetitive type works may also be exempted from review following agreement with the Committee. With regard to the Committee's inquiries into overseas works, the Government is mindful of the legal and constitutional difficulties if the Committee were to conduct inquiries and take evidence in overseas countries. The Bill therefore limits the Committee's inquiries into these works to the consideration of plans, models and statements placed before it, and to the taking of evidence from people already in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided to allow a period of 12 months to elapse after the Bill's date of assent before the works of authorities become subject to the Act. This is in recognition of the need to allow for the alterations to lead times and work loads involved in allowing for Public Works Committee review. The Public Works Committee had requested that the Act be changed to enable the Committee to make random investigations of works costing less than $2m. The Government has rejected this request for two main reasons: Firstly, the responsibilities of the Committee have already been considerably widened by this Bill; and secondly, there would be severe administrative difficulties for Commonwealth departments and authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> It is understood that the Committe was particularly concerned with cases where major works costing over $2m have been phased in over several years with small projects, that is below $2m. These propects have either escaped Committee scrutiny, or if referred to the Committee, have been referred at a stage where proper Committee investigation has been pre-empted by the work already done. The Government expects works totalling over $2m to be subject to parliamentary scrutiny, and will do all it can to ensure that all works required to be examined by the Committee in accordance with the Public Works Committee Act will be so examined. I have assured the Committee that should it wish to examine any work below $2m the Government would treat any request sympathetically, and would facilitate Committee investigation of any such work. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee has also sought authority to examine works proposals of the National Capital Development Commission. Clause 6B of the Bill enables the Government to prescribe certain works of the NCDC as public works for purposes of the Public Works Committee Act, and thus open for scrutiny by the Committee. However, it is anticipated that the bulk of the works by NCDC will be exempted from examination by the Committee. The Government can assure the House and the Committee that should the Committee wish to examine any specific work of the NCDC, the Government would treat any request sympathetically and would facilitate Committee investigation of any work. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It will be slightly more than two minutes. Honourable senators receive a mass of information from individuals in their private capacities, from companies and from pressure groups seeking to justify so-called worthwhile causes. It is not surprising that from time to time many of these people, companies and organisations actually overstate what might not otherwise be an unreasonable case or cause. I remind honourable senators of a document I received last year from a large company that operates in Australia, the Utah Development Company, entitled 'The Comparative Analysis of Tax and other Government Charges on Coal Mining Operations in Six Countries'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This document, which I believe fits neatly into this category, appeared to have a high degree of credibility and accuracy as it was prepared, after all, by a leading firm of chartered accountants which has offices in America. The local off-shoots of this chartered accountants' firm have been fairly meticulous in dotting their i's and crossing their t's as to the requirements of tax effect accounting on many mining companies here in Australia. It appears that this firm of chartered accountants was not so meticulously accurate when called upon to perform an assignment for the Utah Development Company. The document, as I said, reads well and appears to be thoroughly researched. I was therefore surprised that from such an eminent group the figures did not show the source which supports the claims on which their argument was based. </PARA>
<PARA> Having something of an accounting or an inquiring mind, I was somewhat concerned at the extent of the revelations in these documents. I was also concerned about the inclusion of what I believe to be a relatively unknown producer at this point but one whom we probably acknowledged had considerable reserves. There was a difference between production and a country which held considerable reserves by the name of Indonesia. I sought the assistance of our competent Parliamentary Library staff to verify some of these statistics. From the documents which the Library produced, there appeared to be some discrepancies. The Library, of course, quite rightly sourced the material which it extracted, and it quoted the 1978 Year Book of International Trade Statistics-Trade by Commodity, United Nations. More curious than ever, I then asked the company why Indonesia, which ranks well down the list of countries which I got from the Library, was included. In fact it ranks well behind the United Kingdom which is fifth, France, the Netherlands and Italy. They are well ahead of Indonesia. </PARA>
<PARA> The company stated that after all Indonesia was included at our specific request because it believed that that country had significant potential for coal production-there is a difference between production and potential-despite a quite modest current production. We undoubtedly acknowledge that Indonesia has a potential to become a significant competitor with Australia in coal sales to the Asian region. I believe that it would have been far better and more persuasive for this group to have put this argument rather than adding Indonesia to a realistic list of major coal producing companies and giving the impression of its already being a large producer. </PARA>
<PARA> However, here comes the rub. The countries mentioned in the report did not account for more than 90 per cent of coal production outside the communist bloc, as stated in this so-called reputable document. Being unable to reconcile this 90 per cent figure with those which I received from the Library, I again asked to source the data and also the year of the figures. If one picks the wrong number in a particular year, one will get the wrong number. So I duly received further correspondence from Utah which had to refer the matter to its accountants who eventually conceded that a further audit of their figures had resulted in some significant changes. I found that in the auditor's letter, dated 19 September 1980, on page 2, first paragraph, sixth line, that figure of 90 per cent became 73 per cent-a difference of 17 percentage points. On page 3, second paragraph, 14th line, 81 per cent became 65 per cent-a difference of 16 percentage points. These changes affect the figures on pages 1, 3 and 14 of the study and also affect further figures on page two of what they refer to as their executive study. Utah subsequently acknowledged the error, but suggested -I agree with their suggestion-that the figures did not alter the thrust of the argument. That is a recognised fact because they were fairly substantial figures. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I make is that these countries were significant producers, but I believe that if companies are to present figures to senators to justify a cause, they should source their data and should check their figures because some of us in the Senate have an interest in these matters and do not necessarily take the information for gospel, even though it might appear to come from a credible source. They should not necessarily take politicians for fools. I issue this as a warning not only to Utah but also to other companies and groups to ensure a high degree of accuracy when making submissions to politicians. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 26 February 1981 (Hansard, page 148) Senator Douglas McClelland asked me as Minister representing the Prime Minister, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I refer to the activities of the Ministerial Review Committee, commonly referred to by the media as the razor gang. Will the Minister agree that there have been many leaked reports about the responsibilities and activities of this Ministerial Review Committee but that no ministerial statement has been made to the Parliament by the Government setting out the reasons for the establishment of the Committee and its responsibilities? As well as looking at the activities and performance of government departments and statutory authorities, does the Committee intend scrutinising in any way the administrative arrangements of the Parliament? Because the Committee's work could have great repercussions on the functioning of the Australian Public Service and many statutory authorities, will the Government prepare a statement on the work of the Committee for presentation to Parliament before the Supplementary Estimates are brought down in this sessional period?</PARA>
<PARA> The Prime Minister has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Committee reviewing Commonwealth functions was announced in a press statement released by the Prime Minister on Thursday, 6 November 1980. As stated in that press statement the purpose of the Review is to examine the functions of government so as to achieve a more efficient and economical administration of continuing Commonwealth responsibilities. The Government will be giving close consideration to the handling of the Report of the Review Committee when it is received shortly, including the announcement of any recommendations of the Committee accepted by the Government.</PARA>
