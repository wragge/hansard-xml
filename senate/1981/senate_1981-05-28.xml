<PARA> Many Australians depend almost exclusively upon Trans- Australia Airlines for the provision of essential air services.</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Liberal Party policy objective of selling Trans- Australia Airlines within 4 years is contrary to the national interest.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PF4">Senator COLSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister for Social Security: In relation to the income test for a pension or benefit, is interest on an investment regarded as income even if that interest is at a rate less than the current inflation rate? If so, does this mean that some pensioners are not receiving their full pension because they receive interest payments which do not even retain the original purchasing power of their investment? Is the Minister or his Department investigating ways in which this type of injustice can be prevented?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2241" SPEAKER="Chaney Sen The Hon F.M." NAMEID="EF4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The fact contained in the honourable senator's question, that income from investment is included as income for the purpose of the income test, is of course true. Income from whatever source is taken into account in applying that test. To adopt any other course would, of course, be very unfair. For example, where a pensioner earns money from personal exertion it would be very unfair to treat the income from that less favourably than the income received by another pensioner who is fortunate enough to have investment, superannuation or other income. There is a uniform treatment of cash income.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The point which is made by the honourable senator is an important one and it underlines why this Government has placed such a high emphasis on the control of inflation which it regards as important to pensioners, as to all other members of the Australian community. It is a fact that, given inflation, those people who have saved and invested in fixed income investment do lose a proportion of their capital through the process of inflation. That is one of the reasons why the Government regards inflation as an evil which it is important to reduce as far as possible. The plight of those pensioners who have saved and put money away for their old age and who see their savings eroded by inflation is a plight shared by widows and other people who are in the same position. As I said before, I trust this will mean that the Opposition will take note of what has been said by the honourable senator and will place equal emphasis on the control of inflation in any policies it puts forward for consideration by the Australian people.</PARA>

Is it a fact that the Victorian health authority has informed the Royal Talbot General Rehabilitation Hospital at Kew that funds for capital works to the value of $2.5m designed to provide facilities intended to reduce the dependence of patients on institutional care will not be available for at least five years due to lack of Commonwealth funding?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have no information as to whether a Victorian Government authority has given particular information to the Royal Talbot General Rehabilitation Hospital at Kew in relation to its capital works program. I can say that this Government has been careful to pass through to States large amounts of general revenue through the agreements that have been made between the Commonwealth and the States. It is up to the States to make their own priority judgments as to how they spend that money. If there is to be a delay of five years, that reflects decisions made within the States and is not a question of the Commonwealth not making money available.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Because this matter was discussed and mentioned by me several days ago and because the figures I cited were queried, I asked the Department of Education to give me the figures from the Schools Commission. The Schools Commission advises that by 1978-79 all government school systems in the States had achieved a level of recurrent resource usage of about 11 per cent above the targets of per student recurrent expenditure originally set by the Karmel Committee. The Schools Commission has provided a table which shows indexes of per student expenditure in government schools in that year, 1978-79, in relation to targets, the targets being 100.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry, recalls the question asked by Senator Button on Tuesday concerning the Australian Wool Testing Authority. In his answer Senator Chaney said that he did not stand back from his answer of the previous week of sittings when he said that he saw the future of the Australian Wool Testing Authority in the context of the Government's commitment to private enterprise. The question is whether the Government has stood back from Senator Chaney. I ask whether the Minister's negotiations with the Australian Wool Corporation will be confined to the method and timing of a sale to private enterprise or whether the Minister is authorised to negotiate some change of status which does not transfer this profitable and world renowned public enterprise into the hands of private entrepreneurs.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Transport: Will the Minister investigate the difficulties currently being experienced by industry in northern Tasmania in getting goods transported urgently, particularly to Sydney, by the monopoly Australian National Line run? Will he use his best endeavours to arrange for an extra vessel to clear the backlog of cargo? Will he use his best endeavours to ensure that while ANL is permitted to have this run it provides the service required and not just the service that suits it? Is the Minister aware that yet another Tasmanian business is to close sections of its operations because of ANL frustrations? Is there anything this Government can do to ensure that ANL carries out its functions more effectively?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2243" SPEAKER="Messner Sen The Hon A.J." NAMEID="9I4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="VETERANS' AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Transport has provided me with some general information with regard to this area of concern raised by Senator Archer. One recognises that this is of great interest to him and to all other Tasmanian senators. In the peak March season some difficulties were experienced by the Australian National Line in moving cargoes from Tasmania to Sydney. These were compounded by industrial difficulties and delays at Port Botany. In recent weeks ANL vessels have experienced further delays because of action taken by maritime unions. ANL is aware of the seriousness of the problem. The maritime union strikes came at a time when the capacity of ANL was already stretched to the limit by the high demand and congestion at other ports. ANL has maintained personal contact with clients to keep them informed of the efforts being made to overcome the backlogs and to ascertain the individual shipper's specific priorities. For its part, ANL has publicly announced that it will bring extra tonnage into the northern Tasmanian trade to clear backlogs. It aims to use a Lysaght vessel and the Brisbane Trader to alleviate the present very difficult situation, particularly in the Sydney area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Honourable senators will be aware that from 26 May maritime unions again imposed bans on ANL ships. This will add to the existing difficulties created by the unions earlier this month when ANL shipping from Tasmania was stopped for six days. The Minister understands that the maritime unions intend to delay Tasmanian shipping for another six days. ANL has requested the Australian Council of Trade Unions and the maritime unions to exempt Tasmanian shipping from the stoppages, in line with ACTU policy that special consideration ought to be given to the Tasmanian economy during national shipping strikes of this kind. ANL on the whole does give Tasmania excellent service. The Minister believes that the criticism of the Line is unfounded, particularly as recent backlogs are largely due to factors outside the Line's control. The Minister is not aware that any Tasmanian business is to close sections of its operations because of ANL frustrations. However, I am sure that the Minister would be pleased to hear from Senator Archer as to any particular details he may have of a particular case.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3V4">Senator CHIPP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Industrial Relations: Why has the Government abandoned the industrial relations policy which it advocated so strongly during the last election campaign and which called for the facilitating of union amalgamation procedures and the introduction of sensible and moderate secret ballot legislation? Why has the Government shelved the proposed amalgamations Bill which had bipartisan support from both the unions and the employers, and also from the former Minister for Industrial Relations? Why is the Government determined to introduce a Bill on secret ballots which is totally opposed by both the unions and the employers, who all believe that the legislation is unnecessarily confrontative and unworkable? In particular, why does the Government appear to have dismissed the possibility that secret ballots can and often will endorse a strike, thereby lending it legitimacy and causing the Government great embarrassment?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2244" SPEAKER="Chaney Sen The Hon F.M." NAMEID="EF4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="SOCIAL SECURITY" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I shall try to answer this question, being mindful of the prohibition of debating matters during Question Time. Of course, the matters raised in the honourable senator's question will be debated in this chamber shortly. A Bill concerning this matter was introduced into the House of Representatives on 14 May and is, I understand, on the program to be dealt with during the current sittings. The honourable senator has raised a number of questions suggesting an abandonment of industrial relations policy. Of course, the Government sees the Bill not in those terms but rather in terms of its fulfilling the Government's industrial relations policy advocated during the 1980 election campaign.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the two matters raised by the honourable senator, which, it is true, is not to be dealt with in the legislation which is to come before us, is the question of amalgamation. There was an indication in the House of Representatives on 18 September last year of the Government's objective of encouraging the formation of industry-based unions. That is the established policy of both Government parties and the Australian Council of Trade Unions. There has been work, in consultation with the National Labour Consultative Committee, on amendments to the amalgamation provisions of the Act on the basis of a criterion of the community of interest of unions desiring amalgamation.</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EF4">Senator CHANEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is marvellous how much help one gets in answering these questions. I started my reference to this matter by saying that it was not in the legislation. The reason it is not in the legislation-this was raised in the honourable senator's question-is that the Government parties wish to give consideration to the full implications of that legislation before it is introduced. Hence, it is still receiving consideration within the Government. That matter is simply postponed. It is not being brought forward at this stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With respect to the other matter raised by the honourable senator, which relates to secret ballots, honourable senators will be aware that at present a discretion is vested in the Commission to order secret ballots. The effect of this legislation will be to give people at the work place a right to obtain a secret ballot. When they have a secret ballot and they indicate that they do not wish to participate in industrial action they will get some protection against the pressure which might otherwise be brought to bear on them if they did not wish to participate in industrial action.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Both by interjection and in the original legitimate question raised by Senator Chipp, I was asked: What happens if the ballot goes the other way? Of course, there must be a possibility that the people who seek a ballot will find that the ballot supports industrial action. I can only suggest to the Senate that in those circumstances we will at least know the facts of the matter, which is not the case at present. If we know that there is substantial support, that is a quite different situation from a situation in which the people at the work place do not wish to indulge in the action which is being sought by unions or by union officials. Therefore, whatever concerns might be expressed about the legislation, it will establish a position where the facts are known. That might reduce some of the rhetoric of debate and introduce a willingness to tackle the real facts at the heart of any particular dispute.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to Senator Guilfoyle as a member of the ministerial committee reviewing Government functions. When the committee said that the interest subsidy for the Australian Wheat Board 'is to be reduced by one percentage point', was it the intention of the committee that the Wheat Marketing Act would be amended to ensure that the subsidy was reduced, or was it the intention of the committee to coerce the Reserve Bank of Australia into increasing the Rural Credits Department interest rate? If it was the latter, why did the committee report and the Prime Minister refer only to the Wheat Board when several other authorities also borrow from the Rural Credits Department?</PARA></TALK.START>

The intention of the review committee was to see that there was a reduction of one per cent in the interest adjustment that covered the difference between the cost of borrowing from commercial sources and the cost of Reserve Bank Rural Credits Department finance. The committee, in its statement, did not address itself to other commodities; but, of course, other commodities would be involved in the matter covered by that decision. The Treasurer, in drawing the Reserve Bank's attention to it, has said that the Reserve Bank will be free to make these adjustments as it sees fit.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;One must bear in mind that there is a distinction, albeit often very blurred, between tax avoidance and tax cheating. The word 'dodging' can no doubt apply in both instances. Nevertheless, from a legal point of view, there is obviously such a distinction and we must bear that in mind. For a long time now a view has been held that there is a being known as 'tax evoision'. Perhaps that covers the blurred ground. That is where we have had the major problems. The question deals in broad terms. Undoubtedly there is a great deal of activity in this area which blurs into the area of cheating the public in a broad sense, if not in a purely legal sense.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> At the end of last year the Government introduced the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Bill 1980, which is now law and which was designed to deal with companies and trustees that enter into arrangements to reduce their capacity to pay tax. That legislation affects also those who advise them on paying tax, and a very severe penalty is involved. I can assure honourable senators that, from the reactions we had at the time and have had since from the tax avoidance industry of this country, there is very great concern about that piece of legislation and very close attention is being paid to its provisions. I also emphasise the legislation introduced yesterday by my colleague the Treasurer, which will provide penalties for people whose schemes are struck down by its application. Those penalties involve the payment of double the tax avoided by such schemes. Also, a proposed amendment to the Acts Interpretation Act, which will be debated in the Senate perhaps later today, will ask the courts to pay regard to the object and purpose of legislation rather than its literal interpretation. The combination of all these moves represents a very formidable package, already in effect or in the process of being introduced, of measures designed to deal with the problem which is concerning Senator Young and indeed all other members of this Parliament.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government last year established a program which rejoices in the acronym NIEMS, the National Industry Energy Management Scheme, which is aimed at bringing to the attention of industry the desirability and practicability of making very substantial energy savings. The experience of those who have ventured on this path shows that the average industry can save between 20 per cent and 30 per cent of its energy costs by adopting appropriate measures. The NIEMS program has a system whereby the Government will provide advisers to go into buildings or factories and to do an energy audit upon request. Indeed, for small factories it makes some kind of contribution to the cost of that audit. The scheme also takes into account a wide series of seminars held throughout Australia. I think we have had some 20 or 30 major seminars which have been well attended by industries. We have had requests that will take the number to about 90. We have done some advertising on television which is directed to industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I repeat two things. The belief throughout the Western world is that affluent countries can save up to 30 per cent of energy without affecting living standards. Even more importantly in a world in which inflation is pressing and in a country in which the pressure of a resource boom will threaten our downward trend of inflation it is vitally important that costs should be saved in all forms of energy. For example, if we were to save something between 5 per cent and 10 per cent of the electricity consumption of today, domestically and industrially, we would save between $1 billion and $2 billion in capital costs in the development of powerhouses in the next decade.</PARA>
<PARA> I think the article is important. We are making this a major feature of our policy. It is one which is featured internationally. A prominent architect in Australia who recently won an international prize for the design of a building in America of a major standard told me that his design would cause a 50 per cent saving in energy costs.

I will endeavour to give an answer and Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle may wish to make an addition to it. I have noticed with considerable regret the announcement that the widow and daughter of Mr Bhutto have been retained, I think under protective detention. That is the euphemism used these days on the world scene. I am not aware of the details as to the alleged reasons for their arrest, or, indeed, whether they can be verified. If political reasons are involved it would be a matter that bodies such as Amnesty International, quite apart from this Parliament, would need to take care of. Of course, before we venture into the affairs of another country the first thing for us to do is to try to discover the facts because it may be that the Pakistan Government can substantiate charges that it may make.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A special program was established in October last year to facilitate the family reunion movement to Australia for Timorese who were finding difficulty settling in Portugal, the country of their citizenship. Of course, normal sponsorship criteria have been relaxed to include all relatives. I understand that the Portuguese Government will pay a substantial subsidy towards the fare of returnees from its former colonies leaving for permanent resettlement in Australia or indeed any other country. An international agency is assisting these movements by providing the balance of the fare elsewhere, although I understand there is some shortage of funds for that agency. If people cannot actually afford the fare sympathetic consideration is given to meeting the whole of the cost by that agency.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;South Australia and Tasmania, unlike the other four States, have Commonwealth-State cost sharing agreements which do not terminate until June 1985. The short answer to the honourable senator's question is no. This year the Commonwealth is providing about $42m to Tasmania under the Commonwealth-State hospital cost sharing agreement. It is expected that Tasmania will continue with that agreement and will not choose to enter the new agreement. Therefore, under the present agreement, the funds provided to Tasmania by the Commonwealth next year should be in excess of $42m. On the basis of advice from the Department of Health, I understand that Mr Miller's claims that funding for public hospitals in Tasmania next year will be reduced by $9m result from a misunderstanding on his part that new health services funding arrangements applying to other States will necessarily apply to Tasmania. That is not the case. Tasmania has stated that it wishes to continue with the hospital cost sharing agreement which does not expire until 1985. The Commonwealth will therefore continue to share the net operating costs of Tasmania's public hospitals.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Whilst I do not have exact answers to all the questions asked by Senator Teague, I have some information relating to this matter. I am, of course, aware of Press reports which assert that there have been arrests of persons in Italy of the kind set out by Senator Teague. It has been reported that the Italians arrested are members of L'Onorata Societa-the Honoured Society. Mr Justice Woodward, the New South Wales royal commissioner into drug trafficking, examined possible connections between suspected members of this society in New South Wales and the growing and marketing of marijuana. His report of 1979 discussed this aspect of his inquiries, particularly in relation to the area around Griffith. Of course I am not able to say whether Australia is a vast, enormous marijuana plantation. If it is I certainly have not been able to see any of the areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Members of the Honoured Society have also been suspected of involvement in Victorian organised crime, including the cultivating and marketing of marijuana. I understand that information from the Woodward royal commission report and the Victorian Police was forwarded to the Italian police to assist them in their inquiries. As honourable senators are aware, the menace of organised crime does not respect territorial borders, be they State boundaries or borders between countries. I am sure that is the reason behind the last part of the honourable senator's question about seeking major co-operation between police forces. The Commonwealth is aware of the need for this kind of co-operation and is examining what can be done in this area. If the threats posed by organised crime, particularly drug trafficking, are to be met, co-operation between police forces both within Australia and internationally is of the utmost importance. What has gone on is one example of that.</PARA>

I have been informed that a review is being carried out of the rostering arrangements of security attendants and methods towards improving performance of security functions.

It is expected that the review will be completed before the start of the Budget sittings.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>Petroleum (Submerged Lands-Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The package of off-shore legislation passed in May last year included the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Amendment Act 1980. That Act has not been proclaimed yet but since its enactment it has become apparent that some amendments of a mainly technical nature to it and to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967 are required before the 1980 Act is proclaimed. The Bill introduces the necessary amendments. As part of the off-shore constitutional settlement it was agreed that Commonwealth off-shore petroleum legislation would apply beyond the three-mile territorial sea and that State legislation would apply in the three-mile territorial sea. The Commonwealth Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Amendment Act 1980 implements this agreement by amending the Commonwealth Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967 so that it would no longer apply inside the three-mile territorial sea. The 1980 Act contains a scheme for transitional arrangements, agreed on between the Commonwealth and the States and the Northern Territory, under which existing permits straddling the boundary of the territorial sea are to be split into two permits. The two new permits, consisting of a Commonwealth permit and a State permit, are to cover those parts respectively under Commonwealth jurisdiction and under State jurisdiction. </PARA>
<PARA> The 'Scheme for Transitional Arrangements', which appears as Schedule 4 of the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Amendment Act 1980, was drafted in close consultation with the States on the basis that State action to implement the off-shore constitutional settlement in this regard would take the same form as that adopted by the Commonwealth, namely, by amendment of the State Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act 1967. Subsequently, however, it was decided that for constitutional reasons the State Acts should be re-enacted with the necessary changes, rather than merely amended. The Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Amendment Act 1980, which was drafted to refer to the 1967 State Acts as amended from time to time, should therefore be appropriately amended so as to make it clear that it refers to the State Acts as proposed to be re-enacted. </PARA>
<PARA> The opportunity is being taken in this Bill to extend the application of the off-shore petroleum legislation to the continental shelf in the Coral Sea area. This is one of the last areas of Australian continental shelf virtually unexplored for petroleum. It is considered to be prospective and the petroleum industry has expressed keen interest in exploration there. This new area will be bounded to the west by the existing Queensland adjacent area boundary, to the south partly by that boundary and partly by the parallel of latitude 25 degrees south, and in due course will be bounded to the north by the seabed boundary to be established when the Torres Strait Treaty enters into effect, and to the east by seabed boundaries under negotiation with Solomon Islands and France. </PARA>
<PARA> The Coral Sea area is thus one of considerable dimensions and most of it is sufficiently distant from the Barrier Reef to permit exploration activities to be undertaken in those areas. In regard to the areas adjacent to the Great Barrier Reef region the Government is very mindful of its undertaking to protect the reef and it has therefore been decided that no commitment will be given to issue exploration permits within 30 miles of the reef, and furthermore that all exploration proposals within the new area will be subject to the closest scrutiny under the Commonwealth environment legislation. In this respect it is very relevant to point out that all islands and cays in the area are excluded from the ambit of the Bill. In the second reading speech for the introduction of the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) legislation in 1967, it was indicated that when, at some future time, the legislation was extended to the Coral Sea area, administration of the legislation in that area would be carried out by Queensland. This Bill therefore provides that for the purposes of the petroleum legislation the area is to be administered as if it were part of the Queensland adjacent area. Thus the new area will be covered by Commonwealth legislation alone, with day to day administration being carried out by Queensland, but with the Commonwealth, through the joint authority arrangements, having overall responsibility for the area and the final say in major decisions which, of course, will include drilling proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also amends the boundaries of the Queensland adjacent area in the Torres Strait area. There are several anomalies in that boundary and the requirement to amend it at this stage arises out of the fact that, when the boundary was established in 1967, it intersected the Australian territorial seas of five islands in the Torres Strait resulting in some areas of territorial sea of those islands lying outside the Queensland adjacent area. This has not been a practical problem to date. However, under the provisions of the Coastal Waters (State Powers) Act, legislative powers are to be granted to States only in territorial seas which lie within adjacent areas immediately before that Act comes into force. It is therefore necessary to amend the Queensland adjacent area boundary to encompass these territorial sea areas, to ensure that State legislative powers are extended to those areas. When the Torres Strait Treaty is ratified, the adjacent area boundary will be amended to correspond to the treaty seabed line, which is considerably further south than the present boundary. The Australian territorial sea around Australian islands north of the seabed line will continue to be covered by the Coastal Waters (State Powers) Act. As an interim measure, the adjacent area boundary has been amended so that it accords also with the limits of areas of Papua New Guinea territorial sea. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to the provisions of the Bill, Part II of the Bill amends the 1967 Act. The main provisions in this Part, apart from some drafting amendments, are the amendments in clause 6 designed to allow an offence against the Act to be tried summarily without a jury and the re-drawing of the boundary of the Queensland adjacent area in clause 8 for reasons which I have already explained. Part III deals with amendments to the 1980 Act. The main amendments here are the extension of the legislation to the Coral Sea area by clause 10 and the re-definition of State Acts contained in clause 13. I have already mentioned the reasons for these amendments. Clause 11 is a drafting amendment clarifying the meaning of the provision and clause 12 contains certain technical amendments, as explained in the explanatory memorandum, designed to ensure the proper continuity of titles during the transition period. Part IV of the Bill contains a consequential amendment of the Coral Sea Islands Act 1969 resulting from the extension of the off-shore petroleum legislation to the Coral Sea area. The Bill also tidies up certain drafting errors of a typographical nature in the 1980 Act and these are contained in Schedule 2 of the Bill. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>Petroleum (Submerged Lands) (Registration Fees) Amendment Bill 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is subsidiary to the Petroleum (Submerged Lands-Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill 1981, introduced earlier. The amendment contained in the Bill clarifies a legal point that became apparent during the drafting of the complementary State legislation. The effect of the amendment is to ensure that the relevant provisions of the legislation will apply to transfers of title held by several corporations where two or more of the corporations are related and not only to cases where all the corporations are related. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA>Minerals (Submerged Lands) Bill 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> This Bill, and the associated Bills, will provide a framework for the exploration for and production of minerals other than petroleum on Australia's continental shelf beyond the outer limit of the three mile territorial sea. The Bills are part of the agreed arrangements on off-shore mining in the context of the off-shore constitutional settlement. The arrangements for off-shore petroleum were dealt with in the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Amendment Act 1980 passed in May last year. The minerals Bills were also prepared in close consultations with the States and their extensive experience in the administration of mining operations made a valuable contribution in this regard. The provisions follow closely the principles agreed in regard to off-shore petroleum mining. </PARA>
<PARA> There is increasing interest world-wide in other mineral resources of the seabed. Deposits so far identified include construction materials such as sand, gravel, limestone, et cetera; detrital minerals such as tin, gold, platinum, diamonds; and the beach sand minerals such as magnetite, ilmenite, rutile, zircon, monazite; and phosporite. Deposits of this nature have been identified on the continental shelves of many countries. The value of production of minerals recovered from the seabed so far is however small when compared with that of off-shore oil and natural gas. </PARA>
<PARA> There has not been much activity in mining for other minerals in Australia's off-shore areas to date and the constitutional uncertainty may have been a contributing factor in this regard. There are three off-shore exploration permits current at present, two off New South Wales and one off Queensland, but no production licences have yet been granted. There are, in addition, several on-shore coal leases in New South Wales which extend off-shore and some of these subterranean mining operations are carried out as extensions of on-shore operations. It is also understood that in Tasmania there may be some subterranean mining of tungsten from on-shore. </PARA>
<PARA> There is as yet no Commonwealth legislation to cover off-shore minerals other than petroleum. However, in this respect the Australian Minerals and Energy Council agreed in 1978 that mining titles for off-shore minerals could be issued under the respective State laws. The Commonwealth stipulated, however, that this procedure was without prejudice to any future arrangements and the operators involved must be prepared to accept the risk that any title so granted may not be considered valid. The Commonwealth undertook to transition such titles when new legislation is enacted. The Bill contains transitional provisions to deal with such titles. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have already mentioned, the arrangements for off-shore minerals being given effect to in this Bill follow closely the arrangements for off-shore petroleum. I shall not repeat the constitutional history or the history of the negotiations with the States which were outlined when the package of off-shore Bills was introduced in May last year. The basic agreement between the Commonwealth and the States on off-shore mining, including petroleum, included the following:</PARA>
<PARA> all off-shore mining would be conducted in accordance with a common mining code;</PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth legislation would apply beyond the three-mile territorial sea and State legislation within the three-mile territorial sea, but for reasons of administration all underground mining extending from on-shore will be excluded and controlled by State legislation;</PARA>
<PARA> there would be joint authorities in respect of all mining operators beyond the three-mile territorial sea consisting of the relevant Commonwealth and State Ministers;</PARA>
<PARA> the joint authorities would be responsible for major matters relating to titles, for example, granting or refusal, renewal, transfer, farmins, et cetera. The view of the Commonwealth Minister would prevail in the case of disagreement;</PARA>
<PARA> the States and the Northern Territory would have an active role in the day to day administration of the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The original agreement between the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) and the Premiers left the question of royalties for off-shore minerals for further consideration. Following further consultation with the States the arrangement embodied in the Bill is that royalties will be shared 60/40 between the States, including Northern Territory, and the Commonwealth in the same way as applies to petroleum. The sharing arrangement is intended to apply both beyond and within the three-mile territorial sea and also to underground mining extending from on-shore. </PARA>
<PARA> The States and the Northern Territory will retain all fees received from title holders and applicants for titles. This is seen, at least in part, as a recompense to the States for the administrative expenses; as in the case of off-shore petroleum the States and the Northern Territory will undertake the day to day administration and will be the primary point of contact between the industry and the governments. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning now to the provisions of the Bill, the off-shore mining agreements I mentioned earlier are given effect to in the Bill and in particular I refer to Part II of the Bill where the establishment, functions and procedures of the joint authorities and designated authorities-relevant State and Northern Territory Minister-are set out in detail. Part III deals with the application of laws in the area adjacent to States and Territories and the principle embodied in this Part is that the laws of the State or Territory should apply in the off-shore area adjacent to that State or Territory for all purposes connected with the off-shore mining of minerals. </PARA>
<PARA> Part IV of the Bill is the actual mining code. The Bill provides for a two stage system of titles. An exploration title, referred to as an 'exploration permit', may be followed by a production title, referred to as a 'production licence'. In addition, provision has been made for a 'works authority' which will authorise a title holder to have access to areas outside his title area to carry out operations or to construct works associated with operations in the title area. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill provides for the granting of an exploration permit to an applicant. Such a permit grants its holder a right to explore for minerals in an area not exceeding 500 blocks, that is an area of approximately 575 square miles. The initial permit term is two years, and there is provision for renewals, for periods of two years each, subject to the permittee's compliance with the permit conditions and the legislation. Upon each renewal the permittee must relinquish at least one quarter of the area previously held. Because of the many unknown factors in off-shore mineral technology it is not possible to specify precise permit conditions in this Bill. The joint authority will therefore determine the conditions of each permit according to the circumstances of the case. In this respect the possible effect on the environment will be given full consideration under the Commonwealth Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act which, of course, applies in relation to decisions taken by the Commonwealth; and it is anticipated that the States will exercise similar control in respect of the three-mile territorial sea area. </PARA>
<PARA> A permittee may apply for a production licence, covering no more than 50 blocks, that is an area of approximately 58 square miles, of his previous permit area. A person who is not a permittee may also apply for a licence over an area that is not the subject of an exploration or production title. A licence and subsequent renewals may be granted at the discretion of the joint authority for periods each not exceeding 21 years. It is a requirement of production titles that a holder shall annually expend on exploration or recovery operations an amount calculated at $5,000 per block, that is for a maximum licence area of 50 blocks a total of $250,000 must be spent each year. If, however, minerals are recovered in the licence area the value of the minerals recovered is offset against the required expenditure. The joint authority has a discretion to grant an exemption from this provision to deal with a situation where the level of expenditure required may be too high. </PARA>
<PARA> It is an important feature of this Bill that applicants, permittees and licensees will be required to provide adequate information and reports, including samples where appropriate, on exploration and production activities. The overall geological knowledge of the seabed obtained is important to the Government in its systematic assessment of mineral resources. The information will be publicly available after a short period of confidentiality and this is expected to make a valuable contribution to other potential explorers. In accordance with the Convention on the Continental Shelf there is a provision in this Bill for the joint authority to consent to mineral exploration in the course of scientific investigations. The Convention also requires that operations on the continental shelf must not result in any unnecessary interference with navigation, fishing or the conservation of the resources of the sea and seabed and this is covered in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> Included in the Bill are provisions for the making of operating and safety regulations. The Bill, as does the petroleum legislation, gives the designated authority the power to issue direction on any matters with respect to which regulations may be made. Approval of the joint authority is required for directions of a standing nature. Included in this Bill are transitional provisions which enable holders of current State off-shore titles granted under arrangements I have already mentioned to apply for comparable titles under this legislation. The grant of such a title will be subject to such conditions as the joint authority thinks fit but it is intended to match as far as possible the conditions of the current titles for the unexpired portions of their terms. The Bill provides for the normal requirements associated with mining administration such as keeping a register, the appointment of inspectors, and for courts of competent jurisdiction for the prosecution of offences and other proceedings. There are also the usual provisions in the Bill for the joint authority to grant variation, suspension of, or exemption from conditions of a title, and for the surrender and cancellation of titles. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions in the associated Bills deal with money matters and for that reason have to be contained in separate Bills. The Royalties Bill imposes an obligation on licence holders to pay royalties. As I have mentioned before the off-shore minerals industry in Australia is in a very early stage of development and the economics of developing off-shore minerals deposits are largely unknown. For that reason it is felt that flexibility is required in the setting of royalty rates and the Bill provides that the rate is to be set by the joint authorities in relation to specific minerals. Once, however, a rate is set and the determination published in the Gazette, it is intended that it will apply uniformly in all off-shore areas. However, to cope with situations where a particular operation may be uneconomic the joint authority is given the power to reduce the royalty. Uniform criteria would be applied in the exercise of this power. The joint authority is also given power to determine the landed value of a mineral and the quantity of a mineral recovered for the purpose of determining the amount of royalty payable by a licensee. </PARA>
<PARA> The Exploration Permit Fees Bill, the Production Licence Fees Bill and the Works Authority Bill impose annual fees in respect of these titles. The annual permit fee is $10 per block or $300 whichever is greater, the annual licence fee is $100 per block, and the annual works authority fee is $10 per hectare. The Registration Fees Bill imposes a fee on the registration of an instrument by which an interest in a title is assigned or dealt with in some other way. The fee imposed is 1.5 per cent of the value of the interest with a minimum of $300. In certain special cases the maximum fee payable is $3,000. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation provides a framework for the off-shore mining industry, which I feel sure will grow in importance in the years to come. At the same time the legislation illustrates yet again the success of the Government's co-operative federalism policy where the legal powers and responsibilities of the Commonwealth and the administrative experience of the States are combined for the mutual benefit of both and for the good of Australia. It is intended that once this Bill, and the associated Bills, are passed the States will introduce complementary legislation to apply in the three-mile territorial sea area and so give effect to the agreement for a common off-shore minerals code. The Commonwealth legislation will be proclaimed to come into effect after all the States and the Northern Territory have their own legislation in place. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA>I seek leave to incorporate the second reading speech in Hansard, noting only as I do so that this is a long overdue reform measure, that it is based on recommendations of the Australian Law Reform Commission, that the Government's failure to act in the face of an escalating series of broking-house collapses is assuming positively scandalous dimensions, and that I hope that the Government's mind will be so concentrated by the introduction of this Bill that it will take the initiative on the issue early in the Budget session. If it does not, I give notice that the matters in issue here will be pursued very vigorously indeed. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to establish a statutory framework for the regulation of the insurance broking industry and the activities of insurance brokers and agents. </PARA>
<PARA> Legislation of this kind has been long awaited by the public, by this Parliament, by State governments and by the insurance broking industry itself. The fact that it comes before the Senate as a private member's Bill is itself an indictment of successive Liberal governments which have failed to introduce such legislation despite overwhelming evidence of the urgent need and the manifest enthusiasm of the community generally for it. </PARA>
<PARA> In presenting this Bill to the Senate, I wish at the outset to pay a particular tribute to my colleague, Ralph Jacobi, the honourable member for Hawker, without whose tireless pursuit of legislative reform of the insurance industry this Bill would never have seen the light of day. The report of the Australian Law Reform Commission on Insurance Agents and Brokers, tabled in this Parliament on 16 September 1980, and on which this Bill is based, was the result of a reference to the Commission in 1976 which was itself made largely in response to repeated requests by Ralph Jacobi. The Government's responses to periodic questions and speeches from Mr Jacobi on this subject have become almost ritual in their evasiveness. The introduction of this Bill represents a declaration that we can wait no longer for the Government to act. </PARA>
<PARA> At the outset, a clear distinction must be drawn between insurers on the one hand and insurance brokers and agents on the other hand. The Life Insurance Act 1945 and the Insurance Act 1973 regulate the operation of insurers, both life and general, through the administrative supervision of the Life Insurance Commissioner and the Insurance Commissioner respectively. The present Bill is concerned with brokers and agents and not with insurers, although their financial relationships are necessarily closely intertwined. </PARA>
<PARA> Insurance brokers have been usefully defined as persons who 'acting with complete freedom as to their choice of undertaking, bring together, with a view to the insurance or re-insurance of risks, persons seeking insurance or re-insurance and insurance or re-insurance undertakings, carry out work preparatory to the conclusion of contracts of insurance or re-insurance and, where appropriate, assist in the administration and performance of such contracts, in particular in the event of a claim' (United Kingdom, Department of Trade, 'Insurance Intermediaries', Command Paper No. 715 (1975) page 8). The key distinction between a broker and an insurance agent is that, whereas a broker possesses an ability to act with complete freedom as to the choice of the insurer with which he arranges his client's insurance cover, an agent is normally committed to the promotion of the policies or interests of one or a limited number of insurance companies. </PARA>
<PARA> According to Australian Bureau of Statistics figures published in 1979, there are more than 550 insurance broking houses in Australia, employing roughly 5,600 individuals. Approximately 10,000 agents sell life insurance on a full time basis and there are in addition large numbers of part time insurance agents, the majority of whom arrange insurance solely for purposes connected with their main occupation. At present, a large number of insurance agents incorrectly and often misleadingly describe themselves as insurance brokers and it is part of the purpose of this Bill to ensure that the terminology is correctly applied. Accordingly, Clause 30 of this Bill makes it an offence for any insurance intermediary other than a registered broker to describe himself or his business in a way that would lead a person into believing that he was an insurance broker. </PARA>
<PARA> In recent years the insurance broking industry has become infamous for the dramatic collapses of broking houses. Hardly a month goes by but we read the headline 'another insurance broker in liquidation'. This is not a new phenomenon. The law Reform Commission report itemised 27 insurance broker insolvencies in New South Wales and Victoria between 1969 and 1979 with estimated losses totalling $7.3m. The Commission was unable to obtain information in relation to 17 other cases of alleged insolvency. Estimates for 1980 and 1981 put losses at around $7m for the two year period, making the total estimated losses-and this must be regarded as a conservative figure in the absence of systematic statistics-$14m over the 12 year period 1969-1981. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall cite some examples to remind honourable senators more vividly of the problems. In January 1979, Cyril Stanley Pty Ltd collapsed with debts of $1.9m and an estimated deficiency of $619,000. In May 1979 the Hamilton Group of Companies became insolvent with an estimated $400,000 owed to unsecured creditors. In 1980 six Western Australian broking companies collapsed with outstanding debts totalling well over $3m. Those companies were Douglas Insurance Brokers Pty Ltd, John D. Seale and Co. Pty Ltd, Ibis Holdings Pty Ltd, Morley Insurance Brokers Pty Ltd, Dyson Insurance Brokers Pty Ltd and Town and Country Insurance Brokers Pty Ltd. Over the past 18 months, the total number of broker collapses in Western Australia has risen to at least 12, and , as recently as March, Beneficial Insurance Brokers Pty Ltd of Perth went into receivership with an estimated premium shortfall of $1m. </PARA>
<PARA> In New South Wales, 14 insurance brokers have stopped trading in 18 months. Of these perhaps the most notorious is the One Stop Insurance Shop broking group. The New South Wales part of this operation went into liquidation in March of this year with debts of $1m and the same amount was owed when One Stop Insurance Shop Pty Ltd in Victoria went into provisional liquidation. The Queensland affairs of the company are also in the hands of a liquidator. The collapse of the One Stop operation affected some 34,000 policy holders throughout Australia and led directly to the collapse of Australian Premium Financing Company Pty Ltd which had financed those operations. </PARA>
<PARA> Also in March of this year two Victorian brokers folded up. Anthony H. Bown and Associates Pty Ltd went into liquidation with debts of $320,624 and-perhaps the worst case of all-Kinloch (Insurances) Pty Ltd was placed in the hands of a liquidator in March 1981 with estimated debts of $3m after a premium turnover estimated at $6m annually. </PARA>
<PARA> The catalogue of disaster goes on. Let us look at those who really suffer when a broker becomes insolvent. If an insurance broker fails, a policy holder who has in good faith forwarded his premium to the broker may find that, owing to the broker's failure to forward the premium to the insurance company, he is uninsured. In such circumstances, the policy holder must-unless the insurer accepts the loss-pay a second premium in order to maintain his cover. Worse still, if a claim arises in the period between the collapse of the broker and the payment of a second premium, the policy holder is, subject to the benevolence of the insurance company, completely uninsured. It must be said that insurers have tended increasingly in recent years to maintain cover where a initial premium has been paid to the failed broker, but it is obviously undesirable for the policy holder to be thus dependent on the whim of the insurer. </PARA>
<PARA> Equally, an insurance company may have forwarded funds to the failed broker in settlement of a claim and these moneys may have been mixed with the general funds of the broker instead of being transferred to the insured. Again the insurer and insured face a dispute as to who is liable to bear that loss and, on the general common law principle that the broker is the agent of the insured, it will most often be borne by the insured. An examination of the accounts of insolvent brokers shows that insurance premiums received by the broker but not paid to the insurer usually form the greater part of the debts owed by the broker. When a broker becomes insolvent, it is the practice-although it is not clear what is the strict legal position-to treat such premium moneys as being available for the general creditors of the broker and not as being available only to the insured persons who have paid the relevant premiums or those insurers who have extended the relevant cover. </PARA>
<PARA> I need elaborate no further to show how utterly unsatisfactory the current position is and how urgent the need for regulation of the broking industry in the interests of the public and creditors alike. </PARA>
<PARA> The need for regulation of agents and brokers has long been recognised, both in overseas and State jurisdictions, and by all sections of the community involved with the broking industry. The Queensland Insurance Act 1960-1976 provides for the licensing of insurance brokers and for their regulation and supervision by the State Insurance Commissioner. In the United Kingdom, the Insurance Brokers (Registration) Act 1977 established an Insurance Brokers Registration Council together with detailed regulation of the financial affairs of brokers. Following a report in 1975, the New Zealand Parliament enacted the Insurance Law Reform Act 1977 which contains provisions concerning responsibility for the actions of insurance agents. </PARA>
<PARA> I would remind honourable senators that the Whitlam Labor Government had, before its sacking in November 1975, prepared draft legislation for regulation of the broking industry. The proposed legislation would have established strict guidelines as to the skill and educational qualifications for insurance brokers and would have provided for renewable licenses to be issued by the Insurance Commissioner. As with so many other worthy Labor legislative initiatives, that particular proposal was nipped in the bud by Mr Fraser's successful grab for power. </PARA>
<PARA> Since then, we have observed a dizzying series of somersaults by the present Government. In April 1976, the then Minister assisting the Treasurer, Mr Robinson, announced that the Government would introduce legislation for the licensing of insurance brokers. On 11 March 1977, however, the Government reversed its decision and announced its intention to pursue a scheme of self-regulation. The decision to reject legislative regulation of the industry was allegedly made on the basis of the complexity of the proposed legislation, in that it was 'an overkill situation of using a sledgehammer to crack a walnut'. </PARA>
<PARA> In February 1979, the Treasurer, Mr Howard, announced that he would seek the Government's approval to develop legislation for a voluntary regulation arrangement for brokers. Six months later he had changed his mind again. The Government refused to grasp the nettle, claiming that there was no consensus among the various bodies representing insurance brokers on the form of controls that might be introduced. The Treasurer proposed to wait until the Law Reform Commission's report was tabled. </PARA>
<PARA> One might have been forgiven for expecting that the tabling of the Commission's report would finally have stimulated some action. Great was our disbelief when, upon the tabling of the Law Reform Commission's report in September 1980 after over three years of the most extensive consultation with hundreds of representatives of the broking industry, consumer groups, business, legal and other interests, the Treasurer announced that as a first step in the Government's consideration of the present report, he proposed to seek the views of insurance industry organisations and other interested parties. </PARA>
<PARA> The report's recommendations, with which I shall deal in more detail shortly, were clear and unequivocal. That the Government should propose further consultation when presented with a complete blueprint for reform shows how pathological is its capacity for vacillation and how feeble its commitment to the regulation of business in the public interest. This is yet another area-like trade practices, company law and family law-where the need for national regulatory legislation is almost universally acknowledged, but this Government, obsessed by the deregulation ideology which has characterised the whole razor gang performance, continues to shirk its responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted here that the Government cannot even claim in its own defence that the insurance broking lobby is against such legislation. For many years now the various bodies representing insurance brokers-notably the Confederation of Insurance Brokers of Australia, the Insurance Brokers Association and the Insurance Brokers Council of Australia-have been calling for legislation to regulate the broking industry. Those bodies impose their own stringent regulations upon member brokers and have long been concerned that the public and the industry itself are poorly served by the spectacular crashes of broking companies. While there has been disagreement over the degree to which any regulatory body should be controlled by the industry or by the government, there has been a striking unanimity in the calls for compulsory registration of brokers, for professional indemnity insurance and for implementation of the Law Reform Commission's other recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> The frustration at the Government's inaction has been felt in other places. Western Australia recently introduced its own legislation, the General Insurance Brokers and Agents Bill 1981, and the New South Wales Government gave notice as recently as 21 May that it was preparing legislation which it would introduce unless the Federal Government took decisive action. The New South Wales Minister for Consumer Affairs, Mr Einfeld, stated on 5 March 1981 that he completely supported the principles inherent in the report of the Law Reform Commission and the Commissioner for Consumer Affairs, Mr Gallagher, repeated last week that the Federal Government's failure to take action would inevitably compel the New South Wales Government to move in this direction. In the last fortnight, the Victorian Minister for Consumer Affairs, Mr Ramsay, has added his voice to the call for national legislation, repeating the urgent request made by the Consumer Affairs Ministers from all States in November 1980 that the Federal Government implement the Law Reform Commission proposals. </PARA>
<PARA> It would, in the view of the Opposition, be most unfortunate if the States were compelled to enact their own legislation to meet this need. There is already far too much non-uniformity in areas of commercial regulation which cry out for a uniform national approach. There can be no doubt about the Commonwealth's power to legislate in this area: section 51 (14) of the Constitution gives the Commonwealth Parliament power to make laws with respect to 'insurance, other than State insurance; also State insurance extending beyond the limits of the State concerned'. This power covers all private insurance except insurance offered by a State instrumentality within the boundaries of its home State. Equally, there should be no doubt about the Commonwealth's responsibility to enact such legislation. It is, I repeat, an indictment of the present Government that a matter of national public importance should be forced to run the gauntlet as a private member's Bill instead of being introduced with the full weight of the Government behind it. I now turn to consider the provisions of the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> In September 1976, a reference from the then Attorney-General, Mr Ellicott, required the Australian Law Reform Commission to report on the adequacy of the law governing contracts of insurance, having regard to the interests of insurer, insured and the public. In late 1978, in the course of its investigations, the Commission published a discussion paper which included tentative proposals for regulatory control of insurance agents and brokers. These proposals provoked vigorous debate within the insurance industry, particularly amongst agents and brokers, and in order to facilitate the early legislative resolution of the problem, the Commission decided to report separately on the regulation of insurance agents and brokers in advance of completing the full reference on insurance contracts. The Commission's report was completed in January 1980 and tabled in the Federal Parliament on 16 September 1980. A draft Bill was appended to the Commission's report and that draft is, with the insertion of penalties for offences created by the Bill, reproduced in this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> I should stress here that the Opposition is committed to the implementation of the Law Reform Commission's draft legislation in its present form. Apart from the fact that we strongly endorse the substance of those recommendations, we consider it inappropriate that any tampering with the Commission's draft should take place, at least before Parliament has had an opportunity to consider those recommendations in their original form. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission alone has had the benefit of consultation with all interested groups, of expert research and advice and its own careful deliberation. It would make a mockery of that process if personal preference-or the demands of one or other lobby group-were allowed to interfere with the finished product. After three years of internal study, the Commission is better placed than anyone to come up with sensible workable solutions. Before proceeding to matters of detail, I should indicate the scope of the proposed legislation. As an exercise of the constitutional power of the Commonwealth, this Bill when enacted will have national application without the need for complementary State legislation. It is anticipated that the Queensland and Western Australian legislation dealing with this subject will be repealed. The legislation is to apply in respect of insurance offered by friendly societies and to funeral funds insofar as they constitute a form of life insurance. It does not extend to health funds registered under the National Health Act 1953 nor to contracts of re-insurance. Clauses 6 to 8 of the Bill deal with these matters of scope. I would also point out that the Bill binds the Crown in right of the Commonwealth or a Territory and, except as otherwise provided in the Bill, binds the Crown in right of a State. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is concerned with the regulation of the activities of insurance intermediaries. There are three main types of insurance intermediary: insurance agents, insurance brokers and loss adjusters. The Law Reform Commission concluded that the need for statutory regulation of loss adjusters had not been demonstrated. Accordingly, this Bill applies to agents and brokers but not to loss adjusters. </PARA>
<PARA> The distinction between an agent and a broker has already been described. Broadly speaking, an agent acts on behalf of one or a small number of insurance companies, arranging contracts of insurance and settling claims as the agent of the insurance company or companies. The broker, on the other hand, is not-unless he acts under an agreement known as a 'binder'-the agent of any insurance company but rather acts as agent of the insured in arranging a contract of insurance with whichever insurance company he chooses. This Bill provides (clause 11) that all insurance intermediaries (which term is defined for the purposes of this Bill to exclude loss adjusters) other than registered insurance brokers are deemed to be insurance agents. </PARA>
<PARA> The provisions of the Bill relating to insurance agents can be briefly summarised. First the Bill clarifies the confused state of the common law by making the insurer responsible to the insured or intending insured for the conduct of his agent or employee (clause 10). Thus the insurer is liable for any loss or damage caused by the conduct of his agent which is relied on in good faith by the insured, whether or not the agent acted within the scope of his authority or employment. Any agreement which seeks to limit this responsibility is void and it is an offence to make or offer to make such an agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the Bill makes it an offence for an agent or employee of an insurer wilfully and with intent to deceive to misrepresent the effect of, or benefits available under, an insurance policy or to misrecord information on a proposal or claim form or to advise an insured or intending insured to do so (clause 12). Thirdly, the Bill confirms the common law agency principle that the payment of a premium to an insurance agent by an intending insured discharges the insured's liability to the insurer (clause 13) and the payment by an insurer to an agent of claim moneys does not discharge the insurer's liability to the insured (clause 13 (2)). It should be noted that in view of the safeguards already referred to, the Law Reform Commission concluded that occupational regulation of insurance agents was unnecessary, at least at this stage, and the Bill accordingly makes no such provision. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning now to insurance brokers, the major structural impact of this Bill is the introduction of a statutory system of broker registration. The Law Reform Commission concluded that the risk of broker insolvency and of consequent harm to the insuring public-so graphically illustrated by the string of collapses in recent months-could only be reduced by compulsory registration and the imposition of clear standards of financial probity, to be enforced through periodical audits and independent inspections. </PARA>
<PARA> Clause 17 of the Bill accordingly prohibits the conduct of an insurance broking business-whether in life insurance or general insurance-unless the individual or corporation concerned is registered by the Life Insurance Commissioner or the Insurance Commissioner as the case may be. Registration must be effected annually and may be cancelled on the broker's application or if the broker or a director, employee or agent of the broker is convicted of an offence relating to insurance or an offence of dishonesty where the Commissioner is of the opinion that the offence renders the person unfit to carry on business as an insurance broker. Heavy penalties are prescribed for the carrying on of a broking business without registration or after suspension of registration. </PARA>
<PARA> It should be emphasised that the responsibility for registering insurance brokers is placed upon the existing statutory Insurance Commissioners and not upon a panel or other regulatory body comprising industry representatives. The Law Reform Commission considered the options fully and had no hesitation in recommending that an expert and disinterested body-namely the offices of the Life Insurance Commissioner and the Insurance Commissioner-should be responsible for the administration of the legislation, rather than members of a relatively small occupational group who might have a direct or indirect personal stake in the outcome of decisions as to registration or suspension (Law Reform Commission report paragraphs 124-127). Clause 32 of the Bill provides that the Commissioners' decisions are subject to review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill contains a number of specific provisions regulating the conduct of a broking business. First, a registered insurance broker must pay all moneys received by him on account of another person (whether premiums from an insured or claim moneys from an insurer) into a separate account to be called the 'insurance broking account' (clause 21). Unless the written consent of the relevant Commissioner is obtained, the only permitted withdrawals from this account are for payment to the person entitled to the money or for investment in prescribed securities. All moneys received by a broker on another person's account, and any securities in which such moneys are invested, are subject to a trust in favour of the person entitled to them. This is an important provision which will give a considerable degree of protection to those entitled to the moneys received and invested by a broker. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, a registered broker must comply with certain disclosure requirements. As soon as practicable after arranging a contract of insurance, the broker must give the insured and the insurer particulars in writing of any remuneration or other benefit received by the broker in relation to the contract and must inform the insured of the name and a place of business of the insured (clause 25). A broker must, before doing any business as agent for an insurer or under a binder, inform the intending insured that in effecting the contract of insurance he will be acting as agent of the insurer and not of the insured (clauses 25, 15 and 16). A registered broker is, furthermore, subject to the same penalties as an insurance agent for wilful deceptive conduct in relation to a contract of insurance or an insurance claim (clause 12). Finally, a registered insurance broker is prohibited from describing himself or his business in a way that would lead a person into believing that he was an insurer or mislead a person as to the nature of his insurance business (clause 23). </PARA>
<PARA> As regards financial regulation, the Bill provides for regulations to be made for the inspection or audit of the books, accounts and records kept by registered insurance brokers (clause 33). Clause 17 (1) (b) of the Bill makes it compulsory for an insurance broker to maintain with an approved insurer professional indemnity and fidelity guarantee insurance. Clause 27 complements clause 17 by providing that moneys paid to a broker under a professional indemnity insurance policy are not available on the insolvency or the winding-up of the broker for division among the creditors of the broker generally but must be paid to the person whose claim against the broker was subject to the indemnity. Clause 26 prohibits an insurance broker from receiving from an insurer any gift, gratuity, benefit or other reward except as remuneration for services in arranging an insurance contract or settling a claim. Similarly, an insurer is prohibited from paying remuneration to a broker at a rate which varies according to the number of contracts, the total amount of premium or the total sums insured. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill also clarifies the legal position as between insurers and brokers. It leaves essentially unchanged the common law principle that it is the insured, not the insurer, who is responsible for the conduct of a broker. This responsibility stems from the broker's role as agent of the insured and not the insurer. The Bill, however, makes two important statutory exceptions to this rule. First, by clause 13 (1) the Bill provides that the payment of a premium to a broker discharges the insured's liability to the insurer in respect of that premium. Conversely, the payment to a broker by an insurer of moneys intended for the insured does not discharge the insurer's responsibility to the insured in respect of those funds. The rationale for this statutory re-allocation of financial responsibility is that it is the insurer, not the insured, who agrees with the broker on credit terms and acquiesces in a broker's temporary treatment of premium or claims moneys as his own. Furthermore, it is the insurer, not the insured, who is in the better position to know the overall payment performance of a broker and to become aware of his impending insolvency. </PARA>
<PARA> The second exception to the rule that the broker is the agent of the insured is established by clause 14. This provision makes the insurer responsible for the conduct of a broker in doing business under a binder, that is, in circumstances where the broker has the authority to enter contracts of insurance on behalf of the insurer or to settle claims as agent for the insurer. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, clause 29 provides that neither an insurance broker, nor a director, employee or agent of an insurance broker shall be an insurer or a director or employee of an insurer. Conversely, no insurer or director or employee of an insurer may be an insurance broker or a director employee or agent of an insurance broker. </PARA>
<PARA> The Law Reform Commission deliberately chose to make no recommendation regarding penalties for offences under the proposed legislation. The penalties contained in this Bill are based on the penalties imposed for equivalent offences in the Companies Bill 1981, the Securities Industry Act 1980, and the Insurance Act 1973. The method adopted in the Companies Bill 1981, has, as far as possible, been followed, namely that a graded scale of penalties has been employed in order to ensure comparable penalties for similar offences. For the information of honourable senators, with the concurrence of the Senate I incorporate in Hansard a table setting out the scale of penalties in the Companies Bill 1981, and the offences to which each penalty applies. The offences set out in relation to the lowest penalties are by way of example only. </PARA>

<PARA> In commending this Bill most strongly to the Senate, I need hardly repeat that this legislation will meet an urgent need in the Australian community.

It is scandalous that insurance consumers should continue to be neglected by a government which is more concerned about tailoring its ideology to suit its resurgent back bench than about fulfilling its national responsibilities. I hope the Bill will be supported on all sides of the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The purpose of the Wool Industry Amendment Bill 1981 is to facilitate the rotation of the Market Support Fund which is a levy struck on wool growers of 5 per cent of sale proceeds which has been collected ever since 1974 and which has now accumulated to some $350m or $400m. Since there is no clear need for or justification for the indefinite additions to this Fund the amending Act of last year made provision for the payments to be returned to wool growers on a first-in, first-out basis as roughly a seven-year revolving fund, with payments made by growers in one year being withdrawn seven years later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When the original legislation was introduced by the Labor Government in 1974 the clear intention and the understanding-it was my understanding and I believe the understanding of everyone who took a serious interest in it at the time-were that the Fund would ultimately revolve, although no provision was made for that in the original legislation. The legislation of 1974 which first struck the levy was, of course, associated with the historic decision of the then Labor Government to guarantee and to fix a seasonal minimum reserve price, a policy which successive conservative governments over more than two decades had refused to implement but which I note with some satisfaction they have subsequently retained. </PARA>
<PARA> The amendments contained in the Bill before us primarily facilitate the operations of the rotation of that Fund and the disbursement in this financial year of some $46m to growers. However, the second amendment in the Bill requires disclosure of pecuniary interests by members of the Australian Wool Corporation in line with a recent and welcome Government policy of enforcing a higher degree of disclosure of pecuniary interest and possible conflict of interest upon members of statutory corporations. The only real regret the Opposition has about this is the Government's refusal to impose upon itself and its own members the standards which it imposes upon statutory authorities under its control. </PARA>
<PARA> The third provision is to increase by two the membership of the Australian Wool Testing Authority. I would like to make some comments about that. This legislation to add two members to the Australian Wool Testing Authority was introduced seven days after the razor gang decision to sell the Authority was announced. People not familiar with the method of operation of this Government might find that very hard to believe. It is in fact the epitome of policy-making on the run whereby one policy, this policy to increase by two the membership of the Australian Wool Testing Authority, was run over on the way to the starting blocks by the razor gang decision to abolish and sell the Wool Testing Authority. Most people would be amazed if that sort of thing happened in a banana republic, but in the banana republic of Malcolm Fraser it is such an everyday occurrence that it scarcely attracted any attention. The fact is that the legislation, according to the Government's declared policy intention, is obsolete before it is even introduced into the Parliament, let alone passed. The razor gang report said:</PARA>
<PARA> We propose to offer as a going concern . . . the Australian Wool Testing Laboratory and some Commonwealth equity in the Wool Stores. </PARA>
<PARA>Notwithstanding the characteristic obfuscation and prevarication from the Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Nixon, the intent clearly stated in the report was to sell the Wool Testing Authority. The implications of that go well beyond the fact that the Government has contradicted one of its own decisions even before the decision that was contradicted came into the Parliament. It contradicted a policy in advance. The Minister for Primary Industry was a member of the ministerial review committee. Was he not aware of the implications of that razor gang decision? Even allowing for the fact that the report in toto was little more than an exercise in political stunting hastily put together, this matter reveals more clearly than has ever been revealed previously the fundamental incompetence of the Minister for Primary Industry. He ought to be an object of ridicule. He has certainly been an object of hostility from the wool industry over the last few months. He ought to be an object of contempt and ridicule from the whole population. In fact I am tempted to believe that agriculture would be better off if the undertaker were still in charge of it. </PARA>
<PARA> The two proclaimed objectives of the razor gang report in toto, provided the cash was securely locked up, were, firstly, a reduction in government expenditure and, secondly, a desire to dispense with superfluous government functions and authorities. The amount of money saved, of course, was insignificant. The gross saving, according to the Government's estimates, is an amount of $560m over a period. That makes no allowance for the new cost which will be incurred by the transfer of a number of government responsibilities to the private sector. It may well be that the net savings to Government revenue, pursuant to the razor gang decisions, are negligible or even negative. </PARA>
<PARA> But if the Government was seriously interested in saving the taxpayers' money, why did it not look at some of these things: The Northern Territory railway getting $430m-it was known even before the decision was made that that railway could make no contribution whatsoever to its capital cost and that it is money down the drain; $220m for a new Parliament House; $80m for Casey University; $20m for the Prime Minister's 707s; $12m for the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting; $360m promised before the last election for various airport works; $120m in 1981 dollars for the Burdekin Dam; $2m for a Canberra racetrack, because the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) is a motor racing freak; $500,000 for that Liberal Party propaganda outfit called the Government Information Unit; and the unknown cost of a VIP trip to Armidale by the Prime Minister last Thursday to buy a bull! Of course, the so-called parliamentary security imposed within the last three years, which is probably costing about half a million dollars a year, is a manifestation of the Prime Minister's desire to live out his military command fantasies, a desire in which he was given an excuse to indulge after the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation planted that bomb in the rubbish bin outside the Hilton Hotel. </PARA>
<PARA> What is the common thread about all these major and minor, ridiculous and important, areas of government expenditure which were sacrosanct? What is the common thread? They are all Malcolm Fraser's pet projects. That is the common thread. Nothing to which the Prime Minister had given his personal support or about which he had a manic obsession-to borrow a phrase from one of his back benchers-was to be touched by this ministerial review committee. I have not even mentioned the host of irrational, inefficient tax dodges which he promised prior to the last election and about which we will be saying much more in the next couple of weeks, provided the Government does not use the guillotine in the Senate too severely. </PARA>
<PARA> I return to the Australian Wool Testing Authority. Bearing in mind that the proclaimed primary objective of the ministerial review committee was to cut government expenditure-even though it did not live up to that proclaimed objective-there was nothing to be gained financially by the Government by selling the Wool Testing Authority. No government money goes into the institution. It returned a profit of $1.2m in the last year which was paid to the Australian Wool Corporation, of which the Wool Testing Authority is effectively a branch. So there was no recurring cost to the Government in allowing the Authority to continue to operate in its present way. </PARA>
<PARA> It may have been misinformed that by selling the Authority, as the Government intends to sell a number of other capital items, it could have received a short term revenue boost. That does not apply in this case either because if the Authority is sold the proceeds will be paid into industry trust accounts which effectively will still be Wool Corporation money and not government money. That fact was brought out by the honourable member for Canning (Mr Bungey) on 13 May by way of question to the Minister for Primary Industry. Was the Minister for Primary Industry so fundamentally ignorant of the operations of his own Department that he did not realise that if the Authority was sold the Corporation, and not the Government, would receive the proceeds?</PARA>
<PARA> The second declared objective of the ministerial review committee was to dispense with superfluous government functions and responsibilities. It might have seemed superficially that the decision to dispose of the Wool Testing Authority at least met that objective. However, after the decision was announced it prompted some very hostile criticism from rather surprising political quarters. Probably the most significant criticism was that from Mr Ian McLachlan, who happens to be president of the Wool Council of Australia, who is also a long-standing director of Elder Smith-Goldsbrough Mort Ltd and who is, I would take for granted, a member of the Adelaide Club, certainly a member of the Adelaide establishment and a member of one of the old, Australian, pure merino grazing families. In other words, he is a pillar of the Adelaide establishment. In criticism of the Government, Mr McLachlan is reported in an article which states:</PARA>
<PARA> Private enterprise had a poor record in wool testing . . . </PARA>
<PARA> The private sector had been involved in the wool testing field three times in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> It had not only failed on each occasion, but also had threatened the quality and standards of objective measurement of the Australian Wool Clip, he said. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr McLachlan said the proposed sale of the Australian Wool Testing Authority appeared to be for 'purely cosmetic reasons' with the main advantage to Government being a reduction in public service staff numbers. </PARA>
<PARA>That article comes from the Weekly Times of 6 May 1981. That is a sample of the sort of criticism which the Government rightly received, not from members of the Labor Party or even from people who are associated with, sympathetic to or vote for the Labor Party, but from pillars of the agricultural establishment who are normally politically aligned with the governing parties. I repeat: Was the Minister for Primary Industry so fundamentally ignorant of the functions of his own Department and of the political realities of the agricultural sector that he was not aware of the implications of this decision? Of course, that sort of criticism very promptly provoked a backdown. The Minister was questioned again in the House on 14 May by Mr Falconer. He said that the Government had no intention 'simply to sell the Australian Wool Testing Authority to the highest bidder'. He added:</PARA>
<PARA> That body will be set up either as a wool testing house or as a foundation . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is a theme which he followed up in a Press statement issued the next day, 15 May. A few extracts from that statement include:</PARA>
<PARA> There will be no rush into selling the AWTA. In fact, the final decision on the sale of the Authority will be determined by the Minister for Primary Industry in conjunction with the Australian Wool Corporation. </PARA>
<PARA> The fundamental aim is to ensure that the AWTA continues to operate in precisely the same way as it does today. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government believes--</PARA>
<PARA>and this is crucial-</PARA>
<PARA>that this can best be achieved by the establishment of a special Foundation that will continue the present functions of the Authority. </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, having been finally made aware by Mr Falconer, Mr McLachlan and the honourable member for Canning, among others, of just what the razor gang had proposed to do the Minister, in order to extricate himself from the embarrassing position into which his own fundamental incompetence had thrust him, was committing the Government to establishing yet another foundation or statutory authority to administer the Australian Wool Testing Authority. That is a complete contradiction of the second proclaimed objective of the razor gang review. Government policy now is that an institution which had operated as a segment of the Australian Wool Corporation is be be hived off and another authority is to be established. Of course, it will not be called a statutory authority. For cosmetic reasons it will be called something else, but that is what it will be. The last sentence of that ministerial Press release states:</PARA>
<PARA> There is no inconsistency between the Government's plans for the future of the AWTA and the announcement in the Committee's report. </PARA>
<PARA>That is pure newspeak. One can only speculate whether comments such as that are a result of Mr Nixon's breathtaking audacity or his cerebral handicap. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion add ', but the Senate calls on the Government not to proceed with the sale of the Australian Wool Testing Authority as announced in the Review of Commonwealth Functions'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the Wool Industry Amendment Bill 1981. I note that amongst other things the previous speaker, Senator Walsh, indicated a measure of concern about the capacity and the work of the Minister for Primary Industry, Mr Nixon. My only comment is that in primary industry and indeed the community at large the Minister is held in the highest regard. I believe that his performance is stamping him yet again as one of the best performers in this Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I want to talk briefly about the Bill because it is a significant Bill. It brings into operation the determination of the industry and this Government that the Market Support Fund should start to revolve. The Bill provides the administrative arrangements necessary to bring about distributions from the Fund. It had long been responsibly determined that the Fund, which was the base for the real and effective operation of the Australian Wool Corporation in the market-place, should attain and be held at a sufficiently high level so that the Corporation could work in the market-place. Indeed it has worked in the market-place in a responsible and effective manner. I believe it is generally conceded that a figure of some $350m might be a proper figure for such a reserve. That amount, of course, has since been passed. The Fund stands significantly in excess of $400m. The time certainly is ripe for the revolving of the Fund to take place. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that in a debate such as this some comment should be made about the operation of the Australian Wool Corporation. The capacity of the Australian Wool Corporation to function is largely brought about by the existence of this Fund, amongst other things. The Fund has been in operation since September 1974. It has made a significant contribution to the wool industry in Australia. It has been significant both to the producer of wool and to the user. The producer has succeeded in reaching in the open market-place a price level which, in the main, is as high as humanly possible in all the circumstances. But more importantly, from the point of view of the producer and the user, it has succeeded in the objective of establishing a marketing system for wool which not only has relevance to the level of price but also, more importantly, has relevance to the stability of price. </PARA>
<PARA> This particular effect of the operation of the Corporation has been of great significance in building up a real measure of confidence in the user industry. Indeed, sometimes individuals in various areas of primary industry have been criticised for involvement in quite massive statutory marketing organisations. The suggestion is that such involvement relates, of course, to some form of socialisation. I think the comment should be made that the survival of the individual-indeed, primary industry in this country largely comprises individual enterprises-in the world in which we live, a world in which a great deal of government to government trading and authority to government trading takes place, is in no small measure determined by his ability, capacity and determination to be involved in a large operation in which he has a significant say in the marketing field. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the Market Support Fund was established in September 1974 with the purpose of being the basic operating fund for the Corporation in the market-place. Wool growers have contributed to the Fund through a 5 per cent deduction from gross wool receipts. A further 3 per cent is deducted for research and promotion and that amount is matched by the Government. I think a measure of congratulations should be offered to the industry itself. Over the years it has been able to support not only in a very real sense its research and promotion but also, in a total sense, its marketing procedures and methods. This industry has ridden the tides of problems in the economic world absolutely under its own steam. It has accepted the responsibility to operate by itself and for itself. The real implementation of this marketing system and indeed, many other changes in the wool industry was preluded by the introduction and finally, acceptance, of the scientific measurement and description of wool. These measures made the system which now operates and which is consistently being improved a real possibility. </PARA>
<PARA> The wool industry in Australia is virtually as old as the continent itself. It is an industry in which Australia produces the most and the best in the world. It is an industry which I believe has a significant place in the history, the character and the development of this country. It has contributed very significantly to both extensive and intensive grazing of Australian pastures. It has been significant in developing new systems of land utilisation and stock management. The wool industry has seen the introduction of an extensive range of chemicals and it has been involved with the introduction of many new and important pasture types. </PARA>
<PARA> The payments to be made in this revolving scheme are to be made on a first-in first-out basis. The controlling authority will be the Australian Wool Corporation. The brokers and registered agents will handle the actual detail. For the Fund to revolve a fairly complex set of administrative arrangements must be implemented. That, of course, is the basic object of the legislation before us today. Detailed work will remain the responsibility of registered persons, including wool brokers and wool merchants who are registered with the Commissioner of Taxation as collectors of levy or tax. If a registered person ceases to be registered-that of course can occur in some circumstances-then the Corporation has the responsibility of making the payments that are applicable. </PARA>
<PARA> The legislation defines the sale of wool as the point of receipt of proceeds for the wool involved. That clarifies a matter that may have caused confusion in the wool futures market and markets of that type. </PARA>
<PARA> I will not dwell on this legislation at great length. Perhaps a comment should be made about one or two of the matters raised by Senator Walsh. Sometimes in this sort of circumstance an emotional concept enters into the discussions which in reality has very little, if any, background. Senator Walsh devoted most of his time to the actual proposal to sell the AWTA. Of course, no one in this industry has anything but praise for the Australian Wool Testing Authority. It is certainly not the determination of the Government to sell this body in any unwitting or irresponsible way. It has been clearly demonstrated that this matter will be decided between the Australian Wool Corporation and the Minister. Indeed, so it should be. The Australian Wool Corporation-the industry-funds, runs and, indeed, in a real measure is responsible for the standards of, the Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Walsh was concerned that it could not be seen as a vast cutting exercise in government expenditure. Not everything that is to occur as a result of the razor gang exploit, as it has been described, will be a significant cutting of expenditure exercise. The whole work of this committee has brought a bit of reality to the philosophy of free enterprise. Indeed, it has to be seen to relate to the philosophy and purpose of free enterprise and to put responsibility referable to the States and other areas where it should be. This is a significant objective of the razor gang exercise. It is quite crazy to assume that the industry itself or the Government would allow any falling away of the standards of specification of wool under any system that may evolve from the present circumstance. If, for instance, wool testing becomes an area operated basically by private enterprise, that enterprise would be crazy to enable its testing to be found to be failing--</PARA>

That would be the absolute signature of its own doom. I do not believe that is the object of any enterprise. I hope it is not the object of any enterprise, government or private.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I just wish to make the point that the legislation provides the administrative capacity to put the revolving part of the fund into operation. It creates effectively a range of administrative procedures that will enable this to be done. So far as the wool testing authority is concerned, it has to be recognised that there is no mention of haste, no rushing into a sales situation. The decision has been made for reasons other than ones of pure cost saving. There is a determination to observe that whatever happens in this transfer, the Australian Wool Corporation and the Government will be in close co-operation, consultation and understanding. There can be no doubt that the objectives of this Government in relation to this industry relate to the permanence and development of one of the most basic industries in this country. I support the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to the Wool Industry Amendment Bill I will confine most of my remarks to the amendment which was moved by my colleague Senator Walsh. Before I commence my remarks I think the Senate ought to be reminded of the fact that Senator Scott, who preceded me in the debate, accused Senator Walsh of being somewhat emotional in his remarks. I think Senator Walsh had every right to portray some form of emotion. That form of emotion has been transmitted to honourable senators on this side of the chamber as well as to government senators by all of the wool growing organisations in Australia, which have been expressing their concern at the Government's decision to sell off the Australian Wool Testing Authority. I am surprised that Senator Scott, himself a wool grower, has accepted that decision so meekly. I am more surprised that no other members of the National Country Party or the Liberal Party, all of whom would have received the same communications that members of the Opposition have received, have not taken the opportunity today to support in the Senate the organisations which invariably support them. The Government has let them down, in my view.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It must also be recognised that it was the Australian Labor Party in government which introduced the reserve price scheme and set up the Australian Wool Corporation, which has put that industry on a very firm footing indeed. I speak with some experience on wool matters because my family earned its living from the wool industry from as far back as I can remember. My father was a shearer all his life and I followed in his footsteps. So I know something about the wool industry and what a great industry it is for this country. As I have said, I am surprised that Senator Scott has not taken a much stronger stand about the proposed sale. </PARA>
<PARA> I speak on this Bill on behalf of the or- ganisations which have approached me. As my colleague Senator Walsh pointed out, Mr McTaggart, the Chairman of the Wool Committee of the United Farmers and Stockowners of South Australia--</PARA>

<PARA> This association is strongly opposed to the intended sale of Australian Wool Testing Authority and wool stores. </PARA>
<PARA> By virtue of its complete independence AWTA has built up tremendous respect and confidence within the international wool trade which will be destroyed if it is taken over by private interests. </PARA>
<PARA>That is quite contrary to what Senator Scott has just said. The telex continued:</PARA>
<PARA>UFS has requested that enabling legislation only be considered after a full enquiry is instituted by Minister Nixon and seeks your support. </PARA>
<PARA>He has my full support and the full support of every member of the Opposition in that request, but obviously he does not have the support of the Government parties, which his people have supported over the years. I have also received a telegram from Mr O'Connell who is the President of the Wool Section of the Primary Industry Association in Western Australia. The telegram reads:</PARA>
<PARA>Request you to correct serious government error by opposing razor gang legislation to sell woolgrower owned wool stores and Australian Wool Testing Authority. </PARA>
<PARA>JDS OConnell President Wool Section PIA</PARA>
<PARA>There again we have protests. Senator Scott said that Minister Nixon will come to some agreement with the AWC over the proposed sale, but we find in a report in the Adelaide Advertiser of Saturday, 23 May, that the AWC opposes the wool body sale. That article appeared just a few day ago. The AWC is opposed to the sale. Yet we hear Senator Scott saying that Mr Nixon will consult with the AWC and that everything in the garden will be lovely. But, according to this report, it will not be, unless the AWC has changed its mind. On the weekend I had a visit from a wool growers' representative who lives at Karoonda in South Australia and who was very concerned about the situation. I refer to Mr Bill Murdoch, a very well respected man in the wool industry in the Murray Mallee of South Australia. He has told me some things which I have noted, and they are contrary to what Senator Scott said. He said that no-one would believe that a private testing authority would not do the right thing. But Mr Murdoch pointed out to me that three private enterprise attempts to supply the services now supplied by the AWTA failed during the last 10 years. Australian Wool Testing Services failed in 1976, Auscore failed in 1976 and Supervise-Auscore failed, I think, in 1974. So in Australia we have the experience of three private bodies failing. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not interested whether private bodies carry out this work in South Africa or New Zealand, as Senator Scott said. We are concerned with the Australian wool growers. Mr Murdoch told me that during this period AWTA met the stringent requirements of industry and increased its capacity accordingly. In New Zealand a similar authority performs 84 per cent of testing. That is quite contrary to what Senator Scott said. A government authority there carries out 84 per cent of the testing. In South Africa an independent state authority conducts all testing. Either Senator Scott or Mr Murdoch is not right. That needs checking out. An independent state authority in South Africa carries out all wool testing. </PARA>

In fact, the failures mentioned had an ingredient of questionable bias in their service and operations that cause failure, in Mr Murdoch's opinion. Mr Murdoch went on to list some of the other things which he is opposed to. Perhaps I will deal with them when we have more time to speak on the matters. I am under some stricture of time, which is very unfortunate when we are debating such an important Bill. My colleague, Senator Walsh, dealt mainly with the provisions of the Bill. I have said something about the protest, lodged with all Government and Opposition senators, against the sale of the Wool Testing Authority. I recommend to anybody to look in the House of Representatives Hansard of 14 May 1981 at the speech made by our spokesman on primary industry, John Kerin, in the other place. His speech is recorded on page 2454 of that Hansard. He dealt fully with matters relating to the industry. It is unfortunate that we in this Parliament do not have time to deal more fully with the Bill. I would have liked that but I am placed under some strictures. I wish to incorporate in Hansard the six pages of the text of Australian Wool Testing Authority Review of Operations-1979-80.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>AUSTRALIAN WOOL TESTING AUTHORITY</PARA>
<PARA>Review of Operations-1979-80</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>Statutory Functions and Powers</PARA>
<PARA> The Wool Industry Act 1972 preserved and continued in existence the Australian Wool Testing Authority as a body corporate, which operates within the scope of the Australian Wool Corporation's responsibilities. </PARA>
<PARA> Current statutory functions of the AWTA are described in Section 57 of that Act as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> ''(a) to carry out tests, by means of facilities provided, and equipment and materials supplied, by the Corporation, of wool and other fibres, whether natural or otherwise, and wool products and similar products made wholly or partly from other fibres; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) to issue certificates and make reports in respect of tests carried out by the Authority.''</PARA>
<PARA> In carrying out these functions the AWTA provides services to a number of key client groups, namely:</PARA>
<PARA> woolgrowers, brokers, auction and private buyers and merchant topmakers</PARA>
<PARA> wool scourers, carbonisers, fellmongers and combers</PARA>
<PARA> textile processors, manufacturers, retailers and importers</PARA>
<PARA> architects, builders and public purchasing institutions</PARA>
<PARA> Section 58 of the Wool Industry Act 1972 defines the Authority's powers to perform its functions as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> ''The Authority has power to do all things necessary or convenient to be done for or in connexion with, or as incidental to, the performance of its functions and, in particular, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, has power:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) to enter into agreements to carry out tests with persons desiring the tests;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) to advertise its services; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) to charge for its services such fees as it determines.''</PARA>
<PARA> In exercising these powers in relation to the establishment and management of its technical operations, the Authority has complete independence. However, the Act provides that the Corporation may issue directives to the Authority on other matters. In this regard, such direction has been minimal and then only related to major administrative policy issues. Consistent with the relevant Ministerial statements, both the Corporation and previously the Australian Wool Board have encouraged the Authority to manage its own affairs and to establish its own commercially oriented policies and strategies, to the benefit of the wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA>AWTA Objectives</PARA>
<PARA> In performing its functions, the AWTA's primary objectives are:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) to maintain a national and international reputation for technical expertise and commercial independence;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) to provide accurate, impartial and efficient testing services, as required by the wool industry and textile industry, at a minimum cost;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) to maximise nett income to the Australian woolgrowing industry, by encouraging the optimum application of objective measurement by woolgrowers, brokers, buyers and both local and overseas processors. </PARA>
<PARA> These objectives are completely consistent with the objectives of the Act, the expressed policies of the Corporation and the views of the wool industry sectors for whom services are provided. </PARA>
<PARA>AWTA Members and Executive Staff</PARA>
<PARA>As at 1st July 1979, the Membership of the Authority was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr L. J. Yeo-Chairman, Independent Member</PARA>
<PARA> Mr H. G. David-Representing the CSIRO</PARA>
<PARA> Mr A. N. Johnston-Independent Member</PARA>
<PARA> Mr J. A. McGregor-Representing the Australian Wool Corporation</PARA>
<PARA> Mr S. S. Nevile O.B.E.-Representing the Wool Textile Manufacturers of Australia</PARA>
<PARA> Mr F. G. Stuart-Representing the Wool Scourers, Carbonisers and Fellmongers' Association of Australia</PARA>
<PARA> Mr J. K. Westmore-Representing the Australian Council of Wool Buyers</PARA>
<PARA> Mr W. A. Williams M.B.E.-Representing the National Council of Wool Selling Brokers of Australia</PARA>
<PARA> With effect from 28th March 1980 Mr McGregor, who had been appointed as an AWTA Member on 14th February 1975, resigned his office due to pressure of other wool industry commitments, and was replaced as the Corporation's representative by Mr F. M. Davidson. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, following his retirement from service with CSIRO, Mr H. G. David resigned his office effective from 30th June 1980. He had served the Authority as a Member since 12th February 1976 and has been replaced as the CSIRO representative by Dr M. W. Andrews. </PARA>
<PARA> The executive staff of the Authority remained unchanged throughout 1979/80 and was as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Director-Mr D. J. Ward B.Sc. (Hons.), M.A.I.A.S. </PARA>
<PARA> Deputy Director-Mr S. A. S. Douglas M.Sc. </PARA>
<PARA> Assistant Director-Dr P. D. Morgan B.Sc., M.Sc. (Agric.), Ph.D., M.A.I.A.S. </PARA>
<PARA>Raw Wool Testing Activity</PARA>
<PARA> For the fourteenth consecutive year, the AWTA has exceeded the previous year's record total number of bales core-sampled for testing. </PARA>
<PARA> The new record achieved in 1979-80 was 4,030,458 bales, which represented an increase of 10.2 per cent over the previous year. </PARA>
<PARA> Within this overall growth trend, there were a number of significant and compensating changes in levels of activity. In particular:</PARA>
<PARA> Presale Certificate sampling increased by 12.3 per cent to new record 3,443,024 bales;</PARA>
<PARA> Post Sale Certificate sampling decreased by 16.6 per cent to 264,523 bales;</PARA>
<PARA> Conditioning Certificate sampling increased by 14.1 per cent to 266,897 bales;</PARA>
<PARA> Futures Certificate sampling decreased by 67.9 per cent to 677 bales only;</PARA>
<PARA> Guidance Report sampling decreased by 64.4 per cent to 4,794 bales; and</PARA>
<PARA> Sundry sampling, for a variety of special testing requirements, increased by 109.9 per cent to 50,543 bales. </PARA>
<PARA> As reported in previous years, the continuing growth of Presale Certificate testing activity has been the key factor causing those decreases in activity which have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA>Presale Certificate Testing</PARA>
<PARA> During 1979-80, Presale Certificate testing was by far the most significant activity conducted by the AWTA. Whilst woolgrowers are the major users of this service, it is also being used extensively by private treaty wool merchants, who re-offer their purchases to the wool buying trade on a sale-by-sample basis. </PARA>
<PARA> It is now recognised that substantial price differentials exist between tested and untested wools and that these more than offset the cost of testing small lots. Consequently, there has been an increase in the testing of 1, 2 and 3-bale lots, which is illustrated by the overall reduction in the average lot size of bales tested prior to sale, as the percentage of the clip tested has increased. </PARA>
<PARA> Trends over the past four selling seasons are tabulated below:</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>First-hand Average Selling</PARA>
<PARA>auction bales presale test season</PARA>
<PARA>presale tested lot size</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>Per cent Bales 1976-77  62 10.6 1977-78  77 10.3 1978-79  86 10.1 1979-80  93 9.5</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The rapid development of this service since the early 1970's has been due, in particular, to the growing recognition within the wool industry that significant financial benefits were available to all sectors of the wool handling and marketing chain, arising from the flexibility generated by introducing large-scale objective measurement into the primary selling system.</PARA>
<PARA>Testing for Wool Buyers</PARA>
<PARA> The continuing growth of Presale Certificate testing has diminished the level of testing for wool buyers, after sale. </PARA>
<PARA> Post Sale Certificate testing is now limited, almost entirely, to those bales sold traditionally by the woolgrower, since the buyer of a Presale Certificate tested lot automatically receives the relevant Certificate for use in his subsequent sales transaction. </PARA>
<PARA> Futures Certificate testing has reduced to levels which are practically insignificant, following the decision by the Sydney Exchange to accept Presale Certificates. </PARA>
<PARA> With most auction wools tested prior to sale, buyers now have a reduced demand for Guidance sampling. However, the Authority has noted an increased level of testing in this area, particularly with respect to samples drawn from non-auction wools and submitted by clients for testing. </PARA>
<PARA>Condition Testing of Scoured and Carbonised Wool</PARA>
<PARA> The testing of scoured and carbonised wools for regain/ moisture content and the issue of Conditioning Certificates was the principal activity conducted by the Authority from the time of its establishment in 1957 until 1963-64, when the sampling of greasy wool for wool buyers accounted for more bales. </PARA>
<PARA> During 1979-80, the total activity in this area was an all-time record, with 266,897 bales being sampled for certification. This surpassed the previous record total established in 1971-72 and placed Conditioning Certificate testing second only to Presale Certificate testing, in terms of bales sampled.</PARA>
<PARA>Textile Testing Activity</PARA>
<PARA> As reported in previous years, the AWTA Textile Testing Division has been active in endeavouring to encourage a broadly based clientele for the wide range of services available. Prior to 1977-78 its principal client, the Australian Wool Corporation, accounted for more than half of its total revenue. </PARA>
<PARA> Since that time, the number of industry testing clients has steadily increased and now includes local manufacturers, importers, retailers, architects, public purchasing agencies, hospitals, government departments, building companies and the general public. As a result, industry clients accounted for 61 per cent of total revenue during 1979-80. </PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, testing for the Corporation continues to be very important. It includes the check testing of imported wool packs, routine quality control testing associated with the maintenance of Woolmark and Woolblendmark standards and other testing associated with the Corporation's technical and promotion activities within the wool textile industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The continuing growth experienced throughout the year is considered to reflect an increasing awareness of the value of textile specification and quality assurance testing as consumer protection demands increase. </PARA>
<PARA>AWTA Technical Status</PARA>
<PARA> Throughout 1979-80, the AWTA's technical status continued to be ratified by independent external authorities, both nationally and internationally. On the basis of rigorous inspection of facilities and operating procedures and/or following successful participation in inter-laboratory testing trials, the Authority continued to be:</PARA>
<PARA> listed as a Public Conditioning House, by the International Wool Textile Organisation (I.W.T.O.);</PARA>
<PARA> recognised as a calibrated Member of the Airflow and Projection Microscope sections of the International Association of Wool Textile Laboratories (Interwoollabs);</PARA>
<PARA> registered for raw wool testing by the Australian Wool Measurement Standards Authority (A.W.M.S.A.), which is controlled by the Department of Primary Industry; and</PARA>
<PARA> registered for Heat and Temperature Measurement and for Physical and as Textiles, by the National Association of Testing Authorities (N.A.T.A.). </PARA>
<PARA> In addition, the new interlaboratory testing and inspection scheme, initiated by the Authority and now involving the eight major, independent laboratories throughout the world, was re-endorsed by the I.W.T.O. and has enabled Interwoollabs to withdraw from activities in this area. </PARA>
<PARA>Performance Monitoring</PARA>
<PARA> In common with other service organisations operating in the Australian wool industry, the Authority's raw wool testing activities are influenced by the fluctuations in wool receivals and the peaking nature of shearing patterns. To maintain its service commitments to its clients, to reduce the service time from sampling to issue of test results and to control operating costs, it is essential for the Authority to monitor its performance via computerised systems. </PARA>
<PARA> During the year, the average service times for all services were reduced and, regardless of sale cataloguing deadlines even at the peak work-load period, in the presale testing area not one single test out of some 362,000 exceeded the maximum service time limit of ten days. </PARA>
<PARA> Further significant improvements are expected in service, production and quality control, following the current upgrading of the Authority's computerised systems, which was commenced in June 1980. </PARA>
<PARA>Fees for Major Services</PARA>
<PARA> The sampling and testing fees charged by the AWTA for its major raw wool and textile testing services were not altered, as compared with the previous year. With regard to these major activities:</PARA>
<PARA> Presale Certificate services fees have remained unchanged since November 1975, when an average charge reduction of 8 per cent was introduced;</PARA>
<PARA> Post Sale Certificate service fees have remained unchanged since July 1975, when a minor charge increase averaging 0.7 per cent was applied;</PARA>
<PARA> charges for all significant textile testing services have remained unchanged since July 1977; and</PARA>
<PARA> Conditioning Certificate fees were last increased in July 1978, after being held constant for the previous three years. </PARA>
<PARA>Financial Results</PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with the Wool Industry Act 1972, the ultimate legal responsibility for funding the AWTA rests with the Corporation. However, the Corporation has adopted the pragmatic and commercially realistic policy of requiring the Authority to be accountable for its own viability and to manage its own affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> As a result, the Authority aims to operate as a stable, commercially self-supporting organisation by ensuring that its profitability is sufficient to meet the full costs of its activities and to also provide funds to cover its essential capital expenditure and working capital requirements. </PARA>
<PARA> A detailed management accounting system has been developed to monitor financial performance and to ensure that key managerial staff have timely and factual data to assist in their operation decision-making. </PARA>
<PARA> Members of the Authority receive financial reports monthly, including sales reports by major activity, expenditure reports by cost centre and managerial location, a profit and loss statement and a monthly balance sheet. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1979-80 financial results are summarised in the Revenue Statement tabulated on page 6. For comparison purposes, the previous year's results are also shown. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. I repeat that I am very disappointed that Government senators have not come forward today to support the organisations in their protest against the Government's decision to sell the Wool Testing Authority. I thought that they would have been here in their numbers doing that, but they have to answer to the organisations and individuals that have supported them over the years. If they carry on in this fashion regarding other matters dealing with primary industry they can look forward to losing a lot of support from country areas at the next election. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. The Labor Party in government always did its best to look after the wool industry. We introduced the legislation. I do not think that any primary producer could ever quibble about what we did to assist the industry. I support the amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate for its general support of the Wool Industry Amendment Bill 1981 which we are debating today. It has been interesting to listen to the three speakers, each of whom obviously knows a lot about primary industry areas, demonstrating some depth of knowledge about this Bill. Firstly I advert to the comments of my colleague, Senator Scott. His explanation of the intentions of the Bill was most clear and states the Government's position, I think, with great clarity and fairness. These intentions are directed primarily to the revolving of the wool market support fund. In this respect I find no objection by the Opposition to the amendment proposed to the principal Act. Most of the discussion in the Senate has been related to other matters to which honourable senators have addressed themselves and about which the amendment which has been proposed is concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government is unable to accept the amendment which has been put forward. The decisions made by the Review of Commonwealth Functions were made with care and are regarded as a package. The Government would not want to move from those decisions. The only relevance of the Bill before us to the Australian Wool Testing Authority is the fact that the Bill will enlarge membership of the board of the AWTA. The rationale for increasing the board membership has already been mentioned in the second reading speech. I will not go over that ground again. I think that speakers have referred to it. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to hold the Senate up unduly, but I will comment on one point raised by Senator McLaren simply as a matter of historical fact. Senator McLaren was not entirely wrong in what he said, but he was not entirely right when he talked about the history of the Australian Wool Corporation and when it was established. The fact is that the Wool Corporation was established under the Wool Industry Act of the previous coalition Government. Assent was given to it on 31 October 1972. That is a fact of history. The Bill was set to come into operation on the date on which it was proclaimed. It was proclaimed on 1 January 1973. Senator McLaren made a point that it was an action of the Labor Government. The fact is that the Bill was passed under the coalition Government, but it was proclaimed under the Labor Government. It is really just a debating point to claim that one or other side of the Parliament should claim greater merit in this matter. Similarly, there were questions regarding the floor price arrangements but I will not go into those matters and hold up the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> However, there is one matter to which I must address myself in passing. It is not related to the Bill; it relates to the speech made by Senator Walsh. He asserted by way of an aside that the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation had placed the bomb at the Hilton Hotel. Senator Walsh is not just any member of parliament; he is a front bench member of the Australian Labor Party. One presumes that when he makes that kind of statement he does so on behalf of the Australian Labor Party. I put it on public record that if Senator Walsh says that ASIO placed the bomb that went off at the Hilton then, unless the Australian Labor Party wishes to dissociate itself from what Senator Walsh said, we will take it that that is the view of the Labor Party, expressed--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Walsh" NAMEID="TJ4">

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ME4">Senator PETER BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Walsh might be asked why he included it in his speech on the Bill. We have a situation in which the Australian Labor Party has asserted, what I regard as a dreadful thing; that ASIO placed the bomb that went off at the Hilton. I think that that was a most inappropriate thing to say. If that is the view of the Australian Labor Party, let the party endorse it. If it is not the view of the Australian Labor Party, or if it was a mistake and Senator Walsh did not mean to say it, then he should get up and make that assertion. As I have said, we are not able to accept the amendment. I thank honourable senators for the way in which the Bill has been supported.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; In view of the severe time constraints which the Government has imposed on the House of review, to do its reviewing over the next couple of weeks, during which time it will manage to review about four times as much legislation as it reviewed in the previous few months, my remarks on these Bills will be very brief. For reasons which I will explain, the Opposition is opposed to clause 28 of the Customs Amendment Bill 1981 and is entirely opposed to the Excise Amendment Bill 1981. If any one wants more detail on the Opposition's view on this matter, I refer them to the speech by the shadow Minister, Mr John Brown, in the House of Representatives on 26 May at page 2625 of Hansard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The major Bill has four provisions. The first two provisions relate to the clarification of powers following investigations and recommendations by the Williams Australian Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drugs. The third provision deals with illegally imported vessels seized by Customs officers. The fourth provision, which is common to clause 28 of the Customs Bill and to the entire Excise Amendment Bill, extends from six months to 12 months the period for which customs and excise proposals may remain valid without parliamentary legislative authorisation. For that reason the Opposition will oppose clause 28 of the first Bill and the second Bill in its entirety. However, I think I should put on the record that although we divided on these matters in the House of Representatives, it is quite clear that no Government senators are willing to support the Opposition on this matter. Again, because of time constraints there seems to be no point in dividing on the matter, so the opposition will be on the voices only. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This debate, which represents the last parliamentary stage in the passage of a new national companies Act, ought to be a great parliamentary occasion. It is, after all, the culmination of 22 years of endeavour which began right back in 1959 to bring the company law framework into a single national, coherent shape, but we regret that the occasion is nothing of the kind. The Companies Bill-the huge document which is the centrepiece of the present package of Bills-is a profound disappointment. It represents a sad tale of reforming opportunities forgone. With only minor exceptions, it represents no more than the lowest common denominator of the existing State company laws.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Again, the whole scheme of which this Bill and other Bills in the package are a part, this exercise in so-called co-operative federalism, is itself a disappointment-necessarily, because of its very nature, a thing of shreds and patches. It is a structure which has no guarantee whatever of permanence, a structure which, despite the laboriousness with which it has been erected over the last few years, is likely to collapse like a house of cards with the first puff of State chauvinist wind that emerges in this area. However, the attitude of the Opposition to the Companies Bill and to the other nine Bills in the package before us is not one of straight-out opposition. We do acknowledge that any step at all in the direction of a national companies law, however small and wobbly it might be, cannot but represent an improvement upon the present situation. Nonetheless, we do have very profound reservations about the Bill, both in principle and as to matters of detail. </PARA>
<PARA> The nature of our reservations is best summarised in the lengthy second reading amendment which has been circulated, and the terms of which I will return to in a moment. Accordingly, I move:</PARA>
<PARA> At end of motion, add ', but the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Expresses its concern-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) at the Government's abdication of its responsibility to make national laws for companies and securities pursuant to the Commonwealth's own constitutional powers, and in accordance with the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange in 1974-the Rae report,</PARA>
<PARA> (b) at the lack of effective accountability of the National Companies and Securities Commission to either the Government or Parliament of the Commonwealth, or to any other single elected Government or Parliament, and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) that despite the inordinate delay in introducing the legislation, the Parliament of the Commonwealth has not been given an opportunity effectively to scrutinise this Bill and associated Bills and will not be able effectively to determine company law in the future under the Co-operative Companies and Securities Scheme;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Calls upon the Government in the event of the breakdown for any reason of the scheme, of which the Bill is a part, immediately to proceed to the introduction of Commonwealth legislation for the national regulation of companies;</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Notes that this Bill places uniformity before reform in deference to powerful vested interest groups and represents a retreat to the lowest common denominator standard of company law;</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Calls upon the Government to expedite the establishment of an Accounting Standards Review Board; and</PARA>
<PARA> (5) Calls upon the Government immediately to pursue a fundamental reform of company law, including:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the abolition of the category of 'exempt proprietary company' and the privileges associated with it,</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the provision of statutory directions and powers to the National Companies and Securities Commission and the courts to look behind the corporate entity in appropriate circumstances, to ascertain those who control it or hold shares in it, and, having regard to the purpose of the creation of the corporate entity and the manner of its control, to affix personal liability and adjudicate personal rights where it is just and equitable to do so,</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the extension of the powers of inspection of the National Companies and Securities Commission to ensure the fullest reasonable access of the Commission to books,</PARA>
<PARA> (d) the amendment of any provision which enables questionable practices to be hidden by means of legal professional privilege,</PARA>
<PARA> (e) the requirement for all companies to raise and maintain a prescribed minimum nominal and paid up capital,</PARA>
<PARA> (f) rationalisation of the cumbersome provisions in respect of company names on the basis of single nation-wide registration,</PARA>
<PARA> (g) a requirement that dividends be paid only from the genuine profits of a company,</PARA>
<PARA> (h) full review of the provisions relating to fund raising and prospectuses to ensure maximum disclosure and to require independent valuation of assets exchanged for issued shares,</PARA>
<PARA> (i) reform of the provisions relating to companies financing dealings in their own shares, including the removal of the exemption given to financial assistance to salaried directors,</PARA>
<PARA> (j) provision for a higher required standard of competence, care and diligence for directors and officers of companies,</PARA>
<PARA> (k) a requirement that more frequent accounts be lodged by companies listed on the Stock Exchanges,</PARA>
<PARA> (l) in order to protect creditors and to assist the prevention of tax avoidance, the imposition of stringent disclosure requirements upon companies acting as trustees of trading trusts, in relation to their capacity as trustees and the accounts of the relevant trusts, and the imposition of heavy penalties for non-compliance. </PARA>
<PARA> (m) full disclosure to the public of the beneficial ownership of all shares in companies,</PARA>
<PARA> (n) published accounts to include full details of each director's and officer's remuneration and right of inspection for employees and shareholders of director's service contracts,</PARA>
<PARA> (o) adequate remedies for oppressive conduct, including extension of the concept of oppression to single and anticipated acts unfairly prejudicial to a shareholder, and provision of further means such as a 'Shareholders' Tribunal' to protect the interests of minority shareholders, and</PARA>
<PARA> (p) complete reform of the winding up provisions, including greater protection for unsecured creditors, following a reference on insolvency to the Australian Law Reform Commission'. </PARA>
<PARA>The Bills come to us after an unusually lengthy debate in the House of Representatives. There has been in that chamber a full second reading debate and, what is very unusual indeed, nearly four hours of Committee debate. During the Committee stage a number of substantial contributions were put on record by Opposition spokesmen, especially Mr John Brown, the honourable member for Parramatta and shadow Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, and Mr Ralph Jacobi, the honourable member for Hawker, who has long had a passionate and very knowledgeable interest in this area of the law. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the length of that Committee stage debate, because of its complexity and effectiveness, the Opposition does not propose today to embark on a lengthy Committee stage debate in this chamber. To do so would be simply to repeat a good deal of material that has already been put on the record. However, I do propose to spend a little more time on my speech in the second reading debate than might otherwise have been the case, in our presently constrained procedural circumstances, to inform the Senate of the Opposition's attitude to this legislation, which after all is one of the most important legislative packages that could come before any parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition has many problems with these Bills, but our main concerns operate at three different levels. In the first place, the legislation amounts to an abdication of Commonwealth responsibility in a field which it ought to be occupying in its own right. Secondly, it is our position, which later I will spell out in some detail, that a co-operative scheme of the kind that is in issue here is simply not a satisfactory substitute for overriding Commonwealth legislation. There are too many inherent weaknesses in this kind of so-called co-operative arrangement. Our third level of concern is in regard to the specific terms of the Companies Bill, which are quite profoundly disappointing from a law reform point of view. </PARA>
<PARA> I will now discuss each of these matters in turn. I begin with the question of the abdication of Commonwealth responsibility which clearly seems to be involved in the approach taken by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA>Sitting suspended from 1 to 2.15 p.m. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point I was making before we broke for lunch was that the scheme of which the present Bills are a part represents an abdication of the responsibility the Commonwealth has to exercise national leadership by passing national laws in an area manifestly crying out for them. The Bills we are passing today and the Bills which have preceded them in the development of this co-operative national companies and securities law scheme are being passed by the Commonwealth Parliament, of course, but they do not, in themselves, have any national application. All the Bills which we have been passing and those which are before us today apply only to the Australian Capital Territory and they are passed in reliance only upon the Commonwealth's constitutional power to legislate with respect to its own territories under section 122 of the Constitution. The application to the rest of the country, which is the intention, depends on all individual States passing their own legislation to pick up and apply the model Australian Capital Territory Bill in their respective jurisdictions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Opposition believes that the Commonwealth should pass its own legislation in this area. The points in issue were developed at considerable length by me in previous speeches on 19 November 1979 and 26 February 1981. I do not stop to repeat them in detail here. I simply make the following points: In the first place there is an unquestioned need for effective and uniform national legislation and the document that most forcefully established that need was the report of the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange-the Rae Committee-which was tabled in this Parliament in 1974. Secondly, the States have amply demonstrated that they cannot be relied upon to maintain uniformity of approach in complex regulatory areas like this if they are left to their own co-operative devices. The whole history of the uniform companies Acts in 1961 is ample testimony to that. The third point I make is that the Commonwealth has sufficient constitutional power, in my belief, to go it alone. </PARA>
<PARA> The last point is the one that is most often contested, but it is one in which I for one, for what it is worth, have always had a good deal of professional confidence. I believe that the High Court, when it is put to the test, will continue to give expansive readings to the corporation power of section 51 placitum (xx.) which initially came of age in the 1970 concrete pipes case. I am well aware that the consitutional reference in section 51 placitum (xx.) is not to corporations generally but rather to particular classes thereof, namely, trading, financial and foreign corporations. I am equally well aware that judicial dicta in the early cases sought to make a distinction between those categories of corporations and others including mining and manufacturing corporations. I still contend that the trend of interpretation in the few cases to touch this issue since 1970 gives one considerable ground for optimism. I refer especially to the Western Australian football league case decided by the High Court in 1979 and also to two recent Federal Court decisions in which Mr Justice Brennan, now Sir Gerard Brennan of the High Court, participated. I refer to the Ku-ring-gai Co-operative Building Societies case and the State Superannuation Board of Victoria case in 1980. Again, I am well aware that there was an argument in the early years of this century, based on an extraordinarily narrow grammatical reading of the relevant text, that Commonwealth law can constitutionally bite upon companies only once they have been formed and that Commonwealth law cannot constitutionally extend to company law of the familiar kind governing the creation of companies in the first place. Again, without going into the relevant complex legal argument I believe there is good reason to suppose that the early interpretation is much too narrow. </PARA>
<PARA> I also make the point on this constitutional question that there is a strong case for an exercise of venturesome approaches by the Commonwealth when this kind of need for strong national legislation is in issue. This point has been acknowledged from time to time by both sides of the political spectrum. It certainly has not been acknowledged by the present Attorney-General (Senator Durack), although I must confess that with the amendment he is proposing today to the Acts Interpretation Act there seems to be a whole new spirit of adventure abroad in the breast of the Attorney. I am thinking more particularly and immediately of some comments made by a distinguished former Attorney-General on the Government side. I refer to Mr Ellicott who, when speaking in 1974 in support of the Whitlam Government's National Parks and Wildlife Conservation Bill, made the following remarks:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . uncertainty as to the extent of constitutional power should never of itself be a reason for opposing an otherwise worthwhile legislative exercise of power;</PARA>
<PARA>nor should it prevent a government, properly advised, treading where angels of constitutional probity have formerly feared to tread. The High Court, as we know, will readily give us the answer-</PARA>
<PARA>I repeat that Mr Ellicott made those remarks in 1974. I certainly make the point that this Government has never demonstrated any great constitutional timidity when it has wanted to enact draconian legislation of a union-bashing kind. I refer in particular to the 1979 amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act which involved a degree of constitutional adventure under the heading of section 51 placitum (xxxv.) of the Constitution. I also refer to the exercise in the introduction of section 45D of the Trade Practices Act which involved a reliance on section 51 placitum (xx.) which is in issue here. It went rather beyond anything that had previously been given judicial seals of approval. </PARA>
<PARA> When it suits the Government's purpose there has never been any question of timidity or caution on the constititional front. I suggest that there is ample foundation in the law as it stands and as it might be expected to develop over the next few years on which the Commonwealth could proceed should it be minded to do so to enact its own national companies and securities law. It was, of course, the attitude of the Australian Labor Party when in office to support such national legislation generated unilaterally by the Commonwealth, and it remains our attitude that that is the only way we can expect ever to get enacted not only national or uniform companies and securities legislation but the kind of strong reforming legislation that is so obviously necessary in this particular area. </PARA>
<PARA> The point I have been making about the abdication of the constitutional responsibility of the Commonwealth is much reinforced when one considers the second level of the Oppositions concern to which I now turn, and that is the proposition that the co-operative scheme is simply not a satisfactory alternative to the unilateral exercise of the Commonwealth's own constitutional power. There are two basic reasons for that. The first of them is the accountability problem, and that is a real problem, an endemic problem, in any exercise in co-operative federalism. The criticism about the lack of accountability necessarily involved in co-operative schemes has never been satisfactorily answered by the proponents of co-operative schemes. </PARA>
<PARA> I suggest that the great Australian sport in this Federation is not cricket, league football or even Australian rules; it is the sport of passing the buck. That is the inextricable essence of federal systems and it is the inextricable concomitant of co-operative schemes of the kind that are in issue here. A scheme of this kind where no single government is obliged to accept or does accept responsibility for anything the governing organs like the National Companies and Securities Commission do and where no single government does accept or is obliged to accept responsibility for the inadequacy of the law, if the inadequacy is demonstrated in any case, is a classic situation of a vacuum which just will not be filled by anyone. That is the basic problem inherent in schemes of this kind. It is even more obviously a problem in this area because the very point in issue is made in the text of the Maroochydore agreement which itself underlies the whole co-operative scheme. I refer, as I have in the past, to paragraph 38 (1) of that agreement which states in so many words that the policy direction and general control over the administration-that is, over the new body on companies and securities law-shall be exercised to the exclusion of ministerial direction and control by the responsible Minister of the Commonwealth or of the State. That is how extreme the situation is in terms of abdication of responsibility and of accountability in any graspable form. That will be a continuing problem as long as this co-operative scheme is sustained. </PARA>
<PARA> The other problem inherently bound up with this kind of arrangement, whether it deals with companies and securities law or with anything else, is the problem of inertia and lowest common denominator solutions to complex problems. The inevitable result of this kind of co-operative scheme is lowest common denominator compromises. Legislation emerges which is no stronger than the weakest government in the participating scheme is willing to accept. Legislation emerges which is no more progressive than the most reactionary government in the collection of those participating is prepared to accept. That will become clear in a moment when we turn to look at the nature of the actual reforms, if they can be so described, which are accomplished in this legislation. However, the point is usually made about this co-operative scheme that the sort of comment is only true, if it is true at all, in respect of the initial legislation where unanimity is required and that that situation will change and can be expected to change in the future when the only requirement is that of a majority decision. </PARA>
<PARA> But I put to you, Mr President, very strenuously the point that was very cogently put, as always, by my learned friend and colleague Mr Jacobi, the honourable member for Hawker, when he spoke on this matter in the lower House. The point is that it remains the case that the States participate and will continue to participate in this co-operative scheme on a voluntary basis-they are not obliged, legally or in any other way, to remain in it-and that for any State to threaten to leave the scheme will wreck its whole underlying concept. When we put those two propositions together, exactly the same dynamic will apply in the future, sustained this time not by the requirement of formal legal unanimity but by the familiar federal politics of blackmail. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the third level of concern which the Opposition wishes to express about these Bills and, in particular, about the monster Companies Bill now in front of us; that is, the inadequacies of the present legislation, looked at in its own terms. It is manifestly the case that the present Companies Bill is not a reforming piece of legislation. Indeed, so much was admitted, one might almost say with refreshing candour, by the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, Mr Moore, writing in the Australian Financial Review on 26 May when he said that in so many words. Such timid measures as were introduced in the first-exposure draft Bill early last year have subsequently and inexorably been whittled away, first of all in the August 1980 draft and now again in the completed 1981 Bill before us. </PARA>
<PARA> The only changes of any significance at all in the body of Australian company law that are accomplished by this Bill are, firstly, the one place of registration concept, which is important because it enables companies to avoid the multiple filing which has plagued the practical administration of company business for so many decades in this country; secondly, the substantial systematisation of penalties which has been long overdue in this legislative area; thirdly, some reforms, not very earth shattering but reforms nonetheless, in the law on pre-incorporation contracts; fourthly, some undoubted improvements in the law with respect to companies dealing with their own shares; and, finally, some provisions of a significant kind concerning the registration of priority of charges. But that is not much for a Bill of 532 pages and with 581 clauses, excluding the Schedules, because an enormous number of things that might have been done have not in fact been done. </PARA>
<PARA> A good selection, by no means intended to be exhaustive, of the sorts of things which might have been done but which were not done is set out in the Opposition's amendment to the motion for the second reading of the Companies Bill. I propose to spend just a few minutes drawing the Senate's attention to the particular matters with which we are concerned. They are matters which we regard as crucially necessary if any serious exercise in the fundamental reform of company law is to be involved in legislation of this kind. The first matter we refer to as requiring immediate legislative attention-it is dealt with in paragraph (5) (A) of the amendment-is the abolition of the category of 'exempt proprietary company' and the privileges associated with that category. Exempt proprietary companies are defined in clause 5 of the Bill as basically those companies in which there is no direct or indirect share ownership by a public company. A number of advantages flow from being an exempt proprietary company. They are set out variously in clauses 230, 263, 264, 277, 278, 279, 282 and 417 of the Bill. In essence they involve the advantage that an exempt proprietary company need not appoint an auditor and need not file a copy of its accounts along with its annual returns as long as it operates as an unlimited company or has the accounts audited. There are advantages, and an unhappy situation is associated with them because they mean that those potential creditors who may wish to trade with the company in question, if it is exempt, have no automatic right of access to the kind of information that would enable them to judge the company's financial viability. The Opposition takes the point very strenuously, and made it very strenuously in the other place, that the price of limited liability, if limited liability is to be retained in our company law-I will come to that in a moment-must be financial disclosure. Paragraph (5) (B) of the amendment refers to the need to reform the law by:</PARA>
<PARA> The provision of statutory directions and powers to the national companies and Securities Commission and the courts to look behind the corporate entity in appropriate circumstances, to ascertain those who control it or hold shares in it, and, having regard to the purpose of the creation of the corporate entity and the manner of its control, to affix personal liability and adjudicate personal rights where it is just and equitable to do so. </PARA>
<PARA>That paragraph deals essentially with the subject matter of lifting the corporate veil. The context in which the suggestion is advanced is, of course, the misuse of corporate personality in the shape of what are generically known as two dollar companies. The offices of the Corporate Affairs Commissions, as we well know, are littered with a number of two dollar companies that have crashed to the detriment of employees, creditors and shareholders; and something ought to have been done about that. </PARA>
<PARA> Paragraph (5) (C) of the amendment refers to the desirability of extending the powers of inspection of the National Companies and Securities Commission to ensure the fullest reasonable access of the Commission to books, a matter dealt with in clause 12 but in our view dealt with insufficiently. Again the context in which that is made is set out more fully in the Committee stage debate in the other place. Paragraph (5) (D) of the amendment refers to the desirability of there being the amendment of any provision which enables questionable practices to be hidden by means of legal professional privilege'. The reference there is to clause 16 of the Bill. The particular point being made there is the notion, not altogether unknown regrettably in my profession, that questionable transactions can from time to time be channelled through unethical lawyers, securing in the process the protection of legal privilege. If the basic and correct principles governing privilege are to be maintained, obviously the draft of any such approach to this problem needs to be tackled very carefully. Nonetheless, it is a problem to which we draw attention. Paragraph (E) of the amendment refers to a suggested:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . requirement for all companies to raise and maintain a prescribed minimum nominal and paid up capital,</PARA>
<PARA>This is a crucially important amendment and, again, it is one of those right at the heart and soul of the Opposition's concern about this Bill. The situation is, under present company law as it applies in Australia, that one can have paid up capital for a private company of as little as 2c and, in the case of a public company, of as little as 5c. That can be the total paid up capital which is accessible to creditors in the event of a company collapse. It is a bizarre situation and not one that is repeated elsewhere. It follows in Australia from the absence of any explicit legislative minimum amount of capital that must be subscribed. The lowest denomination tender of 1c can, in fact, be the amount of a subscription. The 2c and 5c figures follow simply from the fact that the minimum number of shareholders for a private company is two and for a public company five. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said it is a bizarre situation, an unhappy one and one that the Minister responded to by saying that the proposals had some weight and he would give them attention. I suggest that he ought to give them urgent attention. He also ought to give some attention to what I think is the fascinating suggestion-it has been advanced in other quarters but it was advanced on this occasion by Mr John Brown, the Labor spokesman-that one way of coping with the problem of insufficient subscriptions of capital would be to require the amount of the subscribed capital to be identified in the actual title of the company. Thus it would be, as Mr Brown suggested, Bloggs $100 Pty Ltd. Other examples that spring more readily to mind are perhaps Messner Accounting Enterprises $10 Pty Ltd or Lynch Property Developments 2c Pty Ltd. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I appreciate that. Paragraph (F) of the Opposition's amendment draws attention to yet another requirement of any fundamental company reform. It reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Rationalisation of the cumbersome provisions in respect of company names on the basis of single nationwide registration. </PARA>
<PARA>It is one of the more peculiar characteristics of this massive Bill that a very large part of its weight is accommodated with what is, on the face of it, a fairly trivial regulatory area; that is, the registration of names. I refer to clauses 40 to 64 where, for reasons which still remain unclear to me anyway, the one stop registration principle which applies elsewhere in the Bill was simply not adopted. Although it is more in the nature of an irritant and an absence of streamlining rather than anything of more substantial importance than that, it is the kind of thing one would have thought might have been capable of resolution when this Bill was being put together. Paragraph (G) refers to:</PARA>
<PARA>a requirement that dividends be paid only from the genuine profits of a company,</PARA>
<PARA>That is a reference to what is presently inadequately dealt with, in our view, by clause 565 of the Bill. Indeed, it was a point that was acknowledged in the House of Representatives by the Minister in his reply to the Opposition's suggestions on that point at the Committee stage. Paragraph (H) of the amendment refers to the necessity for a:</PARA>
<PARA> Full review of the provisions relating to fund raising and prospectuses to ensure maximum disclosure and to require independent valuation of assets exchanged for issued shares,</PARA>
<PARA>Indeed, this is a subject on which the Senate has had the benefit of my views expressed, again at some length, in the context of the Negri River affair on 3 March this year. I think the point is obvious enough not to bear detailed repetition at this point. The only specific matter that needs to be adverted to yet again is that the Eggleston committee's recommendations were quite explicit on this point and, in our view, ought to have been adopted. Indeed, Mr Moore, the Minister, again quite overtly acknowledged that this was a major area of the Bill clearly needing some more detailed attention. I just wish to goodness that he and the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities would give it that attention. Paragraph (I) of the amendment refers to a necessity for:</PARA>
<PARA>reform of the provisions relating to companies financing dealings in their own shares, including the removal of the exemption given to financial assistance to salaried directors,</PARA>
<PARA>The point which speaks for itself, I suppose, as a general principle-Mr Moore made, I think, a valid point in reply-is that there was a concern in this area to endeavour to continue to encourage shareholding by employees, a proposition with which the Opposition and I do not dissent. Equally clearly, there would appear to be a case for more effectively regulating, limiting and determining in the public interest how the financing of directors' shareholdings or acquisitions might be accomplished. That matter is dealt with in clauses 129 to 130 of the present Bill, in our view not very effectively. Paragraph (J) of the amendment consists of a suggestion that there be:</PARA>
<PARA> provision for a higher required standard of competence, care and diligence for directors and officers of companies,</PARA>
<PARA>Again, this is a reference to an existing clause of the Bill-in this case clause 229-which, in our view, is manifestly inadequate and which in this case represents in its final version, a substantial backsliding from the original terms of the draft exposure Bill prepared early last year. It is not an area in which the Opposition's well and cogently argued points-as usual-were responded to with any degree of explicitness by the Minister, but clearly again in our view it is an area where reform is needed. There are only three or four more paragraphs in the amendment but there are many problems with this Bill. Paragraph (K) refers to:</PARA>
<PARA> a requirement that more frequent accounts be lodged by companies listed on the Stock Exchanges,</PARA>
<PARA>That is a reference to the inadequacies in this respect in clauses 263 to 276. Again, I think that is a point which speaks for itself. Paragraph (L)--</PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Rae" NAMEID="0P7">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0P7">Senator Rae</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What do you mean when you say 'more frequent accounts'? Is that envisaged as an amendment to the Companies Act or to the listing requirements? In other words, are quarterly statements inadequate or--</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the view. I am not quite sure off hand, without having done some more detailed work on this provision, what the formal requirements are at the moment. I think that in relation to the Companies Act they are only annual and it is a matter of whether there ought to be access through the companies office to scrutiny procedures for more regular accounts than that, at least in the case of quoted companies. There is no concern on our part that any such requirement should extend to unlisted un-companies because, manifestly, the sheer amount of administration and paper work involved in that would be far and away greater than the return that could be conceivably justified by it. As I understand the position articulated by our shadow minister in the other place, to which I simply advert rather superficially, it is our intention that there be an explicit provision that for quoted companies, perhaps those with a turnover of above some specified minimum level, in order to focus in on those areas where deficiences have been felt in the past, there should be some requirement for more frequent accounts, perhaps not necessarily the whole box and dice accounts; maybe just particular indicators being the subject of an additional requirement of this kind. I would be happy to take that up with the honourable senator at an appropriate occasion later. Paragraph (L) of the Opposition's amendment deals with the vexed and controversial question of companies acting as trustees of trading trusts. The paragraph in question reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>In order to protect creditors and to assist the prevention of tax avoidance, the imposition of stringent disclosure requirements upon companies acting as trustees of trading trusts, in relation to their capacity as trustees and the accounts of the relevant trusts, and the imposition of heavy penalties for non-compliance,</PARA>
<PARA>There seems to be no doubt but that the trading trust can be used as a vehicle for significant tax avoidance in this area. The only significant area for argument seems to be whether one deals with this phenomenon in companies legislation of this kind or whether, rather, one regards it more aptly as the subject matter of specific taxation legislation. The Opposition's view, in essence, is that it is the kind of commercial problem that needs attention at both levels. We cannot for the life of us see why the former Part 6AA in the exposure draft was abandoned in the subsequent development of this Bill. This is not a matter to which the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs gave the Opposition the courtesy of a reply at all in the Committee stage in the other place. If the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner), without asking too much of him on this occasion, could give us some specific indication as to precisely what the Government's policy and intentions are in this area I think that would be a useful and constructive contribution to the general knowledge of honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA> Paragraph (M) of the amendment refers to:</PARA>
<PARA> Full disclosure to the public of the beneficial ownership of all shares in companies. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, this is something that hardly needs elaborate or rhetorical debating passion on my part because the self-evidence of the proposition one would think is so great. I simply repeat the plea that was very passionately and effectively made on this subject by my learned friend and colleague, Mr Jacobi, in the other place when he said, in a way that is absolutely unanswerable, that the provisions are defective; they are ineffective and the only way to protect Australian equity and resources that this country wants to develop is to force disclosure of nominee shareholding. I agree with him. Again I would be interested to know what reasons there might be for the unwillingness apparently of the Government to proceed in this area. Maybe that is a matter on which the Government feels a little more sensitive than some of the other areas with which I have dealt. </PARA>
<PARA> Paragraph (N) of the Opposition's amendment refers to the need for :</PARA>
<PARA> Published accounts to include full details of each director's and officer's remuneration and right of inspection for employees and shareholders of director's service contracts. </PARA>
<PARA>In effect, those matters are covered by clauses 263, 269 and 270 of the present Bill. They are matters again in respect of which there was not much in the way of a positive response from the Minister in the other place but are matters that we would hope have some self-evident policy advantages and would be taken on board by the Ministerial Council. </PARA>
<PARA> Paragraph (O), the second last paragraph of the Opposition's amendment, deals with the subject matter of clause 320 and refers to:</PARA>
<PARA> Adequate remedies for oppressive conduct, including extension of the concept of oppression to single and anticipated acts unfairly prejudicial to a shareholder, and provision of further means such as a 'shareholders' tribunal' to protect the interests of minority shareholders. </PARA>
<PARA>Again, one would have thought this matter was of enormous and obvious importance but we received no response from the Minister, notwithstanding that his own officers have indicated, in the very extensive briefings we have had and for which we are grateful in the build-up of this legislation, they were matters which were very much on the list of priorities for reform. The last paragraph of the Opposition's amendment details the inadequacies of the reformist qualities of this legislation. Paragraph (P) calls for:</PARA>
<PARA> Complete reform of the winding up provisions, including greater protection for unsecured creditors, following a reference on insolvency to the Australian Law Reform Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>Part XI of the Bill-it is huge Part of the Bill which has some 117 clauses-which deals with this matter is, in our view and indeed, it appears, in the view of the Minister, much in need of attention. The only difficulty is who is going to give it that attention and when. The Law Reform Commission indicated in the course of its earlier recovery of debts reference that it was able, willing and anxious indeed to take on the question of company insolvencies as well as the larger issues still remaining unresolved in the bankruptcy area. The Government so far has not responded affirmatively to that request. One wonders why. Can it be a resource problem or can it be some dark policy secrets that the Government is nurturing to its breast? If the Minister for Veterans' Affairs would care to tell us we would like to know because this is manifestly an area demanding attention. That list, lengthy as it undoubtedly is and occupying as it did some four hours of debate in the Committee stage in the other place-a debate which perhaps honourable senators will be delighted to know will not be repeated here-nonetheless still by no means exhaustively catalogues the deficiencies of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> There is one other matter to which I specifically draw attention although I will not debate it, and that is the particular question of an accounting standards review board. That is the subject of clause 4 of our amendment, the expedition of which seems undoubtedly to be a crucial necessity given the extraordinary chaos-I do not think that is too high a word-which prevails in the evolution and application of relevant inflation-proof accountancy standards in this country at the moment. So much for particular matters. </PARA>
<PARA> In general terms, the point that the Opposition makes-I guess we have given enough illustrations to make the point-is that this is a major reform opportunity which has been forgone. For that reason, this Government and the weaker and more reactionary elements which constitute the majority of the Ministerial Council, deserve a great deal of the blame. There is one aspect of this though for which the Minister deserves a degree of blame. It can be described only as something very close to, if not actually constituting, a misrepresentation. I refer to a letter which was written by the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs to the Australian Financial Review and which appeared in the edition of 27 May, in which he claimed extraordinarily that it was not within the jurisdiction of the Ministerial Council for reforming legislation to be produced. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Companies Bill should be seen essentially as the foundation for future, comprehensive and on-going reforms. </PARA>
<PARA>So far so good, but then he went on:</PARA>
<PARA> This view is consistent with the Formal Agreement-</PARA>
<PARA>He is referring to the Maroochydore agreement of 1978-</PARA>
<PARA> Which requires the initial legislation to be substantially based on the existing ICAC Companies and Securities Industries Acts. </PARA>
<PARA>He said that the Maroochydore agreement requires the initial legislation to be thus based. Clause 8 (2) (b) of the Maroochydore formal agreement provides that the initial legislation to form the basis of the scheme shall:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . except to the extent that amendments are agreed upon by the Ministerial Council . . . be substantially in conformity with . . . legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>It refers to the existing legislation. In other words, the Ministerial Council unquestionably had the power to introduce reforms without restrictions, subject only, of course, to the limiting requirement of unanimous agreement. I make that point because there is a disposition, there has been a disposition and no doubt it will be repeated by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs in his reply unless he is a little more honest than his counterpart in the other place to claim that it was not in the inherent nature of his exercise to produce a reforming Bill. Clearly it is not accurate to make that claim. The power was there. It is simply a matter, for a variety of other reasons, resulting in the opportunity being forgone. </PARA>
<PARA> The other point I want to make is a general point of some importance. I refer to the question of the formation and establishment of the companies and securities law review committee. The formal Maroochydore agreement between the Commonwealth and the States which established the companies and securities co-operative scheme did provide in clause 21(2) as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> To assist the Ministerial Council in discharging its functions-</PARA>
<PARA>I interpolate here to indicate that it is to consider and to keep under review the formulation and operation of the companies and securities legislation: Clause 21(2) further states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . there shall be a Companies and Securities Law Review Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the functions that that review committee was given in terms of the formal agreement was to carry out research into and advise on law reform in relation to the companies and securities legislation. This committee has not yet been established-that was admitted by the Minister in the letter to which I referred in the Australian Financial Review yesterday-nor am I aware that there have been any moves to establish it. It is 2 1/2 years since the agreement was signed. Such a committee would have to be staffed with appropriate academics, company lawyers and departmental experts from the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs. Such a committee could have fulfilled its intended function by advising the Ministerial Council on the Companies Bill. Never, I suggest, was an expert committee more badly needed nor its absence more evidence than in relation to this Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The reality of the matter is that in the early part of this century Victoria led the way in company law reform in the common law world. Victorian law recognised the private company 11 years before similar recognition was accorded in Britain. The Victorian Companies Act in 1938 was in many ways an improvement on the British consolidating Act of 1929. Since that initial extravaganza by the Victorians, which has not been repeated since in that State, all the running has been made not in this country but in Britain, the highlights being the Green committee report in 1926, the Cohen committee report in 1945 and, of course, the Jenkins committee report in 1962. </PARA>
<PARA> The only significant initiative that has hitherto been taken in Australia as a major reforming exercise was the establishment of the Eggleston committee, appointed by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General in 1967, to inquire into protection mechanisms for the investing public. That Committee's report, admirable as it was, was the product of insufficient time at the time, and has certainly been the product of insufficient governmental attention since. I simply make the point, without going into as much detail as I could about the earlier attempts at reform in this area, that this much vaunted, much heralded Companies Bill was the golden opportunity for wide consultation for a detailed report by a committee giving reasons, unlike the Ministerial Council in this case, for what it does and does not recommend and for wholesale reform in all the areas to which the Opposition's amendment refers. I conclude my remarks by making the point, although it is a fairly detailed one--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to Senator Rae's guffaw, I say that it is the last subject to which I wish to refer. Lest he be minded to continue guffawing, I simply make the point that I am making this speech at the expense of four hours, or potentially more, of Committee debate. He should count his blessings. This was also the occasion for reform of an even more fundamental and far-reaching kind. I wish to leave the Senate and indeed, the Minister and the Ministerial Council, with an idea. I believe that rather than having just the kind of inevitably and essentially patchwork reforms which I have been listing and which are the subject of the Opposition's amendment there is a strong case for considering the whole question of limited liability. Let me remind the Senate that limited liability means that if on the winding up of an insolvent company the assets of the company are insufficient to pay its debts in full the liability of a shareholder to meet those debts is limited to the amount which is not paid up on his or her shares. In the absence of fraud, or if reasonable grounds can be shown for believing that the company could pay its debts, the directors of the company have no liability for those debts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The historical justification for this situation has always been that limited liability provides a safeguard for risk-taking and that therefore it is an incentive to investment. In a large company it ensures that the non-participating contributors of capital are not liable for the misjudgments or failures of the directors and managers. However, the evil of limited liability is that it leaves unprotected and unpaid creditors who have entered into bona fide transactions with companies while providing a shield for those who stand to benefit if the company succeeds. In other words, it shifts the risks of failure. It shifts those risks away from the proprietors of a company, who will have all the benefits of success, to creditors who then bear the costs of failure but who get no more than their due if things go well. It must be seriously considered whether this is a proper allocation of mercantile risks. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition's concern, although we have not articulated it in quite such explicit terms, about the consequences of limited liability is of course reflected in a number of the specific items in the amendment. In the first place the price of limited liability, as I have said, has to be full disclosure of accounts so that creditors can take steps to inform themselves of the financial position of the company with which they deal. Thus paragraph 5(A) of our amendment calls for the abolition of the category of exempt proprietary companies and its privilege of non-disclosure. A similar theme is evident in paragraph 5(L) of the amendment, which calls for stringent disclosure requirements for companies acting as trustees of trading trusts. Again, paragraph 5(B) of the amendment calls for company law to incorporate powers in and directions to the National Companies and Securities Commission and the courts to pierce the corporate veil in appropriate circumstances-that is, to remove the shield of limited liability and to affix personal liability on directors and shareholders where it is just and equitable to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> Paragraph 5(E), to which I have referred, is also relevant to this theme. It calls for a prescribed minimum, nominal and paid-up capital. This too should be a prerequisite before the privilege of limited liability is conferred. It will ensure some minimum financial substance and thus reduce the risk of insolvency. It will act as a deterrent to frivolous incorporations. It will certainly end the abuse of the $2 shelf company. As we know, it is this kind of company which is so widely used, in tax avoidance schemes, in particular as the trustee of trading trusts. </PARA>
<PARA> A couple more paragraphs are relevant to this theme. Paragraph 5 (H) calls for the independent valuation of assets exchanged for share issues. This may not stop the most determined of fraudulent promoters but it would greatly limit the number of formations and, for that matter, failures, of companies by reckless or inexperienced proprietors who are short of real working capital. Finally, paragraph 5 (J) calls for a higher standard of competence, care and diligence for directors and officers of companies. This provision, too, is intended to safeguard those who deal with companies in good faith and, of course, to pre-empt unnecessary risk-taking or incompetence before it does any damage. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that there is a case for going beyond these kinds of measures which nonetheless assume the universal continuance of the limited liability principle and to raise for serious debate the question as to whether limited liability should be so automatically accepted and applicable for all classes of companies. At present, all companies have the privilege of limited liability. This means that all companies, large and small, public and private, must comply with the mountainous regulatory provisions of this Bill, all 532 pages of them. </PARA>
<PARA> For small traders and private companies, this Companies Bill, like the Companies Act which it is to succeed, is undoubtedly a procedural wilderness and a legal minefield. I suggest that small companies, as defined by the number of owners, their capital and their turnover, or some combination of those criteria, should be given the alternative of unlimited liability with no obligation to disclose and a simpler code of conduct. This, of course, is a matter of fundamental and, indeed, almost religious significance in company law. Obviously, it cannot begin to be fully canvassed here, not least because I have trespassed so much on the Senate's time, but I assert that the advent of unlimited liability, whilst having obvious advantages to creditors, would not discourage soundly based businesses. The emphasis, of course, is on that qualification. Any discouragement to reckless trading or highly speculative incorporations could only be welcomed in my view. At the same time the correlative privilege of non-disclosure and a simpler code of conduct to adhere to would take appropriate notice of the fact that much company regulation is unnecessary for small companies where there is a substantial identity between the managers and the shareholders of the company in question. I therefore propose that consideration should be given to having ultimately separate legislation, perhaps even a small businesses Act-that ought to be dear to the heart of Senator Messner-to give effect to the kind of differential needs and obligations of small and large companies. I suggest that that might be a viable scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The above catalogue of complaints and suggestions, as I have said, by no means exhausts the things that can be said about this Bill but it gives a clear indication above all else of how weak, timid and unadventurous a document it is. It is perhaps also worth making the point-it is a point I have made whenever speaking about such schemes-that there is an air of awful unreality in any event about pursuing this debate much further than I have sought to do today. As we all know, the reality is that no particular amendment that we might propose is likely to be accepted. That is not unusual in this chamber but in this case no amendment to the legislation now before us is likely even to be considered-taken away overnight and contemplated by the Government. That follows because of the nature of the package arrangements which are involved in this co-operative Federal exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> The Bill has been approved by the Ministerial Council. It comes before us on a take it or leave it basis. There is nothing that we can do to improve it. All we can do is to make suggestions of the kind that I and the Opposition have made-they have been made at much greater length in the other place-which may or may not be taken seriously. So much for parliamentary sovereignty! That is another reason why I believe the only satisfactory long term solution to the problem of getting an effective system of not only uniform but also strong and reformist national company law is for the Commonwealth to take the bit between its teeth and enact the necessary legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Evans in both an interesting and constructive contribution to the debate, notwithstanding the fact that I laughed at his suggestion that he was concluding some quarter of an hour ago, or whatever it was, described the Companies Bill 1981 as the much vaunted, much heralded Companies Bill. I have never thought that it had achieved that sort of acclaim. Rather I thought that the attitude adopted by the Parliament, the public and the media is as the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore) described it in his letter to the Australian Financial Review-the start of a reform process, the first stage in developing what may become a modern, workable and appropriate package of companies legislation in Australia. I think that point needs to be made as a brief response to Senator Evans's speech. He said it was the vehicle but it was not used. Therefore I will give a very brief resume of the background on how this legislation came about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There was concern in Australia that the whole area of the company law, securities industry law, the rules and administration of stock exchanges, company registries corporate affairs commissions-or whatever they may be-was demonstrated to be inadequate. This led to the suggestion, through a Senate committee, and certainly a general public acceptance that reform and a new approach was necessary. That led to the introduction of a Bill for Commonwealth legislation which had some draconian aspects to it as well as some desirable reforming aspects. However, it caused this chamber some concern and the Senate referred that Bill to a committee which considered it during1975. It had not reported on it when the events of 11 November 1975 led to a double dissolution and change of Government. On the change of Government it was decided quite legitimately, although I believe wrongly that the approach more appropriate than using what I believe to be the undoubted Commonwealth power to legislate was that of co-operative federalism. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1976 the Commonwealth Government forwent the opportunity which had been created of having a single Commonwealth companies Act enacted by a parliament and that parliament being solely responsible for it. To me that would have been consistent with both the single power of the Commonwealth Constitution in relation to companies and also with the package of powers created. I do not propose to dwell upon the package of powers that would have been available. Suffice it to say that such a package of powers has supported the United States of America Securities and Exchange Commission since its introduction in 1933. I do not believe-my view was supported in some fairly weighted legal opinions which were received by the Senate committee-that that would have been possible in Australia. But the Government of the day legitimately chose to adopt, consistent with its party's philosophy as it perceived it, the co-operative federalism approach. Inevitably that involved negotiation, compromise and the achievement of a start point from which one may be able to look at reform. I do not accept the criticism that this was a real opportunity for reform. </PARA>
<PARA> The Maroochydore agreement, which was eventually reached between the relevant Ministers of each State and the Commonwealth, was for the creation of a national companies and securities commission and the creation, by agreement, of a package of legislation which was to be enacted by the Commonwealth Government but which would be at its commencement as close as possible to the existing legislation common to the States. So it was a matter of hastening slowly. That is what was agreed to at Maroochydore in December 1978. I believe one of the unfortunate aspects of the development of this legislative package with which we are now dealing is that there have been too many attempts to try to improve the existing provisions, which has tended to hold up the introduction of this legislation. It would have been far better to have taken as a package what existed in the States, pass it and then say: 'Now we have got the basis of a national companies and securities commission. We have the basic legislation which enables the system to work. Now let us look at using the national companies and securities commission apparatus and take the opportunity to implement reform.' Whilst I find almost overwhelming the temptation to engage in a full debate on all the issues that have been raised by the amendment which Senator Evans moved and all of the other interesting aspects which are contained in the Bills, I resist it. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore, I will deal briefly with some of the matters that Senator Evans raised because I believe the matter is at the next phase-the stage at which this Parliament will need to debate in far more detail some of the issues which need to be faced in Australia. There are a very large number of issues involved. I believe from a situation where we started to develop the possibility of Australia leading the world in the formulation of an appropriate companies and securities legislative design, we have fallen behind at the alter of co-operative federalism, because it has taken so long-it is nearly five years since a serious start was made-to get a co-operative approach to the creation of a national commission and the development of a legislative package. That approach did not start until some time after the new government came into power in 1976. That is why I said it is nearly five years since that took place. Had it been possible to get a little more co-operation from some of the State governments, I believe the whole thing could have been achieved more expeditiously. I point out that this is not a matter of saying that one party or one side of politics was right or wrong in relation to the matter. Those representatives on the Ministerial Council represented the major political parties of Australia in the various State governments and the Commonwealth Government. There were differences. Those differences had to be determined on the lowest common denominator basis because the Maroochydore agreement involved unanimity in relation to everything that was to be the original package. That is, unanimity in relation to the legislation for the creation of the National Companies and Securities Commission, the companies and securities industry legislation and other various pieces of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> When one looks at the disparate interests of six States and the Commonwealth and imagines the possibility of enjoying daring reform with unanimity one is looking at a very long term process at best. I return to the point I made earlier. Far from agreeing with Senator Evans that this was the vehicle for reform, I think it was a vehicle destined to be the lowest common denominator in its initial stage. Had it been approached from the point of view of trying not to worry about some of the more important issues related to variations of the existing law, we may have had this legislation a lot earlier than we have. I do not say that critically of anybody but rather as an appraisal, looking back perhaps with a degree of hindsight. It is unfortunate that all of this legislation was not in force a little earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Acting Deputy President, I do not wish to re-cover in detail the ground that has been covered in previous speeches which I have made in relation to the prior legislation which has arisen from the Maroochydore agreement. I simply say that I endorse and wish to affirm what I said on those prior occasions in relation to the approach which has been adopted. I see this as step one. The legislation will be on a national basis. That is a major step forward. It may not be the most adequate, most interesting or most reforming legislation, but it is at least legislation on a national basis. I trust that from now on it will involve the agreement of only a majority of the members of the Ministerial Council to reform the legislation. There will be an opportunity for the National Companies and Securities Commission, through what I see as the adaptation to Australian circumstances of the American SEC special study role, to develop some public awareness, debate and consensus in relation to what sort of companies and securities law will be most appropriate to serve the needs of Australia for the ensuing two or three decades. It will also be able to start to get some agreement so that we will not have the lowest common denominator principle applying; rather we will have an exhausting of the debate and then an understanding by clear definition, by the recommendations of the National Companies and Securities Commisison, of what is likely best to serve Australia's needs. </PARA>
<PARA> We will then have the opportunity for the introduction of new legislation and we will have one parliament responsible for dealing with it. I hope that this Parliament then will start to take an interest, which it is not taking at the moment, in the detail of the legislation, and that when people ask 'If I apply some of my very precious time to considering these issues, can I expect to see some change take place?' the answer will be yes, they can. It will be worth while. But at the moment it is understandable that most people have adopted the attitude that as this legislation required unanimity and as the Parliament, in effect, is being denied the opportunity to play any sensible part in the determination of what is in the legislation, if they want to change anything at all by way of amendment, they destroy the package and the unanimity. One is back to square one. It has to go back to the Ministerial Council to be agreed to and it has to go back to each of the parliaments before it can become effective. I regard it as quite understandable that many people have adopted the attitude of saying: 'Let's get the show on the road first, then start to look at the detail of which way down the road we ought to go'. </PARA>
<PARA> With that background I would like to make some brief comments on the amendment which has been moved by Senator Evans. I do not have a great deal of objection to a number of matters which he raised from the point of view of being matters which ought to be considered. But I believe that one or two of them are inaccurate or inappropriate and some of the others, I believe, are matters which would be worth considering by the National Companies and Securities Commission, but not as a tag to this Bill which I believe ought to be approached from the point of view I have outlined, which is: Let us get this Bill, the lowest common denominator which could be achieved with unanimity on a bipartisan Commonwealth and States basis, and then let us see where we go from there. The first part of the amendment moved by Senator Evans states:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the Senate</PARA>
<PARA> (1) expresses its concern-</PARA>
<PARA> (A) at the Government's abdication of its responsibility to make national laws for companies and securities pursuant to the Commonwealth's own constitutional powers, and in accordance with the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange in 1974 . . . </PARA>
<PARA>I can indicate only that that would not unnaturally attract some degree of sympathy from me. The members of the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange believed that the Commonwealth had the constitutional power. We also believed that the States had behaved in a way which led one to believe that they had abdicated their right to be able to determine what should happen in this respect. That Committee report demonstrated time and again that the States had failed totally and absolutely in their regulatory responsibility, as had in many instances the stock exchanges. The stock exchanges have done a very considerable amount to endeavour to reform their procedures and to overcome their demonstrable shortcomings at that time. I am not sure that the States-certainly not looked at in globo-can be given the same degree of accolade in that respect. But, as I have mentioned, I believe it is the legitimate right of a government elected by the people with a clear mandate and a clear philosophy to say that it will adopt the co-operative federalism approach to issues such as this. It is its clear right to be able to approach it on that basis, however much I may believe that it would have been more effectively done in another way. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not accept the suggestion in the first part of Senator Evans's amendment that the Government has abdicated its responsibility. I believe it would have been more effective had it taken advantage of the opportunity which had been created for it to go it alone, but in the circumstances it chose, quite legitimately, to go the other way. This is what has been achieved to date. The sooner we get the legislation enacted and implemented the better. The second part of the amendment states:</PARA>
<PARA> the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) expresses its concern-</PARA>
<PARA> (B) at the lack of effective accountability of the National Companies and Securities Commission to either the Government or Parliament of the Commonwealth, or to any other single elected Government or Parliament,</PARA>
<PARA>There are two aspects of that. One is general accountability. I do not accept that as a criticism of the legislation. I believed it was essential, and I still believe that it is essential, for the National Companies and Securities Commission to have a degree of independence. Whilst accountable in terms of reporting its finances and its actions on an annual basis, it should be clear, free and independent from any particular government in carrying out the statutory functions which have been given to it. Insofar as the question is raised that it is not really accountable to any of the parliaments in that no individual parliament is in a position necessarily to liaise directly with or to take up the recommendations of the National Companies and Securities Commission-one might say almost a special relationship with the National Companies and Securities Commission-I believe that is a temporary situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I take the opportunity to express my sympathy to those commissioners who have been finding the fulfilment of the task for which they were appointed somewhat frustrated by the time it has taken to get them into a position where they have legislation to administer and a capacity to act. I pay a compliment to the patience and the endeavours of the Chairman and his other commissioners who, notwithstanding some feelings of frustration, have stuck with it. I believe that once we get this legislative package going and once the National Companies and Securities Commission can get itself going, we will find that, as the amendments are made by the Commonwealth Parliament, there will be the opportunity for some degree of liaison and understanding and some interest taken by the Commonwealth Parliament in relation to the work of the National Companies and Securities Commission. I hope that there will be intercommunication between that Commission and the Commonwealth Parliament on a consistent basis so that there will be some reasonably close degree of understanding of where they are going and what legislative results may be desirable to follow. I refer to paragraph (1) (C) of the amendment moved by Senator Evans, which states that the Senate expresses its concern:</PARA>
<PARA>that despite the inordinate delay in introducing the legislation, the Parliament of the Commonwealth has not been given an opportunity effectively to scrutinise this Bill and associated Bills and will not be able effectively to determine company law in the future under the Co-operative Companies and Securities Scheme;</PARA>
<PARA>I think I have dealt with most of that but the only further point I would make is that, insofar as there is implied in that paragraph a criticism of the successive Ministers since Mr Fife as the responsible Minister, that would be an extremely unfair criticism. I have never known legislation to be dealt with in a way which made it more readily available to both sides of the Parliament earlier and with more opportunity to consider than has happened with this legislation. Both the Government parties and the Opposition parties have had committees in relation to this legislative package. Both committees have been provided at an early stage-long before its introduction to Parliament-with copies of the proposed Bills. Both of them have had ready access to briefing by departmental officers and I think in fact, far from its being a case in which any even implied criticism would be legitimate, the handling of this package of legislation, designed originally by Mr Fife and followed by his successors is an excellent example of the way in which legislation can be approached-by giving those who are interested on both sides of the Parliament an adequate opportunity to study, to be briefed, to consider and to debate. I therefore take the opportunity to say, insofar as there is any implied criticism in the paragraph, that I wish to assert the very opposite; that is, that the successive Ministers are to be complimented for the way in which they have approached this legislation. I also take the opportunity to pay a degree of tribute to the officers of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs who have also been very ready in the assistance which they have given to the parliamentary committees, as I understand it, on both sides, in briefing them, in providing information and in answering questions. I can say only that I wish I felt more excitement about the content of the legislation which would have made the whole exercise just that much more worthwhile. But I still look forward with enthusiasm to what this will make possible by way of future reform. </PARA>
<PARA> Paragraph (2) of Senator Evans's amendment reads:</PARA>
<PARA>calls upon the Government in the event of the breakdown for any reason of the scheme, of which the Bill is a part, immediately to proceed to the introduction of Commonwealth legislation for the national regulation of companies. </PARA>
<PARA>Insofar as I have supported the current Government's right, and the appropriateness of the current Government's use of the co-operative federalist approach, I reassert what was asserted in the report of the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange and that is, that it is essential that there be national legislation and if there is any breakdown in the co-operative federalist approach then there is the clearest possible responsibility on the Commonwealth Government to exercise its powers and to introduce its own legislation. I agree that any Commonwealth Government would be recreant if it did not in the case of breakdown immediately take over the responsibility to ensure that there is appropriate legislation on a national basis for what is an extremely important part of the whole operation of our national economy and our national society. </PARA>
<PARA> Paragraph (3) states:</PARA>
<PARA>notes that this Bill places uniformity before reform in deference to powerful vested interest groups and represents a retreat to the lowest common denominator standard of company law;</PARA>
<PARA>I have already commented on the lowest common denominator standard aspect and the retreat to powerful vested interest groups is, I believe, one of the indications of the sort of mania that occasionally distorts that which is worth while that comes out of the Opposition into that which is almost not credible. I regard it as unfortunate that those few words were put into that paragraph. Otherwise I comment that it is for the reasons that I have referred to, the lowest common denominator standard of company law. </PARA>
<PARA> Paragraph (4) 'calls upon the Government to expedite the establishment of an Accounting Standards Review Board'. For reasons which I gave the last time I spoke in relation to this legislative package, I totally support the urgent need for getting on with that side of it. I believe there are so many problems in relation to the whole of the questions involved in accounting standards that this is the vehicle which will enable the work that is being done at the moment to be formalised and brought into action. In saying that, I do not wish to be taken as being critical of a whole lot of the work which is taking place at the moment. But it needs to be brought together and it needs to have a focal point. I believe that the Accounting Standards Review Board could provide that. There is a horde of questions, some of which have been dealt with and others which need to be dealt with. I am quite sure that the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) will not have any problem in agreeing with that particular paragraph. </PARA>
<PARA> Paragraph (5) 'calls upon the Government immediately to pursue a fundamental reform of company law', and includes items (A) to (P) which are a cross-section of matters of question, of interest and of areas of possible reforms. In relation to all of those I simply go back to saying that I believe they are all proper matters for the National Companies and Securities Commission to consider in carrying out its special study role as to what ought to be the framework for the development of the company law of Australia for the next few decades. I do not propose to deal with each one individually but rather to say again that I do not think they need to be the matter of a motion from the Senate. I am quite sure that the National Companies and Securities Commission will advert to the debate which takes place in this chamber as well as to the debate which has taken place in the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of matters were raised in some detail in the debate in the House of Representatives which Senator Evans has quite effectively dealt with on a more expeditious basis in this chamber and to which I trust the National Companies and Securities Commission will have regard. I do not see the necessity for the amendment which has been moved by Senator Evans although I find a number of areas of it perfectly reasonable to be raised by way of debate for further consideration. I resist the temptation to debate in detail the issues because I think, and I hope, that they will be matters for committee consideration in this chamber at a future time. I hope that it will be possible for us to look at having a standing committee of this chamber which will continue the work which was started in this chamber of having regard to the importance of the company law of Australia, the securities industry law of Australia and the operation of that law in facilitating the growth and development and fair opportunity for people and enterprise to take place. I hope that we will have a committee which can liaise with, and pay regard to the work of, the National Companies and Securities Commission and the Accounting Standards Review Board, one that will endeavour to ensure that it has a knowledge and understanding of what those organisations are doing and some input to their deliberations. I hope that it will be a communications base with the Parliament to ensure that there is a thrust towards getting reform once there has been sufficient input from the various sectors. There has been agreement on what is desirable and necessary and then it becomes clear that we can develop a long way in this regard. </PARA>
<PARA> I conclude by referring to the question of unlimited liability, which Senator Evans mentioned. He did not refer to the British White Paper on company law of 1973, I think, which pointed out that limited liability has become a fiction in our type of society; that if one is small enough to need it, creditors with any sense will ensure that they have personal guarantees; if one is not small enough to need it, the question does not matter. The original objective of having limited liability to encourage entrepreneurial development and risk-taking in the interests of the development of the nation has been lost as a result of modern commercial practice. I would certainly agree that there is a very strong case for a reconsideration of the value of limited liability. There is a very strong case for the consideration of the desirability of having proprietary companies and whether they should not be limited partnerships in some form and for reconsidering the idea of having thousands of companies which have two shareholders but which have a corporate name. They are cluttering up the company registries and in effect are cluttering up the Companies Act. That is the legislative structure which attempts to deal with the BHPs and the Bloggs Pty Ltd corner stores. </PARA>
<PARA> In my view, the two are not capable of being dealt with in one legislative package. It would be far better to be able to say: 'That is a State matter. The small business area of company law ought not to be in the national company law at all; it ought to be dealt with on a State by State basis'. </PARA>

Equally Bloggs Corner Store Pty Ltd could never be regarded properly as a matter of the interest of the national Parliament.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I feel like a pigmy among giants in this debate but will take some five minutes of the time of the Senate to make some comments on the Bill in the package called the Crown Debts (Priority) Bill. It is with some pleasure that I see amongst the body of advisers Mr Malcolm Starr, who played a very able role as Secretary of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs which produced the report on the priority of Crown debts. The thrust of that report was that the priority which the Crown has traditionally exercised in the distribution of those meagre funds or assets which remain following bankruptcy or insolvency should be done away with. In that way the community-which is, after all what we are talking about-through its Government, should rank equally with ordinary members of the community who find themselves financially disadvantaged, imperilled or in jeopardy because of the insolvency of some firm, business or trading enterprise. The whole thrust of the report was to say that when such meagre assets have been drawn together out of the wreckage the community should share equally with employees, unsecured creditors and all who have a claim on the firm in respect of its remaining assets.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill provides some further movement by the Government-some two or three measures have been brought down in the last few years-to bring the legislation somewhat more in line with the thrust of the Senate Committee's report. Nevertheless, in our opinion, the Bill fails in that it does retain priority for the Crown in relation to tax instalment deductions, withholding tax on dividends and interest remitted overseas. What this means in particular is that when a company falls into a parlous state financially and has to be brought to an end, those employees who may have gone for three or four weeks without pay, who perhaps have accumulated entitlements to holiday leave or who are on workers' compensation, perhaps not covered by insurance arrangements-there is another category, but I cannot remember it-will find that tax instalment deductions will be taken by the Commonwealth from the meagre funds. Inevitably and invariably they will swallow up all the moneys available for distribution. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to the Opposition, as it did to all the community groups which gave evidence to the Committee, that that is unfair. It does not greatly enhance the revenues available to the Commonwealth Treasury. In fact, I think it was estimated at the time as amounting to perhaps $6m. That figure does not take into account the fact that if employees do not get their wages or other accumulated entitlements from the assets that remain there may be a snowballing effect of bad debts throughout the community which may offset the revenues that would otherwise accrue to the Commonwealth Treasury. Not only is it unfair and not of great fiscal importance, but also all the community groups which gave evidence were of the opinion that the priority expressed as priority of the Crown-which has a sort of feudal and awesome ring to it but which merely means the priority of the community over certain members of it-should be done away with. </PARA>
<PARA> We go further in the amendment, which I intend to move at the appropriate time, and say that, indeed, employees in such situations should have a priority over the Commonwealth. In that regard, the amendment goes beyond the thrust of the Committee's report. In respect of wages and workers' compensation payments it seems to us that employees, who have no form of sustenance other than remuneration from their firm, should have priority over the community, which has other sources of revenue available to it, and over those involved with the firm, perhaps as traders or even shareholders, who also have other sources of revenue. The Opposition is firmly of the view that employees ought to have a priority in relation to wage and compensation payments. It is not enough that they rank equally, because the moneys that are left to be distributed are very meagre. </PARA>
<PARA> This seems the appropriate time to mention, as a sideline in a sense, that in Estimates committees much concern was expressed that the bankruptcy jurisdiction is overwhelmed by so much work at present that the official receivers in the various provinces are quite unable to carry through the distribution of assets that they have managed to marshal. In my home State there have been instances of official receivers having to write to creditors and say: 'I have the moneys available but they will not be distributed for a year or so because I do not have the staff to write out the cheques to make the moneys available to you'. We have not only the problem of the ranking of creditors but also the question of whether moneys will ever become available to them in a reasonable time, whatever their ranking. There is a strong case to be made out, perhaps at another time in another debate, for a diversion of money by the Commonwealth into the bankruptcy jurisdiction to ensure that those who are awaiting distribution of funds can receive them as speedily and expeditiously as possible. I know that Senator Messner has a particular expertise and interest in bankruptcy and associated matters-as a professional man, not in any personal capacity. With those few words I simply wish to indicate that at the appropriate time-I understand it will be a little later this afternoon-it is my intention to move the amendment, circulated to honourable senators, to the motion for the second reading of the Crown Debts (Priority) Bill 1981. That will involve adding at the end of the motion:</PARA>
<PARA>, but the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Expresses its concern that Crown Priorities in relation to tax instalment deductions and withholding tax on dividends and interest remitted overseas, and the priority of the Crown in right of the States, have been preserved; and</PARA>
<PARA> (2) calls upon the Government to-</PARA>
<PARA> (A) abolish all remaining Crown Priorities in right of the Commonwealth and to seek the abolition of all remaining Crown Priorities in the State sphere, and</PARA>
<PARA> (B) ensure that all wages and compensation payments to employees are given priority over all creditors. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank both Senator Evans and Senator Rae, who took part in the debate on the Companies Bill, and Senator Tate, who spoke to the Crown Debts (Priority) Bill, for their interesting and constructive remarks. I would like to dwell on the more general issues which were raised by Senator Evans and then to deal with not all but some parts of the amendment he has moved because, as he indicated, much of it received attention in the House of Representatives from the Minister who had carriage of the Bill. Firstly, may we address ourselves to the important basic concept of the legislation. It is based on an agreement between the States. On that base is constructed the legislative framework for the Commonwealth, incorporating the States as well by agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Evans said that in his view this is not the best way to proceed in this area. Nevertheless, as Senator Rae so ably pointed out, it is a very sound base for moving forward. I liked the kinds of remarks which he made in that respect. He regarded it as a starting point or as a launching pad. He sees it as a point from which progress can be made in the development of company law in this country. If we accept that premise, most of the issues raised in the Opposition's amendment fall to the ground. That is not to say that several of the matters raised are not matters which ought not to be contemplated by the Government. Indeed, several of the issues are important and no doubt will be discussed by the various States at the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities and at various times in this Parliament, no doubt as a result of the development of the interest of this Parliament in corporate law. I draw attention to that because Senator Rae made the very important point that one of the main results of this form of development of corporate law is that for the first time the Commonwealth will have a specific interest in the operations, the reporting functions and the regulation generally of the great Australian corporations. It provides a base from which this Parliament will be able in future to exercise a supervisory role as well as direct control, if it sees the need. That will entail the use of the new instrumentalities which are to be set up by other legislation, in particular the National Companies and Securities Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to two or three of the issues which Senator Evans raised. I start with his amendment. Paragraph (1) (A) is an indication by him that the Government has abdicated its responsibility to make national laws for companies and securities. I noted that Senator Rae had some sympathy with the view that there ought to be a national law based upon the 1974 report of the Senate Select Committee on Securities and Exchange. That is something which the Government thought about very deeply in implementing this proposal. Senator Evans's point goes to the basis of the objection which the Government saw in trying to establish a basic and general law with Commonwealth application but without consideration of the States' interests. It is of particular concern, and perhaps a glowing example of the way in which the Commonwealth works, that a great deal of enterprise has been undertaken successfully by the various States and the Commonwealth in bringing together all these diverse interests into a form of law which can be regarded as truly national. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the issues which Senator Evans raised in this context it is important to acknowledge that if the States were to break away from the Ministerial Council and enact their own legislation, to the extent that the Commonwealth had extended its own legislation to cover the whole of the Commonwealth other than the Australian Capital Territory, which it would otherwise do, the State law, where it was identical, would be superseded by Federal law. The Federal law would have application. It would need a relatively minor adjustment to the Federal legislation to enact a Federal company law. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the difficulties of the various State relationships, Senator Rae put the position very clearly. The States have joined the Ministerial Council. The amending process of the laws in the various States in the Commonwealth will now rely upon a majority decision rather than the unanimous one which was required in the first instance in order to bring the whole legislative framework into creation. Consequently, that seems to me to present the opportunities for which Senator Evans is looking for the future development of the legislation and, particularly, the concept of corporation law throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> I shall deal with the points raised in paragraph (5) of the Opposition's amendment. They are the matters which the Opposition would like to see incorporated in the reform of any company law. I address myself firstly to paragraph (5) (A) which touches on:</PARA>
<PARA> The abolition of the category of 'exempt proprietary company' . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Senator Evans during his remarks referred, I think, to the aspect of trying to extend the concept of maybe unlimited liability to a great number of small companies so that they could be released from the obligations of reporting under the companies law. Indeed, that is a matter which has exercised the minds of several honourable senators in this place and, indeed, it has been discussed at other levels in the public arena. Indeed, I believe it is a very worthwhile proposition that we should look at this area in the future. To have sought to have incorporated it in this law, I believe-Senator Rae has pointed this out-would have unduly delayed the establishment of the framework and considerably lengthened the process by which this law would be set in place so as to regulate the important areas of public company operations on the stock exchanges and in order to safeguard the public against abuse. </PARA>
<PARA> Consequently, I hold to the view that that is a matter for the future and we ought to address ourselves to it. However, it appears to me that Senator Evans's amendment, bearing in mind his objective of establishing maybe a separate form of corporate entity, is going about the whole thing the wrong way by proposing that exempt proprietary companies should be abolished and that privileges associated with such exemption should also be abolished. It seems to me that that provides a framework for developing the later concept of which he spoke. </PARA>
<PARA> Paragraph (5) (B)-looking behind the corporate veil, so to speak-deals with a matter which has indeed represented a development of the law in many ways in the last few years. We have seen the rising degree of prosecutions of directors for misfeasance and all kinds of defaults of officers of companies. Indeed, the present legislation will incorporate many penalties against officers and directors of companies where those things have occurred. I do not know whether Senator Evans has other things in mind. Perhaps he does. Indeed, no doubt, as the public discussion on these issues continues matters will arise from time to time which the Government would like to consider and take into account. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the extension of the powers of the NCSC to ensure the fullest reasonable access to books. I point out that the NCSC already has extensive powers, subject to certain safeguards, for the inspection of company books where criminal activity is suspected. I suspect that that is the very area which is worrying Senator Evans. The purpose test in sub-clause 12 (1) of the Bill has been introduced to ensure that the NCSC's inspection powers are not used for purposes extraneous to the prevention and detection of offences relating to companies. </PARA>
<PARA> It was not thought appropriate, in the interests of maintaining some privacy for public companies, that the NCSC should require the production of company books purely for the purposes of making recommendations to the Ministerial Council for the reform of legislation. Public submissions have been received in respect of that view. It has been noted that the powers of inspection provisions in the Companies Bill appear in substance to be as broad as the inspection powers given to the Corporations and Exchange Commission in the Corporations and Securities Industry Bill 1974. In that sense I think we have met to a very large extent the criticism implied in the amendment which has been put down by Senator Evans. </PARA>
<PARA> As to the requirement of companies to raise and maintain a prescribed minimum nominal and paid up capital, I believe this is an essential area of the corporate law. In fact, it is a matter which the Government will be continuing to monitor and, indeed, it is already well and truly incorporated in the legislation. Paragraph (5)(I), which speaks of the 'Reform of the provisions relating to companies financing dealings in their own shares', is a matter of long-standing provision in the law. In fact, it is based generally on section 67 of the Companies Act of the interstate Corporate Affairs Commission. This provision has, however, been extensively redrafted in this Bill following a detailed consideration of the matter by the interstate Corporate Affairs Commission and in the light of submissions received from the public generally.</PARA>
<PARA> The exemption mentioned in paragraph 129 (9) (b) in relation to financial assistance being given to salaried directors represents no change from the existing law and no reasons have been given as to why salaried directors should in the future be treated any differently from any other employees. In addition, it should be noted that a similar provision was contained in paragraph 171 (2) (b) of the National Companies Bill. This provision did not, however, contain the requirement that the scheme approving the issue of shares be approved by both the company and its ultimate holding company at general meetings. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of how a company is to become aware of relevant facts, case law seems to have established that the persons in the company who must have knowledge of the offence are those who constitute the directing mind and will of the company. The test case is Tesco Supermarkets Ltd v. Nattrass 1972. Exactly who these persons are in each case will, of course, have to be decided on the facts and it is not likely that the legislature could provide guidance which would be equally satisfactory in all circumstances. I believe again that area will no doubt have to be reviewed from time to time in the light of developing circumstances in the business world. Companies of today are different and business today operates so much differently from the way it operated in the nineteenth century. Therefore, we can say that the developments over time will need close watching, and that area is another one for future consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> I will just touch on the matter which was, I think, of particular interest to Senator Evans. That was the matter of trading trusts and the operation of companies acting as trustees in this situation. The provisions on trading trusts were incorporated in the April 1980 Companies Bill and were omitted from subsequent drafts because members of the Ministerial Council felt that the original provisions contained a number of defects which meant that they did not achieve their intended purpose. I add-Senator Rae pointed this out-that indeed the development of the legislative framework in this Bill has been delayed considerably by some of the reforming techniques which were adopted in the discussions at Ministerial Council level and which were subsequently found to be defective. Indeed, this area is one such affected area. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, in speaking to one of these defects, one of the stated aims of the provisions was to alert members of the public to the nature of the entity with which they might be dealing. However, the provisions were criticised on the ground that they might have actually disadvantaged members of the public because, knowing that they were dealing with a company acting as a trustee, they could have been deemed to have had constructive notice on the terms of the trust. Accordingly, potential creditors would have been forced to make expensive and often needless inquiries in order to engage in the most basic transactions. </PARA>
<PARA> Another of the stated aims of the provisions was to clarify the extent to which the assets and liabilities of the trusts were to be disclosed in the accounts of the trustee company. It was felt in many quarters, particularly in professional quarters, that the provisions clouded rather than clarified the extent of disclosure required under the existing law. Although a specific reference to trading trusts has been deleted from the Bill, there has been no lessening of the requirements of the existing law to disclose details of any trusts being carried out by companies. Of course, it is necessary to give a true and fair view of the accounts of the company itself. Further, I point out that in the present ninth schedule of the present companies Acts in the various States there is a requirement for separate disclosure of the total assets and liabilities of a trust where a trust company is involved insofar as that represents a possible contingent liability of the trust company and, as such, is available where those companies lodge their accounts with the registrar. I believe that particular area is again one which the Government will have under review from time to time. It is a matter about which the Government should and will, no doubt, accept submissions from interested persons in the community from time to time. Indeed, it is a highly relevant area of general concern. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the whole question of reform of the winding-up provisions which Senator Evans mentioned during his speech, it is indeed a very complex area of the companies legislation. Again I think it is one of those areas which would have unduly held up the development of the establishment of the legislative framework at the national level had it been entered into by way of discussion with the States at this vital stage. Accordingly, I see that area as another one for future review. No doubt the Government, with the States, will be looking at those questions from time to time. </PARA>
<PARA> In relation to the companies and securities law review committee, which Senator Evans mentioned, I am advised that the establishment of that committee has been referred to the National Companies and Securities Commission but as yet no report is available. I cannot indicate when we might expect a decision on that matter. Once again, bearing in mind the time, I thank honourable senators for their contributions to this debate. I wish the Bill a speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government opposes the amendment. I shall address myself to one or two aspects, bearing in mind the remarks which Senator Tate made earlier during the debate on the total companies legislation package. I draw his attention to paragraph 2 (B) of the amendment by which the Senate calls upon the Government to:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>ensure that all wages and compensation payments to employees are given priority over all creditors. </PARA>
<PARA>I noted that Senator Tate observed that that provision was not included in the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs and therefore goes beyond the report and is not representative of the views of the Committee. I make just one other point. It seems to me to be rather odd that whereas Senator Tate said that the amendment would have regard to the whole of the community and would ensure that the assets of a bankrupt firm would be distributed equitably amongst all persons in the community, he is drawing a distinction in this paragraph and is making a priority for those who are creditors by virtue of wages. It seems to me to be an incongruity in his argument. Of course, it is not the main reason for the Government's rejection of the amendment, but it draws his whole argument into some doubt. It is quite clear that the Government takes the view that there should be some special preference for those taxes which have been deducted from wages and that they ought to be paid in priority over other payments to the Crown. In fact, they represent moneys which are held in a form of trust by a company in relation to payments made for the Commonwealth. The Government rejects the amendment on that basis. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Opposition I indicate opposition to clauses 10 and 11 of the Companies (Acquisition of Shares) Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1981. This is the only specific matter that the Opposition proposes to debate officially in the whole Committee stage of this Bill. It is the very important matter of crossings, which are, of course, the arrangements whereby sales of shares are conducted within a broker's office. This matter arises in the context of crossings by brokers acting for an offeror either on or off market in a takeover situation. These two clauses of this Bill remove the prohibition that would otherwise operate on crossings of that kind. The Opposition's objection is to the removal of the prohibition, because we think crossings ought to continue to be prohibited in this context. The explanatory memorandum that was advanced by the Government in relation to this Bill, although there was no comment about it in the speech of the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore), made it clear that the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities had some reservations about this issue and it did not propose to proclaim these two clauses unless and until it unanimously so resolved. It is the view of the Opposition that there is something inherently bad about this kind of arrangement and the matter ought not to be so left; these provisions ought to be removed. If these provisions remain, the Government is asking the Parliament to pass into law provisions that it appears to have decided are neither desirable nor feasible. We are accommodating ourselves well enough to the proposition of handing over to the Ministerial Council the responsibility generally for these matters, but this in our view seems to go a little far.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other more substantial and immediate objection to this provision is that we have no confidence that the business rules of the stock exchanges or the self-regulatory policing activity generally of those exchanges is likely to be sufficient to ensure that crossings transactions of this kind are handled by the brokers concerned with the appropriate degree of honesty. The Minister in his reply in the other place to our suggestions to this effect, acknowledged that there was a problem here. However, he was not prepared to concede that the problem was as large as the Opposition was claiming in the other place or that I am claiming now. The Minister conceded that at least in one respect of the situation there were problems of this kind. I refer to his response on 13 May 1981 as recorded in Hansard on page 2349. This is the same speech of the Minister when he gave us a fascinating insight into Liberal values with his comment. </PARA>
<PARA> The most important thing to anyone, after health, is a person's shares or money. </PARA>
<PARA>That ought to be recorded for posterity as a fascinating insight not only into Liberal values generally but also into the values of the Moore family household. Be that as it may, another passage of his speech reads:</PARA>
<PARA> That problem can only really take place where a broker is building up a holding on behalf of an offeror prior to the offer being made. Under the circumstances of the new Bill dealing with the National Companies and Securities Commission that relates to shares prior to the 20 per cent threshold. Under those circumstances a broker acting for a offeror accumulating up to the 20 per cent mark on a rising market will, of course, be buying shares at a varying price. A client of that broker offering to sell on those price patterns needs to know of these activities or have complete trust in that broker. It is only within that context that I see a problem within the prospect of crossings. </PARA>
<PARA>I put that into the record because it indicates that the Minister, who was a very experienced stockbroker in his previous incarnation, was at least prepared to acknowledge that there is a significant potential for difficulty in that area. He went on to claim that the honesty and diligence of the broking profession were such that caution of the kind that the Opposition had was not justified. I think it is worth noting that he made at least that acknowledgment. That in short compass, is the reason for the Opposition's position. I believe it is an important point and justifies the attention which we have given it in the Committee stage. We do not propose to divide on the matter but we would appreciate a response from the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner). That is the only point that we will raise in the Committee stage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Evans has rightly drawn our attention to the Opposition's view on this clause. Of course he is correct in saying that the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities will have to agree unanimously to incorporate this clause. It is obvious that the Council will have to have a good look at this whole area, as I believe there are difficulties, as Senator Evans has acknowledged. Areas to be looked at might include the declaration of a conflict of interest by a broker. The questions which have to be addressed are whether there ought to be prohibiting advice by brokers in these situations, what price should be applied-whether it is the market price or some other price-whether in fact such rules ought apply to all crossings or whether only particular areas ought to be considered. I understand that apparently there would need to be amendments to the securities industry code to allow enforcement of relevant business rules and the setting up of disciplinary procedures for brokers, but at this stage, having acknowledged Senator Evans's point, the Government rejects the Opposition's non-amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to deal with the Crown Debts (Priority) Bill. As I understand the situation at present, there is to be an increase in the limit in respect of amounts that are to be involved in Crown debts. In regard to the priority of wages and salaries there are certain priorities in the States and in the Commonwealth. Clause 3 of the Crown Debts (Priority) Bill reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Notwithstanding any prerogative right or privilege of the Crown in right of the Commonwealth, the Crown in right of the Commonwealth is subject to any provision of a law of a State or Territory-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) relating to the order in which debts or liabilities of a body (whether corporate or unincorporate) are to be paid or discharged;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) relating to the avoidance of preferences received by creditors of a body (whether corporate or unincorporate); or</PARA>
<PARA> (c) relating to the effect on creditors or members of a body (whether corporate or unincorporate) of a compromise or arrangement between the body and another person or other persons. </PARA>
<PARA>I am advised that the priority of wages and salaries under the relevant Tasmanian Act is $600 within four months of the commencement of the winding up. So far as other States are concerned, the amount is $1,500 with no time limit prior to the relevant date. The relevant date is the date of resolution of members in a members-creditors voluntary winding up and the date of the court order in a compulsory winding up. The national Companies Bill, of course, proposes an increase in the priority wages up to a certain amount with no time limit. No change, however, is proposed in relation to the group tax priority. That, as I understand it, was the burden of Senator Tate's amendment which was defeated. I wonder whether I could make this suggestion to the Minister: In view of the limited priority now given to wages and salaries under State companies Acts and the proposed limit in the Companies Act that has been or will be dealt with, will the Minister give urgent consideration to limiting the amount of group tax claimed as a priority debt to the amount due and payable in respect of wages and salaries earned within four months of the relevant date? I wonder whether the Minister might take that on board and give me a response at some suitable time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government's policy in this area is to have unlimited access to group tax in this situation. It would require a consideration of the matter by the Government if it were to adopt Senator Harradine's suggestion. But I will refer it to the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore) and obtain a reply for him in respect of that matter. I reiterate that the Government's policy is to try to recover as much group tax as possible in the winding up of a company. I wonder, too, whether I might comment on one other aspect of Senator Harradine's speech. He spoke of the Tasmanian priority being $600.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I feel as though I am about to talk about a fruit salad, except I suppose fish and dried fruits do not make a fruit salad. Because we are debating the first reading of a money Bill I take the opportunity to raise a matter about which I have been concerned. It was, extraordinarily enough, the Australian Dried Fruits News that gave me some sort of lead to raise this matter under this legislation. The front page depicted dead trees and salt pans. At the bottom was a caption which read: 'Salt, the slow killer'. The front page created some drama that it does not always create. Of course the magazine is concerned with a matter that Australia should be much more concerned with, and that is the subject of clean water or, I suppose to be more to the point, the lack of clean water. By clean water I am not referring just to water that is free from mud or sewage, something that is hard enough to find in many parts of Australia, but also to water which is free from salt and radioactivity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Because a number of matters which fall under the heading of water and especially the lack of clean water have been drawn to my attention, I am using these Bills to raise the subject. The Australian Dried Fruits News came out with this dramatic front page saying that salt is a slow killer. Salt is a great danger to the livelihood of many vine growers in Australia and particularly in Victoria. Some work is being done to try to produce salt tolerant vines, but it is slow work. It has always seemed to me that it would be more to the point if more money, time and effort were put into finding the reason for the salt being in the water in the first place and killing the vines in Victoria and South Australia. However, I found the editorial in the magazine not so much to my liking as the front page. I felt that the editorial looked at only one problem, and looked at it from a South Australian angle. It tended to lay the blame on everybody else and especially on New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA> Anybody who has shown any interest in the matter lately and has been following any of the newspaper reports will have observed that South Australia is taking a very political attitude to New South Wales on the problem of water. It has been extraordinarily one-eyed in seeing only that New South Wales is causing the problem that South Australia has with salinity in the River Murray. The magazine editorial referred to hearings for the granting of licences for irrigation in New South Wales and to the fact that South Australian irrigators had sought to be seen as objectors to the granting of those licences. The last paragraph sums up what I am trying to say about the stand that South Australia has taken. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> The less immediate, but by far more important point at issue, is whether the present policy of the New South Wales Government is detrimental to the future development of South Australia. New South Wales rightly points out that South Australia has always been provided with the quantity of water provided under the Murray River Agreement Act and in most years has received water greatly in excess of this minimum. While this is undoubtedly true, it only serves to highlight the inadequacy of an agreement which, while ensuring that South Australia is provided with adequate water, does not also provide that the water will be of useful quality. Only a political decision can alter this Agreement. </PARA>
<PARA>What worries me is that while many people are engaging in politics on the issue not a great deal of work is being done about solving the very real problems. Anyone who cares about water quality in Australia at all would agree that the last sentence, which states that only a political decision can alter the agreement, is a political comment. It is unfortunate that at the moment that is the only way we see of solving the problem and altering the predicament. The Australian Dried Fruits News is participating in a most partisan and political way and is completely ignoring the part that Victoria plays in providing very saline water for South Australia. I would have liked to see the dried fruits growers, the vine growers and the fruit growers-the people in the south-eastern corner of Australia who depend on the River Murray-being much more vocal and much less political in this magazine. I would have liked them to be much more vocal and to ask governments to realise that the River Murray is one of the greatest resources Australia has and that a tremendous number of Australians depend on it for their very lives. It is time that Australian governments dropped their political stances and got together to make sure that the very real problems that are arising are dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA> Some members of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment-my friends Senator Jessop and Senator Mulvihill and me-only a week ago stood on the heavily silted up mouth of the Murray. To the three of us, who come from the three States that are the cause of the problem and are also affected by it, it seemed that the time had long passed when Australia should take due note of the fact that the greatest river in Australia has now no outlet to the sea. So far as we could ascertain from people who should know about the likelihood of water coming down the Murray in the next season, it will be quite a time before the Murray again has a mouth open to the sea. Indeed, it might happen that rather than water coming down the Murray to open the mouth the sea might open the mouth and take seawater up the Murray to the detriment of the lives and livelihood of a large number of people. </PARA>
<PARA> It seemed to the three of us, while standing on the mouth of the river, that governments of all political persuasions had been less than responsible in looking at the problem and in doing something about it. The silting up of the River Murray's mouth has been a problem that people knew would happen and about which nothing has been done. It is not a new problem. It has not suddenly happened, and yet nobody has moved to deal with the problem. Members of the Committee have listened to the River Murray commissioners and the people who work for the River Murray Commission. We have read reports and listened to the irrigators and the farmers. Everybody knows that the solution is that the River Murray Commission should have teeth to tackle the problem and to make decisions but, because everybody is too busy playing politics, the River Murray Commission has no teeth, the River Murray has no mouth to the sea, the water level is falling and people's lives and livelihood are in danger. </PARA>
<PARA> South Australia is trying to blame New South Wales and turning a blind eye to the part that South Australia plays. Of course, New South Wales farmers will use the water in their State. They in turn are caught up by the salt that comes into their rivers from Queensland. They too must acknowledge that a lot of the salt that flows down their rivers and into the Murray is caused because trees have been removed from catchments and land has been cleared. Victorian farmers look to use the water from their rivers and they find that because of the clearing of catchments and the clearing of land for farming they have a tremendous problem with salt. South Australian farmers look to use the Murray and they find for exactly the same reasons that they have excessive salt rising on their land. They have to use the saline water which comes down the river. </PARA>
<PARA> All three States continue the same illogical practices which exacerbate the problem. For instance, none of them has programs for replanting in either catchment or farming areas to lower the water table. None of them has plans to buy back lands demonstrably unsuited to irrigation and that type of farming. None of them has schemes to force more logical and sensible irrigation on the farmers in the States. Three States and the Federal Government form the River Murray Commission. The River Murray Waters Agreement has been on paper for too long and nothing has been done. Yet all members of the Commission know what has to be done. Victoria allows water to flood over salt prone land and so pour millions of tonnes of salt into the River Murray. Victoria has a water commission whose only solution is to collect salt in increasing numbers of salt lakes which, in turn, threaten good land. It knows what can solve the problem but does nothing about it. It has even gone to the length of finding out that the farmers themselves do not understand the causes of salinity in many areas. Victorian soil conservation officers conducted a small survey of farmers to learn how much they understood of surface and subsurface water movement and its relationship to soil salinity and erosion. The farmers were involved in gully and tunnel soil erosion problems. Half had dry land salted areas, yet did not appear to know what caused this. One would have thought that the next step would have been immediately to give those farmers information to ensure that they understood why the salinity arose, but nothing has been done. No public education program has been undertaken to make farmers more aware of the causes of their problems, that their own practices are causing the problems and that their practices are in turn causing problems for people in other parts of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In an article in the National Farmer, Jeff Jenkin, of the Victorian Soil Conservation Authority, is reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . forests are particularly effective in keeping the soil dry as the roots spread over a wide range of depths, often to 20 metres or more. The forest provides a sensitive control over the water table . . . </PARA>
<PARA> When the trees are removed (cleared) and replaced by shallow-rooted pastures or cereals, this control is lost. </PARA>
<PARA>Yet there is no program to replant, or to plant in new areas. The problem is known, as is the answer, but nothing is done. In Victoria we have reached the idiotic position in which people propose that millions of dollars should be spent on a pipeline to take the salt water to the sea. Apparently, we are to go on producing the salt water and not do anything about preventing its production. Nothing positive has been done for more than 20 years. For that period we have known what the problem was, yet have done nothing about it. </PARA>
<PARA> Similarly, New South Wales irrigates and in so doing threatens new land. But at least at the moment that State, because of the dry season that it has experienced, has restricted the use of irrigation-as indeed it should in view of the problem that it faces. Those restrictions were announced after storage figures released by the New South Wales Water Resources Commission revealed that water in some dams had fallen to the lowest recorded levels. Mr Gordon, the Minister for Water Resources, is reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA> Irrigation activities in some river valleys in New South Wales will be severely curtailed if the dry weather continues . . . </PARA>
<PARA>He added that only 60 per cent of the allocations made on the River Murray would be available, and only half of the normal quantities would be released into the Murrumbidgee. Therefore, it does not really matter if South Australia takes New South Wales to court. That will not provide the water that South Australia needs for the very life of its population, nor will it provide the water it needs for its farming areas. It will take a lot more than just one State threatening legal action against another to provide water in the condition and amount needed if we are ever to restore adequate supplies. It is extraordinary that South Australia should talk of taking New South Wales to court over whether it is preventing South Australia from obtaining water when it wants to use the water from the Murray River for the Roxby Downs uranium mine. I would have thought that by this stage South Australia would be getting its priorities right. Rather than go to court it should practise co-operation and urge that teeth be given to the River Murray Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> It has been said to me cynically in the last few weeks-and I believe it-that if the Murray flowed the other way South Australia might not have quite the same attitude to the use of water from that river that it does at the moment, but I do not believe that it is useful to engage in political by-play when people's lives are threatened. We have had evidence that salinity can be seriously detrimental to health; that the increasing amount of salt in Australian water can cause hypertension and heart disease. We have now two States, South Australia and Western Australia, which face a serious problem from salt in drinking water, so it is time for co-operation between all States and for firm political action on such matters. </PARA>
<PARA> But I find that South Australia is not happy just to have real problems with domestic water from the Murray and increasing salinity in its farming areas. Apparently it plans to use monstrous amounts of water for Roxby Downs. I find that it is also planning a uranium mine-the Honeymoon project-which is to use the in situ leeching method which employs a large amount of water to produce the final product. The environmental impact statement that was provided to the State Government and eventually to the Federal Government gives no account of how serious ground water contamination would be prevented if this method of uranium mining were employed. I am astonished that, in an area in which water is at a premium, neither the South Australian Government nor the Federal Government has demanded that the company involved show how it will deal with the matter. The environmental impact statement that it submitted was ridiculous. It gave no information on how the company planned either to obtain the water or to prevent or deal with the pollution of ground water that could arise. I am astonished that a State which is so sensitive to the use of water and the maintenance of clean water supplies should have shown so little sensitivity to a project that could damage its water resource in this way. </PARA>
<PARA> I find uranium mining threatening fresh water supplies in other parts of Australia also. I want now to refer to a case in Queensland. People may or may not be aware that recently a hearing was held in the Mining Warden's Court in Charters Towers about a proposal in respect of a uranium mine at Ben Lomond operated by Minatome Australia Pty Ltd. The company sought permission to lease additional areas to accommodate its tailings and waste water dams. It is of interest to note that finally the Mining Warden recommended that the application be rejected. His finding which provides certain interesting information about what could happen in the area, states in part:</PARA>
<PARA> The lack of hydrogeological study of the area has been pointed out, and evidence called to show that faulting and fracturing is abundant in the area. This has not been denied by the applicants witnesses who contend that such studies will take place at a later stage when more detailed engineering will take place. The objector has called evidence to show the unsuitability of the clay in the area for use as a sealer in the Evaporation Ponds and Tailings dumps, and also to encapsulate those area in their final stablisation. Evidence of the highly erosive quality of the country has been given and of the exceptionally high rainfalls which might be expected from time to time, which it is contended by the Objector would render stabilisation of contaminated wastes and tailings over a very long term impracticable. </PARA>
<PARA> There is some doubt as to the identity and quality of all the toxic materials which might be expected to accumulate in the evaporation ponds during the lifetime of the mining operation. </PARA>
<PARA> It appears that there must be some seepage or leakage from the evaporation ponds whilst they contain water during the mining operation, and that there is also danger of movement of water through the residue in the evaporation ponds when mining is finished and through tailings which have been placed in the dump and the open pit. It appears to me that only detailed hydrological and geological study can provide the necessary information on which to base any decision as to the suitability of the sites for the establishment of the evaporation ponds and tailings dumps. As to the long term isolation of tailings and wastes it also appears that such study is essential. </PARA>
<PARA>The mining warden finally determined:</PARA>
<PARA> However it is my opinion that it is the treatment of ore in this area and the long term storage of tailings and residues in the area which drains into Keelbottom Creek and ultimately the Burdekin River--</PARA>
<PARA>That would mean into the Burdekin Dam-</PARA>
<PARA>which are the main matters for concern. </PARA>
<PARA> I recommend to the Minister that this application be rejected in so far as it relates to the area to be used for the evaporation ponds, the tailings dump and the treatment plant and facilities pertaining thereto. </PARA>
<PARA>I am anxious to know whether the Federal Government will take that matter seriously. A wardens court was asked to weight up the evidence as to whether this mine could contaminate not only the ground water but also the very creek, river and dam water in an area that sustains a large population. The warden has maintained that this mine cannot continue because he cannot see that the company's plans will prevent contamination. Will the Federal Government then step in and say to this particular firm: 'You can stop right now because we will not give you a permit to export until such time as you can show us without any doubt that your mine and its workings will not contaminate the water?' What has worried people such as Senators Mulvihill and Jessop and me is that we cannot see the Federal Government or any State government taking the whole question of water seriously. Many people in Australia say blithely and as a throwaway line that this is the driest continent in the world. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Exactly. That is something I was coming to, Senator Mulvihill. It seems to me that, until we have a government with vision and a sense of nation and a government that really establishes and accepts that water is one of the most precious resources in Australia and that without it people will die and there will be no industry, no manufacturing, no mines and no food, and until we take the matter seriously, prevent the contamination of water and store it, we are not really facing up to one of the most important and serious problems that Australia has. In area after area in State after State we find that after water has been contaminated and after projects have been allowed to proceed, governments use political ploys to blame somebody else. They cry poor mouth, blame the Federal Government and do anything but face up to the very real problem and combine as one nation to deal with the problem. I hope that this Government, my colleagues in this place and the Committee on which I have been proud to serve will continue to take up the matter and to press governments to deal with it as a matter of urgency.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also want to take the opportunity presented by this first reading of a money Bill to raise a matter that I regard as very important. I would like to support what Senator Melzer has already said about the need to adopt a national approach to the problems associated with water supplies throughout this country and to commend her on her very constructive and well-meaning speech. Of course, the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment of which I am Chairman has examined the problem in a peripheral way. We know that reports have been presented to Parliament and that recommendations have been made repeatedly concerning the need to provide the River Murray Commission with power to deal with water quality. We know that it already has the power to deal with water quantity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We became impatient, and justifiably we are becoming more and more impatient, because agreement was reached in principle by the four governments concerned about 10 years ago and there has been continual procrastination over that period with respect to ratifying the agreement and putting it into legislative form. I am glad that in recent times things are improving. The only government causing a problem at the moment-I think it has only a very minor difficulty-is the New South Wales Government. Only yesterday I was talking to Senator Carrick about the matter. He feels quite confident that this minor problem will be overcome very shortly. I hope that by the Budget Session-unhappily Senator Melzer will not be here to see it-we may be passing the appropriate legislation through the chamber to give effect to that agreement in principle. Even so, I would have doubts as to whether that is the total answer because the River Murray Commission, as you know, Mr President, has to have unanimity with respect to decisions that are made. Our Committee thinks that ought to be looked at to provide for a majority decision rather than for a unanimous decision of the four governments concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say in defence of South Australia that that State has been anxious to complete the agreement. Certainly it took New South Wales to task in the High Court; and I appreciate what Senator Melzer said about that. South Australia has to develop its economy and to do that it has to rely on mining developments. What Senator Melzer said was quite right-without proper and adequate water supplies those enterprises cannot be carried out. I think industry in Australia must recognise that it cannot develop anything without an adequate water supply. I believe governments could consult with the big industries of Australia with the object of arriving at some way in which we can encourage them to put finance into the hands of government to assist to overcome some of the real problems we have with respect to salinity mitigation, water storage generally and so on. Perhaps the Government ought to be looking at a two to one subsidy. I am glad that the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) is in the chamber. She might regard it as of economic interest to the country to encourage industry to enter into partnership with the Government to come to grips with the whole question of our national water supply. I commend that thought to the Minister. I may even take it up in another area at a future time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. That could be an added economic reason why some encouragement should be given to industry to take a positive interest in this matter. Only the other day I was talking to a gentleman called Jack Beale, a former Liberal member of the New South Wales Parliament, who has written a sensible and logical series of articles concerned with green Australia. He said he had talked to an industrialist the other day who wanted to develop a mining enterprise somewhere in Australia. I cannot remember the actual details of it. Strangely enough, one of the last things thought about was water. This has become a serious problem. I believe it is a matter that we could do a lot more about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I wish to speak of my concern about the grain storage facilities in Australia. Honourable senators may recall that in 1977 I raised this matter following an explosion in the United States of America which resulted in 38 people being killed and 46 people being injured. The Weekend Australian of 31 December 1977 reported some comments I had made. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The Chairman of the Senate standing committee for science and the environment, Senator Jessop, yesterday said the Government should lay down uniform specifications for silo construction and proposed examination of a $5m to $7m scheme to safeguard existing silos. </PARA>
<PARA>I went on to say that if this were done we could establish throughout Australia a system of silos that could be sealed. Nitrogen could be introduced into those silos for two very useful purposes. First, it would kill the weevils without endangering human health. At present pesticides, which are sometimes harmful, are used. Nitrogen would have a very important effect. The other quite significant point is that nitrogen is an inert gas and its use would totally eliminate the possibility of explosion or fire. I believe that we are dealing with a quite significant industry in Australia which has an annual value, in the wheat area alone, of something in excess of $2 billion. Each year 55,000 farmers produce something in the order of 10 million tonnes of wheat. Of this, 77 per cent is exported and 23 per cent is used domestically. </PARA>
<PARA> I think this is a problem which needs to be looked at very seriously. It is all very well for people to say that the chance of an explosion in silos in Australia is very remote. In only April this year there was yet another example in the United States of America of what could happen here. I have an article which appeared in the Australian Financial Review of 5 May at page 31. It states:</PARA>
<PARA> Yet another grain elevator explosion has occurred in the US, this time killing seven people, and investigating experts are having trouble finding a reason for the blast. The explosion occurred on April 7 at the Texan port of Corpus Christi, where investigators say the port authority followed all the safety instructions laid down by the Federal Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The explosion also injured 32 people and severely damaged several 45-metre-high silos. </PARA>
<PARA> It is the most recent of several fatal grain elevator explosions in the US in recent years. </PARA>
<PARA>I have referred to the other more serious explosion which cost 38 lives and injured 46 people. A third explosion in 1978 killed three people and injured six. It seems to me that we cannot ignore the possibility of the same thing happening in this country. I think it may well be appropriate to examine the whole matter of rationalising the overseas grain sale facilities in some way. At the time when I last raised this matter I welcomed the suggestion by the then Chairman of the Australian Wheat Board, Sir Leslie Price, that wheat silos built in the future should be sealed to prevent explosions. I ventured to suggest that I did not think the Board could make such a decision. I do not know just who could because several authorities are involved. We have the Australian Barley Board and the Wheat Board. Would it be a good idea to suggest that there ought to be a grains board to take responsibility for the problem that I am mentioning?</PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me to be quite silly that, for example, four people go to Japan on the same day to sell wheat for Australia. It seems to me to be uneconomic and deserving of some rationalisation. I know that bulk handling in the States is done by instrumentalities. It is very difficult to get agreement under the present system because all those instrumentalities, quite properly, jealously guard their positions. It seems to me that it is time that we examined the matter again and looked at possible solutions to what I regard as being quite a dangerous situation if it is allowed to continue. Better storage facilities would also protect the valuable crops we grow in this country. </PARA>
<PARA> I will refer to one or two advantages of nitrogen treatment of silos. It is certainly widely accepted by the Wheat Board and the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation that nitrogen can be used and is used to bring about inert atmospheres in silos. There are many advantages. There is no possibility of insects developing resistance to oxygen depleted atmosphere; there is no pollution; there is no smell or tainting of the grain; there is no danger to humans in areas neighbouring treatment enclosures; there is no rejection by purchasing countries because of the presence of toxic pesticides residues; no overseas exchange is required to develop, establish or operate the proposed system; there are no detrimental effects to grain-even the germinative quality is preserved; there is no spontaneous combustion hazard; there is no rodent survival; and, there is minimal dependence on fossil fuels as an associated energy resource. </PARA>
<PARA> I have some notes concerning the bulk handling authorities in each State where there is a company which is paid a fee by the Australian Wheat Board to receive, store and deliver wheat. Unfortunately, all these bodies are autonomous and the Wheat Board has no jurisdiction over them. Consequently, the industry is most fragmented. I have other notes that I think are of interest. In the interests of saving time I seek leave to have this information incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Bulk Handling Bodies</PARA>
<PARA> In each State there is a company which is paid a fee by the Australian Wheat Board to receive, store and deliver wheat. Unfortunately, all of these bodies are autonomous and the Wheat Board has no substantial jurisdiction over them, and consequently the industry is a most fragmented one. Such elementary policies as there being no standard design for silos and although CSIRO have recommended Nitrogen to be used, there are still silos under construction which would be almost impossible to make gas tight. </PARA>
<PARA> The CSIRO has suggested to all of the Bulk Handling Authorities, that they use at least two silos with an atmosphere of Nitrogen during this year. To date Victoria, South Australia and Queensland have done that. </PARA>
<PARA>CSIRO Trials</PARA>
<PARA> The first silo to be used for trials was in a flour mill at Port Adelaide of 5,000 bushel capacity. This was an outstanding success and so it was decided that the next trial in conjunction with CSIRO would be at Bordertown to be followed up at Balaklava-both in South Australia. These silos were both of 7,000 tonne capacity or 250,000 bushells. </PARA>
<PARA> The dimensions of the silo being about 90 feet high by 75 feet diameter. The temperature of the grain ranged from 24*C-34*C, with a moisture content of 11.5 per cent. About thirty polythene tubes were lowered into the silos at various depths and different placements so that when the grain was put into the silo, it would enable us to get the various atmosphere readings in the different situations. At the time of the PVC tubes going in, cages of infested grain and the whole life cycle of the weevil were also lowered at different spacings. </PARA>
<PARA> The reasons for getting the various atmospheric readings, was to check on the convection currents in the grain where there is a 40 per cent air space. </PARA>
<PARA>Oxygen Content</PARA>
<PARA> It is desirable to have the oxygen content below 2 per cent. The maximum allowable amount to kill is presently 1 per cent, where it can be achieved. </PARA>
<PARA>Insect Pests Regeneration</PARA>
<PARA> Given the ideal conditions, it is possible for a pair of weevil to produce about 220,000 progeny in the life cycle of the pair of sixteen weeks. The female weevil becomes sexually mature in the first week of her life and she lays her first eggs in one month. </PARA>
<PARA>Insects' Habits</PARA>
<PARA> The weevil eats a hole into the grain, she then backs into the hole, lays her eggs and seals the grain with saliva. The progeny then emerges about one month later, but during that period and the whole life cycle of the weevil, it breathes oxygen and so by denying them the said oxygen, a complete kill is assured. </PARA>
<PARA>Silos</PARA>
<PARA> Australia has about 2,500 vertical concrete structures which equals one-third of the total storage only. Many of these are very old, and consequently of poor concrete, and a large number of them have had the tops put on them in fairly recent times. In consequence, none of them are gas or air tight and so we are now in throes of doing just that. </PARA>
<PARA>Sealing of silos</PARA>
<PARA> Fortunately, whilst negotiating with Dunlop for the re-cycling of rubber crumbs, I found that they had through their subsidiary company, Beta Chemical Companies, a water soluble neoprin rubber solution. This, when sprayed onto concrete is absorbed into the pores and remains in an elastic condition for a very long period. It has a 200 per cent stretch and so when a silo is under stress, the seal moves with the silo and does not break. </PARA>
<PARA>Introduction of Nitrogen</PARA>
<PARA> The photographs will show how the liquid is placed in position and there are two methods of distribution of the gaseous nitrogen in the silo-from the manhole where a 2'' line is clearly seen. In one case we connected a 2'' perforated polythene tubing about 4 feet in from the wall of the silo with the holes pointing down to the floor so that when the gas was put in at about 50,000 cubic feet per hour, it would hit the floor and it would then be deflected upwards through the grain. The second method was to have two inlets at different manholes with a free flow of gas at again about 50,000 cubic feet per hour. </PARA>
<PARA> In a silo of 250,000 bushells, it takes about 24 hours for a complete diffusion to get the atmosphere down to under 1 per cent. The convection currents played peculiar tricks, however, in the 24 hours the atmosphere stabilises and we finish with the said 1 per cent of oxygen only. </PARA>
<PARA>Distribution</PARA>
<PARA> In Australia nearly all silos are located on railway lines and in some centres batteries of silos so that it is conceivable that we place an evaporator in a central position and the gas can be piped into each silo. The evaporator can then be filled either from a road tanker or as is done in the United Kingdom, from a nitrogen train. </PARA>
<PARA>Farm Silos</PARA>
<PARA> The CSIRO is anxious that the Australian Wheat Board, through the Bulk Handling Authorities, insist on the farmers having their own storage and endeavouring to kill the insect pests before they are delivered to the rail siding. When this happens it will be wonderful business for us as each farmer would need gas in cylinders and appropriate equipment. At this moment, the South Australian Department of Agriculture has set a pattern which could be adopted by all other State Departments of Agriculture whereby grain will be inspected at the siding silo, and if it is infested the grower will be either forced to have his grain fumigated or will have a substantial amount docked from his proceeds by the Bulk Handling Authority. </PARA>
<PARA>Gas Mixtures</PARA>
<PARA> Some 2 or 3 years ago, I asked Bill Bailey, the Chief Scientist in charge of grain storage, if the metabolism of the insect pests is upset by having them in an atmosphere with a minimum of oxygen and, if so, we may be able to combine some other poison which would kill the insects in a shorter period. He agreed that this would be desirable and so I feel that our Pestigas (which contains pyrethrin in a Carbon Dioxide propellant) and Insectigas (which is dichlorhos) will be very much in demand under the South Australian grain hygiene program. </PARA>
<PARA>Samoa</PARA>
<PARA> Whilst in Samoa in December, I learned that they are having considerable problems with the storage of coffee, cocoa, and copra from their own production and imported hops and barley for a brewery which is about to be built and also stock feeds. </PARA>
<PARA> I have put the Samoan authorities in touch with CSIRO who have had experience with these commodities and I think it is likely that gas tight silos will be built. </PARA>
<PARA>Pacific Area</PARA>
<PARA> From what I could see in Samoa with foodstuff shortage, there must be an equivalent problem in other areas. The extract from the Financial Review on Friday, 13 May 1977, is a most interesting one so far as Papua New Guinea is concerned, but the indication that coffee prices are going to boom for some time may be a sufficient enticement to get the local authorities in each country where you are located, to take some action in storage, and I think I could probably be of some assistance from my experience with grain, which after all is a parallel case. </PARA>
<PARA>S.E. Asia</PARA>
<PARA> Figures taken from the United Nations Statistical Year Book 1969 giving the production of rice grain of 24 nations, and in the last year showing China's crop. </PARA>
<PARA> The loss in the rice crop is up to 50 per cent annually due to weevil, rodents, insects, birds and rain. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us be conservative and allow a loss of only 10 per cent, this means that of a total of 247,557,000 metric tons, and allowing the conservative amount of 1 lb of rice per Asian per day (when in actual fact the minimum for existence is 15 ounces) the loss incurred would provide food for 147 million people. </PARA>
<PARA> Our nearest neighbour, Indonesia, has a production of 15,500,000 metric tons of rice per year, and based on the same forumla they could provide food sufficient for 9,500,000 additional Indonesians or, at 50 rupiah per litre, this would return them about $213m per year. </PARA>
<PARA> According to the United Nations, 1,000 million of the world's population of 3,700 million live in dire poverty. </PARA>
<PARA> Why send tractors under our aid programme to increase food production, when it is consumed by pests?</PARA>
<PARA> My idea is to spend the money on building gas tight silos with an indefinite life, so that the rice can be stored in them and then when they require wheat they purchase ours. This would be conditional when we build the silos, either prefabricated in Australia and welded on site, or concrete ones erected in each country. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2G7">Senator JESSOP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Another point I suggest in the whole context of silo treatment is that it may well be appropriate for the Government to consider making this part of a foreign aid program. When I was in Canada just before Christmas at a science and technology policy conference one country represented was Kenya. Kenya is a very unsophisticated country technologically. One of its main problems seems to be how it can store grain because weevil and other infestations that tend to contaminate the food. I know we provide help on silos in certain countries. It occurred to me that it may well be very appropriate to consider a program of constructing, in some countries in Africa and South East Asia, silos which can be insulated and treated with nitrogen so as to guarantee that the grain made available in those countries for the food of the people is protected adequately. I hope that one or two of those suggestions might attract the attention of the Government and that some action might be forthcoming.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to use the debate on the first reading of these Bills to raise two matters which I believe need airing in the Federal Parliament. One of the matters relates to the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme and the other matter relates to social security. Both matters have strong connections. Both indicate that some sections of the bureaucracy take it upon themselves to adopt a big brother attitude. I mention first the matter relating to the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme which I will refer to as TEAS from now on. I was most surprised to read in yesterday's edition of the Courier-Mail a suggestion that the Federal Government might set up a force to track down students who were overpaid under TEAS. I would like to quote some parts of the report in the Brisbane Courier-Mail. It reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Federal Government might set up a force of people trained in self defence and social work to track down students who were overpaid under the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Education Department's state assistant director, Mr Joe Kelly, said federal police used to do the job but found they already had too much work. </PARA>
<PARA>The article states further:</PARA>
<PARA> The department was trying to resolve the issue and a force of people trained in recovering over-payments seemed the best solution. </PARA>
<PARA>This seems to me to be an amazing suggestion. In recent times we have been told that there will be a reintroduction of fees for certain students at universities and colleges of advanced education. Secondly, we have been told that a student loans scheme will be introduced. Due to the introduction of the student loans scheme the real value of TEAS will probably decrease as time goes by. Thirdly, it has been suggested that the Government should set up a force of people trained in self-defence and social work to track down students who have been overpaid. I do not know whether the person who made this suggestion was making it as an official suggestion, one that is the official policy of the Government. If it is official policy, I ask the Government to look at it to see whether it can reverse this decision. If it is not official policy of the Government, I suggest that the Government dissociate itself from this almost unbelievable suggestion that it should set up a force of people trained in self-defence and social work to track down students who have been overpaid. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter I wish to raise is concerned with the Department of Social Security. In particular, I refer to the area of responsibility of field officers. It has always been my belief that the primary role of field officers in the Department of Social Security is to assist social security beneficiaries. However, I have been informed that some field officers-I am not sure how widespread this practice is-are maintaining what would be called in police parlance a kill sheet. The field officers concerned are using a more euphemistic term than a kill sheet. They are calling it a savings book. The idea of a savings book apparently is that when they detect someone who is on a benefit but who should not be receiving it and they are successful in taking that person off that benefit, they enter in their savings book how much they have saved for the Government by having that person taken off the benefit. For instance, if a person is receiving a supporting parent's benefit and the field officer is successful in taking that person off the supporting parent's benefit the field officer enters a certain amount in his savings book. He might enter the amount of $5,000 or $4,000 or whatever the cost might have been for the whole year. If a person is taken off the unemployment benefit for some reason the field officer would then enter a certain amount. It would not be based on a yearly figure; I am told that it is probably based on a four-monthly figure, the idea being that the person would probably have continued on the unemployment benefit for another four months. </PARA>
<PARA> It seems to me that having a savings book-this is the parlance used in the Department of Social Security-is in direct conflict with the philosophy of social welfare. I am not quite sure what use is to be made of the material put in the savings book. I do not know whether these details are entered so that some statistics can be developed within the Department of Social Security to indicate that these field officers are in fact worth while in an economic sense because they save the Government so much a year. I mentioned earlier that I believe the field officers' primary role should be different from that. It should be to assist social security beneficiaries. </PARA>
<PARA> I know from the short time that I worked as a public servant in the police department that the kill sheet is a very important record. The kill sheet is looked at when people come up for promotion, especially plain clothes police officers. If their kill sheet is a good one it indicates that their clear-up rate is good, although that might be debatable. It is a measure of their clear-up rate and if they have a good kill sheet, they are then considered for promotion. I am not sure whether the same thing is happening in the Department of Social Security if these savings books are in fact kept. I would not say that it would be an official policy that one would have a look at a person's savings book record when he or she comes up for promotion. But if that savings book is there the possibility exists for a supervisor to look at it to get some idea of the work value of the person who is looking for promotion. I ask the Government whether it can have a look at these savings books to see whether they are of any use to the Department and whether they are providing statistics that the Department definitely needs. If they are not, I suggest that the use of the savings books be discontinued. </PARA>

<PARA> The speeches read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>Dried Fruits (Export Inspection Charge) Bill 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is associated with other Bills just introduced for export inspection charges on fishery products. The purpose of this Bill is to impose charges for the export inspection of dried fruit, from 1 July 1981. The Government's intention is to recover approximately half the total inspection costs of these products. A maximum rate of charge is specified, namely $11.00 per tonne. The actual rate of charge will be specified in regulations. It is proposed that a rate of $5.50 per tonne for exports in 1981-82 be recommended to the Governor-General for promulgation in regulations. On the basis of long term export averages, charges at this rate will yield approximately $259,000 in a full year. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA>Dried Fruit (Export Inspection Charge) Collection Bill 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is associated with the Dried Fruit (Export Inspection Charge) Bill 1981 just introduced. It is designed to provide for the collection of charges proposed in that Bill. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA>Fish (Export Inspection Charge) Bill 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to introduce, as from 1 July 1981, charges to recoup part of the cost borne by the Commonwealth for inspecting fish for export. This is part of the Government's program to recover costs of providing export inspection for certain agricultural and fishery products. Export inspection is designed to ensure that products meet minimum standards of quality, hygiene and presentation when exported. In 1979 the Government introduced charging for meat, grain and wool inspection aimed at recovering approximately 50 per cent of the inspection costs of the Commonwealth. The Government proposes that fees aimed at a similar level of recovery should be imposed for similar services provided by my Department to seafood exporters. </PARA>
<PARA> Turning to specifics in this Bill, honourable senators will see that it provides for the recovery of fish export inspection costs to be achieved through charges on fish inspected for export and for which an export permit has been issued under the Exports (Fish) Regulations. The Bill provides that the person to whom an export permit is issued under the Exports (Fish) Regulations is liable to pay the charge. Exemptions may be provided in the regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> To achieve the 50 per cent cost recovery, it is proposed that the following rates be recommended to the Governor-General for promulgation by regulation; rock lobster-3.9c per kilogram; all other shellfish except oysters, squid, cuttlefish and octopus-2.5c per kilogram; all other fish except oysters in the shell or half shell-0.34c per kilogram; oysters in the shell or half shell-1c per dozen. On current estimates of fish exports for 1981-82 these rates will yield approximately $1m in a full year. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA>Fish (Export Inspection Charge) Collection Bill 1981</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> This Bill is related to the Fish (Export Inspection Charge) Bill 1981 just introduced. Its purpose is to provide for the collection of charges proposed in that Bill. It follows the provisions for the collection of levies in other export inspection charge legislation. Specifically, provision is made for exporters to pay charges due to the Commonwealth for the inspection of fish for which an export permit has been issued under the Exports (Fish) Regulations. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; The Opposition is not opposing the export charge and export collection Bills relating to fish and dried fruit. The measures extend a principle first adopted by the Government in the notorious mini-Budget of May 1979-that principle being that 50 per cent or thereabouts of the actual costs incurred by the Commonwealth in providing inspection services ought to be recovered from the exporter by way of levy on the product. A comment is in order because of the disparate attitudes that the Government had adopted in continuing the export inspection service under complete government control while it is simultaneously proposed in a document that the Government should opt out of providing what amounts to comparable services through the Australian Wool Testing Authority; that is, a guarantee given by a government authority to purchasers stipulating particular minimum standards of quality and so on.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Although we are not opposing these Bills because we have no objection in principle to cost recovery of 50 per cent-there may even be something to be said for cost recovery of above 50 per cent-I refer to the absurdity of raising the trivial amount of $1m or $1.5m in revenue from the primary industry sector by imposing charges of this type when, simultaneously, the Government has before the House a Bill which provides for a stupid tax concession which was originally to apply to the storage of fuel on farms. It would have cost revenue at least $70m if, as a result of that concession being introduced, farmers were persuaded to store on farms an extra six months' supply-a measure which would provide a means of storing any given quantity of fuel at five times the total cost of an alternative and superior way of storing fuel. The difference in those two costs would relate entirely to the different sizes of the likely storages which would be used. I refer to the differences between a few hundred large storages held at regional locations and 100,000 small storages being scattered around on farms all over the country. The same quantity of fuel could be stored in the large regional storages at 20 per cent of the total cost of this scheme. Even if the Government paid entirely for those regional storages the cost to Government revenue would still be less than half what it will be under the legislation proposed by the Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate is considering legislation to provide a massive bonus for the inefficient storage of fuel in the form of a tax rort promised by the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) in the lead up to the last election which on farms alone, if it is to be effective in achieving its stated objective, will cost Government revenue $70m. Absurd, trivial Bills such as this are being introduced to recover a tiny fraction of that revenue from basically the same sector. The likely cost to the agricultural sector is $70m. The modifications and extensions provided by the Government between the time the Prime Minister promised the legislation and the time the legislation was introduced in the Senate will significantly increase that cost. </PARA>
<PARA> This leaning towards tax rorts, tax deductions, is a function of a crazy man's notion that the fiscal effects of tax deductions are qualitatively different from the fiscal effects of government expenditure. They are, of course, precisely the same. One might draw some consolation from the possibility that we will not have to put up with this man for very much longer. The Liberal Party is clearly applying a new, updated version of its infamous domino theory of the 1960s. One domino fell in Sydney yesterday and one domino fell in Melbourne today. Which domino will fall tomorrow? In stating a personal preference, I have great difficulty in deciding whether I would prefer the domino in Perth or the domino in Canberra to fall. I do not think the domino in Perth will fall. The domino in Canberra will fall, if not tomorrow, in the not very distant future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Statute Law Revision Bill is a fascinating Bill, for the contents of which the Government is to be much congratulated. I say at the outset, however, that the Government is not to be especially congratulated for insisting on the debate on this Bill being brought on just 24 hours after its introduction without the Opposition having been given an opportunity to go through the normal procedure of debate in party committees, the party executive and the party room. Nor has there been an opportunity for the meaning and implications of what are in some respects quite unfamiliar new concepts in the Bill to be explained to one's colleagues. Nor has there been an opportunity to make a detailed check of the 50-odd pages of technical drafting to ensure that the Bill does what the Government says it does and that no swifties are being pulled. I make that protest quite genuinely. I appreciate the pressure of parliamentary business and the fact that the Government no doubt anticipated that the Bill would be uncontroversial, but I make more than a merely formal objection because important issues are involved in what I have just said. However, there is nothing I can do about that aspect so I shall move on to the more substantial issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The substance of the Bill involves two quite significant innovations. The first innovation is the very existence of the Bill as a vehicle-a compendious vehicle-for tidying up oversights, errors and oddities that creep into even the best laid drafting plans and also to accommodate minor changes that become necessary because of changing circumstances. The Opposition notes that it is the Government's intention to introduce housekeeping Bills of this kind at least once each year, and perhaps every sitting. I, for one, certainly applaud that as a rational legislative measure aiding in the avoidance of the unnecessary cluttering of the parliamentary process with what are on any view small issues most of the time. However, I believe that a genuine ground for concern has been expressed in a number of quarters-this was adverted to by the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) in his second reading speech-about amendments accomplished by a Bill of this kind being, as it were, hidden from the eyes of inquiring lawyers and others with an interest in keeping track of the state of statute law at any given time. However, I note his ensuring that the Government Printer is now generating the monthly tables of legislation which will make clearer than such tables have in the past the implications of Bills such as this for changes in statutes that are not overtly identified in the title of the Bill. I am prepared to accept that that measure should be enough to satisfy that concern, but it is a matter that the Opposition will keep under review. </PARA>
<PARA> The other innovation accomplished by this Bill, which is otherwise quite uncontroversial and quite uninteresting, is the amendment to the Acts Interpretation Act, accomplished by what is on any view a quite remarkably well hidden clause appearing in small type in the Schedule to the Bill in the form of a two-paragraph amendment to that Act. Indeed, it was so well hidden that had it not been for the Attorney issuing a Press release to draw attention to it it may well have passed unnoticed since he did not even draw the attention of the Parliament specifically to it, at least in his oral remarks as I recall them, the substance of the second reading speech having simply been incorporated. Having emerged into the daylight, by one means or another, the provision is undoubtedly a fascinating one. It is in the form of a new section 15AA of the Acts Interpretation Act, preceded by the marginal heading 'regard to be had to the purpose or object of Act'. Paragraph (1) states:</PARA>
<PARA> In the interpretation of a provision of an Act, a construction that would promote the purpose or object underlying the Act (whether that purpose or object is expressly stated in the Act or not) shall be preferred to a construction that would not promote that purpose or object. </PARA>
<PARA>Paragraph (2) states:</PARA>
<PARA> Nothing in sub-section (1) shall be construed as authorising in the interpretation of a provision of an Act, the consideration of any matter or document not forming part of the Act for any purpose for which that matter or document could not be considered apart from that sub-section. </PARA>
<PARA>In paragraph (2) the object is to preserve for the moment the prohibition on the courts having regard to extrinsic materials-although I note that the Attorney clearly foreshadowed a willingness or inclination to get rid of that prohibition and to give some positive statutory encouragement in the future for the courts to look to material of this kind. I will revert to that matter in a moment. The explanation given by the Attorney, in his second reading speech, of this proposed new section, was quite succinct, as is the Attorney's want at least on paper. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The effect of the provision to be inserted in the Acts Interpretation Act will be to confirm that in interpreting provisions regard is to be had to the object or purpose underlying the Act in question. </PARA>
<PARA>I am not among those people who would say that the general approach of our courts is at present overly legalistic. I think there is scope for expressly stating that the statutes that we make are to be interpreted in a purposive manner. Tax decisions constitute a topical and important example that will come readily to all senators' minds, but the matter has wide implications and extends to many other statutes. The Attorney is cautious to the last in his acknowledgment of the utility of progressive values being applied in this area of the law, but he is to be applauded, if not for the way he said it then certainly for the fact that he has said it and for what he has done. It is a splendid innovation and one which the Opposition wholeheartedly applauds. </PARA>
<PARA> We note that although the Attorney elsewhere in his second reading speech indicated some obeisance, if not obeisance than at least acknowledgment, to suggestions in relation to legislative proposals of this kind in the United Kingdom but which have not yet merged to fruition and although he also paid due regard to the suggestions or noises that have been made in this respect by some distinguished law Lords, including Lord Scarman and Lord Wilberforce, he did not pay due regard to the role that the Opposition has played in suggesting this innovation. I refer in this instance, as I have several times today, to the role of the honourable member for Hawker, Mr Jacobi, who I am delighted to see is in the Gallery. On 2 April in the House of Representatives he put a question to the Treasurer, Mr Howard, which ran in part as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Will the Treasurer now consider an appropriate amendment to oblige Australian courts to alter their canons on the construction or their interpretation of taxation laws so that such laws are applied in accordance with the intent of this Parliament? Does the Treasurer agree that such amendments are necessary to strenghten the redrafted section 260 and section 135 of the Act?</PARA>
<PARA>To this very positive and explicit suggestion the Treasurer, Mr Howard, replied as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> As to his specific request that legislative action be taken to indicate to the courts what approach they should adopt in interpreting statutes, that sort of issue more properly lies within the responsibility of my colleague, the Attorney-General, to whom I will refer what the honourable gentleman has said.</PARA>
<PARA>He expressed a reservation which I will come back to in a moment about the desirability of any such innovation not threatening the independence of the judiciary. Certainly there was a clear acknowledgement of the utility of Mr Jacobi's suggestion. It is evident that that suggestion was passed on to the Attorney-General and has borne fruit. It may be that independent minds, as well-constructed and cast as that of Mr Jacobi, were already working on this suggestion within the Department. I take the point that there is an obvious nexus on the public record between this suggestion and the legislation which now comes forward. I would be interested to know whether the Attorney-General is prepared to acknowledge the contribution that the Opposition has made, through the person of Mr Jacobi, in stimulating this initiative. </PARA>
<PARA> There can be no doubt of the very real importance of this amendment and of its potential significance across the whole broad sphere of legal interpretation so far as the Federal statutes to which it immediately applies are concerned but also perhaps beyond that into the whole area of statutory interpretation generally and ultimately even into the area of constitutional law about which I will say something in a moment. Clearly the most revolutionary immediate significance of this Bill and this proposed new section in the Acts Interpretation Act is likely to be in the area of taxation law. I find it difficult to regard it as a coincidence that this measure has been introduced on the same day as the Government's new Part IVA of the tax legislation. I applaud that conjunction of legislative initiatives from the Government, even though it will be necessary to express next week something less than ecstacy about the particular drafting adopted by Mr Howard in the production of Part IVA which seems to the Opposition not to justify the fanfare of enthusiasm which has so far been received. </PARA>
<PARA> It is clear that if this new approach is adopted, or this much more explicit parliamentary direction to the courts to adopt this approach becomes law, then we can expect much more explicit attention being paid by the courts in the future to these purposive questions. That is as it should be, because in the past there has been a real problem in this area. The problem arises from the fact that statutory language, like any other kind, is notoriously open-textured, imprecise and ambiguous. Statutes are not and cannot be drafted with mathematical precision to cover all possible contingencies. Traditionally judges get over this difficulty by saying that what they are doing in interpretating statutes is eliciting the intention of the legislature. </PARA>
<PARA> When the legislation does not on its face state any positive intention or give any indication as to what its purpose might be, the result is that, quite legitimately-no one believes the Parliament, as distinct from the Executive and its draftsmen' does have a collective intention about anything or if it did have such an intention it would be discoverable in the confused flurries of rhetoric that constitute the Hansard record-judges traditionally, in the absence of directions of the kind now contained in this new measure or in the absence of explicit statutory references to purpose or intention of particular legislative measures, have had to turn for guidance to one or other of two more or less equally time-honoured but nonetheless basically irreconcilable approaches to statutory interpretation. One of those two chosen approaches seems, on the face of it, to depend, as much as on anything else, on the taste, temperament, conscious or subconscious, political prejudice or even the state of the judge's liver on the day. Those two approaches are literalism on the one hand and what can be loosely described as liberalism on the other. </PARA>
<PARA> The literalist approach, in essence, amounts to this, and it has been a very familar game played by certain High Court judges in recent years. Take the literal words of the statute absolutely at their face value, ignore any absurdity, manifest inconvenience or even inconspicious injustice that would flow from their literal application and if all this creates a mess then leave it to Parliament to sort out. The alternative route is the liberal approach for which lawyers have a variety of more highfalutin expressions, but in essence this is the kind of approach which allows the plain meaning of words to be qualified or extended if a strictly literal interpretation would lead to absurd or mischievous consequences or thwart what appears to be the manifest purpose of the statute in question. The fact that these two approaches are on the face of it more or less flatly contradictory is bad enough, but what really bemuses successive generations of law students--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And others. What really bemuses successive generations of law students in particular, and I speak from that experience, and successive generations of parliamentarians, and Senator Georges can speak with ample authority on that score, at least until they come to recognise the whole judicial non-creativity argument to be the racket or charade that it is, because we all know that judges are creative in the way they make law, is to find one and the same judge very often in successive judgments-in the case of Sir Garfield Barwick it was not unknown for it to happen within the course of the same judgment-applying those two opposite techniques. One picks one's technique in order to get the result that one intuitively perhaps thinks is appropriate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The classic recent demonstration of these two quite distinct judicial styles at work, between the literalist on the one hand and the liberal on the other, was, of course the 1980 Westraders case which has become something of a classic in this respect in which the High Court, by a three to two majority, held that a share trading partnership was entitled to manipulate the price of its trading stock for tax avoidance purposes in such a way as to convert a small real profit into, I think, a $6.4m paper loss. Sir Garfield Barwick, the Chief Justice as he then was, delivering the leading majority judgment, on this occasion chose to wear his literalist hat. Indeed, his literalist hat is the one Sir Garfield was prone to wear on occasions when taxation law was in question. On other matters, he tended to be somewhat more liberal, but that is by the way. Mr Justice Murphy, as usual the leading dissenter, was on this occasion being his more or less consistent liberal self and I think it is a fascinating exercise to juxtapose two key extracts-there are lots more in their judgments-to indicate these two styles of work. This is what Sir Garfield Barwick had to say:</PARA>
<PARA> It is for the Parliament to specify, and to do so, in my opinion, as far as language will permit, with unambiguous clarity, the circumstances which will attract an obligation on the part of the citizen to pay tax. It is not for the Court to mould or to attempt to mould the language of the statute so as to produce some result which it might be thought the Parliament may have intended to achieve, though not expressed in the actual language employed . . the citizen has every right to mould the transaction into which he is about to enter into a form which satisfies the requirements of the statute . . Nor can it matter that his choice of transaction was influenced wholly or in part by its effect upon his obligation to pay tax. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Justice Murphy, on the other hand, had a somewhat different approach which can be summarised in this passage:</PARA>
<PARA> It has been suggested, in the present case, that insistence on a strictly literal interpretation is basic to the maintenance of a free society. In tax cases, the prevailing trend in Australia is now so absolutely literalistic that it has become a disquieting phenomenon. . . . Progress towards a free society will not be advanced by attributing to Parliament meanings which no one believes it intended so that income tax becomes optional for the rich while remaining compulsory for most income earners. </PARA>
<PARA>It need hardly be said which of those approaches I find the more persuasive. Perhaps it also should be said that I believe Mr Justice Murphy's approach to be, even before the enactment of this legislation, better law. Certainly, it would be so regarded in Britain where the courts have in recent years indicated a clear preference for the liberal approach, even in dealing with penal and revenue statutes of the kind where traditionally there has been very narrow construction against the Government. Lord Scarman made the point very effectively, I think, in his Fullagar Memorial Lecture at Monash University in September 1980 when he said:</PARA>
<PARA> When I, an English judge, read some of the decisions of the High Court of Australia, I think they are more English than the English. In London no one would dare to choose the literal rather than a purposive construction of a statute, and 'legalism' is currently a term of abuse. </PARA>
<PARA>One of the joys, the incidental delights of this particular legislation, not made less piquant by the fact that it is legislation coming from the current Attorney-General is that 'legalism' may well become a term of abuse now here in Australia too. </PARA>
<PARA>Sitting suspended from 6 to 8 p.m. </PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Before the suspension of the sitting I was saying that the kind of literalist approach that had become so characteristic of the Australian courts was in the process of being shown to be the incongruity which it in fact is in terms of the international development of the common law, in that it is an approach which has come in for quite robust criticism in the British courts and by British judges, including Lord Scarman. The best recent demonstation of that is the House of Lords taxation case which was recently widely publicised in this country. It is the case of W. T. Ramsay Ltd v. the Inland Revenue Commissioners in March 1981 in which the House of Lords made it absolutely clear that in the context of contrived artificial taxation avoidance schemes it was absolutely unprepared to accept the traditional literalists sorts of arguments that have been used by tax avoiders from time immemorial in Britain as in Australia, and was prepared to take the plunge of making judgments about the intention, the overriding purpose, of the legislature.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The dicta-indeed, the statement of law-which emerged from that case are very apt as a backdrop to the measure that is taken here by the Government today. It should serve to concentrate wonderfully the minds of those remaining Australian judges who have been unwilling to exercise their judicial responsibility in the national and community interest and to produce interpretations of legislation which are in conformity with what not only the parliaments but also right thinking members of the community wish to achieve. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to make four remaining points in relation to this Bill. The first is that the enactment of this amendment to the Acts Interpretation Act means that the stage is now set for a much greater exercise in the future by Parliament of its power, and I hope its responsibility, to include within this legislation particular sections or clauses stating clearly the purpose for which the legislation is enacted; in other words, articulating the intention of the Parliament and not simply leaving it to be untangled from the often necessarily abstruse technical language that we have to adopt to communicate our intentions so far as particular provisions are concerned. There is a case for doing this. It is gradually being acknowledged in recent years. One of the best recent examples is the Freedom of Information Bill, which apparently is inevitably due to come before us, albeit in emasculated form, tomorrow. I hope that a further example will prove to be the new Part IVA of the taxation legislation, which, although in its present state of development it lacks a clear statement of purpose or intention and leaves that simply to be intuited or implied, may conceivably, after the parliamentary debate in which the Opposition will expose it in the next couple of weeks or months as the case may be-this parliamentary session is proceeding as long as possible-end up with a clause of that kind which may help judges come to the conclusion that Parliament wants them to come to. I simply state the point that I hope it becomes almost a matter of drafting routine for the Office of Parliamentary Counsel to include, and indeed for departments and Ministers to brief the OPC to include, intention or purpose provisions of that kind that will easily allow the application of the clause that we are enacting here today. </PARA>
<PARA> The second point I make is that it is crucially important that the Government now proceed with its announced intention to legislate so as require the courts to take into account not only in general terms their perception of the intention or purpose of the legislation but also the kinds of explanatory memoranda which we are capable of generating in relation especially to complex legislation. This is a suggestion that the Attorney-General, Senator Durack, in fact floated in an address to the Australian Society of Senior Executives in September last year. It is an initiative which was warmly welcomed at that time and has been since, certainly by me, and will be, I assure the Attorney, by the Opposition whenever he chooses to get to the starting line in respect of that further initiative. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The taxation legislation looks likely to be able to deal with Mr Clyne in a way that its predecessor legislation has not. I do not think the courts have ever had much trouble dealing with Mr Clyne. The main problem with dealing with Mr Clyne is simply to get the executive machinery of government working fast enough to keep up to date with him. My view has always been that the only way one can cope with people who are as blatant and as outrageous in their social irresponsibility as Mr Clyne is in the taxation field is to enact retrospective legislation so that he is not able to get away with even one step down the track at any given point. But Senator Mulvihill is correct in saying that this is the context-taxation legislation-in which this kind of provision, in association with other substantive provisions, will have its major impact. But it will have an even greater impact if it is supported also, as I said, by explanatory memoranda being able to be taken into account. I make it clear to the Government that it will have the full support of the Opposition, I expect, if that initiative is taken, and I hope it is taken in the near future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The third point that I make by way of concluding remarks, and it is particularly apt given the presence in this chamber of my learned colleague Senator Georges, is that there has been concern in some quarters that judicial independence may in some way be put at risk by this kind of provision. The Minister, Mr Howard, raised this issue in his answer to Mr Jacobi on 2 April, which I referred to previously. The Attorney adverted in passing to this question in his second reading speech, claiming that there was no question of any such principle being infringed by this legislation. Of course, Senator Georges, with his usual perspicacity, at Question Time today drew attention to this as a possible problem. I make it clear that I believe this kind of concern, although it is perfectly understandable, is in fact unjustified in the context of this legislation. This kind of provision is not a matter of anyone, least of all the Executive, trying to interfere with the way in which the courts adjudicate particular cases. It is not in any way a matter of exercising influence in the sense of making suggestions to the court as to who should win and who should lose a case. What is an issue here is simply the general mode of interpretation, the general criteria of interpretation to be applied by the courts. It in no sense involves an exercise of influence of the kind that has traditionally and quite properly been thought to be utterly unprincipled and out of step with our democratic tradition. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;From one point of view it may be based on that presumption, in the sense that some judges have been less keen than others to accommodate themselves to the realities of the twentieth century and to the necessity for detailed and systematic regulation of social misbehaviour. It may be that that is enough to constitute them as dills in the eyes of Senator Georges. Certainly I am not usually heard to defend too vigorously those elements of the legal profession which I regard as behaving socially irresponsibly. I prefer to regard this as an exercise in concentrating the minds of the judges into more correct and sensible channels should they be minded to stray from the path of socially responsible rectitude. I think that is a slightly more apt and respectful way of describing what this legislation is about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The object of the exercise is really to reinforce the traditional principle that has been always understood to apply as the basis of statutory interpretation, and that is that Parliament's intention should prevail. This provision is just a machinery way of improving the probability that that will be the case. It is, of course, Parliament's intention that is in issue here. An executive piece of regulation is not involved in our discussion tonight; we are dealing with a provision in an Act of the Parliament. What is in issue is something very different from the kind of influence, for example, which has manifestly been sought to be exercised by Mr Sinclair, the Minister for Communications, and other members of the Executive Government in relation to proceedings currently pending before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal-a quasi-judicial body-in respect of Mr Murdoch's problems with television channels. If we are talking about interference with the independence of judicial and quasi-judicial proceedings, it seems to me that the kind of case where individuals and their rights and potential obligations are in issue is much more to the point than this kind of general guideline provision that is in issue here. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth and final point I make is not unimportant. In one way, regrettably it is the case that nothing that is accomplished in this legislative provision will do anything to govern the interpretation of the Australian Constitution by the High Court or any other court. It is the area of constitutional interpretation, above all others that one can argue is crying out for flexible, purposive, non-legalistic and non-literalistic interpretation. That that is so follows from the fact that the Australian Constitution is not a Commonwealth statute but is rather a statute of the United Kingdom Parliament. Occasions and considerations such as this produce in us the salutory reminder that we are creatures, constitutionally and legally speaking, of our former colonial masters, and that is an unhappy constitutional and legal state of affairs. We realise again the extent of that subjugation when we appreciate how little power we in parliament have to determine the kinds of criteria that should be applied by the High Court in interpreting the Constitution. It is beyond our power to make any such suggestion to the court. The court must treat the situation according to how it sees it. We cannot give the court any guidance in the process. I hope that the habits of mind that seem to be gradually emerging in the present High Court, if not its immediate predecessor, and which can be expected to be encouraged somewhat by this kind of legislation in the context of statutory interpretation generally will continue the process of creating in the High Court a rather more purposive approach, a less legalistic approach, to constitutional interpretation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Constitution has always been an area in which there has been some disposition on the part of the High Court to respond flexibly to changing economic and social circumstances, but arguably that has not been sufficiently so. The kind of interpretive approach that is involved in this legislation and which the Government seems anxious to adopt in the text of legislation generally is, I suggest, a perfectly appropriate and sensible interpretive approach to adopt in relation to constitutional law generally as well, even though I notice that the Attorney-General was at pains in his second reading speech to point out how he, for one, was not dissatisfied with the legalistic reputation the High Court and other courts continue to enjoy. I conclude by simply repeating that the Opposition welcomes the Bill and congratulates the Attorney-General on his good sense and his progressive instincts in picking up the Opposition's suggestion which appears to have stimulated the legislation which is before us tonight. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I mention that because I think Senator Georges would understand this aspect: It is not a matter of the Executive government giving any directions or making any decisions. Much less is it a matter of seeking in any way to direct the independent courts of this country and our judicial system. This Parliament is enacting an amendment to the law relating to statutory interpretation. The Acts Interpretation Act, to which is being added this measure, was first passed by this Parliament in 1901. There is a long history of such Acts being passed not only in this Parliament but also in every other parliament operating under our Westminster system of government. Parliament plays a very long, respected, traditional and influential role by laying down general rules of interpretation for the courts which the courts observe. Although the courts themselves are also obliged to interpret an interpretation Act, I assure the Senate that they are quite familiar with the role of parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> This measure may seem to be one for argument by lawyers and one about which many of our colleagues may feel some impatience. But occasionally what lawyers do and say has some major relevance to the community. I venture to suggest that this measure, although it may be very much a lawyer's measure, does have and will have very great relevance. Under our democratic system the measure is enormously important not only to what parliament does but also to what the courts do. The courts' approach and contribution to the development of law historically has been of enormous importance. It is perhaps only in the more recent years of the development of the law, and I am speaking not of decades but of centuries and in particular this country, that the courts have retreated very considerably in their role of developing the law-certainly this has occurred in an overt way-and have left it to parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> Parliament has very much asserted its role to the extent where the courts have almost, in theory at least, retreated to the point where they ostensibly claim that any development of the law is not for them but for parliament. That is a most unfortunate trend, which has resulted in Parliament being overwhelmed by legislation of enormous proportions and growing technicality, to an extent that, as honourable senators will agree, it is beyond our capacity as parliamentarians to handle it. Therefore, it is time to take corrective measures and the proposal before us represents a first and very important step to that end. I hope that it will prove to be a catalyst in correcting the imbalance that has developed. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. Many judges have said that they are obliged to interpret legislation literally and may not look beyond that. That approach, if taken to its logical conclusion, as unfortunately occurs quite often, obliges parliament to attempt to produce legislation which will cover every conceivable situation that may arise. I see the role of parliament as much more than one of laying down broader principles and relying on the courts to apply them to those manifold situations which develop and which parliament cannot, despite its best efforts, always anticipate. Parliament's role will be much better served if it can concentrate on laying down more general principles, policies and so on and leave to the courts their application to the specific cases with which they have to deal. The measure represents a first step, because courts do need more guidance than traditionally we have given them. I repeat, we will have to supplement it with better signals than traditionally we have given the courts as to our intentions and purpose.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In recent years some very interesting suggestions have been made as to how we might do that. The matter has been the subject of a good deal of debate, largely of course in the legal profession, but very little that is as specific as is the proposal before us tonight has actually been done about it. The additional measures that I propose to bring forward will give the courts better and clearer signals as to the way in which they can apply the general principle that is embodied in the measure before us. I do not want to rush the matter because it warrants a good deal of care and consideration, which I am not satisfied that I have yet been able to devote to it. Certainly, many suggestions on the subject have been made. My Department and I are in the process of giving them consideration. I hope that will result in additional measures being introduced in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA> The Parliament of the United Kingdom will probably be passing legislation on the same subject in the near future and its actions will be of great interest and assistance to us. It is for these reasons that I welcome particularly the support of the Opposition in what is proposed and am encouraged to persevere with my ideas on the matter and bring forward additional proposals in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA> I do not want to do any point scoring in relation to this subject. I am very pleased that members of the Opposition have had similar ideas. I pay full tribute to the fact that the honourable member for Hawker (Mr Jacobi) has raised the matter in recent months, but it is a subject in which I have been interested for a considerable period. I opened up the question in a speech in September of last year, but even that was not the first occasion on which I thought of it. It is one about which I have been very concerned for many years. I am pleased to have had the opportunity to bring forward this measure and to start the ball rolling. I hope that it will lead to more detailed and effective methods of redressing the imbalance which has developed between the courts and the Parliament in relation to the details of law making. A great deal remains to be done. I hope that from time to time the Parliament will address the problem and make some contribution towards resolving it. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Evans mentioned the matter of constitutional interpretation. It is true to say that the Acts Interpretation Act cannot apply to the Constitution. Suggestions cannot be made to the High Court by way of Act of Parliament, as to how it should address the interpretation of the Constitution. Nevertheless, I believe that an amendment to the Acts Interpretation Act of the kind proposed will indicate to that court, and to other courts, the preferences of the Parliament as to how the courts should approach even that document. </PARA>
<PARA> At present we are engaged in important discussions with the States with a view to eliminating what one might call the residual constitutional links with the United Kingdom-as Senator Evans has put it in more colourful language, cutting the knot of our colonial past. Admittedly, that is not directly concerned with the matter that the Senate is now discussing. Nevertheless, if we can resolve such questions we will have a uniquely and clearly Australian constitutional base. When that has been finally achieved, some of the questions and problems that Senator Evans has mentioned in relation to constitutional interpretation will also disappear. For those reasons I believe it is an important measure. I am most gratified and encouraged by the support that has been given to it by the Opposition. I believe this is a first step in some very important developments which in the not too distant future will be taken by this Parliament in an area of great significance not only for lawyers but also for all those who are affected by what lawyers and courts do. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When the Committee reported progress last night I had asked a number of questions concerning Estimates Committee D. I had been dealing with the particular question of costs associated with the Boeing 707 simulation continuation training for which there was an additional sum of $65,000 in the Estimates. I just remind honourable senators of the answer that I received from Senator Chaney. He said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> With respect to simulation training, which was raised by Senator Sibraa, it is cheaper to undertake such training than it is to use aircraft for training, so that in itself involves an economy. The honourable senator may have exaggerated somewhat the problems that we face in retaining crew. I am advised that we have lost only one crew of two pilots for the Boeings since 1979. I would merely acknowledge the point made by the honourable senator and move on.</PARA>
<PARA>I accept Senator Chaney's answer. I was making the point-I am going to make it again-that because the Government has these Boeing 707 aircraft, because crews are trained to fly them and because the crews are then eligible to fly commercial Boeing 707s anywhere in the world, we will still run the risk in the future of those crews leaving. The point I was making last night was that if those planes were sold and if the BAC 111s were modified, we would still have an adequate VIP fleet, we would still be able to fly to most places in the world with it and we would not face the catch-22 situation whereby every time we train a crew to fly the 707s we run the risk that a commercial airline may offer them a position and we would therefore lose them. That is all I want to say on that issue. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to make a number of comments about the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, which was also concerned in Estimates Committee D. During the hearings I asked for a list of overseas posts where the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs is represented. I was quite astonished to hear evidence about the situation in Africa, because the Department is represented in Pretoria and Cape Town in South Africa and in Nairobi. Only one out of the three posts that we have in Africa is in a black African state. The other two are in a country the policies of which the Australian Government has certainly no support for and with which we have had a minimum of contact for a number of years. I believe the Department should seriously assess where its priorities lie. I do not believe we should have a post of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in Zimbabwe. I believe a different situation exists there and that it would be wrong at this stage of that country's development for us to look for people to leave the country. We have a government which opposes the political stance of the South African Government, which opposes sporting links with South Africa and which completely opposes the system of apartheid that South Africa has at the moment. Yet when we look at where we have posts to encourage people to come here, we see that we have two posts in South Africa and only one post in the rest of Africa. </PARA>
<PARA> The same situation occurs on the American continent. We find from the list we were given that we have only two posts in South America. Yet in North America-the United States of America and Canada-there are seven posts. I hope that there will be government initiatives in looking for immigration from South American countries, but when I look at the list I gain the impression that the Department may be more interested in encouraging the more affluent North Americans to come and settle in Australia than it is in encouraging people from South America. We have only two posts in South America where there are a number of countries in political turmoil and with a depressed standard of living. Yet we have three posts in the United States and Canada. I believe we ought to reassess our priorities. </PARA>
<PARA> The last point concerning the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs deals with the status of refugees. We have a particularly disturbing situation at the moment. We are taking in a large number of Indo-Chinese and east European refugees. I want to make it quite clear that I do not oppose the Government policy of accepting refugees from these countries. In 1978-79, of 14,000 refugees only 43 came from the Lebanon. In 1979-80, of approximately 20,000 refugees 13 came from the Lebanon. That is 0.06 per cent of the refugees came from the Lebanon, a war-torn country in which people are being killed. There are 200,000 Lebanese living in Australia who have a number of relatives there. They are suffering great hardship. Yet we are accepting into this country as refugees a number of people from East European countries. </PARA>
<PARA> I know they come from Poland, Czechoslovakia and some of the other countries behind the Iron Curtain. I am not disagreeing that, in fact, they are political refugees. But countries in Western Europe are accepting refugees from Indo-China. I just wonder whether we have the right priorities and whether it would not be right for Australia to be saying: 'The countries of Western Europe should be accepting the refugees from Eastern Europe'. I am wondering whether it is right that some of the refugees coming into Australia come from Eastern Europe. We should be saying: 'This is the number of Indo-Chinese refugees coming to Australia and we will fill the rest of the quota with people from the Lebanon, where a war is going on. We will put the pressure on the Western European countries to take those genuine refugees coming from Eastern Europe'. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that yesterday Senator Sibraa asked several questions that have not yet been answered. I think he asked a question about consular pressures in Bali. My instruction is that the Government is aware of the consular pressures arising from the increasing number of Australians visiting Bali and is giving consideration to the early opening of a consulate there. At present, regular visits are made to Bali by consular officers based in Jakarta. As yet no firm decision has been made on the timing of the opening of the Bali post.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I understand that Senator Sibraa also asked about aid to East Timor. My advice is that the joint International Committee of the Red Cross-Indonesian Red Cross program, which has been the only relief operation in East Timor to which the Australian Government has been contributing since late 1978, formally concluded on 15 April this year. The additional contribution of $300,000 included in the estimates is to cover costs related to that joint program on which the ICRC reports. The ICRC has advised that it will be remaining in the area and will offer limited support to the Indonesian Red Cross, which will continue to give medical and relief assistance in those areas where it is needed most. The Indonesian Red Cross, to which Australia has not contributed directly since late 1978, has not sought assistance for the continuation of its programs in East Timor. All existing commitments in respect of the joint ICRC-IRC program have been implemented. </PARA>
<PARA> Tonight Senator Sibraa raised a number of questions. He referred to the Boeing 707s from the transport wing of the Royal Australian Air Force. I think his argument was that we were training crews and losing them to commercial operators. That argument I understand and sympathise with. If I understood him correctly, he suggested that instead we should renovate the BAC 111s so that they may take the place of the 707s. I point out that the BAC 111s have two grave disabilities. One is that they are twin engined. All safety advice is that for any distances over the sea they are not a suitable international aircraft. I think Senator Sibraa will recall a near accident with which the then Prime Minister, Mr Whitlam, was confronted, I think, on the way to New Zealand. So there is a defect in that respect. Apart from that Senator Sibraa will, if he reflects, realise that the size, the actual capacity to transport, is limited. Therefore, particularly for troop movements and matters of that nature, they are not very suitable. I am not aware of their age, but I imagine that they have been around a while now and they may present difficulties. That is a spontaneous answer on my part drawn from my own knowledge. I would be happy to seek further information. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Sibraa also referred to overseas posts and their locations. Of course, the overall limitations are ones of government resources. I think that the best plan is for me to direct the attention of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee) to the suggestions made. As to the final point made-that is, the status of refugees-I am advised that Lebanese people coming from their home country do not qualify for the status of refugees. If there is a need for more technical information on that matter I will be happy to get it to the honourable senator, but that is the technical answer. It may well be that the argument can be pursued. I, like him, acknowledge that the Lebanese have made first class citizens in Australia and have added to our culture and community. I will seek further information on that matter also and let the honourable senator know. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is not my intention to delay the Committee and to delay the passage of these Appropriation Bills. I just point out to the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Carrick) that Senator Robertson and I have raised the issue of our consular post in Bali. We believe the reason it is not operating is that there are staff ceilings. We know the problems existing there. We know the sort of work that is being put on to Qantas Airways Ltd officers. We hope that that situation will be changed in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I accept the point the Minister made about the BAC 111s. I recall that the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Anthony, took one of these planes to the Middle East. Obviously, the aircraft must have been required to fly over the ocean for long periods. I realise how old the planes are. I read an article recently saying that the British Government and Rolls-Royce have apparently entered into an agreement with the Romanian Government to build 100 of them. It would seem that they are being built and modified all the time. It is not my intention to keep pin-pricking over these issues. They are matters about which I can ask questions and which we can discuss some time in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Mulvihill raised several matters. I have some information concerning Brett Anthony Collins. I am advised that on 4 July 1980 he was ordered to be deported pursuant to section 13 of the Migration Act. He applied to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal on 27 August 1980 for a review of the decision of the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Macphee). On 22 January 1981 the AAT affirmed the Minister's decision to deport. On 22 February 1981 Mr Collins appealed to the Federal Court of Australia on the point of law arising from the AAT decision. That appeal has been set down for hearing in the Federal Court at Sydney on 20 and 21 July. As the matter is before the Federal Court further comment on the case is inappropriate. Senator Mulvihill may care to pursue the matter later. He also asked for details concerning the list of current litigations as at 30 April 1981.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have some matters I wish to raise concerning the Department of Transport. They deal with the Australian National Railways Commission. Yesterday I asked a question of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) who represents in this place the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt). I asked why there is a difference in terminology used by the Australian National Railways Commission. It placed an advertisement in the Adelaide Advertiser on 23 May under the heading 'Australian National'. It was advertising public loan No. 2. On the same day in the Melbourne Age an advertisement appeared headed 'Australian National Railways Commission'. It called tenders for the design and manufacture of 12 brake van bodies. Senator Messner sent me back an answer to the question but, of course, he is quite confused because in it he said that Australian National is the trading name but that the Australian National Railways Commission is the legal body that must seek the loan.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I indicate to the Committee that when it advertised that it was seeking a loan it used the title Australian National, not Australian National Railways Commission. I am confused. Of course, I spoke at length during the Estimates inquiry about why the name was changed. We already know that it cost the Australian National Railways Commission some $409,000 to engage some consultants. I note that Senator Rae is in the chamber. He is the person who alerted me to that fact when I was speaking on the financial returns for the Australian National Railways Commision earlier this year. I promptly placed a question on notice and that is the startling answer that I received. I am more confused than ever now because of the answer I have been given by Senator Messner. He must be as confused as me when he says that the Australian National Railways Commission is the legal body that must seek the loan. </PARA>
<PARA> All the stationery that is used by Australian National has got that logo on the top, yet I am told that that Australian National Railways Commission is still the legal body. I hope, as I said before, that it will remain so because people will then know which body they are dealing with. It is a railways department. If it is referred to as Australian National, of course, nobody knows what it is, unless, of course, one looks at the photograph of a diesel locomotive which appears in this advertisement. In the advertisement calling tenders for 12 brake van bodies we find that the Australian National Railways Commission is the body to which tenders must be sent. I have quite a few more matters I want to talk about in relation to railways. Perhaps the Minister for National Development and Energy (Senator Carrick) might be able to clear up that matter before I go on to the other matters. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise simply to say that I was not aware of the nature of the answer of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner). It is a matter on which I will have to seek guidance. I will do that but I suggest that that delay should not hold up the course of the Estimates.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to pursue some other matters concerning railways. On 24 April I asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Senator Messner) a question concerning the sale of the Victor Harbour railway station to Federal Hotels Ltd. He told me in an answer that neither the Minister for Transport (Mr Hunt) nor the Australian National Railways Commission-again that term is being used and I am quite happy with that-has held any negotiations with Federal Hotels concerning the sale of the Victor Harbour railway station. In the Advertiser on 13 May, an article appeared which explained that there was a $15m plan for a holiday village for Victor Harbour. In that article it is mentioned that a spokesman for Australian National said that no direct approach had been made about the station yard and facilities but that a year ago Australian National had had discussions with the Victor Harbour Council about the cost of relocating facilities to an alternative site.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That article states that the railway is to run from Victor Harbour to Goolwa. Of course, if the people who are to develop this holiday village intend to run a railway from Victor Harbour to Goolwa it is only natural that they will use the existing track. There must be some thoughts in the mind of the railway commissioner that the Government will dispose of that railway to a private concern so that this holiday village can be operated. The article also talks about the present Victor Harbour railway station being of historical value. It states that it could be taken over by the National Trust of South Australia and a new railway station built. That is another question I want to place on notice. It is of great concern to the people who live in the south coast area of South Australia and who do not want to see closed that railway line between Adelaide and Victor Harbour. It is a great tourist attraction. With a little foresight it could be developed and it could be a great revenue earner as well as providing a great service to the tourist industry in that part of South Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> The other matter I wish to raise under the estimates for the Department of Transport is one which I have raised before and one about which I have presented many petitions to the Parliament in recent months. I refer to the closure of country railway lines and also to the decision taken by the Australian National Railways Commission to do away with the small parcel service to country towns. This is causing people very great concern. Just the other day I received a letter from the principal of the Coomandook Area School in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA> Please find enclosed a copy of letter forwarded to Dr. Williams, General Manager of ANR re the closure of the Coomandook siding to freight of quantities less than 1 truck. </PARA>
<PARA> Such action will seriously inconvenience the school, and so seek your assistance in maintaining the existing service. </PARA>
<PARA> Such closure is a retrograde step, a step which I feel clearly demonstrates the lack of consideration for country clients and people. </PARA>
<PARA> I, therefore, ask you to take up this matter with the relevant authorities, or Minister, to ensure that such action does not eventuate. I am also disgusted at the fact that we were not consulted re such proposed action. </PARA>
<PARA> Thanking you for such action. </PARA>
<PARA>In my reply to Mr Graeme Dodsworth, the Principal of the Coomandook Area School I said that I would give this matter my earliest attention when the Senate met. Of course, the most appropriate time to raise this matter is under the appropriations for the Australian National Railways Commission. I seek some further answers as to why we are taking this action. I know that it has been said-I have said it myself-that the main reason is that by the direction of the Minister of Transport, Mr Hunt, the Australian National Railways Commission is trying to cut costs, irrespective of whether any service is given to the people who live in outlying country areas. Just today I received a letter from Mr Kevin Hamilton, the State member of parliament for Albert Park in South Australia. He enclosed a letter which he had received from a person who has expressed great concern about a matter. I will read the letter and list the names of the stations and the areas which will be affected by this decision of the Australian National Railways Commission. This person wrote to Mr Hamilton and said:</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Kevin,</PARA>
<PARA> Advice has been received from Australian National in a letter dated 13 May 1981 as follows-;</PARA>
<PARA> 'Please be advised that effective Monday 29 June 1981, stations listed hereunder will be closed to less than car load goods traffic;-</PARA>
<PARA>A number of stations are listed which are very important to people who live in the country, particularly those people who live in small isolated towns, and to primary producers. There is a list of towns in the letter as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Auburn, Balhannah, Bangham, Borrika, Bowmans, Bridgewater, Bute, Callington, Coomandook, Freeling, Georgetown, Gulnare, Goolwa, Kulkami, Kybybolite, Monarto South, Mount Barker, Parilla, Paskeville, Port Elliot, Port Wakefield, Salisbury, Tarlee, Two Wells, Virginia. </PARA>
<PARA>I have just spoken about the letter I received from the principal of the Coomandook Area School. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA>Blyth, Brinkworth, Farrell Flat, Geranium, Gurrai, Hampden, Hallett, Lyndoch, Marama, Murraw, Owen, Peake, Peebinga, Redhill, Robertstown, Tantanoola, Terowie, Wasleys. </PARA>
<PARA> Many of those centres are in the Murray Mallee where there is a big cereal growing industry. Many of the people who live there, such as small shopkeepers, have told me that they will be put out of business because they will not be able to get their small parcels of groceries and so on delivered to the stores. They are going to suffer. This man went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> An evaluation of sundry goods handled at these stations has established need does not exist for the service, which is being withdrawn. You will appreciate the action taken in this matter is part of general rationalisation associated with a review of unprofitable operations to achieve our aim for economical viability by the year 1988. </PARA>
<PARA>That is what the people in South Australia are complaining about. All the Government thinks about is making a profit on every service that is offered, never mind about giving a service to the people. As I have asked previously in the Senate when I have spoken about railway legislation, what situation will we be faced with in a few years when the roads deteriorate further from their use by heavy transports? The people responsible for the roads in the States-I refer particularly to the Highways Department in my State of South Australia-will have to go to the Federal Government, cap in hand, to ask for more road grants money so that they can build up the roads to cope with the heavy transports that are using them to cart goods whilst we already have a railway service there. The Government is not only depriving the people who live in these areas of a service but is also running down the work force and making more people unemployed. The letter which I have read out, which lists stations to be closed and the reasons for their closure, was signed by the Acting Operations Manager for Central Region. He sent a copy of it to all the station masters. I understand that he is to send a letter to all of the people who have been users of the railway. My correspondence goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA> The people who will suffer will be the country people and they are the ones on which the Liberal and Country Party rely for their vote . . . </PARA>
<PARA>One wonders whether this Government is trying to commit hara-kiri. In the Senate today we debated legislation which takes away a resource, the Australian Wool Testing Authority. The primary producers are bitterly upset about that legislation. Now we find that the Government is to close down all these railway sidings, to the great detriment of the people who live in the areas concerned. It seems to me that the Government has become tired of being in office and is looking for an escape route so that it can get out and hand all these burdens over to members of the Australian Labor Party. We will gladly accept them. We believe that we have the expertise in our ranks to govern this country the way it ought to be governed and to keep the service operating for the people who need it. </PARA>
<PARA> It is often said that members of the Labor Party are not concerned about country people. Let us look at the actions that have been taken by this Government, particularly in respect of railway services, in the five years that it has been in office. The Government is deliberately taking services away from the people and handing them over to private trucking business. We have only to pick up a newspaper to learn of the accidents that occur on the roads every day involving these mammoth trucks whose drivers are trying to service the people. The drivers drive hour after hour. They do not have decent working conditions as do the people who work in the railways. They work their eight hours and then have time off to go home to their families. Some of the people driving these juggernauts on the roads drive for 24 hours a day. That is a great cause of road accidents. Yesterday in Canberra a massive semi-trailer tipped over on a main road, causing traffic to bank up for about six miles. If that can happen in a small town such as Canberra we can imagine what happens on the Hume Highway and such places where such accidents happen daily. This Government should bear road safety in mind. It talks about it a great deal but it is doing something to aggravate the situation. It is taking away the railway services of which we should be proud. It ought to be doing something to keep them going. </PARA>
<PARA> I make a plea on behalf of the country people. Nearly every Wednesday in the Senate I present petitions signed by people in South Australia protesting at what the Government is doing. I only hope that the Government will take some notice of the voice of the South Australian country people. It might believe that as the areas in which it is closing down these services are in safe Liberal seats such as Wakefield and Barker no matter what happens a government member will be returned to office. Of course, we often hear that the worm turns. People will take so much and no more. I sound a warning to the Government that it ought to take some cognisance of the needs of country people. It should not be doing what it is doing to them. They will not suffer it too much longer. I hope that I can get some answers to the questions I have posed tonight. </PARA>
<PARA> During the Estimates committee hearings I posed another question to which I have not yet received an answer. I have looked through the written answers that were sent to us. The answer to my question is not among them. I wanted to know why there was a need to change the name of the Australian National Railways Commission to Australian National. I also asked whether the new logo is similar to the logo of the Boral organisation, which is a mammoth concern in this country. It appears to me that the logo and the colouring that the Commission is using on its stationery are identical to the colouring used by Boral-yellow and green. The Government has now appointed as the new commissioner to take over from Mr Smith, who retired just recently, a person whose main expertise in transport was in road traffic. The Government replaced Mr Smith with a man who had no experience in railways, whose sole forte in life had been in road transport. Now he is the head man in Australian National Railways. I think he might also have some association with Boral. We have to be very wary. Is this Government going to sell off our railways to private enterprise as it is selling off many of the Government utilities which are listed in the razor gang report? There is a fear abroad that the next thing it will try to sell is the Commonwealth Bank. It might hand over the whole of the--</PARA>

We will fight the Government tooth and nail if it ever tries to sell the Commonwealth Bank and its associates to private enterprise. God help this country if the Government is to put all the financial structures, all the public utilities, into the hands of the financial wizards of this country, whose only concern is about making a dollar's profit so that they can live a life of luxury and not worry about the needs of the people.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. The honourable senator was out of the chamber at the time. Senator McLaren asked a question of the Minister, who said that he did not have the information available at the time. Senator McLaren, on his fifty-third, or whatever it is, round of questions, repeated that question, causing me to feel that I could not resist intervening. I wish to amplify what I said to Senator McLaren on one of the other occasions on which he raised this matter. A concept prevails in large areas of communications in business that there is some advantage in having a shorthand identification of an operation. That is why all sorts of people in business, politics and other areas of activity endeavour to have a name to which people can learn to relate which is simple and easy. That is why, for instance, the Myer Emporium Ltd changed its trading name to Myer. If one looks at the bills one receives from Myer if one deals with that company, or at the outside of one of its buildings, one sees that one of the very large retailers in Australia trades under the name of Myer although its full name is the Myer Emporium Ltd. The same situation applies to the Australian National Railways Commission. Let us take the case of the Shell Co. Do we see the name Shell Co. of Australia Ltd at the service stations? We see the name Shell because the company has developed a situation where people relate to--</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is because it is common usage, not because we pay $409,000 to an organisation to change its name. It is common usage.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0P7">Senator RAE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If it is a matter of common usage, how did it become a matter of common usage? Because the company decided to trade under an identifiable, simple shorthand name. Why did Ansett Airlines of Australia become Ansett? Why is Trans-Australia not known as Trans-Australia Airlines? Why does K-Mart not use its full title, whatever it may be? Its name is K-Mart. Why is Qantas Airways Ltd known as Qantas? So we can go on. Such shorthand names enable people to identify with a particular type of business operation. When we get down to railways, why is VicRail called VicRail? The answer is that it is a shorter name than its full corporate statutory authority name. Apparently it is a little beyond the wit of Senator McLaren to be able to identify that what has been successful in corporate business activity in a very large cross-section of both public and private sector of corporate business activity-apparently Senator Coleman cannot understand this-that an identification and an association can be built up so that a stage is reached where people can relate, for example, Shell to the Shell Co. of Australia Ltd or Myer to the Myer retailing store. Why should people not be able to learn to relate to Australian National as meaning one of the fine railway systems of the world? I hope and trust that that is what it will become in everybody's estimation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a concept of a development of a corporate image. It is not just related to names and logos, it is related to an analysis of an organisation and to a form of super-management consultancy-cum public relations or an integration of the two. Without asserting that Australian National got value for money for the $409,000 or whatever the exact amount was, it is not uncommon for major business enterprises of this country and other countries to engage the management and public relations consultants to advise how to structure an operation, so that people can relate to a business undertaking. Employees, customers and would-be customers can all relate to it. It has been adopted by a large cross-section of business-public and private-in Australia and elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said on a previous occasion, I think it is unfair for Senator McLaren to imply that there is something sinister in the change of name. I believe the new management of the Australian National Railways Commission has done a very significant job in trying to bring that organisation into the twentieth century. It had its difficulties. Railways around the world have tended to have difficulties because they stagnated in what tended to be a nineteenth century attitude in relation to management and organisation. Endeavours are being made to overcome that situation by the new management of Australian National Railways Commission. If it chooses to engage consultants to assist in developing management, structure and public relations techniques, then let us await the result before we start to criticise. I wish the management luck. I believe railways can be one of the important aspects of public transport in Australia. I defend the decisions which have been taken by people who have been appointed to do the job. In no way, as I understand it, has there been interference or direction from the Government of the day in relation to this aspect. I apologise to the Senate for taking a little time, but Senator McLaren has repeatedly raised the matter. I wish to ensure that the Australian National Railways Commission trading as Australian National, gets a fair chance to do its job. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of one of my colleagues who unfortunately cannot be here I will ask some questions concerning the Department of Transport. According to the Budget Papers, the estimate for air navigational charges this year will yield $102m. Last year the amount was $83,997,246. Is the amount of $102m expected to be the result? If it is not expected to be the result, why not? I turn now to the issue of revenue from airport rentals. The estimates of revenue in the last two years have included retrospective rentals of $9m and $12m previously held in trust pending resolution of a number of matters. Are any amounts in 1979-80 and 1980-81 attributable to accrued air navigation charges for Ansett Airlines of Australia and Trans-Australia Airlines? If they are, could we get the details? It has been put to honourable senators on this side that because of the Ansett Airlines case-there was an appeal in 1974 against the airport charges and the case was not finalised until 1979-this matter could be associated with the question that I have just asked.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will ask a number of questions in relation to retrospective rentals. What is the nature of these amounts? What are or were the reasons for holding these rental amounts in trust? What are or were a number of matters awaiting resolution? Are any accruing rentals owed by TAA or Ansett? If so, could we be furnished with the details of amounts and periods over which the amounts are owed? What are the outstanding retrospective rentals as at 30 April 1981? I make the point to the Minister that my colleague who wants these questions answered, of course, does not expect that final details will be able to be given tonight. </PARA>

In the last few weeks we have heard announcements over the airport public address systems and by the hostesses to the effect: 'You are travelling Trans Australia'. Trans-Australia Airlines was the product of a very fine group of dedicated people who loyally associated themselves with the establishment of this civil aviation institution. Hundreds and hundreds of thousands of dollars have been spent in publicising the great, illustrious name of TAA throughout Australia and throughout the world. I want to know-I have heard a lot of humbug about this-why names are suddenly changing and why the Government is following Friedmanism to sell off the things to which the public of Australia has become accustomed. There is a negative turning back of the clock to the dark ages of the private exploiter. Why do we have to sacrifice one of our most wonderful organisations whose name is TAA and why are we allowing the hostesses and the girls who operate the public address systems at the airports to say 'This is Trans Australia'? The Parliament has never authorised this change. The legislation refers to Trans-Australia Airlines. It is TAA now and it will remain that way, as far as I am concerned.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish very briefly to support Senator O'Byrne. Honourable senators will know that I am a very strong supporter of Trans-Australia Airlines in this chamber and outside. I was alerted a couple of months ago to this surreptitious and underhand change of name. At airports one heard what one thought was a slurring of 'TAA' into 'TA'. Now when one phones travel offices one hears 'Trans Australia', and on the side of aircraft one sees 'Trans Australia'. I think the commissioners need to be told by the Parliament that they have made a very grave misjudgment of the loyalty of Australian people to the name TAA. I also want to support Senator O'Byrne's description of the new logo. It is an absolutely meaningless blob which conveys nothing to the mind unless one already knows that it is meant to represent TAA. It conveys nothing. It is a meaningless logo.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It seems to me that the directors of TAA, having been caught up in the need to purchase new equipment and having been caught up in the Government's requirements that it change its status at least to a public corporation, may not have given sufficient consideration to the good will and loyalty that have been built up around the name TAA. It seems to me that there ought to be some indication from this chamber of the public concern. I have met no one amongst members of the travelling public who has welcomed these changes. There is a very grave risk that in the somewhat competitive atmosphere that will prevail in the coming months and years with the new types of aircraft being purchased by both airlines there will be such a loss of good will and loyalty that this great national airline will suffer. We are merely taking this opportunity to alert the commissioners to that fact. </PARA>

Earlier today I gained a clearance from the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Senator Messner, to incorporate a number of documents in Hansard. I subsequently showed them to Senator Carrick. The first matter I raise was brought to my attention by the Hospital Employees Federation of Australia via its Assistant National Secretary, Les Butler. He has sent a duplicate letter to the honourable member for Wills (Mr Hawke). The union covers people employed in repatriation hospitals. At the risk of incurring the wrath of Senator McAuliffe, I intend to intrude into Queensland matters and to refer to the Greenslopes Repatriation Hospital. As I said, I obtained a communication from the Assistant National Secretary of the Hospital Employees Federation of Australia which provides Australia-wide coverage; therefore I am not intruding into the States rights. The representation concerns a dispute about medical evidence. Apparently a question arose concerning an overweight problem of a member of the union employed at the Greenslopes Hospital. Counter evidence was given by the union that the matter was not what it appeared to be. I ask that a communication from the Assistant National Secretary and a further letter which elaborates on the history of the case be incorporated in Hansard so that Senator Messner can take up the matter.

<PARA>Dear Senator Mulvihill Thank you very much for the assistance you have given me in obtaining exemption from taxation for most of the components of the Webster Medication I am introducing to Nursing Homes. </PARA>
<PARA> I am enclosing a copy of the last letter I received from Mr MacKellar suggesting only some of the drugs we dispense are Pharmaceutical Benefits. In fact almost all the drugs are Benefit items. Most of the residents we supply are Pensioners or covered by Repatriation. It is our aim to provide medication to these people at the lowest cost possible. We frequently make contact with prescribers so that an alternative 'free drug' could be supplied instead of an expensive private item. </PARA>
<PARA> This Medication System works very well in the Nursing Homes we service. However the Commonwealth Department of Health considers we only put labels on bottles and provide little in the way of extra Pharmaceutical professional services. How do we get recognition and an alternative method of payment so that the System can be expanded to more Homes?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a few matters to raise. The first is quite specific and arose while Estimates Committee G was dealing with the Department of Social Security. Senator Chaney was asked what was meant by the scaling down of the Social Welfare Division of the Department. He replied that this was not to happen and in fact the speculation was due to media misinterpretation about what was happening as a result of the so-called razor gang's decisions. Page 36 of the printed ministerial statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser) on the Review of Commonwealth Functions-in other words, the report of the razor gang-states that the Social Welfare Division of the Department will be scaled down. Can I have some clarification about what is going on? What does 'scaling down' mean? Does the Prime Minister know what he is talking about when he says that the division will be scaled down? Does Senator Chaney know what he is talking about when he says that such an interpretation is media speculation, which is what he stated in the Estimates Committee hearing? First of all I seek clarification of that simple point.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I raise two matters, one of which I raised at the Estimates Committee hearing. Unfortunately I did not follow it through at the time because of the confusion which existed between the definition of homeless youth and homeless persons. I asked a question concerning the age limit for expenditure on homeless youth. From memory the response stated that the age limit was 18 years. I have since been informed that at a Senate standing committee hearing information was that funds allocated for homeless youth catered for people up to 23 years of age. I would like that aspect clarified, I would also like some clarification on the amount of money allocated for homeless youth. How much of that appropriation has been spent this year?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other matter of some concern was brought to my attention the other day by a medical person. He queried with me whether in actual fact it was true that the Federal Government was to sell the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. I would like some clarification on this matter. The Commonwealth Serum Laboratories manufacture a number of things which I doubt that private enterprise would see as being an economic exercise. I would hate to see those products disappearing from the market. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise another matter. I ask the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) whether he can obtain from the Department of Social Security some answers concerning the administration of what is, and what I believe should still be known as, the work test for those on unemployment benefit. Are we to understand that income statements will be now collected by the Department of Social Security and that people will be able to post them in to the Department every fortnight rather than having to deliver then personally? We have word that the work test is now to be administered by the Department of Social Security. Over the years there has been a tightening up of the rules connected with the work test. Part of that tightening up was the introduction of the personal delivery of income statements. Can we have some information about what will happen in future not only to that part of the work test but also the other parts?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also ask, as we have asked in the Estimates Committee and in other places: Can we have details of the system, under the new health scheme, concerning those who are classed as disadvantaged? How will they be declared disadvantaged and how they will get their health cards? What administrative procedures will be used, how long will the cards be valid for and what will be required, particularly for people on low incomes, to obtain these cards? I would also like to know what is happening to the children's services legislation which has been promised in this Parliament term after term since I have been shadow Minister for Social Security. If the Bill is not coming down-a Bill that was previously considered to be desirable and urgent and which was going to be made available for all of us to look at before it was introduced into this place-what will happen with child care in the future? What is the future of the Office of Child Care and those employed there?</PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I ask a question which has been asked in this place but which has either not been answered or not answered satisfactorily. What, if anything, has happened to the $10,000 which is paid to the firm or the employer of the President of the Australian Society of Accountants as compensation for the considerable time he spends in the position? As the President was Mr Lanigan, and as he spent considerable time in the affairs of that organisation, has the money been paid to anybody? Has any money been paid to the Department of Social Security in return for Mr Lanigan's services, as it would have been paid if Mr Lanigan had worked for a private concern?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A series of questions has been asked, all of which I would have thought would have been more appropriately asked at the sittings of the Estimates committees rather than in a debate on the Appropriation Bills. Regrettably, this seems to be an established pattern. Senator McLaren raised a question about funds for the anti-smoking campaign. Funds for this campaign are part of funds for a wide area of preventive health advertising and it will continue to be funded by the Government but the actual priorities for the next year of course will be set in the next Budget. Views that are expressed in relation to the priorities and so on, such as those of Senator McLaren, will be taken into account along with the views we receive on these matters from large numbers of people. As to the particular publications that Senator McLaren mentioned, I have no knowledge of them but if a State is providing some publications on the subject, and they are being publicised in school tuck-shops, that seems all to the good.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, that is a pity. Senator Mulvihill incorporated in Hansard a number of letters. As I understand it, he simply wanted to draw the attention of Ministers and officials to matters raised in the letters, and, those letters having been incorporated, attention will certainly be given to them and replies given to Senator Mulvihill in due course. On the particular matter of Concord Repatriation General Hospital which he mentioned, it may be possible, depending upon Budget priorities next year, to offer the local Concord council some share in relation to the cost of the works that he referred to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Grimes asked a number of questions. His first question dealt with the Social Welfare Division of the Department of Social Security. The Review of Commonwealth Functions mentioned that there will be a review of that Division, looking at the requirements that it has for social workers and other welfare functions. Senator Grimes's specific question asked of Senator Chaney in respect of a scaling down of the Division ought, I suggest, to be pursued with the Minister but, as I understand it, it does not mean a scaling down but a review of certain functions. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coleman asked questions relating to a homeless youth program. Just over $1m is estimated for this program for this year. Funds are also allocated through the homeless persons program. The homeless youth program comes under the Office of Child Care and I am advised that it covers children up to the age of 18 years. It is thought that there may be some confusion between the Community Youth Support Scheme and the youth services scheme under the Department of Social Security. The Community Youth Support Scheme deals with youths up to the age of 23 years whereas the other scheme is limited to those up to 18 years of age. There are no plans to sell the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories and the Government has not included any amendments or legislative proposals for a children's services Bill in the current legislative program. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Grimes also asked about payments to Mr Lanigan in respect of his presidency of the Australian Society of Accountants. I am informed that no money has been paid to the Department of Social Security in respect of that matter. If Senator Coleman has any further questions to ask as a result of those answers I gave perhaps she will ask them while I check whether one or two other answers are to hand. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise for two purposes. The first is to express my complete dissatisfaction with one answer that the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) gave. I realise that the matter does not concern his own Department, or area of interest, but I would point out to those who provided him with the answer that on page 36 of the document setting out the Government's decisions following its Review of Commonwealth Functions, under '3. Development and Administration of Welfare Program', the following decision appears:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Social work activity to be confined to that relating to Departmental functions. </PARA>
<PARA> Social Welfare Division of Department to be scaled down. </PARA>
<PARA>There is nothing there about a review being made. It refers to a Government decision to scale down the Social Welfare Division of the Department of Social Security. Any statement that refers to a review is nonsense. I know that, when the statement came down, the Department did not know what was to be in it. The review committee probably did not know the implications of what it was saying, but clearly it was saying: 'There is a Government decision to scale down these functions'. Senator Chaney, when asked about it, said that it was media speculation. Honourable senators have a right to know. I hope that in the next couple of weeks we shall be able to learn the answer from Senator Chaney. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter, which is minor in terms of the overall Budget, I would hope to get an answer on in the next couple of weeks also. The Department supplies to the Minister a Press clipping service. Can honourable senators be told who, other than the Minister, is given that service and why? The Minister and his colleagues will probably know why I ask the question. </PARA>

Perhaps he will also take up with him the matter of the Press clipping service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Coleman asked how much had actually been spent this year on the homeless youth program. I am advised that at this stage the figures are not available. Apparently the assembling of those figures depends on what has been spent in the States, and at this stage the Department does not have those details. We will take note of the question and provide the figures when they can be obtained. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not find the answer of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) altogether satisfactory. I brought up the matter at the hearings of the Estimates committee. I accept responsibility for not following it up then but, certainly, had I done so I could have expected to receive an answer on that day. If it had not been available then the matter would have been pursued in the period before these votes came before this chamber. My question should not be very difficult to answer. The Minister's advisers should be able to give me at least a rough estimate. I would accept an estimate, to within a few thousand dollars, of the amount allocated for work with homeless youth this year which has been spent. If the Department tells me that essentially the arrangement is on a one for one basis and it is necessary to wait to see how much the States have spent, and for how much they will send a bill, I will accept that type of answer as well. I believe that we are entitled to ask whether an appropriation made last August in the Budget session for expenditure on homeless youth programs has in fact been spent, whether it has been allocated-even though it may not have been spent-and how much it is anticipated will not be spent before the end of the financial year which, I would remind the Government, is coming up in a few short weeks.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The honourable senator is perfectly free to speak further on that matter also. Senator Grimes asked about the changed work test arrangements following the Review of Commonwealth Functions. Under the new arrangements, unemployment benefit claim forms and fortnightly applications for continuation of unemployment benefit will be lodged direct with the Department of Social Security, not the Commonwealth Employment Service. Personal lodgment of the forms will not be necessary. The CES will continue to act as agent for the Department of Social Security in the administration of the work test and will report work test failures to the Department. That will mean that the CES will report on the following matters: Where a claimant fails to maintain registration with the CES; where a claimant fails, without good reason, to respond to a request from the CES to attend for an interview; where a claimant declines referral to a suitable job vacancy; or where a claimant fails to accept the offer of suitable work or does not commence duty in a suitable job that he has accepted. On receipt of adverse work test reports from the CES the Department of Social Security will review eligibility. Decisions under the Social Services Act will remain the sole responsibility of the Department of Social Security.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Grimes also asked what stage had been reached in implementing the administrative arrangements for the disadvantaged under the new health schemes. I am advised that administrative arrangements are now at an advanced stage and that social security officers will be ready to answer inquiries which may be expected in the near future when the advertising of the broad details will begin. Present planning is that the Department of Social Security will begin to accept claims for the new health cards from early in August 1981 so as to be able to issue the first cards to coincide with the commencement of the scheme on 1 September 1981. Special attention will be paid to advising the different categories of social security pensioners and beneficiaries of their entitlements. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a question concerning the Department of Industry and Commerce. I placed on notice a question concerning the cost of the advertising campaign against the shorter working week. The question was asked of the Minister for Administrative Services and the answer I got back was that an amount of $145,690 had been committed to 20 April. Yet when we look at the estimates for the Department of Industry and Commerce we find that it is expending $260,000. If that amount is added to what the Department of Administrative Services is spending, we get a total of about $400,000. In the Melbourne Age of 8 May there was an article by Jan McGuinness which cited an amount of $560,000 of taxpayers' money being used by the Government to publicise the campaign against the introduction of the 35-hour week. As the answer that I was given in reply to question on notice No. 600 and the figures given on page 36 of the explanatory notes for the Department of Industry and Commerce do not add up, and as I am assured by Jan McGuinness from speaking to her that she was able to obtain her information from the advertising agency handling this work to which she was referred by the Department of Industry and Commerce, I now ask: What is the exact amount that the Government is spending on this publicity campaign opposing the introduction of the 35-hour week? It appears that the Department which is handling the greatest bulk of this advertising campaign is the Department of Industry and Commerce. I seek some clarification as to the actual amount in view of the fact that the expenditure mentioned in the explanatory notes is $260,000.</PARA></TALK.START>

After I read the article I questioned her at length and she was emphatic that the figures she was given by the advertising agency were correct. That is what the agency expects to receive. The article mentions that the advertising agency is Ogilvy and Mather (Aust) Pty Ltd. This matter is causing great concern in the work force in this country, particularly in the trade union movement which will have to have an reduction in hours ratified by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission unless industry is prepared to come to some arrangement and allow reduced hours to be worked. That is why I ask again: What is the actual figure anticipated to be? We know that an amount of $260,000 is listed for expenditure, in addition to the other figure I was given by the Department of Administrative Services.

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 31 March 1981:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is the Minister for Social Security aware of a retirement plan advertised by the Australian Retired Persons Association Friendly Society in which it is claiming that regular periodical bonuses paid by the plan 'are not regarded as income by the Taxation Department and that they are excluded from the income test applied by the Social Security Department for the age, invalid and widows' pensions, etc.'; if so, (a) is this advertisement factual; (b) how can such payments be excluded from consideration as taxation or as part of the income test applied by the Social Security Department; and (c) are similar benefits from other organisations excluded in this way.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The retirement plan has been brought to my notice. The Minister representing the Treasurer has already replied to the taxation aspects of the honourable senator's Question No. 566 (Hansard, 29 April 1981, Page 1539) which is in the same terms. Answers to those aspects falling within the responsibility of my portfolio are as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) I have seen an extract from a publication by the Australian Retired Persons Association and, as far as it applies to social security pensions, the information is correct.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) The payments are excluded in the application of the income test under the provisions of section 18 of the Social Services Act which provides, among other things, that a payment by way of a benefit from a friendly society is to be excluded from the computation of income for pension purposes.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) Similar benefits from other friendly societies are also excluded from the pensions income test.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) $5.00 a week ($260 per annum) for a single pensioner, a supporting parent beneficiary and a married pensioner couple. A similar payment called supplementary allowance is payable at the same rate to sickness beneficiaries after six weeks.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) November 1974.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) If the present rate of supplementary assistance were increased by the movement in the Consumer Price Index from the December quarter 1974 to the December quarter 1980, it would become $9.25 a week (rounded to the nearest five cents), equivalent to $481 per annum.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) It is estimated that:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) doubling the current rate of supplementary assistance/allowance would cost $110 million in a full year;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) increasing the current rate of supplementary assistance/allowance to $9.25 a week would cost $90 million in a full year.</PARA>
<PARA> These costs are based on numbers in December 1980 and include an estimate of the cost in respect of pensioners who would become newly eligible for supplementary assistance/ allowance as a result of the increased rate of payment.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) In the case of a single pensioner, the maximum rate of assistance is reduced by the excess of his or her income as assessed over $1.00 a week ($52 per annum). In the case of a married pensioner couple, the reduction is one-half of the couple's combined income as assessed in excess of $2.00 a week ($104 per annum). In determining income as assessed, up to $6.00 a week ($312 per annum) is disregarded for each child. The income test applied to supplementary allowance is similar except that there is no 'disregard' for children.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) October 1965. Between then and November 1976, the test was applied to a combination of income and property. Since November 1976 it has been a test on income alone.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) If the income above which reductions commence were increased by the movement in the Consumer Price Index from the December quarter 1974 to the December quarter 1980, it would now be $1.85 a week ($96.20 per annum) in the case of a single person, and $3.70 a week ($192.40 per annum) in the case of a married couple.</PARA>
<PARA> (8) It is estimated that:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) amending the present income test to that outlined in (7) without changing the present rate of supplementary assistance/allowance would cost $3 million in a full year;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) doubling the present rate of supplementary assistance/allowance and amending the income test to that outlined in (7) would cost $115m in a full year; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) increasing the present rate of supplementary assistance/allowance to $9.25 a week and amending the income test to that outlined in (7) would cost $95m in a full year.</PARA>
<PARA> These costs are based on numbers in December 1980 and include an estimate of the cost in respect of pensioners and beneficiaries who would become newly eligible for supplementary assistance/allowance as a result of the new income test or the increased rate of payment.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Is Americium-241 a highly dangerous derivative of Plutonium.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) What was Gulf Oil Corporation, Gulf Nuclear of Texas, United States of America, doing with the material in New South Wales when it was spilt onto a road near Port Macquarie in New South Wales.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2U4">Senator Carrick</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Americium-241 is a derivative of plutonium. Its use in Australia is subject to State legislation controlling radioactive materials. Americium-241 may be safely handled when the appropriate precautions are applied and it is used safely throughout the world in the commonplace geophysical application of borehole logging.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) I am advised that no radioactivity was spilt onto a road near Port Macquarie in New South Wales. A package containing radioactive sources fell onto a roadway near Port Macquarie as the result of a road accident. Although the outer packaging was broken, no radioactive material escaped from the inner containers.</PARA>
<PARA> The Americium-241 source was on consignment to a geophysical contracting company in Queensland from suppliers in the United States of America. It comprised part of a neutron logging tool used in downhole logging of boreholes to determine the porosity of rocks.</PARA>
