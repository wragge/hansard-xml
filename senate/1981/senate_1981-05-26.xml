<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I present the following petition from 11 citizens of Australia:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth that:</PARA>
<PARA> Whereas before Europeans settled in Australia, the Aboriginal peoples of Australia had lived on their traditional lands from time immemorial and had in Aboriginal law and customs a clear title to those lands; and</PARA>
<PARA> Whereas Europeans and other non-Aboriginal people have occupied and used most of the traditional lands of the Aboriginal peoples against their will and without negotiation, compensation or treaty; and</PARA>
<PARA> Whereas it has been the practice of nations established in territories previously occupied by indigenous inhabitants to reach a negotiated settlement with those inhabitants; and</PARA>
<PARA> Whereas that occupation has seriously damaged the traditional way of life of Aboriginal Australians and has caused poverty and hardship to be the fate of the great majority of their surviving descendants; and</PARA>
<PARA> Whereas the surviving descendants of the Aboriginal peoples have expressed a wish to have their rights to land acknowledged, to preserve their link with their Aboriginal ancestors and to maintain their distinctive identity with its own cultural heritage; and</PARA>
<PARA> Whereas the people of Australia in 1967 voted overwhelmingly that the Commonwealth Parliament should have responsibility for laws relating to Aboriginal Australians; and</PARA>
<PARA> Whereas it is accepted internationally by the United Nations organisation, that each country should work to establish the rights of indigenous peoples to self-determination, non-discrimination and the enjoyment of their own culture; and</PARA>
<PARA> Whereas the Woodward Commission in 1974 established principles by which Aboriginal rights to land should be acknowledged and realised; and</PARA>
<PARA> Whereas the Senate of the Commonwealth Parliament in February 1975 resolved that Aboriginal Australians should be compensated for the loss of their traditional lands and for the damage to their way of life; and</PARA>
<PARA> Whereas the National Aboriginal Conference unanimously resolved in April 1979 in Canberra to ask the Commonwealth Government to negotiate a Treaty with Aboriginal Australians.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Commonwealth Government should invite the Aboriginal people of Australia to negotiate a Treaty with the Commonwealth of Australia, and any Treaty should contain provisions relating to the following matters: (i) The protection of Aboriginal identity, languages, law and culture, (ii) The recognition and restoration of rights to land by applying, throughout Australia, the recommendations of the Woodward Commission, (iii) The conditions governing mining and exploitation of other natural resources on Aboriginal land, (iv) Compensation to Aboriginal Australians for the loss of traditional lands and for damage to those lands and to their traditional way of life, (v) The right of Aboriginal Australians to control their own affairs and to establish their own associations for this purpose.</PARA>

<PARA>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA> That the members of the Women's Service of the 1939-45 War not at present considered eligible for Defence Service Home Loans should qualify as ''Australian Soldiers'' under the Defence Service Homes Act. They volunteered for service with the Naval, Military and Air Forces, serving wherever they were sent in whatever capacity they were required, and yet are refused Defence Service Home Loans.</PARA>
<PARA> They took the oath to resist His Majesty's enemies which meant to fight His Majesty's enemies, and although not used in actual combat in war zones, they were available for that use and had a sufficiently grave need arisen would have been used, to serve with distinction as have women of other lands.</PARA>
<PARA> In accordance with the Acts and Regulations of the period, the women of the Military Forces had enlisted for service anywhere, some of the Naval women to sail in any waters, others with service on warships optional, while the women of the Air Force could have been sent to Papua New Guinea or other territories under the control or care of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Ex-servicemen of the Royal Australian Navy, the Australian Imperial Force and the Royal Australian Air Force who volunteered in the 1939-45 War but were not sent to War Zones are granted home loans. Not to grant eligibility to all Ex-servicewomen of 1939-45 War is unjust and unfair.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that you favourably consider amending the Defence Service Homes Act by repealing Sub-section 4 (2A) (b) (c) (d) of the Principal Act as amended by No. 137 of 1978, and grant eligibility to all members of the Women's Royal Australian Naval Service, the Australian Women's Army Service, the Women's Auxiliary Australian Air Force, the Australian Army Medical Women's Service, and the Voluntary Aid Detachment of 1939-45 War.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I refer the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry to an answer he gave to a question from Senator Tate on 14 May in which the Minister said, in relation to the Australian Wool Testing Authority:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>. . . this Government is one which believes in private and not public enterprise. We believe if a function can be performed by the private sector it should be performed by it.</PARA>
<PARA>I ask the Minister whether he was aware at the time he gave that answer to the question on Thursday, 14 May, of a Government decision to be announced on 15 May that it was no longer the Government's intention to sell the Wool Testing Authority to private enterprise. If the Minister was not aware of the decision at that time, by whom are these important decisions relating to the fundamental philosophy of the Liberal Party made and at what stage are other Ministers in the Government, apart from those who make the decisions, informed of those decisions? I further ask whether the Minister still shares his very strong commitment, expressed on 14 May, to the Wool Testing Authority being appropriately in the hands of private enterprise.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have just had another look at the answer which I gave on 14 May and I certainly do not step back from what I said at that time. I believe it is one of the important differences-indeed, one of the fundamental differences-between those on this side of the chamber and those on the other side of the chamber that we do believe that wherever a function can be performed other than by government it ought to be performed other than by government. At the time when I answered that question the Government had announced a decision about the Australian Wool Testing Authority. Further statements were made subsequent to my answering that question and my present advice is that the final decision on the sale of the Authority will be made by the relevant Minister in conjunction with the Australian Wool Corporation. Consultations are currently in progress with the Australian Wool Corporation and the industry on the various options which are open to the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3E4">Senator MARTIN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Transport. Will consideration be given to difficulties alleged by the Minister for Local Government, Main Roads and Police in Queensland as a consequence of the Commonwealth's requirement that tenders be called for all construction works on national roads? The two main alleged difficulties are, firstly, that this decision could affect the capacity to handle emergency works, particularly in western Queensland, and that flexibility between construction and maintenance could disappear; and, secondly, that the continued existence of some departmental regional offices and other establishments may be questioned and the viability of repair and store operations could be jeopardised. Further, will the Government give consideration to the request that any requirement for a major shift to contract works allow a basic day labour presence and provide three years for practical implementation, thus avoiding major retrenchments?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2055" SPEAKER="Messner Sen The Hon A.J." NAMEID="9I4" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="VETERANS' AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9I4">Senator MESSNER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister has provided me with some information with regard to this matter. I believe it has become a matter of public concern in the last few days. The Minister is aware that a letter from Mr Hinze, with the usual belly-ache, opposing the Government's introduction of the tender and contract system, has arrived. Mr Hinze, in his letter, makes extravagant suggestions about massive retrenchments and redundance of the large departmental plant fleet and, not surprisingly, suggests that the Commonwealth should leave such matters with the States.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Recently the Minister for Transport introduced the Roads Grants Bill 1981 into Parliament. This Bill provides that Commonwealth grants for construction works on national roads will be conditional upon the tenders being called and dealt with in accordance with approved arrangements. The Government's objective is to ensure that maximum value is obtained from its very substantial outlays on national roads, which, of course, are eligible for full Commonwealth funding. The Government will not exclude State road authorities and local authorities from carrying out national road construction works. State and local government authorities will be free to bid for the works in competition with private contractors. Given the road construction experience which these authorities have gained over the years and the financial and other advantages they enjoy, they ought to be in a very good position to compete for such works. Quite clearly, this puts them in a strong position in order to deal with the kinds of emergency works to which I think Senator Martin was referring.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Hinze chooses to ignore the fact that the Commonwealth requirement for tenders to be called for construction works on national roads applies to only 10 per cent of road works in Queensland. The other 90 per cent will continue to be carried out under present arrangements. Accordingly, it is again hard to understand the proposition which is mentioned by Senator Martin, that this in fact will affect repairs and stores operations in the various areas which she mentioned. Even if Mr Hinze's pessimism about the chances of the Main Roads Department being able to compete with private contractors turns out to be justified, a reduction in work loads of 10 per cent will hardly destroy the viability of any of the operations carried out by his Department. The Minister does not accept the suggestion that the Commonwealth will in any way endanger the capacity of the Main Roads Department to handle emergency works. Such works on national highways will continue to be funded by the Commonwealth as they are now. Once again Mr Hinze has deliberately misrepresented the Commonwealth's intention regarding a new tender system for the national road construction system.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle as a member of the ministerial committee which reviewed Commonwealth functions and as Minister for Finance. When presenting the ministerial statement on the Review of Commonwealth Functions, the Prime Minister stated that the interest subsidy to the Australian Wheat Board 'is to be reduced by one percentage point'. The Minister for Primary Industry has since claimed that the statement referred only to a one per cent increase in the rate charged by the Reserve Bank Rural Credits Department. Did the Government instruct the Bank to increase the rate? If so, when will the Government table the instruction as required by section 11 of the Reserve Bank Act? If not-that is, if it was an autonomous Reserve Bank decision-why was it misrepresented by the Prime Minister as a razor gang decision? Why did the Prime Minister refer only to the Wheat Board when several other statutory bodies, including the Australian Dairy Corporation, would be affected by Rural Credits Department interest rates? Finally, why did the Prime Minister use the future tense-that is, he said 'is to be'-when the Rural Credits Department rate was raised by one per cent a month before he spoke and by one-half per cent a fortnight after he spoke?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2056" SPEAKER="Guilfoyle Sen The Hon Dame M.G.C." NAMEID="6D7" PARTY="LP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FINANCE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="6D7">Senator Dame MARGARET GUILFOYLE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash; A number of matters were raised by Senator Walsh in his question. The Treasurer today answered a question which included some of the matters raised by Senator Walsh. The important part of the Treasurer's response was that, because of the significant policy implications, particularly to Australian primary industry, of variations in the interest rate charged on Rural Credits Department advances, it has been a long-standing practice for there to be close consultation between the Government, normally through the Treasurer of the day, and the Reserve Bank of Australia regarding the level of interest. The Treasurer went on to say that, as the questioner in the other place implied, the final decision on the level of Rural Credits Department advances is a matter for the Reserve Bank to determine. The Treasurer added:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There has been no section 11 notice, letter or whatever one likes to call it written nor indeed is that in contemplation. I have written a letter to the Governor of the Reserve Bank informing him formally of the decision that was the subject of the Prime Minister's announcement.</PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer went on to say that already, over the past few months, there had been changes in the rate of interest charged on Rural Credits Department advances. He added:</PARA>
<PARA> There was one in March and there was one, I think, on 15 May. Also there have been some fluctuations in the market rate of interest charged on borrowings by the Australian Wheat Board to the extent that it is borrowing on the commercial market. The intent of the Review of Commonwealth Functions committee decision and the intent of the Prime Minister's announcement was to indicate a view on the part of the Government that the differential ought to be less by reason of a further rise. The question of any additional increase which would at some time be needed to give full effect to the intent of the Government's decision, a further increase of one per cent, is something that the Reserve Bank itself must determine, taking into account a variety of factors, some of which have been canvassed in the honourable gentleman's question.</PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer did write to the Governor of the Reserve Bank and draw to his attention the decision of the review committee and the announcement by the Prime Minister at the time that statement was made to the Parliament. If any further matters are involved in Senator Walsh's question I will see that additional advice is given to him.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to ask a supplementary question. I remind the Minister that the question was directed to her, not in her capacity as Minister representing the Treasurer but in her capacity as Minister for Finance and as a member of the committee concerned. The Treasurer did not answer the question in the House of Representatives, and neither has she. Specifically, since she was a member of the committee, can she tell us whether the Government had decided that the interest rate would be increased by one per cent, and if the Government did not make that decision-if, as the Treasurer claimed and she now claims, it was a decision of the Reserve Bank-why it was misrepresented in the report as a decision of the ministerial committee? If, as her answer given just now implies, the interest rate is to be increased by one per cent subsequent to the Prime Minister's statement of 30 April, can we anticipate another one-half per cent increase in the Rural Credits Department rate, irrespective of whether the Rural Credits Department chooses to make that decision autonomously? I remind the Minister that she is being asked the question as a member of the review committee and should know. She should not seek to take refuge behind what the Treasurer said, or do as she usually does and state that she will refer it to the Treasurer for his comments.</PARA></TALK.START>

In the next financial year the health funding grant to be paid within general revenue grants for health services is to be based upon the same level of funds as paid in the present financial year for public hospitals, for the general community health program and for the school dental health programs, plus a factor to cover inflation, and, as the honourable senator pointed out in his question, less 60 per cent of a State's assessed revenue raising capacity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Following the Health Ministers conference on 8 May and consideration of the views put forward by States and the Northern Territory, the Commonwealth reviewed the question of the assessment of the additional revenue capacity of the States. Arising from these considerations, the Commonwealth has decided that a review will be made towards the end of 1981-82 of its assessment of States' capacity to increase revenue in the light of experience. The manner in which it was to proceed and the nature of the proposed review was the subject of discussion at the Health Ministers conference in Canberra yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA> It was considered important that States be aware as early as possible of the factors in the assessment as a means of establishing their charging policies and the levels of charges. It was agreed that Commonwealth and State officers would meet as soon as possible to finalise the factors to be taken into account in the review, as well as assessment procedures and mechanisms. This approach will ensure that the review will take into account any special factors which may exist in a particular State. Any necessary adjustments to funding will be made after the results of the review have been considered. The special grant to Queensland for 1981-82 will be a cushioning adjustment of $16m for 1981-82 only. The 60 per cent of Queensland's assessed capacity to increase revenue will be reduced accordingly. The residual 40 per cent of assessed revenue available to the State is not affected by the allowance of $16m.</PARA>

I will refer that part of the question to the Prime Minister and get him to respond to that section.

As I understand the Bowen report, it has no particular relation to this matter, but we will be in fact implementing the Bowen report. The Bowen report is a creature of this Government. It would have been competent upon the Australian Labor Party when in government to have brought down guidelines. Apparently now it suddenly has discovered that it has some guidelines on ethics on this matter. My understanding is that the Bowen report has no such guidelines to cover this matter, but if it has we will look at them and see.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> My understanding also is that members from both sides of the chamber have accepted invitations over the years at their own judgment. For example, it is common for them to receive invitations to have free trips on inaugural flights on airlines. Members on both sides of the chamber have accepted invitations from governments. The question of whether any interest is implied is a matter for the judgment of the individual and the overall integrity of the individual. Any member of parliament is constantly coming under pressure to receive information on a variety of matters and is subjected to particular interests day after day. It is for the member of parliament to get to understand the issues and make value judgments objectively. The real test of integrity comes when the judgment is made on issues, when the member speaks or votes on the issues. There is a precedent for what has happened.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen the article which appeared in the April 1981 issue of Choice. I thank the honourable senator for drawing this matter to the attention of the Senate. I am aware that that article advised mothers not to give rusks to their infants because the rusks contain excessive amounts of sugar or salt. The honourable senator's question contains particular and general questions. The Minister for Health is aware that the reported levels of sugar and salt in some of the rusks are significantly higher than the upper limits presently listed in a National Health and Medical Research Council draft standard for cereal-based foods for infants and children. This matter is of nutritional concern. The Department of Health's food and nutrition policy recommends a reduction in the community's intake of sugar and salt.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On average, Australians consume about one kilogram of sugar per head per week, two-thirds of which is obtained from processed foods. It is estimated that nearly one-fifth of the food energy in the Australian diet comes from sugar. Australians also consume excessive amounts of salt in relation to their needs and there is concern about the link between salt intake and the later development of hypertension.</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Health agrees that it is important to limit the amount of sugar and salt in foods for infants and young children, both to promote their nutritional health and to foster good food habits, a matter about which the honourable senator asked. Information on feeding young children, provided in nutritional publications of the Department of Health, recommends that foods with a high sugar or salt content should be used sparingly. I am sure that Senator Missen will be interested to know that a joint departmental and food industry working party has been set up by the National Health and Medical Research Council to develop the food standard that I referred to earlier. This standard will establish upper limits for the amounts of sugar and salt in cereal-based foods for infants and children. The Minister for Health has advised me that the working party has been asked to expedite work on this standard. When finalised the standard will be recommended to the States and Territories for adoption in food legislation.</PARA>

I have no doubt that the States are able to carry out effectively the public health role which properly falls to them. The honourable senator asked first whether I was aware of a statement of the Assistant Director of the Victorian Public Health Commission that the germ, the pneumophila, causing legionnaires disease is widely spread in nature. I am aware of that. I am also aware that it can cause two separate illnesses. One is an illness which occurs quite commonly, which is called Pontiac fever. The other is an illness which occurs infrequently, which is called legionnaires disease. Legionnaires disease is less frequent and more serious. Pontiac fever, as I am sure Senator Elstob will be interested to know, is very frequent but is not serious and has some elements of la grippe, if I may use a French term.</PARA></TALK.START>

Under the terms of the agreement, EEC countries must receive back from the Soviet Union the same quantity of uranium as is sent for enrichment, and these transfers will be monitored by the International Atomic Energy Agency. I ask the Minister whether he thinks for one second that the Soviet Union would consider processing our uranium unless it was in its own best interests to do so? Can he categorically assure the Senate that the monitoring to be carried out by the IAEA is completely fail-safe and that every kilogram of Australian uranium will be meticulously accounted for? What is to stop the Soviet Union, in an emergency situation, from unilaterally impounding Australian uranium and enriching it to nuclear weapons grade? What possible sanctions could be imposed against the Soviet Union if it chose to do this?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The first premise that I invite Senator Chipp to address himself to, and which he will accept, is that the use of uranium for warlike purposes involves the derivation of plutonium from it. Also I would like him to accept the melancholy fact that Russia has such an abundance of plutonium in its own stocks that it is many, many times the volume that it could ever possibly need for any kind of warlike purposes. So the thought that Russia will look towards acquiring uranium from some part of the world to process, enrich, upgrade and reprocess to get plutonium in order to help its weapon stocks is not soundly based. In the first place, on that ground one would not expect, even if one mistrusted the Soviet's motives as well one may reasonably do, that it would look towards Australian uranium or uranium from any other country as a source of plutonium. It so happens that the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics has an abundant source of uranium for its own purposes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The International Atomic Energy Agency is a monitoring body which has world respect and world trust. It is the belief of this Government, and the belief of governments of the world, that the Agency is capable of so monitoring the movement of all uranium products around the world that it can detect whether there is any appreciable loss in weight in processing or reprocessing the product. Yes, we do believe that the IAEA can do this job. Indeed we have our Australian Safeguards Office as a strong auditing body working closely with the international body. If Senator Chipp is worried that it would be Russia's aim to secure plutonium, I have to say that Russia has more than abundant sources of both uranium and plutonium. I do not find any joy in that at all.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The inquiry that was set up to study the feasibility and economics of a power grid for south-eastern Australia is one that could in the longer term bring great benefits to Australia. Initially, the inquiry was directed to South Australia, Tasmania, Victoria and New South Wales. It could readily have included a State further north, Queensland. It is sometimes said that neither New South Wales nor Victoria has any interest in a further grid. As I think an interjector said, last week, had the inquiry gone much further, it could well have disproven that point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There is considerable thought about and benefit in, first of all, extending the grid to South Australia. I hope that South Australia will be able to find workable quantities of good coal so as to have in the decades ahead coal powered stations operating in areas where there is likely to be very big industrial development in the future.</PARA>
<PARA> I am aware of the report of the Institution of Engineers. I have in mind that figure of roughly $230m as the estimated cost of a cable going under Bass Strait. Indeed, the Institution of Engineers went on to say that the overall savings by using peaks and base loads properly and by using the hydro-electrics of both Tasmania and the Snowy Mountains properly would be the equivalent of something in the order of two or more new power stations, that is to say, several billion dollars in real money.</PARA>
<PARA> I know that the Ziedler Committee has seen that report. I know that it has studied it. The Ziedler Committee is, I think, to bring down a report-it may be an interim or the full report-in the very near future-in a matter, I think, of weeks.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Has the attention of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs been drawn to the Press announcement that the Transcontinental Hotel at Oodnadatta has been purchased by the Aboriginal community? Is this purchase in line with the Government's program of encouraging private enterprise ventures by the community? Has the Minister inspected the hotel property purchased? Does he propose to visit it again? Does he recall his visit there with a Senate committee? Is he satisfied that the Transcontinental Hotel is a suitable place to be used as a community venture? In serious terms I ask the Minister whether he has any information on community projects which Aboriginal organisations may purchase and develop, as I believe this one is being developed, for the benefit of the total local community.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that with the relocation of the railway that used to pass through Oodnadatta it has become possible for the hotel at Oodnadatta, the Transcontinental Hotel, to be purchased by Kuyata Pty Ltd, an Aboriginal body which had previously operated a housing association under another name. The cost of the hotel was $100,000 and the funds were obtained by way of a loan from the Aboriginal Development Commission. It is true that I have visited the hotel. I actually stayed there one night with Senator Jean Melzer. I understand that a couple of other senators also were present that night on committee business. It was a most memorable occasion, not least because someone in Oodnadatta threatened to shoot someone-we think it was a member of our party-but I am pleased to say that we all got back in one piece and did our Senate committee business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The hotel was purchased as a business venture to provide employment and training opportunities. The purchase will assist the community to control alcohol sales. The community members, through its control of trading hours and conditions, hopes to benefit from better control over the access to alcohol. I just add that the support given by the Aboriginal Development Commission is an expression of the Government's policy of facilitating self-sufficiency and self-management while at the same time helping Aboriginal communities to pursue other community priorities. Yes, Mr President, I do know the Transcontinental Hotel. I do not intend to return to stay there again in the near future.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. As it is now four weeks since he and the Minister for Health announced changes which would allegedly assist disadvantaged patients in the community, I ask him whether he can inform the Senate of any details of this scheme. For instance, will unemployed people be automatically issued with cards declaring them to be disadvantaged or will they have to apply for them? How often will these cards be issued? Will wage earners who have come into the disadvantaged bracket have to produce pay slips, bank books, credit union cards and so on to get this disadvantaged status?</PARA></TALK.START>

With respect to people who are applying as people who come within the income test, it would not be expected that in every case the sort of information that the honourable senator mentioned would be required. It may be that in some cases some checking would be required, but since there will be a very substantial number of people involved I would think the same sort of detail as is required in social service applications, which is normally the completion of forms and the minimal production of supporting material, would be necessary.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the question raised by the honourable senator would relate to what is known as the youth services scheme, which is one of a number of programs administered by my Department in the area of emergency housing or emergency accommodation. I say that because it is that scheme which is funded on a dollar for dollar cost sharing basis with the State. The scheme is specifically related to the young homeless who are caught in a situation and who need temporary assistance. It is a pilot program which was formulated by my predecessor Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle who, I believe in 1978, obtained the agreement of the States to a cost-sharing program which was to proceed for three years and to be subject to evaluation. In fact, the pilot program will have to go beyond three years from the time of its inception because not all States commenced the program at the same time. I believe the State of Victoria was the first to become involved in the program. As a result, the pilot scheme will proceed probably until mid-1982 and funding of it by the Commonwealth will continue to that time. It is an important program because a phenomenon of homeless youth appears to be developing. It is a matter about which the Government has expressed concern. I am pleased that the Senate also has shown its concern by having the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare commence an inquiry into the matter under the chairmanship of Senator Walters. I understand that that Committee hopes to report early next year. One would imagine that its report would be of assistance to the Government in deciding on the future of the program. It is important that some protection should be provided for people, of whatever age, who find themselves in a homeless and emergency situation. A series of programs are aimed at meeting the need in that area.</PARA></TALK.START>

In fact, the figures given by the honourable senator were those cited by Professor Hollows, who has resigned. I ask: What concern and regret is the Minister prepared to express, especially since Professor Hollows said, amongst other things, that he no longer wished to co-operate with a government that deliberately placed Aboriginal health at the feet of State governments. Is the Minister prepared to invite Professor Hollows to reverse his decision? If not, what has the Government in mind with a view to replacing in the program people of the status of Professor Hollows?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;First may I say that later today the Government will bring down a comprehensive statement on Aboriginal health in response to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs report on that subject. The statement will take into account the report of the trachoma committee and an officials document that was prepared on that subject. I think the statement will contain the kind of substantive material that Senator Georges seeks. I do not intend to pre-empt that statement which, as it is a response to a House of Representatives committee, will be made in the House of Representatives, although I will table it here and make a brief statement. It is not true that the Commonwealth has handed back to the States any management of Aboriginal health programs. That being the case, there was no basis and at no stage has there been a basis for Professor Hollows to make the assertions that he made. Certainly there was no ground for him to resign on the basis of those assertions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I have said publicly on a number of occasions in the Press and on radio, I am sorry that he has resigned. I am sorry because I believe his resignation does not serve Aboriginal people well. I believe they were looking to him for certain skills. I believe he has walked away from the situation on the basis of no firm body of information. Honourable senators may wish to remind themselves that Professor Hollows resigned last Friday and that he did so knowing that a statement was coming into the Parliament this week. If he wanted to resign, the time to resign was when he had examined the statement. One must wonder why he took that course of resigning ahead of time on the basis of assertions which are patently incorrect. What Professor Hollows does next is entirely up to him.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 7 May Senator MacGibbon asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for the Capital Territory, a question without notice concerning the awarding of a multi-storey allowance to carpenters working on the new Parliament House site and also the latest cost estimate for the new Parliament House. The Minister for the Capital Territory has now provided me with the following answer: Firstly, the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission has determined that the existing multi-storey allowance of 16c an hour contained in the already established Carpenters, Joiners and Bricklayers (Australian Capital Territory) Award should apply to the new Parliament House project. At present this affects one carpenter and one apprentice and is retrospective to the date of their commencement on site earlier this year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Secondly, the cost of the building has not risen to $300m at May 1978 prices as reported in certain newspaper articles. The approved budget for the building is still $220m at May 1978 prices. This was agreed to by Parliament in August 1980 and remains the Parliament House Construction Authority's budget. The effects of inflation on the prices of materials and labour in the building industry in the three years since May 1978 have been estimated at 35 per cent plus. Therefore, the cost of the building plus an allowance for inflation is estimated to be $296m at June 1981 prices. The Parliament House Construction Authority is maintaining a very tight control of costs involved in this project and is firmly committed to maintaining in real terms the approved budget of $220m at May 1978 prices. There is no intention to terminate the program, as suggested by the honourable senator; rather there is a real incentive to maintain the considerable momentum already achieved and, in doing so, to minimise the effects of inflation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 13 May during the second reading debate on the Quarantine Amendment Bill Senator Sibraa indicated that coastal surveillance was a five-day a week task. In my response I indicated that aerial surveillance of the coastline was a seven-day a week daylight operation, 365 days a year, subject to weather. Whilst my answer was correct, I am advised that it may mislead some honourable senators into believing all sectors of the northern coastline are always overflown daily. This is not so. The situation is that aircraft are programmed on a monthly basis by the Australian Coastal Surveillance Centre to overfly the coastline daily between Karratha in Western Australia north about to the Roper River in the Northern Territory and from Weipa north about to Cairns, including the Torres Strait. Surveillance aircraft are programmed to overfly the coastline from the Roper River to Weipa on alternate days. Experience has shown that this latter part of the coastline is one of very low vessel activity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> For most sectors, contracts were recently renegotiated with the relevant aircraft operators to allow variation by coastal surveillance authorities in aircraft flight patterns, flight times and day to day scheduling so that variability and flexibility can be built into the program and emergent needs met as they arise across sectors. These arrangements allow aircraft to be redeployed by coastal surveillance authorities and the intensity of aerial surveillance of the coastline to be varied at relatively short notice. This can result in a variation up or down in the programmed frequency of surveillance flights in particular sectors. The Australian Coastal Surveillance Centre, which is responsible for day to day operational co-ordination and the receipt and distribution of coastline surveillance reports, operates on a 24-hour a day, seven-day a week basis.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am making a statement in relation to the August 1979 Report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations entitled 'Advance to the Minister for Finance', which was tabled by the Chairman on 11 October 1979.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I regret that the Government's response to the Report has taken longer than expected; consultative processes extending for longer than anticipated. But some of the recommendations have already been implemented. </PARA>
<PARA> In essence, the Committee concluded that a centrally controlled contingency fund for urgent expenditure, as provided by the Advances, is a proper tool of Government. Although satisfied that there had been no misuse of the advances, the Committee went on to suggest certain changes to the operation of the system. The Committee largely directed its attention to the use made of the Advances available under Appropriation Acts 1 and 2 and Supply Acts 1 and 2:</PARA>
<PARA> to supplement existing appropriations; and</PARA>
<PARA> to fund new services for which no prior specific appropriation has been made.</PARA>
<PARA>While accepting that contingency funding arrangements are necessary for both these purposes, the Committee was concerned that:</PARA>
<PARA> existing criteria for determing issues from the Advances are 'too vague and subjective' and that, with the criteria being laid down only in the Finance Directions-which apply only to officials-Ministers are not necessarily bound by them:</PARA>
<PARA> there was no limit on the amount Governments could seek under the Advance appropriations; and</PARA>
<PARA> the degree of disclosure of funding from the Advance was insufficient. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has given careful and sympathetic consideration to the recommendations of the Committee. Where it has not been able to adopt a specific recommendation, it has endeavoured to find a compromise that met the spirit of the Committee's thinking. In so doing, the Government records its recognition of the important contribution made by the Committee in further development of procedures for ensuring the continued proper use of the Advance to the Minister for Finance. </PARA>
<PARA> I now announce the Government's response to each individual recommendation of the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION 1 'Expenditure from the Advance in addition to items already appropriated for, or new items, be permitted only in ''urgent and unforeseen'' circumstances.'</PARA>
<PARA> The Government accepts that the issue of funds from the Advance be on the basis that the contemplated expenditure is deemed to be 'urgent and unforeseen' at the time of preparing the relevant Appropriation Bills and cannot reasonably await the passage of an Appropriation Bill. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government also accepts that, in general, issues from the Advance should be for expenditures which were unforeseen at the time of preparation of previously introduced or enacted Appropriation Bills, but notes that there are occasions on which foreseen expenditures become urgent (that is, in effect, the urgency is unforeseen and payment is required to be made before an Appropriation Bill under consideration by the Parliament is enacted). </PARA>
<PARA> The Government also points out that whether or not an expenditure is foreseen is dependent in part on the accepted rules of estimating amounts to be provided in the Appropriation Bills, namely that estimates for all items of expenditure shall represent a realistic assessment of the sum that is expected to be spent having regard to the information available to the Government and the prices prevailing at the time of preparation. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION 2 'The above criteria be set out in the Finance Regulations made under the Audit Act.'</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has noted the terms of a legal advising to the effect that practical legal difficulties would arise in dealing with requests for the issue of funds from the Advance if the words 'urgent and unforeseen' were to be included in legislation. It also noted that the making of a regulation for this purpose under the Audit Act would not be a valid exercise of the regulation making power under the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has considered whether it should seek power to enable such a regulation to be made but has decided not to pursue that course in view of the administrative difficulties outlined in the legal advising. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the Government recognises the Committee's desire to see some form of legislative provision constraining the use of the Advances of supplementing existing appropriations for specified purposes, and for new services for which no specific appropriation has been made. In these cases, the Government is prepared to include in the Schedules to the Appropriation and Supply Acts a clause which provides for the Minister for Finance to be satisfied that expenditure from the Advances is urgent and unforeseen; such a clause was introduced in the Appropriation Acts (Nos 1 and 2) 1980-81. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION 3 'The amount appropriated to the Advance in Appropriation Acts No. 1 and No. 2 be limited to 2.3 per cent of the total of the previous year's general Appropriation Acts. If the amount is exceeded, then the matter should be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations and the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure.'</PARA>
<PARA> The Government does not agree that the amounts to be appropriated for the Advances in the Appropriation Acts Nos 1 and 2 should be limited to 2.3 per cent of the total of the previous year's general Appropriation Acts. The Government believes that the level of the Advances to be sought in a particular year is dependent on a number of factors, including past experience, the need for restraint in public expenditures, and Parliamentary attitudes. The Government considers that the current practice under which the Minister for Finance gives careful consideration to the amount to be sought, consulting, as necessary, other senior Ministers, is appropriate and less arbitrary. It should be noted that since 1977-78 the percentage of the Advance to the total of the Appropriation Acts has fallen from 2.4 per cent to 2.0 per cent and the Government would wish to see no undue increase in this relativity other than in exceptional circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is not therefore disposed to accept this recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION 4 'The explanations accompanying the Appropriation Bills, which are examined by Senate Estimates Committees, be accompanied by a separate section for each Department showing the funds which have already been provided from the Advance.'</PARA>
<PARA> The Government agrees that it would assist the Parliament in its examination of Appropriation Bills if departmental explanatory notes were to be accompanied by a section showing funds which have already been provided from the Advances. The Government notes, however, that issues continue to be made from the Advances after the date on which the explanatory notes are prepared and, indeed, may continue to be made until Governor-General's Warrant is obtained following the enactment of the Bills. However, the Government will direct departments to supply up to date lists of issues to the Chairman of the appropriate Estimates Committee at the commencement of the examination of each department's estimates; such a procedure was implemented in respect of the Estimates Committee hearings for the 1980-81 Budget estimates. </PARA>
<PARA>RECOMMENDATION 5</PARA>
<PARA> 'A statement of approvals of expenditure from the Advance be published at the end of each calendar month and then tabled in Parliament at the earliest opportunity. The statement should indicate into which category each item of expenditure falls, i.e. whether it is expenditure to fund payments pending the issue of Governor-General's Warrant, to make advances which will be repaid within the financial year, to make moneys available for supplementation of existing appropriations for specified purposes or to make moneys available for new services for which no specific appropriation has been made. The statement should show all expenditure which requires the creation of a new appropriation item, but only expenditure above $50,000 for the other categories.'</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has no objection in principle to this recommendation, but questions whether the cost of both publication and tabling could be justified. Following further correspondence on the matter, the Chairman of the Committee has indicated that tabling of the statement would be sufficient. Accordingly, the Minister for Finance will table a categorised statement of issues from the Advances at the earliest opportunity after the commencement of each Sitting and at approximately monthly intervals thereafter. </PARA>
<PARA>MINISTERIAL STATEMENT BY THE HONOURABLE M. J. R. MACKELLAR, M.P., MINISTER FOR HEALTH</PARA>
<PARA>Commonwealth Government response to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs' Report on Aboriginal Health</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> 'The standard of health of Aboriginals is far lower than that of the majority of Australians and would not be tolerated if it existed in the Australian community as a whole.'</PARA>
<PARA> This is the main finding of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs, in its Report on Aboriginal Health. </PARA>
<PARA> The same message comes through in two other reports now before the Government: The National Trachoma and Eye Health Program and the Government's own Program Effectiveness Review on Aboriginal health. Both show that the health of Aboriginal Australians is unacceptably low. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government agrees with this assessment and reaffirms its objective of raising the health status of Aboriginals to that of the rest of the community.</PARA>
<PARA> The hard fact is that, while we have channelled many millions of dollars into Aboriginal health and health-related programs, and in spite of all our efforts-and despite some improvements which have occurred-the level of Aboriginal health is still unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA> Whilst there has been some improvement in the health status of Aboriginals, health services alone cannot provide the solution for all the problems. Nor are they the responsibility of any one Government. The problems will have to be overcome by a co-operative and co-ordinated effort involving many arms of both the Commonwealth and State Governments as well as Aboriginals themselves and their representative organisations. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important that we look at what we are doing and ensure that we are not just providing services and nothing more. We must evaluate existing programs to ensure that they are directed towards-and actually do result in-an improvement in Aboriginal health and social well-being. To this end, Commonwealth support for Aboriginal health programs will be made conditional upon a set of specific goals and objectives, which include Commonwealth Aboriginal Affairs policy, being drawn up for each program, against which its attainment can be measured. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has received timely offers of assistance from professional health organisations. The Royal Australasian College of Physicians, whose members have undertaken much of the original research on respiratory, cardiovascular, renal, metabolic and paediatric problems among the Aboriginal population, considers that Aboriginal health is a major social issue in which its involvement could be increased. The Australian Medical Association has also expressed its concern and offered assistance. The Government appreciates the interest shown by these and other professional bodies and intends to pursue the offers, particularly in relation to evaluating health services to Aboriginals. </PARA>
<PARA>The reportsThere have been numerous reports on Aboriginal health. They have all painted much the same picture. I turn now to the background of the three reports which the Government has considered. </PARA>
<PARA> The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs received references on Aboriginal health from the House of Representatives on 1 December 1976 and 10 March 1977. On 16 March 1978 the then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, the Hon. Ian Viner, gave the Committee its terms of reference. I seek leave to have them incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The terms of reference read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES STANDINGCOMMITTEE ON ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS</PARA>
<PARA>Terms of Reference-Aboriginal Health</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> (1) Examine the health problems of Aboriginals with particular attention to-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the prevalence of different types of disease suffered by Aboriginals and Aboriginal communities;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) the relationship between Aboriginal health and environmental, social and cultural factors;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) the effectiveness of existing health care programs for Aboriginals generally, and the adequacy of Western European-type health services to cope with the health problems of Aboriginals; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) alternative methods of health care delivery that take account of Aboriginals' lifestyles, including camp situations. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) That the Committee consider ways and means by which-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) persons with appropriate qualifications can be encouraged to assist Aboriginals achieve a better standard of health, and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Aboriginals including traditional healers can participate in the development and delivery of health care services to their own communities, and in any modification of existing services. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) That the Committee recommend possible courses of action. </PARA>
<PARA> Having taken evidence through submissions, public hearings and community visits, the Parliamentary Committee presented its Report on 20 March 1979. </PARA>
<PARA> The Trachoma Report was prepared by the Royal Australian College of Opthalmologists. It describes the most extensive screening, diagnosis and treatment coverage of eye disease ever undertaken in this country. The field teams involved in the National Trachoma and Eye Health Program also detected and arranged treatment for a variety of other illnesses. The Report was presented to the Parliament by me on 1 April 1980. </PARA>
<PARA> A Program Effectiveness Review was conducted by Commonwealth officials during 1980 to determine, as far as possible, the health status of Aboriginals and the effectiveness of current Aboriginal health programs and of other programs which affect Aboriginal health. </PARA>
<PARA> The review team drew information about the programs from Commonwealth Departments and took into account the findings of the two reports I have already mentioned as well as other related reports. The officials also visited Aboriginal communities and consulted with people directly involved in community-based health care programs. </PARA>
<PARA> The Officials' Report was completed during 1980. </PARA>
<PARA>Main findings of the Reports These three reports are obviously inter-related, and it is appropriate for the Government to consider them together in its response to the Parliamentary Committee's report. They contain common fundamental concerns and recommendations, but differ considerably in detail. We have therefore felt it necessary to give careful attention to the major themes of each and the various proposals advanced. </PARA>
<PARA> The reports all confirm three things:</PARA>
<PARA> the unsatisfactory health status of Aboriginals;</PARA>
<PARA> the urgent need to improve the enviromental conditions affecting Aboriginal's health; and</PARA>
<PARA> the importance of increasing Aboriginal involvement in the design, control and delivery of health care services. </PARA>
<PARA>Environmental improvements Each report referred to the need to increase efforts to improve the environmental conditions in which many Aboriginals live. Much of the ill-health experienced by Aboriginals is directly associated with a sub-standard physical environment:</PARA>
<PARA> The Parliamentary Committee recommended that 'the highest priority be given and immediate action taken to provide clean and adequate water supplies to all Aboriginal communities' (R. 1 para. 138)</PARA>
<PARA> The Trachoma Report found in rural Australia that, when the hygiene of Aboriginals approached that of non-Aboriginals so did the prevalence rate of the diseases measured. So for those people living in unhygienic conditions it recommended that appropriately designed and equipped houses be provided (Trachoma R. 1, para. 180), and that houses should contain a water supply to cater for all necessary uses and should also have efficient water-based sewerage systems and garbage disposal facilities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Officials' Report also recommended that greater priority be given to the provision of housing, water supply, sanitation and electricity. </PARA>
<PARA> The disruption of Aboriginals' traditional lifestyle has given rise to a number of widespread health problems, especially where Aboriginals have been obliged to live on reserves or settlements, or in camps, or in rural or urban areas, under conditions of poverty. The problems include poor water supplies, dangerous sanitary conditions, overcrowding and limited access to nutritious food. The spread of illness and disease has been facilitated, especially respiratory, ear and skin infections, and intestinal parasite illnesses. The disruption of their society and lifestyles and its effects have also produced despair, chronic disadvantage and alcohol abuse. </PARA>
<PARA> The situation is not amenable to short-term solutions, and Government programs over many years have sought to improve services and facilities in such ways as will encourage Aboriginals to assume responsibility for decisions about their lifestyles and their futures. The effort must be maintained and expanded while the problems remain as serious as they are. </PARA>
<PARA> Once preventive measures begin to take effect, succeeding generations will not be saddled to the same extent with the wide spectrum of diseases-eye, ear, respiratory, gastro-intestinal, skin etc, that are less frequent in the non-Aboriginal population. Of course, in the meantime, health services play an important role by alleviating distress and improving the quality of life. It is our intention that all children, including Aboriginal children, will have a much better start to life than has been the case for so many in the past and which is so important in the long term for improved health status. </PARA>
<PARA> Aboriginals themselves have stressed the prime importance of adequate housing. That priority has been, and continues to be, reflected in the programs of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> For example, since 1975-76, the Government has provided $298.2m for Aboriginal housing, including hostels. During the last full financial year (1979-80), 1632 houses were built or purchased for Aboriginals and 205 home loans provided throughout the States and the Northern Territory with Commonwealth funds totalling $59.9m. The last Budget provided in excess of $72m for Aboriginal housing and accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA> These substantial increases in funds for Aboriginal housing show how determined we are to respond to Aboriginals' own priorities. </PARA>
<PARA> The figures give the lie to uninformed claims that funds have been cut. The Government has considerably expanded funds for Aboriginal housing and accommodation even while these reports have been under consideration. Those increased funds are flowing into this priority area of need. We have not delayed action-we have accelerated it. Much remains to be done-we do not deny that. But the Government's achievements in Aboriginal housing are substantial and growing each year. In fact, in some States, the time is now within sight when the housing backlog will have been overtaken. </PARA>
<PARA> Increasing attention is also being given, within the Department of Aboriginal Affairs' allocation, to programs administered under the general heading of Community Management and Services, for municipal-type services to Aboriginal community organizations, reserves and settlements. Here our role has been essentially a topping-up of State and local government activities. </PARA>
<PARA> However the Commonwealth expects the States and the Northern Territory also to honour their responsibilities towards their Aboriginal citizens. Aboriginal people, like other citizens living in a particular State or Territory, are entitled to expect basic municipal services to be provided by State or local government. The Commonwealth has done much to help overcome past neglect, but it is not, and should not be regarded as, the only source of funds for providing services to Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> While we expect the State and Territory Governments to take up this challenge, we understand that a special effort will be needed. That is what the Government had in mind in committing an extra $50m over five years for environmental health improvement. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned earlier that the efforts which have been made have not always been as effective as we would have liked. The Government is looking to shared funding arrangements under this program in a joint Commonwealth/State effort to eradicate at least the worst of the environmental conditions under which many Aboriginal communities in rural and remote areas live. </PARA>
<PARA> Finding, storing and distributing clean water supplies, and installing waste disposal systems are costly exercises. We must get our priorities correct, and make sure that Aboriginal communities' priorities are fully known. The technology used must suit the community environment. Good planning here may take time, but it will pay off. </PARA>
<PARA> It will be necessary to co-ordinate planning for the environmental improvements which are needed, so that we can determine which projects should be funded under this program in terms of national as well as community priorities. The Commonwealth intends to discuss these matters with relevant State Ministers and with Aboriginal representatives. I expect that there will be a range of subsequent discussions involving officers. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Aboriginal Affairs has a regular program of consultation and co-ordination with State authorities and with Aboriginal organizations, leading up to the preparation of its program for each financial year. At that Department's request, some proposals have already been identified for additional environmental health projects in the normal budget process for 1981/82. Again, we have not waited, or delayed action. The job is underway and we want to accelerate its progress, in co-operation with State and local authorities and with their financial support. </PARA>
<PARA> In considering projects for inclusion under the new program, we will be looking to concentrate the additional funds on those larger-scale water supply and waste disposal projects which have the highest priority of need, but which are difficult for the Commonwealth or the States to accommodate in their normal ongoing budgets. </PARA>
<PARA> Special needs arise in the increasing number of small outstation communities in traditional areas. It is not appropriate in these cases to provide permanent major capital works which would disrupt the preferred lifestyle. </PARA>
<PARA> We are much encouraged by reports received that the health and well-being of Aboriginals at outstations is, on the whole, an improvement on the health of those people in the past. Nevertheless, the Government believes there should be adequate water supply and waste disposal to supplement the provision of basic services by members of outstation communities. </PARA>
<PARA> With major works being undertaken through the Environmental Health Program, relatively minor works which are also of high priority will be able to be accommodated within ongoing programs, where increased emphasis is already being placed on such measures. </PARA>
<PARA>Aboriginal involvement in the planning and delivery of services We know that conventional health services have real difficulties in winning the confidence of Aboriginal people. That confidence and familiarity are essential to effective and early use of health services. The reports before us all confirm that services which Aboriginals perceive as remote or impersonal have not been acceptable and therefore not effective in tackling their serious health problems. Because non-Aboriginals share the culture and outlook of most health personnel and have a lifelong familiarity with the institutions and values of mainstream society, we find it difficult to understand the alienation of many Aboriginals. This is particularly true of our health system, which is strongly based on scientific research, institutional care and professional structures. And I have not yet mentioned the daily reality and the historical experience of disadvantage, the evidence of which Aboriginals see all around them. What they see compounds the problems and makes our task in Aboriginal health a uniquely demanding one. We must do everything possible to strengthen Aboriginal responsibility and participation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government therefore wishes to see, and will actively work towards, a marked increase in the degree of Aboriginal involvement in the control, management, design, delivery and evaluation of health care programs affecting Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Aboriginal Affairs has been involved in supporting Aboriginal health care services through two channels:</PARA>
<PARA> assistance to the States to provide an adapted general service more appropriate to Aboriginal needs and more accessible by Aboriginals; and</PARA>
<PARA> the funding of Aboriginal organizations to provide health services run and controlled by Aboriginals for Aboriginals. </PARA>
<PARA>More recently, my own Department has also assisted some established Aboriginal Medical Services by payment of Health Program Grants designed to meet salary costs of clinical staff. </PARA>
<PARA> These services have tried to close the gap between the general medical services and the health needs of Aboriginals. </PARA>
<PARA> While we want to encourage the development of programs which serve the whole community, rather than segregated services, our fundamental objective is the improvement of Aboriginal health, using the most effective means available. We will need to monitor carefully the impact of the Government's proposals on the effectiveness of the various means of service provision. </PARA>
<PARA> There is not only a need for Aboriginals to be better informed about the availability of health services, to understand the services, to feel confident in approaching them and to feel at ease in using them. There is also a very real need to improve the understanding and empathy of non-Aboriginal staff who supply the health services and control the facilities. Finally, the services must modify and adapt themselves to Aboriginal values and needs-we must not make the assumption that only Aboriginals must change. </PARA>
<PARA> The Parliamentary Committee recommended that 'Aboriginal cultural beliefs and practices which affect their health and their use of health services . . . be fully taken into account in the design and implementation of health care programs' (R.6, para. 193). The Government supports this view. </PARA>
<PARA> The people best equipped to advise on relevant cultural beliefs and practices and the appropriate adaptation of health services are Aboriginals themselves. They are also best equipped to undertake important bridging roles in health service delivery. Their responsibilities in the health care services which they use must be rapidly expanded. </PARA>
<PARA> In supporting Aboriginal health programs, the Commonwealth will require greatly increased Aboriginal involvement in the design, control, management, delivery and evaluation of services. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a need for the States and the Northern Territory to provide greater opportunities for Aboriginals to play significant and expanded roles. To achieve this goal, increasing numbers of Aboriginals will have to be trained for, and employed at, all levels. Aboriginals must also take a real and decisive part in policy and program decision-making. The way each State Government meets this goal may be different. We are firmly committed, however, to ensuring that the goal is met, and we will be taking these questions up with State Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA> In the same spirit I should like to mention that some State colleagues with responsibilities in Aboriginal affairs have in the past expressed their concern that, in administering programs on behalf of the Commonwealth, they may not have enough flexibility. For example, they may wish to reallocate funds to reflect changing circumstances. The Commonwealth would be prepared to examine this problem with any of the States which wish to redirect priorities towards mutually-acceptable policy goals, and especially Aboriginal involvement. </PARA>
<PARA> It is unacceptable that, at the present time, there are no qualified medical practitioners of Aboriginal descent, and insufficient numbers of Aboriginal people qualified for other professional and para-professional roles. We propose to have discussions on a number of fronts to make sure Aboriginals have greater opportunities in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA> It is vital that Aboriginal doctors, nurses, administrators, nurses' aides, and other health care staff should be available. We acknowledge that the necessary education and training will take time. </PARA>
<PARA> In the short-term, however, we can also look at redefining existing practical responsibilities of Aboriginals presently employed in health care. Both the States and the Aboriginal Medical Services need to be involved in the provision of opportunities through the National Employment and Training System and other programs. Nor should the role of traditional healers, who are intimately involved in services in traditional communities, be overlooked. Opportunities must be found to make use of their particular skills, which can be built on or adapted according to circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> We shall continue to give strong support to the employment of Aboriginal health workers, who have important preventive and primary care roles to perform, now and in the foreseeable future. </PARA>
<PARA>Availability and awareness of choices Most of us would take it for granted that we can choose the kind of health care we think appropriate. The Parliamentary Report makes it clear that more needs to be done to make a range of choices known and available to Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> One difference between Aboriginals and other groups in Australia is that Aboriginal people are not fully aware of the range of health care options availabe. The Parliamentary Committee recommended that 'Aboriginal communities be given the opportunity to determine the type of health service that will best suit their needs and available resources . . .' (R. 10, para. 314). </PARA>
<PARA> We endorse this view and commend it to State Governments. The Government will propose to the States and the Northern Territory discussions between officials, and with Aboriginal people, on this matter of choice. These discussions will be looking for a co-operative basis for increasing Aboriginals' awareness of the health service options and expanding the opportunities for Aboriginal communities to influence the types of services provided to them. This is a fundamental commitment and one which is supported by each of the reports on Aboriginal health to which I have referred. </PARA>
<PARA> In fact the Commonwealth and Victoria and Aboriginal organizations are now co-operating in a State Government working party which has these very objectives. </PARA>
<PARA> There is also scope for improving the relationship between general practitioners and Aboriginals, and increasing the use of primary care services by Aboriginals. </PARA>
<PARA> I mentioned before Commonwealth grants to Aboriginal Medical Services. These organizations provide primary health care services which are acceptable and accessible. Some of them have also begun to provide preventive services and ancillary programs in response to community needs, expressed through the close involvement of many Aboriginals in the Services. </PARA>
<PARA> The Aboriginal Medical Services are a fine example of Aboriginal initiative and of readiness to assume responsibility to improve their own health status. The Government endorses their valuable role in this field and commends also professional co-operation between Aboriginal Medical Services and State services so that their work is complementary. The Aboriginal and Islander Medical Service in Darwin, which is funded jointly by the Commonwealth and Northern Territory Governments and works in closely with existing health services, is a good example of what can be achieved through co-operation. The Government will be prepared to consider provision of assistance to similarly innovative approaches elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> We shall, of course, continue our existing support to Aboriginal Medical Services. We shall also consider, together with the States and Aboriginal people, the expansion of complementary community-based services where they offer the most effective form of health care, and work towards an expanded range of options for primary medical care. </PARA>
<PARA> Aboriginals must be involved to the fullest possible extent in selecting the most appropriate health care options. This policy is consistent, the Government believes, with a cardinal principle of the Government's health policy, that people should have freedom of choice in an integrated and comprehensive system. That is something the Government wishes to see for all Australians, not the least of whom are the Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA> The Officials' Report had proposed that future funding arrangements should be focussed away from State Programs to Aboriginal Medical Services. The proposal evisaged this being done at a predetermined rate or by reference to a set formula. The Government looked carefully at the proposal. We considered these issues when we were drawing up the new arrangements for general health care funding and administration. Conscious of the fact that many Aboriginals are dependent, to some extent, upon the States' general health care systems, we took the view that we should direct more effort into encouraging the States to involve Aboriginals in the planning and provision of all health services to their people. In the case of Aboriginal Medical Services, of course, this is already a settled matter. </PARA>
<PARA>Aboriginal advisory body The Commonwealth, for its part, in demonstrating that Aboriginal involvement is so central to Government policy and so crucial to improving Aboriginal health, will seek ways of ensuring that it receives the best possible advice from Aboriginals in relation to Aboriginal health matters. We acknowledge the advice that has been provided from time to time by the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation, a federation of Aboriginal Medical Services. However, we also wish to have a more formal arrangement for advice on the whole range of health and health-related problems and needs, including medical needs. We shall therefore discuss, with the National Aboriginal Conference, arrangements to ensure that the Government receives appropriate and comprehensive advice about Aboriginal health, through the Conference. It would be fitting for the National Aboriginal Conference, as an all-Aboriginal elected body, charged with that responsibility of transmitting the views and advice of Aboriginals to the Government, to undertake this special task. </PARA>
<PARA> The Parliamentary Report recommended that a new unit be established in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. It was proposed that a group of experts on middle level technology should be set up to advise on, amongst other things, the most practical means of providing communal and household facilities in Aboriginal communities. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Aboriginal Affairs is essentially a policy co-ordination and funding body. It does not have specific functional expertise but rather draws on the resources of other departments or agencies when professional advice is needed. The same is true at the State and local levels. Where necessary, private consultants may be engaged. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government considers, therefore, that it would not be appropriate or necessary for the proposed special group to be located within the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> A second proposal was for an evaluation team to have responsibility for maintaining a check on the effectiveness of Aboriginal health care services and programs, and for the provision of standardised statistics on Aboriginal health. </PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Aboriginal Affairs has in its Central Office structure an Evaluation Branch, which conducts evaluations as an entity distinct from the rest of the Department. That Branch will be able to participate, as it has in the past, in evaluation of programs and projects, in close consultation with Aboriginal people. The Department of Aboriginal Affairs will continue to draw on resources already available, including those in other specialist departments as the need arises in undertaking evaluations against defined objectives. It will be seen, therefore, that the objective of the Standing Committee is capable of achievement under present arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>Aboriginal health statistics The Officials' Report recommended that a national system of Aboriginal health statistics be developed along the lines proposed by Dr L. R. Smith. It recommended that the Department of Health allocate, as a matter of priority, the necessary resources for the system's implementation. The lack of a uniform, national data colletion system, to provide an accurate measure of Aboriginal health status, is a deficiency which cannot be allowed to continue. In order to assess the effectiveness of Aboriginal health programs, including those which will take into account the measures I have outlined, it is essential that we measure Aboriginal health status on a uniform basis. As a matter of priority, I propose to implement a uniform system of national Aboriginal health statistics through the Department of Health. Such a system is absolutely essential for monitoring and evaluation of effectiveness. There have been discussions with State and Northern Territory authorities on this matter in recent years and the co-operation of the States and the Territory will lead to its speedy achievement. </PARA>
<PARA>Special national programs Finally, mention must be made of the valuable work done by the National Trachoma and Eye Health Program, undertaken by the Royal Australian College of Ophthalmologists. The Report highlights many adverse conditions suffered by Aboriginals which both Commonwealth and State Governments must rectify. It also graphicaly illustrates the relationship between environmental and other conditions suffered by Aboriginals and their health status. The Government supports the recommendations from the Report for the continuation of the work commenced by the Trachoma Program and recognises that, without follow-up through both therapeutic and preventive intervention, much of the effort to date may be lost. We are, therefore, taking steps to ensure that the improvements in Aboriginal eye health achieved by the Trachoma program are consolidated by means of effective follow-up and regular reporting. </PARA>
<PARA> Commonwealth officials and representatives of the College have met with Northern Territory and Western Australian authorities and the College is hopeful that a re-screening and minor surgery program will be commenced in the Northern Territory shortly. Similar meetings are proposed with other State authorities. </PARA>
<PARA> This program, supported by the Commonwealth to the extent of some $2m, has shown us how much improvement can be made, given a concentrated effort. The three reports highlighted prevalent illnesses to which this approach would be suitable. A further group of illnesses, because of their chronic nature, e.g. diabetes, would need to be the subject of long-term care programs. The Government will investigate the need for additional funds for national programs which will have a special focus on prevalent illnesses. We wish to have the advice of Aboriginal people and of the States in determining the needs, appropriate programs and priorities. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion The matters I have touched on represent the Government's general reactions to the many points made in the three reports. We are determined to play our part in bringing about a substantial improvement in the health of all Aboriginal Australians. As I said earlier, our long-term objective is to raise the level of their health to that of the Australian community generally. </PARA>
<PARA> This aim requires the co-operation of the State and Northern Territory Governments, with whom much of the responsibility lies. Of equal importance is the co-operation of the Aboriginal people themselves. Action must be taken now to provide the training needed for Aboriginals to assume wider professional and semi-professional responsibilities in health services and also to expand the roles and skills of existing health workers. This is in addition to the contribution which Aboriginals can and now should make to the planning, administration and evaluation of such services. </PARA>
<PARA> We will be reporting to the Government in mid-1982. </PARA>
<PARA> Therefore we propose immediately to open discussions with the States and Aboriginal organisations to explore ways of getting on with the job. While not denying the achievements to date, much still remains to be done. We are ready to play our part. </PARA>
<PARA> I present a statement showing in detail the Government's responses to the House of Representatives Standing Committee's Report on Aboriginal Health. I ask for leave for it to be incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs</PARA>
<PARA>Report: 'Aboriginal Health'</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>Recommendations</PARA>
<PARA>Response/comment</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>The Physical Environment-</PARA>
<PARA> 1. 'The highest priority be given and immediate action taken to provide clean and adequate water supplies to all Aboriginal communities.'</PARA>
<PARA>Endorsed. In addition to the ongoing programs of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs which provide housing, water, sanitation and other community services, the Prime Minister announced in his election policy speech a commitment to provide an additional $50m over 5 years to meet highest priority needs for water supplies, sanitation and other environmental improvements. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. 'A determined effort be undertaken to eliminate as soon as possible the unhygienic sanitary pan system in Aboriginal communities.'</PARA>
<PARA>Endorsed. There is a need to provide sewerage systems where these do not exist, and to ensure that the system provided matches the needs of the Aboriginal community. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. 'An advisory group within the Department of Aboriginal Affairs comprising experts in middle level technology be established, and in consultation with relevant departments and the Australian Institute of Aboriginal Studies to research various options for the provision of community and household facilities; consult with Aboriginal communities to assess their needs; advise them on the most appropriate facilities that best suit their needs; monitor implementation of its advice to communities; facilitate employment of technical advisors by Aboriginal communities; and report to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs.'</PARA>
<PARA>Professional advice on appropriate technology is available to Aboriginal communities and organisations from relevant Government departments and, where appropriate, private consultants. As far as possible, these arrangements are decentralised, to ensure their responsiveness to communities. The Department of Aboriginal Affairs does not itself provide professional expertise and would therefore be an inappropriate location for an advisory body on technology. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. 'Priority for Aboriginals living in towns and moving into towns away from the fringes, be given to the provision of funds for meeting and upgrading their housing needs.'</PARA>
<PARA>Housing accommodation or shelter is a high priority for Aboriginals, not only for those moving into or living in towns. Existing policy affirms the importance of Aboriginal involvement in decisions regarding the number, location, design and arrangement of housing projects. Priority is currently given to the provision of housing for Aboriginals living on reserves. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. 'The Department of Aboriginal Affairs consult relevant Commonwealth and State departments, local authorities and Aboriginal communities and organisations to define responsibility for safe water, public hygiene services, housing standards and inspection of premises in Aboriginal settlements and communities, particularly fringe camps.'</PARA>
<PARA>Endorsed. Such consultations will be part of developing a program for the expenditure of the additional funds committed by the Commonwealth for improvement of the physical environment of Aboriginal communities, as referred to in the comment in recommendation 1 above. </PARA>
<PARA>Cultural Factors-</PARA>
<PARA> 6. 'Aboriginal cultural beliefs and practices which affect their health and their use of health services such as their fear of hospitalisation, their attitudes to pain and surgery, the role of traditional healers and the differing needs and roles of Aboriginal men and women be fully taken into account in the design and implementation of health care programs.'</PARA>
<PARA>Endorsed. Current policy supports the adaptation of services and programs to meet adequately the cultural beliefs and lifestyles of Aboriginals. The Government believes that the Standing Committee has correctly identified the major cultural factors affecting Aboriginal health. These will be specifically drawn to the notice of States and the Territory in the course of discussions on Aboriginal health program funding arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA>On Health Care Programs-</PARA>
<PARA>7. 'Savings to the State-funded health services which result from the Commonwealth-funded State Aboriginal preventive health programs be directed to the further development of preventive programs.'</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee's concern that State authorities should accept some financial responsibility for improving the health of Aboriginals is endorsed. The States have already been informed that the Commonwealth expects State Governments to provide at least a pro-rata share of general revenues for Aboriginals in their own programs and those supported by the Commonwealth, and to apply the 'priority of need' principle in all such programs. In the negotiations referred to in comments on recommendations 5 and 6, the matter of joint Commonwealth/State funding will be thoroughly discussed. </PARA>
<PARA> 8. 'An independent evaluation team responsible to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs be established to evaluate the effectiveness of all Aboriginal health care services and programs in accordance with the World Health Organisation's definition of health and the principles of self-determination, and to establish suitable criteria so that standardised information can be collated and that funds be provided for the purpose where programs are funded by the Government.'</PARA>
<PARA>It is agreed that there is a need to standardise criteria for evaluation and to collate information. The Government supports reviews and assessments of Aboriginal health programs, and expects that their conclusions will be used in the modification of existing services and the development of new Aboriginal health services. </PARA>
<PARA>The idea of conducting evaluations against the World Health Organisation's definition of health and the principle of self-management is acceptable to the Government as a broad principle. The Government has reservations, however, about the usefulness of evaluations which are conducted without more specific terms of reference or criteria. These only provide evaluation criteria that are very broad and difficult to relate to the very large number of projects which may comprise 'all Aboriginal health care services and programs'. </PARA>
<PARA>A structure already exists within the Department of Aboriginal Affairs to develop and co-ordinate assessments and program reviews. The Department has within its Central Office an Evaluation Branch which conducts evaluations as an entity distinct from the rest of the Department. The Committee's objective-the establishment of an independent evaluation team-is, therefore, capable of achievement under present arrangements. Aboriginals are to be involved in any evaluation. </PARA>
<PARA> 9. 'The full range of choice of the various types of programs delivering health care to Aboriginals are maintained and, where appropriate, support increased.'</PARA>
<PARA>Endorsed. The degree of increased support will of course depend on available resources and on competing priorities in Aboriginal programs generally. </PARA>
<PARA> 10. 'Aboriginal communities be given the opportunity to determine the type of health service that will best suit their needs and available resources and that a Task Force be established to place the full range of alternative health care services before them.'</PARA>
<PARA>The Government is committed to expansion of Aboriginals' involvement in all aspects of health services affecting them, including in the design, control, management, delivery and evaluation of health services for Aboriginal people. The Government supports the development or expansion of Aboriginal responsibility in relation to State Aboriginal health programs. The recent initiatives of the South Australian and New South Wales Governments in these aspects are examples. In the context of these developments, there is no need for a 'Task Force' approach. Nor does the Government see a centralised body as necessarily the best means of ensuring what the Standing Committee has in mind. </PARA>
<PARA> 11. 'An inquiry be held into the implementation of the policy of self-determination as it affects community development.'</PARA>
<PARA>Not endorsed. The Government's policies aim at Aboriginal self-management and self-sufficiency. The Department of Aboriginal Affairs assesses, on a continual review basis, the impact of the Government's policies and programs in Aboriginal affairs on community development. </PARA>
<PARA> 12. 'Aboriginals be involved to the fullest possible extent in all stages of the provision of health care services and that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs assess the number of Aboriginals required, the time it will take to train them to assume responsibility for the health of their own people and, to this end, develop, in consultation with relevant Ministers, suitable training programs.'</PARA>
<PARA>The principle that Aboriginals should be involved to the fullest possible extent in the provision of health care services for them is strongly supported. The Government also supports the provision of suitable training, whether academic or on-the-job, to ensure the greatest possible Aboriginal participation in health care for Aboriginal people. The Commonwealth has funded training programs for Aboriginal health workers in State Health authorities and stands ready to discuss new initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government is particularly concerned to see the development of Aboriginal health professionals-doctors, dentists, nurses and para-professionals. Special measures may be needed to encourage Aboriginal students to go on such training and Commonwealth Departments will take what steps appear appropriate. </PARA>
<PARA>Beyond the measures needed to train and employ suitably qualified Aboriginal people as health professionals, there is also a need to employ Aboriginal people in administrative and clerical positions, at all levels in Commonwealth and State authorities which have responsibilities in relation to Aboriginal health. The Commonwealth Government has taken several steps to ensure these objectives are met and will commend a similar approach to the States. </PARA>
<PARA> 13. 'Training hospitals for nurses, university medical faculties and other tertiary institutions introduce into their curricula, both at undergraduate and graduate level, a component which deals with Aboriginal health.'</PARA>
<PARA>Endorsed. Whilst some hospitals and medical faculties already provide courses or segments on Aboriginal health, there needs to be a concerted effort to ensure that Aboriginal health and related matters are adequately dealt with in medical training institutions. These proposals will be taken up and actively pursued with the Tertiary Education Commission and with appropriate medical learned societies. </PARA>
<PARA> 14. 'Comprehensive orientation courses be conducted for all non-Aboriginal staff recruited to serve in Aboriginal communities before commencing duty, that they receive regular inservice training, and that a formal diploma or certificate be provided by a tertiary institution for professionals actively involved in providing health care to Aboriginals.'</PARA>
<PARA>Orientation and inservice training courses are already provided by most State and some Aboriginal organizations, but there is a need for more comprehensive and more regular training courses for non-Aboriginal staff. The proposal for a formal diploma or certificate course will be pursued in the discussions envisaged in relation to Recommendation 13. </PARA>
<PARA> 15. 'Governments introduce special allowances and entitlements which recognise the unusual working conditions and the geographical, social and professional isolation experienced by personnel working in predominantly Aboriginal communities in remote areas.'</PARA>
<PARA>Health personnel already receive the general standard allowances paid in recognition of isolation and residence in a tropical climate, but they do not receive, in their conditions of service, acknowledgement of the special difficulties they experience. Consultation with the States, Northern Territory and non-government organisations will be necessary. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>The report documents the numbers of students receiving tertiary assistance, the numbers of appeals being heard, rejected or succeeding, and so on. The overall importance or significance of this report is that it is an illustration of how totally inadequate student assistance is under the Fraser Government and how that inadequacy has been growing worse for the six years that the Fraser Government has been in office. I wish to draw attention to some of the major inadequacies of the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme from the point of view of the Federal Opposition. The most significant problems associated with the current operation of the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme are the inadequacy of the allowance, the failure to index the allowance, the inappropriate means test cut-off point, the anomalies of the scheme and the rigidities inherent in the regulations. </PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the inadequacy of the allowance, I point out that the maximum allowance payable under the scheme is $45.15 a week and is payable only to those students who are classified as independent or who, though classified as dependent, are forced to live away from home and whose parents' combined income does not exceed $9,400 per annum. Even this maximum allowance is grossly inadequate for the basic needs of a student. The inadequacy of the overall amount becomes obvious when it is recognised that the dole-that is, the unemployment benefit-for single adults is $51.45 a week. I think this is a very important point: The Government, through its Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme, is virtually forcing students out of the universities and other tertiary institutions and on to the dole. It simply makes no economic sense depriving students of an adequate level of tertiary support to undertake tertiary studies and offering them a positive incentive to drop their tertiary studies and take up the dole. I think that while this positive financial incentive to go on the dole exists the Government's claims that it is really serious about reducing youth unemployment are shown to be absolutely hypocritical. There ought not to be such a positive financial incentive. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, the policy does not make economic sense. Of course, when we look at the effects of the policy on the skills and resources available within our economy it makes no sense at all in terms of long term manpower planning and economic planning. As I have had cause to point out several times recently in this place, we have a very low level of tertiary skills in the community. We have one of the lowest levels of people engaged in post-secondary education or vocational training of any member country of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. That fact alone goes a long way towards explaining the current economic problems that we are experiencing. Similarly, we have one of the lowest levels of student participation of any OECD country. We have one of the lowest ratios of people in the 15 to 25-year age group engaged in education or post-secondary training. Of course, this ratio is significantly lower than the ratio in such countries as Austria, Germany, Japan, Switzerland and Sweden. Again, it explains in a structural way why we have such high levels of youth unemployment. </PARA>
<PARA> We have such high levels of youth unemployment simply because the Government is intent on preventing young people from undertaking post-secondary studies. It does this in a variety of ways, but it does it most particularly and most effectively by denying an appropriate level of student assistance. When it makes more economic sense for a young person to go on the dole than to undertake tertiary studies, it can be seen that the Government is actually creating youth unemployment in this country. Then, of course, it has the hypocrisy to condemn the young unemployed for their idleness, slothfulness and so on. </PARA>
<PARA> There are other very disturbing features of the current Tertiary Education Allowance Scheme. One is that the TEAS allowance has declined markedly in value since the inception of the scheme in 1974. I will not take the time of the Senate now to document that claim but it will be very clear to honourable senators who compare the maximum TEAS rates with the consumer price index adjustments since 1974 that the current maximum TEAS allowance is $8 below real 1974 levels. Again, that is a demonstration that it is the effect of the Government's policy and the intention of the Government's policy to force young people out of our tertiary institutions and on to the dole. Another problem is the means test cut-off point. In keeping with the basic intention of the scheme, TEAS allowances are means tested on the basis of either the parents' income or, in cases where a student is classified as independent, the student's income. However, the allowance payable subject to the means test has declined under the Fraser Government to such an extent that many genuinely needy students are no longer eligible for the TEAS allowance. If we look at the changes over the past few years relating to the means test of parents' income, we find that the gap between the means test cut-off point and the average male wage is rapidly widening with the result that the number of students eligible under TEAS is systematically decreasing. For example, between July 1974 and July 1975, 53 per cent of TEAS recipients received a maximum allowance compared with only 34.9 per cent in 1978. The figures relating to the means test on a student's income demonstrate that since the scheme's inception an independent student has been able to earn up to $1,500 and still receive the maximum allowance. However, this amount has not been raised since 1974 despite inflation. Furthermore, income earned during the long vacation used to be disregarded but is now included in this $1,500 maximum. The independent rate means test is particularly onerous for mature age students with dependants. </PARA>
<PARA> There are many anomalies in the operation of the scheme. Recent surveys have indicated this and have shown that there are many injustices in the scheme as it now operates. Such anomalies are extremely significant insofar as they prevent the scheme from achieving its fundamental goal which is to provide living allowances to all full time tertiary students in financial need. As a result, many students are prevented from undertaking tertiary study while others are studying under conditions of grave financial hardship. On the other hand, there are some students-a very small number-who receive the TEAS allowance and who do not in fact need it. The sorts of areas in which there are very serious anomalies in the current operation of the scheme are the independent status conditions, the regulations relating to the means test and the regulations governing the progress rules of the scheme. All of these, I suggest, require investigation. What needs to be done with regard to the chaos that the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme is in now is an overall reassessment of the scheme. Specifically what needs to be done is the raising of the level of the allowance, the indexation of the allowance, a liberalisation of the means test and, of course, the carrying out of an immediate inquiry into the anomalies and injustices of the scheme. There also needs to be an investigation of the ways of reducing the administrative problems associated with the scheme and an examination of the extent to which the Student Assistance Review Tribunals' discretionary powers should be increased. </PARA>
<PARA> These are all specific comments but I would like to make this general comment. The report which has just been tabled needs to be read and studied in the light of the decisions of the Lynch Committee with regard to the Government's intentions to tighten even further the eligibility for the TEAS allowance and to introduce a student loan scheme. I would like to place on record yet again the opposition of the Australian Labor Party to a loan scheme. First of all, it will create a great deal of bureaucracy and administrative red tape in its operation. But more particularly, the students who need the loan scheme are the ones least able to take on the burden of a loan at this particular time of their studies. Such students fall into two categories. They are either students from poor families or families with modest incomes who cannot support them, pay their fees and provide all the back-up expenses for full time student living or they are mature age students-in particular, mature age women who are taking up the option of tertiary education at a later stage in life, who have family responsibilities and who simply cannot add to their existing family responsibilities the burden of a loan. The only people who could confidently take up a loan with no worries at all about how to pay it back are the students from wealthy families who do not need it. </PARA>
<PARA> The Opposition is entirely opposed to the introduction of a loan scheme. We are entirely opposed to the further restrictions of eligibility for TEAS and we are opposed to the whole situation which is now being created in our tertiary institutions of the destabilisation of the research programs of all of these universities, of the destabilisation of the teaching program, because many courses will have to be dropped. At Deakin University, for example, the whole faculty of engineering is to be dismantled, and we can repeat that example if we look around tertiary institutions in this country. The availability of education and training to young people entering tertiary institutions will be drastically reduced as a result of the various recommendations of the Lynch review. It is a time when Australia needs all the expertise it can get in terms of technological advance, economic restructuring, the restructuring of adequate social and welfare policies for the 1980s and so forth. I have made these points recently and I do not intend to labour them now. At the very time when Australia's need for expertise is so great, the idiocy of imposing new and greater obstacles to young people and people of mature age undertaking tertiary studies ought to be exposed and condemned. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the Opposition notes the tabling of the 1980 report on the operation of the Student Assistance Act. I repeat that we find that Act and its operation totally inadequate and we call on the Government to take immediate steps to follow the recommendations for increasing and improving the student assistance scheme which I have enumerated. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to speak about the eligibility criteria under the Tertiary Education Allowances Scheme being tightened. The report of the Review of Commonwealth Functions states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Eligibility for living away from home allowance for those 21 to 25 to be restricted to those who live away from home by reason of geography or home conditions. </PARA>
<PARA>That is, if a person is between 21 and 25 years of age and simply wants to live away from home, that person no longer qualifies for a living away from home allowance. The Australian Democrats join with the Australian Labor Party in condemning that retrograde step. We note that the report states also:</PARA>
<PARA> De facto relationships no longer to be an acceptable qualification for independent status. </PARA>
<PARA>Again we wonder about the wisdom of the Government intruding into the morality of the behaviour of human beings and therefore denying students an allowance because they do not conform to the moral standards laid down by a government or by a bureacurat. The report further states:</PARA>
<PARA> Periods of registration for employment, with or without receipt of Unemployment Benefits, to be taken into account in determining the 2 year qualifying period for independent status. </PARA>
<PARA>We would oppose that also, and we will do so at the appropriate time. We believe the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme is a very worthwhile scheme which should be extended, not tightened. Our policy is to set the TEAS allowance at 120 per cent of the poverty line and also to index it to increases in the consumer price index. I would simply ask anybody who might say that that is an extravagant policy whether it is the wish of anybody who wants to maintain TEAS at or below the poverty line to insist that students not only live but also study below the poverty level. We consider that to be an unthinkable position, and that is why we have determined that as our policy. </PARA>
<PARA> We vehemently oppose the so-called razor gang changes to the eligibility requirements for the scheme which seem on the surface to be very difficult to police in any case. As the position unfolds, it would seem that a great number of the so-called razor gang's proposals were brought down because of their superficial attraction to a middle class group or to a certain group of people in the community without proper consultation with departments or with interested groups in the community. In many cases the incredible situation will ensue where the recommendations of the razor gang when implemented will cost more than if the status quo had been maintained. For example, I am absolutely sure-my conversation with student, teacher and parent bodies confirms this-that the imposition of fees at tertiary level for post-graduate studies and second degrees will in fact add to the cost of the taxpayer and not reduce it. </PARA>
<PARA> One wonders whether, if this fact is brought home to the Government, it will show some sense and at least drop that particular recommendation. We oppose the introduction of fees for post-graduate courses. The Government may say to the Australian Democrats: 'Here is the professional student. Here is the person who has opted from the age of about 18 when he or she first entered university to stay at university at the taxpayers' expense until he is 45, 50 or 55 years'. I would agree in a flash that there is no reason that the taxpayer should fund in perpetuity the professional and permanent student. I believe that in total these people represent a very small proportion of the student population and the cost of weeding them out will be astronomical and will cost more than it will save. </PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Democrats believe-my colleague Senator Mason has stated time and again in the Senate-that more, not less, research needs to be done in Australia. Yet the Government seems determined to drive promising research students out of the country. Only 7 months ago the Minister for Education (Mr Fife) promised unequivocally that no proposals for the reintroduction of tertiary fees were being considered. This promise partially, at least, now has been broken. To those people who assume that this paves the way for the reintroduction of fees for first degree students this causes concern. I hope that I am not misleading student bodies and people interested in education who have interviewed me on this question. I have said to them that the Government would not be stupid enough to break that additional promise and to reintroduce fees for all university courses. I genuinely believe that a government would not be that stupid. </PARA>
<PARA> The abolition of fees by the Whitlam Government, while noble in purpose, did not achieve the intended goal. Honourable senators will remember the noble vision of the Whitlam Government which said that if we abolish fees for tertiary education we move the eligibility of young people who can attend tertiary education down to the lower socio-economic groups. That is a very noble purpose. I am not persuaded that that occurred. I conclude unhappily that today essentially the same type of people, from the same socio-economic backgrounds as those who attended tertiary education in the 1970s, are attending tertiary education. Notwithstanding that fact, I believe that the reintroduction of university fees will be a disaster, a massive setback to a great number of people, particularly mature age students. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Australian Democrats ask: Why are so many colleges of advanced education being forced to merge with such haste? I have said for the last 3 years-it is Democrat policy-that there must be some rationalisation in the number of tertiary institutions in the country. But why should 30 tertiary institutions be asked to merge-including such unlikely combinations as those at Frankston and Caulfield-in a matter of seven or eight months? We favour rationalisation of the tertiary education system but certainly not along the lines recommended by such an inexpert and opportunistic group as the razor gang. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Senate take note of the paper. </PARA>
<PARA>I have a number of comments to make about the report. Whilst it contains a considerable amount of important data and statistics which relate to the problems of road construction in different areas of constitutional responsibility in Australia, nevertheless when one examines the report in more detail one can only come to the conclusion that it has become not just a report on our roads system but, in fact, an ideological document. So many of the conclusions reached and statements made in the report seek to justify the Fraser Government's whole philosophical concept of returning matters of responsibility to State and local governments and allowing them to determine completely the rate of growth and development of our road system. The Fraser Government seeks to maintain its interest only in a national road system. It is rather alarming to consider the implications of that. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth seeks to change the established practice and procedures upon which Commonwealth funding and responsibilities have existed in the past. One can only draw the conclusion that the Commonwealth is abdicating its responsibilities and leadership in national planning. Parliament has not yet been able to debate properly the recent report of the Review of Commonwealth Functions or, as it is more commonly known, the razor gang report. This report of the Council seeks to justify the Governments philosophical position in these areas by seeking to change the whole process by which road funding has hitherto existed in this country. Whilst it correctly points out that financial responsibility for road construction and maintenance is vested legally with State and local governments and that the Commonwealth has no legal or specific constitutional responsibility to provide financial assistance for roads in the States, nevertheless the report draws attention to the fact that the States are unable properly to fund road construction in this country. Therefore, since 1922 the Commonwealth has accepted the responsibility of providing both tied and untied grants for our road system. </PARA>
<PARA> In more recent years the Government has been quite specific about the sorts of roads and classifications of roads, determined as a result of consultations with the States, which ought to have greater priority than in the early days when the Commonwealth accepted financial responsibility for some sectors of road construction works in Australia. The Commonwealth did this because it became very apparent in post-war years that the States used Commonwealth funds in a pork-barrelling and most unsatisfactory way, in a way which enabled State Ministers to aid their cronies in State cabinets and State jurisdictions to respond to pressures to build roads in areas which did not have the priority or the need that would give them preference over other areas. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course we all recognise the importance of a road system and we want to see the day when all our roads in Australia are properly constructed, tar sealed and able to perform a proper function in the whole transportation and communication system. But to reach that point surely we must have some system of priorities, some system which operates to the best advantage in terms of trade and population. To that extent obviously urban arterial roads would assume a greater degree of importance than some arterial roads that otherwise might be so classified by the States. Experience in that area prompted the Federal Government to be more specific about responsibility for the expenditure of Commonwealth funds. This report seeks to put back the clock. This report is a change for the worse. The report states that responsibility for the expenditure of Commonwealth funds for road purposes should be left entirely to the States. As the report correctly points out in another section, there is even disputation between the State governments and the local government authorities so far as the provision of funds by the States for local government needs is concerned. If we accept the fact that disputation exists at that level surely we can understand there is a need for a priority system. After all, Commonwealth policies largely determine population growth, for example, immigration policy and the policy on the development of new towns and decentralisation. These are matters in which the Commonwealth has a vested and a vocal interest. I think an error has been made in a philosophical and ideological sense in dealing with this aspect. The report in paragraph 348 states:</PARA>
<PARA> The cessation of tied Commonwealth road funding grants would make the States fully responsible for the development of the road system in Australia. It would enable each State to determine its own priorities for roads and to allocate resources accordingly. The Commonwealth's withdrawal from responsibility for national highways would remove any dispute between the Commonwealth and the States as to which roads should be included as national roads. </PARA>
<PARA>The report is taking on board the Government's own view, that is, that these matters should best be dealt with by giving the responsibility back to the States. To prove that point the report states:</PARA>
<PARA> Such a move would be consistent with the concept of functions being provided by the sphere of government as close as possible to the people. </PARA>
<PARA>Nobody would disagree that these sorts of functions should be provided at the State level. In relation to functions which involve large sums of money such as the thousands of millions of dollars that are involved in this five-year program surely the Commonwealth is entitled to say to the States that there is a need for a classification and system of priorities instead of just leaving the decisions to be made on the basis of narrow parochialism or concepts even though they rightfully may appear to belong to State jurisdictions because State concepts bear no relationship to national government concepts. </PARA>
<PARA> As has been pointed out, motorist organisations and other groups are concerned about this whole question of inadequate Commonwealth road grants for the improvement of the whole of the Australian transport system. In correspondence sent to me, and I presume to other honourable senators, by the Australian Automobile Association as recently as 22 May this year, attention was drawn to the fact that between 1955 and 1973 Commonwealth road grants to the States averaged 2.73 per cent of total Commonwealth outlays; in 1973 the grants averaged 2.59 per cent; they dropped to 1.78 per cent in the 1979-80 Budget and a further drop of 1.74 per cent is estimated in the Budget for the current financial year. As the Association pointed out, the Commonwealth's contribution to the national road program has declined from 32.2 per cent in 1974-75-during the Whitlam Government period-to 27.3 per cent in 1978-79. It has declined in real terms over that period and at a time when the Commonwealth has dramatically increased Commonwealth revenue as a result of the oil levy-in excess of $2,000m in the current Budget. Whilst the report represents Commonwealth, State and local government interests, it finishes up adopting this so-called concept of small government, that is, the Commonwealth abdicating responsibility in the matter of road construction nationally by handing responsibility over to the States. </PARA>
<PARA> It is no wonder that motorist organisations are saying that they are particularly concerned at the paucity of Commonwealth funding for roads especially in view of the very large sums of additional revenue arising from the Government's crude oil pricing policy being appropriated to Consolidated Revenue. The Commonwealth has reduced the level of funds for roads, as the Association points out. The projected increase in funds over the five-year period drops from 11.2 per cent in the Budget period 1980-81 to only 6 per cent in the Budget period proposed in the five-year program to 1984-85-a period in which we know that inflation and road costs will rise quite considerably. One is entitled to draw the conclusion that the report in no way properly appreciates the need for a planned development of our road systems. The Commonwealth still accepts its responsibilities in respect of a national roads system, but I ask honourable senators to look at the number of fatalities and accidents that occur on our roads. We know the cost in human resources and energy that is brought about by having an inadequate roads system. I fail to see how this report deals with these sorts of problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The report ignores completely the Commonwealth's responsibility for urban arterial roads. Therefore in that sense it is a very inadequate report even though so much of its general collection of information is very valuable. Whilst the report deals with the differences between the States as to the way in which their road funding systems operate the report came to, I believe, quite inadequate conclusions that the Advisory Council, which is the body that brought down the report, considers that the Commonwealth should be involved in road funding in one form or another. Is the Commonwealth to be interested only in a national roads system? Will it be concerned about our main and our urban arterial roads? Will not it be concerned about our substantial secondary road systems? The report did not come to any conclusion in respect of those questions. To that extent the Opposition would say the report is totally inadequate in terms of the problems of road construction in a period when road construction costs are increasing dramatically and in a period when inflation is not being taken into account in the allocation of funds. Whilst we of the Opposition recognise that the Commonwealth will be bringing down legislation to implement a number of the recommendations of this Council, probably during this session, we will have much more to say at that time about the matter. In the meantime, I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave- I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate take note of the papers. </PARA>
<PARA>In moving this motion I remind the Senate that the United Nations Conference on the Law of the Sea has undoubtedly been one of the most important international negotiating ventures ever undertaken, certainly in the history of the United Nations. Perhaps it has been one of the most important diplomatic excercises ever, in the sense of the importance of the issues involved, the number of state parties that have been involved in it, and the productiveness of the enterprise that has so far resulted, or at least had resulted up until the conclusion of the Ninth Session, which is documented in part of the papers before us today. As a result of more than 10 years of negotiations, the last seven of which have been largely occupied in a series of Conference sessions, we have seen the emergence of a treaty, supported by Australia, which would recognise that the resources of the sea, at least outside the 320-kilometre economic zone, were 'the common heritage of mankind'. </PARA>
<PARA> We had an agreement, in the penultimate draft text of the treaty, whereby an international authority would impose a royalty on companies mining the potentially rich nodules of nickle, cobalt, manganese and copper on the ocean floor, with the proceeds of the royalty, expected to run into many billions of dollars, then being distributed to developing countries. The treaty was to provide for, amongst other things, the establishment of rules of passage through and over waters of other nations and through straits used for international navigation. They are just some of the features of it. It is an enormously complex document in the draft form in which it has emerged. So far, so good. </PARA>
<PARA> It was indeed expected that in the tenth session of the Conference due to start in New York in March all those enormous labours by so many people over so long a period would in fact have borne fruit in a properly adopted final treaty. But that is, of course, where the United States stepped in under the new Reagan Administration. The ministerial statement which accompanies the report before us today describes in a straight-faced kind of a way-indeed it might even be said to be a po-faced kind of a way-what has undoubtedly been one of the most outrageous, and also underreported, bits of international misbehaviour ever perpetrated by any country. I refer to the behaviour of the United States after all these years of treaty negotiations in simply turning its back on the Conference, refusing to take any further part in it until it conducted a full review of its own domestic position, at the same time, incidentally, sacking the team of seven diplomats who had been working professionally on this treaty for a very long period. The reaction that was created by that United States' reaction can scarcely be underestimated in its intensity so far as the rest of the nations of the world are concerned. The whole atmosphere was rather colourfully described in an article in the Melbourne Herald by Bruce Wilson on 10 March 1981. He wrote:</PARA>
<PARA> After nine years of planning and seven years of interminable diplomatic manoeuvres, the International Law of the Sea Conference has been suddenly torpedoed by President Ronald Reagan. </PARA>
<PARA>Referring to the exercise over the years, he went on:</PARA>
<PARA> This had been basically the foreplay to a final act of consummation to have resumed today--</PARA>

<PARA> Now, the six-week-long final act-as solemn and cumbrous as the lovemaking of a great sea turtle-has been cruelly interrupted by Mr Reagan. </PARA>
<PARA>That puts it colourfully but it certainly does not put it inaccurately. The interruption of the developing consensus around the whole law of the sea issue was a very spectacular interruption indeed because this is not a treaty which it was ever anyone's intention to adopt other than by consensus. It was not simply a matter of a majority vote in the United Nations. It was from the outset to be a matter to be resolved from consensus and that laboriously patched together consensus has now, as I said, been cruelly interrupted by the behaviour of the United States. The motives for the United States behaviour are not very difficult to fathom. The reason is simply that the United States seems not prepared under its new administration-although it certainly was under previous administrations-to accede to the notion that the seabed resources are the common heritage of mankind. Rather, the view is taken, apparently, that they amount to the heritage of the United States, and that they are there to be exploited not in the interests of mankind but rather in the interests of those major deep sea mining multinationals, four of the five of whom which presently operate in a significant way world wide are in fact wholly or substantially American owned. The Reagan Administration has come under acute pressure from those United States mining interests to do more to protect their interests in the exploitation of the seabed resources. It is on that crude, parochial basis, taking no account of the larger interests of mankind, that this action has been taken. I note that the Australian reaction has been pointed when this act of spectacular international misbehaviour, as I have described it, was perpetrated. The Australian position was put by Mr Keith Brennan, the ambassador who has played such a central role in the development of the whole Law of the Sea Conference for so many years, in a masterly understatement when he said that the United States attitude was 'potentially unsettling'. </PARA>
<PARA> Indeed it is a very understated reaction that appears in the ministerial statement before us today. But at least the terms of that statement leave in no doubt, I believe, the Government's attitude to the United States behaviour. I indicate that the Government has the full support of the Opposition in the further steps that it may take to restore some sanity and some credibility to what presently is the United States response, which lacks both of those characteristics. I cannot spend any more time on this matter at this stage. A number of other points, however, could and perhaps should be made about this very important issue. I think many of them were very admirably made in an editorial in the Canberra Times of 14 May 1981. I conclude my remarks for the moment by seeking the leave of the Senate to incorporate in Hansard this editorial from the Canberra Times. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>LAW OF THE SEA</PARA>
<PARA> President Reagan's administration, having flexed its muscles to delay finalisation of the United Nations Law of the Sea Conference, is expected to face concerted attempts by the Third World and some developed nations to get it to adhere to the negotiated text. The stakes are high, as it is the final division of the finite resources of this globe. </PARA>
<PARA> The convention was laboriously negotiated between 150 nations over the past eight years and arrived at by consensus, an illustration of international co-operation and good faith. The 10th session of the conference, which was due to be the penultimate, has ended inconclusively in New York and will be resumed in Geneva in August; but the United States has stated that it will not regard it as the final session. The US decision has seriously disrupted the work of delegates and is a most unfortunate unilateral abrogation of the achievements of the negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA> The virtually completed draft of the convention sets out the rules to govern exploitation of the fishing and mineral riches of the sea and seabed and the rights of navigation and overflights. It provides also for a massive transfer of technology from the developed to the developing nations. This technology is concerned with deep-sea oil and gas exploitation and seabed mining. The provision in the convention for compulsory transfer of this technology to an international authority and its further transfer to competing countries is one of the sticking points for the US, which has most of the technology. </PARA>
<PARA> The US is unhappy also about the provision for limits on production of the minerals on the seabed-manganese, cobalt, copper and zinc. This provision went in as a result of pressure by land-based producers of these minerals, particularly Canada, which feared a glut on the world market. The US is in a vulnerable situation with most of these minerals, which are essential to its industry and arms. It imports 82 per cent of its cobalt needs from Zaire, and jet engines cannot be manufactured without cobalt. It imports 72 per cent of its manganese from nations such as Gabon and South Africa, and manganese is an essential ingredient of steel. It imports 77 per cent of its nickel, mostly from Canada, and Canada strongly supports the present text of the convention. </PARA>
<PARA>Developing nations</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> At present the world supply of all the minerals involved is adequate, so the profitability of seabed mining is problematical. Nevertheless, the resources are finite, and present exploitation of the seabed would give the US an alternative to politically vulnerable sourcues and would help its balance of payments. </PARA>
<PARA> In the background to the US action against the law of the sea convention is the pressure of the mining and manufacturing companies which stand to benefit most from free, unshared access to the seabed resources and lack of artificial ceilings on production. </PARA>
<PARA> It was in this context that Australia not so long ago suddenly switched from support for the Canadian position of production ceilings to protect land-based producers to the position favoured by the US. The Australian position was changed after direct representation by CRA and other mining interests. Australia is less happy though about the US delay to the convention, which the Federal Government still regards as an equitable approach to the sharing of resources and development of the Third World. </PARA>
<PARA> The developing nations are reluctant to see this transfer of technology and resources slip away from them and already the Singaporean president of the law of the sea assembly, Mr Koh, who has just assumed the office, has made these objections plain. He expressed what is probably the prevailing view outside the US administration, that the US had all along willingly taken part in the negotiations under different administrations and had not dissented to such concepts as the riches of the sea being the heritage of all men. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Koh justly pointed out that the convention, which reached its final form entirely by consent, without votes having to be taken, had achieved important targets, of great benefit to the big maritime nations such as the US. These included a system of control and regulation of the ''creeping jurisdiction'' which was formerly pushing out territorial limits and sea zones in a haphazard fashion and the guaranteed rights to overflight and to passage through straits. </PARA>
<PARA> Large fishing nations such as Japan, while perhaps initially very worried about possible damage to their distant fishing, have come to appreciate the benefits of access under licence and joint projects. </PARA>
<PARA> Commodity-dependent, technology-oriented nations such as those in Western Europe, particularly West Germany and Britain, look with particular concern at what has happened to the convention. They are very aware that the US has already put through unilateral legislation to allow seabed mining and it would not be surprising if they followed suit. What this would mean would be a greedy grab by those best equipped technically for the difficult task. While this would agree with President Reagan's philosophy of free market forces deciding economic issues, one certain result would be to push the weakest-the developing nations-even further to the wall. There would be high human and political costs in such a course and the US should exert its known good sense to get the administration of President Reagan back on course and steering for an early approval of the present draft of the convention. The rule of law, the cornerstone of American freedoms and of international life, demands no less. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I was pleased to hear that the Government had responded so favourably to our report. I think it is worth noting that in this case the work of a Senate committee has resulted in the Government deciding to implement recommendations which we believe will improve the Parliament's surveillance of government expenditure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Advance to the Minister for Finance is a centrally controlled contingency fund which is available for use by the Government for emergency purposes. Although the total amount for the Advance is appropriated, a government may spend amounts from the Advance where there has been no specific prior parliamentary appropriation. The principle of prior parliamentary appropriation of government expenditure is, of course, enshrined in section 83 of the Constitution and is of considerable concern to honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee found that the criteria given for the use of the Advance varied in several ways in ministerial statements, the Finance Directions and other relevant sources. We recommend that these confusing criteria be clarified by adopting one set of criteria only, that is, that the use of the Advance be permitted in 'urgent and unforeseen circumstances'. We believe the adoption of this set of criteria will on the one hand give the Government the flexibility to use the Advance for emergencies where necessary but on the other hand protect the principle of prior parliamentary appropriation. I therefore welcome the Government's acceptance of our recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also welcomes the inclusion, in the Schedules to Appropriation Bill (No. 1) and Appropriation Bill (No. 2) of 1980-81, of a clause which provides that the expenditure be urgent and unforseen, thereby putting these criteria on a legislative footing. </PARA>
<PARA> One of the Committee's major worries was the ability of a government to commence major new expenditure programs from the Advance and then present the Parliament with a fait accompli at appropriation time. We concluded that the best way to prevent this would be to improve the disclosure of expenditure from the Advance so that the Parliament could learn earlier and in greater detail where the money was being spent. </PARA>
<PARA> Disclosure has been improved in two ways. Firstly, the funds which have already been provided from the Advance will be shown more clearly in the appropriation Bills explanations. The procedure has already been implemented in relation to the 1980-81 Budget Estimates. Secondly, a statement of approvals of expenditure from the Advance will be published more regularly than in the past. This statement will show all expenditure which requires the creation of a new appropriation item and expenditure above $50,000 in other cases. The publication of this information at approximately monthly intervals during parliamentary sittings can only enhance the Parliament's scrutiny of the expenditure from the Advance. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, the Committee notes that the Government did not accept its recommendation for a limit to be placed on the amount appropriated for the Advance. Nevertheless the Committee will continue to keep a close watch on the total amount appropriated to the Advance and if it exceeds the levels suggested in our report as appropriate, the Committee will draw this to the attention of the Parliament and consider what further action may be necessary as a result. I thank the Senate for the opportunity to make the statement and thank the Minister for the Government's response and acceptance of almost all of our recommendations. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-As a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations I rise to say only that my ecstasy at the response of the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) to our report is modified by several considerations: Firstly, that the Government has specifically not accepted our recommendation for a 2.3 per cent limit on sums made available by way of the Advance; secondly, that the Government's reaction on the particular issue of the 'urgent and unforeseen' criterion, while ultimately it appears to come down as favourable to the Committee, is full of obscurities, ambiguities and qualifications as to the way in which that criterion is to be accepted; thirdly, that the Minister and the Government have not in fact accepted our recommendation that this statement of criteria be set out in the finance regulations made under the Audit Act. Instead, they have adopted the more circuitous route of incorporating it in the Schedule to Appropriation Bill (No. 1) and Appropriation Bill (No. 2), where I am not quite sure that it has the same educative impact, even it it does have the same legal impact, on the minds of Government officials concerned.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But all that said, the response does appear to accept the basic reasoning and the general thrust of the Committee's report. I note, of course, that if the basic reasoning and thrust of the report are accepted that should in the future make impossible, or at least politically quite untenable, the use of the Advance for such extraordinary purchases as that of the Boeing 707 aircraft which, honourable senators will recall, was one of the contexts that were very much present in the mind of the Committee when the report was developed and written. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-A number of recent reports of the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances have considered different aspects of the disallowance provisions in the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 and other Acts. This is a technical area of the law, but one of importance. The Government recognises the important role which the Committee plays in monitoring the more technical aspects of delegated legislation and acknowledges the important contribution made to the development of this area of the law by the Committee's recent reports. I am, therefore, pleased to be able to announce that the Government intends to take action to give effect to a number of the Committee's recommendations on matters relating to parliamentary disallowance of delegated legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In its 66th report the Committee recommended that the common law rule of revival should, by statute, be applied to the parliamentary disallowance of all instruments. The common law rule of revival is that the repeal of an Act, which has repealed an earlier Act, has the effect of reviving the earlier repealed Act. The common law rule has been reversed by the Acts Interpretation Act 1901. There is, however, some doubt as to the application of the Acts Interpretation Act provisions to parliamentary disallowance of a repealing regulation. </PARA>
<PARA> There is a clear distinction between statutory repeal of legislation and parliamentary disallowance. In the case of statutory repeal, appropriate transitional or consequential provisions may be made, whereas a House of the Parliament that disallows a regulation may do no more than nullify the provision tabled before it. In the absence of a revival rule, disallowance can create a legislative void. As the Committee has pointed out, absence of a revival rule also means that a House of the Parliament is effectively unable to prevent the repeal of an instrument which that House may not wish to have repealed. The Committee's recommendation has drawn attention to an uncertainty which should be removed. Accordingly, the Government has decided to introduce amendments to the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 to implement the Committee's recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA> In its 68th report, the Committee recommended that, for the effective parliamentary control of delegated legislation, certain provisions found in Part XII of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 should be incorporated in all disallowance provisions, unless there were good reasons for variation. The provisions to which the Committee addressed its attention are those which provide that-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) a regulation must be laid before each House of the Parliament within 15 sitting days of its making;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) a motion for disallowance must be dealt with within 15 sitting days or the regulation is deemed to be disallowed;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) where a motion for disallowance is unresolved at the end of a session, the regulation in question is deemed to be laid before the House concerned on the first day of the next session; and</PARA>
<PARA> (d) regulations the same in substance as disallowed regulations cannot be made within six months after disallowance without the approval of the disallowing House. </PARA>
<PARA>An increasing number of Acts of the Parliament now include provisions for the making of instruments of a legislative character which are subject to disallowance. There is also a growing diversity amongst such instruments. There are, for example, statements of the principles in accordance with which quotas are to be determined under the Dairy Industry Stabilization Act 1977, orders approving administrative procedures for the purpose of achieving the objects of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974 and zoning plans under the Great Barrier Reef Marine Part Act 1975. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government is committed to the principle that these instruments of delegated legislation should be subject to review by the Parliament. In accordance with that commitment, it has been willing to take steps to refine the review and disallowance procedures when this has proved necessary. With the increasing number and diversity of provisions relating to statutory instruments, there is a need to take stock of the position and assess whether a uniform approach is possible and practicable. I am pleased to be able to inform the Senate that the Government accepts the substance of the Committee's recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA> Future provisions for the disallowance of statutory instruments will, unless there are good reasons for variation, incorporate the substance of the four principles recommended by the Committee. The Government additionally proposes that, unless there are good reasons for variation, the two other requirements in Part XII of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 will also be incorporated in future disallowance provisions. These two requirements are that regulations be notified in the Gazette and that they do not have a retrospective operation which adversely affects the rights of a person other than the Commonwealth. The Government will also be making a careful study of existing disallowance provisions to bring those into line with the commitment I have made today. I hope that it will be possible to bring forward amendments to do this at the same time as the other amendments announced in this Statement. </PARA>
<PARA> Last year the Committee drew my attention to the suggestion it made in its 50th report concerning the status of a notice of motion for disallowance which remains on the Senate Notice Paper when the House of Representatives only is dissolved. Sub-section 48 (5A) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 provides that, where a notice of motion for the disallowance of regulations has not been disposed of at the end of a session of the Parliament, the regulations in question are deemed to be laid before the relevant House on the first sitting day of the next session. The sub-section operates in relation to the Senate only where the Parliament is prorogued or the Senate is dissolved and does not deal with the case where such a notice is pending before the Senate when the House of Representatives only is dissolved. There is accordingly some doubt as to the status of a notice in such a case. A similar problem exists in relation to disallowance provisions in other legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government has decided to introduce amendments of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901, and the disallowance provisions of other Acts, to provide that where a notice of motion for disallowance of a regulation is pending before the Senate when the House of Representatives is dissolved, the regulation in question shall be deemed to have been tabled in the Senate on the first sitting day of the Senate after the dissolution of the House of Representatives. The amendments, which are long overdue, will ensure that the powers of the Senate in respect of disallowance are properly protected. The necessary legislation to give effect to the Government's decisions that I have announced in this statement will be introduced as soon as the legislative timetable permits. </PARA>

I acknowledge, as he does, that the matters upon which the Government proposes to act are of a technical nature. Nonetheless, adoption of the suggestions made is an important contribution to the effective parliamentary scrutiny of the plethora of instruments made under parent Acts. It is pleasing to note the Government's recognition of the significance of the Committee's monitoring role in the development of the law relating to delegated legislation, and I welcome the Government's ready acceptance of the Committee's recommendations, made in reports dating as far back as 1974.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Briefly, the Attorney-General has given a commitment on behalf of the Government to introduce amendments to the Acts Interpretation Act to remove uncertainties concerning the powers of the Senate relating to the disallowance of statutory instruments following a dissolution of the House of Representatives; to ensure that repeal of an instrument does not leave a legislative void, perhaps against the wishes of the disallowing House; and to standardise, as far as practicable, disallowance provisions in both existing and forthcoming legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I have also noted with pleasure the Government's extension of one of the Committee's recommendations to include compulsory notification of regulations in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette and Government concern to ensure, as the Committee constantly has done, that any required retrospective application does not adversely affect the rights of a person other than the Commonwealth. </PARA>
<PARA> The Attorney-General's statement has not as yet been formally considered by the Committee.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I wish to express my approval of the statement by the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) to the Senate. I take this as a statement of the Government's confidence in and recognition of the powers of the Senate to disallow delegated legislation. In that spirit I seek to obtain some assurances from the Government that it will put its policy into practice when it comes to the implementation of some of the decisions made by the committee investigating Commonwealth functions. Today I was surprised and disappointed to learn that the Government intends to pursue the decision of the razor gang to deregulate trading hours in the Australian Capital Territory, not by an ordinance to amend the trading hours ordinance, as would be most appropriate if the Government were serious about the principles it has enunciated in the document before the chamber, but as part of the omnibus legislation that will come before the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I consider that that action would be inconsistent with the principles behind the statement made by the Attorney-General to the Senate today. I feel that the Attorney-General ought to indicate to the Senate now that in light of the statement now before the Senate, the Government will not take the action of implementing the razor gang's decision in respect of the trading hours ordinance by lumping it in with the omnibus legislation but will, in fact, honour its obligation to the Senate and defer to the Senate's power in relation to the disallowance of delegated legislation. I hope the Government will bring in-as I believe it intended to do previously-an amendment to the trading hours ordinance so the matter can be properly tested without being lumped in with the omnibus legislation, with all the difficulties that that presents. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-Earlier today there was incorporated in Hansard a statement about to be made by my colleague the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) in another place outlining the Government's response to the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs on Aboriginal health. I am aware that this response has taken longer than the time allowed for responses to parliamentary reports. I apologise to the Parliament for this. I remind the Senate, however, that this matter is complex and has required a great deal of consideration. Since I assumed this portfolio, I had to acquaint myself with the ramifications of the issues and to settle with my colleagues the many detailed matters which have needed discussion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Government's position is set out fully in that statement and I do not propose to go through it again. However, there are one or two points which I should like to bring to the notice of honourable senators. Although it is responding to the House of Representative's Standing Committee's report, the Government has also had before it two other important reports on Aboriginal health. The other reports are the trachoma report and an internal report on the program effectiveness review of Aboriginal health. All these reports show that Aboriginal health is unacceptably low. We must do more to bring about the improvements that are so urgently needed. My colleague' statement gives details of the measures we propose and I shall mention them only briefly. </PARA>
<PARA> Firstly, there is general agreement that the environment in which Aboriginal people live must be improved. My Department has funded programs over a number of years in housing and community management and services. We will continue with these programs. The Government's election commitment to a five-year program to improve environmental health will be vigorously pursued. Indeed, in the short time available, my Department has developed projects totalling $10m which will begin in 1981-82. These are urgently needed projects throughout Australia. The special environmental health program represents the Government's basic commitment to the provision of at least clean water and waste disposal facilities for Aboriginal communities still needing them. </PARA>
<PARA> We recognise that improvements in Aboriginal health flowing from environmental improvements will take some time. Therefore, we have also closely examined the effectiveness of present programs for Aboriginal health care. Our fundamental concern here has been to improve the acceptability of the present range of services in the eyes of Aboriginal people themselves. It is not much good saying that a health care service is available if Aboriginal people do not feel able to make use of it. Therefore we are seeking discussions with the States and the Northern Territory to redefine objectives for the provision of health care to Aboriginal people. We are seeking increased Aboriginal involvement in the design, control, management, delivery and evaluation of health services affecting them. </PARA>
<PARA> The reports before us all make it clear that Aboriginal medical services have been very acceptable to Aboriginal people themselves. Their role is increasing in importance and we shall be holding discussions with the States against this background. The Government, for its part, wishes to have the benefit of Aboriginal advice on matters relating to Aboriginal health. Therefore I shall be asking the National Aboriginal Conference to discuss with me ways in which, through it, the Government receives appropriate advice on Aboriginal health. </PARA>
<PARA> There has been some speculation over the last week or two that the Commonwealth is planning to hand over responsibility for Aboriginal health to the States. The statement which my colleague is about to make in another place shows just how far off the mark that speculation was. We recognise, unlike some ill-informed critics, that the responsibility for bringing about an improvement in Aboriginal health throughout Australia rests with both the Commonwealth and the State and Territory governments. We seek the co-operation of other arms of government in pursuing the objectives I have described briefly. But we are certainly not proposing a transfer of responsibility. Nor should the Senate draw any inferences from statements made recently by spokesmen for the Victorian Aboriginal Health Service. That Service has been trying to divert attention from its own failure to manage with the funds available to it. These spokesmen have made wild and inaccurate attacks on me and my Department. They have also predicted a hand over of responsibility for Aboriginal health to the States. They have been using the wrong crystal ball. </PARA>
<PARA> I should also mention briefly the announcement last week of Professor Hollows's resignation from the National Trachoma and Eye Health Program. He gave as his reason the supposed Commonwealth handover of responsibility for Aboriginal health. He too has been misinformed. I acknowledge the excellent work Professor Hollows and his team have done. I hope he will now reconsider his position. I commend the statement of the Minister for Health to the Senate. I particularly invite honourable senators to give consideration to the Government's detailed response to each of the specific recommendations of the House of Representatives Standing Committee's report. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I can understand the reluctance of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) to have any remarks made by the Opposition on the statement which has just been brought down. The statement-indeed, the combination of statements we are now considering-is a totally inadequate response to the crisis in Aboriginal health in this country. Aboriginal health is a national scandal. It is fast becoming an international scandal as international organisations-United Nations organisations, international church organisations and so forth-pay some attention to the crisis in Aboriginal health. I have seen in this country health problems the like of which were a great deal worse than what I saw in refugee camps in Kampuchea and Thailand. In no other country in the world is there such a combination of such diseases as leprosy, venereal disease, trachoma, skin diseases and blindness and deafness caused by infections. Of course, in no other affluent country in the world do these diseases exist in the way they exist in Australia. We have a crisis which, as I have said, is not only a national, but also an international, scandal. The response of the Government has been totally inadequate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Before I make some detailed comments on the statement that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has just brought down and the statement by his colleague in another place, the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar), to which he referred I must make some comments on what has happened in the last few days which I believe has focused the attention of Australians at least on the crisis in Aboriginal health. I refer to the resignation from the national trachoma program of Professor Fred Hollows and his executive director, Gordon Briscoe. They made it quite clear in their resignation statements that they were resigning because of the failure of the Federal Government to act effectively with regard to the dreadful problems of Aboriginal health. The comments of the Minister, Senator Peter Baume, on Professor Hollows' resignation were absolutely disgraceful. His initial comment, as reported in the media, was an offhand remark that there was not a Commonwealth program anyway so he did not know what Professor Hollows was resigning from. Subsequently on the program AM he modified his remarks but still persisted with the claim that there was no need for Professor Hollows and Mr Briscoe to have resigned because the statements the Ministers were to bring down today would answer all the criticisms and concerns of Professor Hollows and Gordon Briscoe and, indeed, all the Aboriginal people who had criticised the inadequacy of the Federal Government. Let me repeat the reservations that Professor Hollows stated in conversation with the Minister, Senator Peter Baume, on the radio program AM. He said of the Minister:</PARA>
<PARA> If he's saying that when we hear the statement today, that I'll be reassured that there's going to be a strong Federal presence in Aboriginal health and that various racist, inefficient organisations around the country are not going to take over Aboriginal health matters, if that is what he's saying then that's fine, but I don't know if that's what he's saying. </PARA>
<PARA>Clearly, it is not what the Minister has said. Professor Hollows said:</PARA>
<PARA>Well, my worries are that he hasn't reassured me that the Trachoma Program is going to be taken over by the States and that any role for a national body will only be for those parts that the States say that they cannot undertake themselves because no State has ever said that it can't do what needs to be done in Aborignal health, they've always said it, but they haven't done it. They've always accepted money to do it. </PARA>
<PARA>The reservations that Professor Hollows had this morning have not been overcome by what the Minister has said. Professor Hollows and Mr Briscoe have drawn attention to the fact that Aboriginal health services as administered by State and territorial bureaucracies have been totally ineffective. That ineffectiveness has been documented in a Government report, the Program Effectiveness Review report, to which we have had no official or formal access but to which, because of its circulation amongst various members of the media, we now have some access. It is no wonder that Senator Baume is not prepared to table that report and has not been prepared to give me, as shadow Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, a copy of it. That report documents very clearly the fact that the current administration of Aboriginal health services in this country, mainly via State and territorial agencies, has been totally inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA> This is probably not the time to go back into history to determine why this is so, why there has been a history of inappropriate services, inappropriately trained people, sometimes racist State administrations and sometimes simply incompetent administrations. All of those reasons, in composite, add up to the situation with which we are now faced, that is, total ineffectiveness. An amount of money-I do not say a large amount of money because in terms of total Federal expenditure it is not a large amount-is being spent on Aboriginal health via State and territorial programs and that money is simply not reaching the people who are meant to be the beneficiaries of it. </PARA>
<PARA> Like Senator Peter Baume I have been travelling around the remote areas of Australia and, indeed, some of our cities, investigating the circumstances in which Aboriginal people are living. It is very clear that the programs are failing. We simply would not have the crisis in Aboriginal health that we have now if the programs were effective. Let me remind honourable senators that the sorts of diseases from which Aboriginal people are suffering-I suppose trachoma is the best example-are preventable diseases. It is not outside the ability of current medical practice or wisdom to deal with them. Such diseases are virtually non-existent in the white population and in that part of the white population that is living in the remote areas along with the Aboriginal communities. It is not a question of diseases of a mysterious or complicated nature. They are diseases which are well able to be treated by conventional medical practice and which are not being treated effectively. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's response to the situation-the Minister's statement-is totally inadequate. The statement merely restates the problems of Aboriginal health that have been defined in the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs on Aboriginal health, the report on the National Trachoma and Eye Health Program and the report on the Program Effectiveness Review. The only real initiative put forward in the detailed statement by the Minister for Health is the establishment of a uniform national data collection system to provide accurate Aboriginal health statistics. A plan for a national system of Aboriginal health statistics was put forward by Dr Smith in his report 'Aboriginal Health Statistics in Australia-A Survey and a Plan'. The Federal Opposition would be extremely pleased to see the routine collection of Aboriginal health statistics. That is about the only positive response that the Government has made to the four pertinent and incisive reports on Aboriginal health which it has had presented to it over the last two years. Of the 15 recommendations in the Ruddock report on Aboriginal health the Government has stated that five will not be implemented, that a further four will be considered or discussed with the States, and only six have been endorsed. Nothing which requires new expenditure commitments or which may be seen as conflicting with the States' health policies has been endorsed. </PARA>
<PARA> That seems to the Opposition to be the crux of the political problem. The Federal Government is not pretending that the problems do not exist, but because of its infatuation with the concept of new federalism, and because of the obsession, I think particularly of the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser), with handing back to the States the responsibilities for all sorts of basic services, the Federal Government will not endorse recommendations of health committees which conflict with current State practice. This ideology of federalism has to take priority over the needs of the community, and in particular, the needs of the most disadvantaged section of the community-Aboriginal people. The Government's response, statistics apart, states only what is being done, which has been proved inadequate. About the long term health of Aboriginal people, Mr MacKellar stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Once preventive measures begin to take effect, succeeding generations will not be saddled to the same extent with the wide spectrum of diseases . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This statement assumes that preventive measures are now being taken-something which I hasten to inform the Minister is not happening in many places. For example, in February I visited the Northern Territory and spoke to the Director of Health, Dr Charles Gurd. I was disturbed to find that nobody in the Northern Territory Health Department was specifically employed in preventive health programs. Similarly I recently visited most remote Aboriginal communities in the Kimberleys area. I was informed by medical people working in that area and, indeed, by Aboriginal health workers themselves that there is no preventive health program operating in the Kimberleys. For example, there are no properly trained Aboriginal health workers to take preventive health measures in remote Aboriginal communities. Certainly, there are Aboriginal people in these communities who are called Aboriginal health workers. They have received in some cases three weeks training and are supposed to go back into their communities and run an Aboriginal health program. So in Western Australia and the Northern Territory no adequate preventive health program is in progress. I very much doubt whether there is such a program in any other part of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> In Mr MacKellar's response it is stated that the government wishes to encourage the development of programs which serve the whole community rather than segregating services. I think this is a false argument and a rather weak way of attacking the Aboriginal controlled health services. My information is that most services will treat non-Aboriginal patients and that in many places they are more popular than institutionalised services. In Broome, on the north-west coast of Australia, a large number of white people go to the Aboriginal-run health service because the nature of the service-it is community controlled and so on-makes it more acceptable than the State bureaucracy with which the people would otherwise have to deal. It would seem that the Government could learn a lesson from this. I think the entire population is happier and more comfortable dealing with community-run health services, for primary health care at least, than with the State bureaucracies or private practitioners who are, of course, very insensitive on these matters. The MacKellar statement, in dealing with the professional qualifications of Aboriginal people, provides:</PARA>
<PARA> We propose to have discussions on a number of fronts to make sure that Aboriginals have greater opportunities in those areas. </PARA>
<PARA>Given the various education decisions that have been made in recent times the opportunities for Aboriginal people to get into formal and conventional medical training are disappearing rapidly. Australia does not have one trained Aboriginal doctor. Not one person of Aboriginal descent is a doctor. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am glad to hear that, but I hope that the Minister is not putting it forward as a panacea for the problem I have just enunciated. The Government states that it will hold discussions. Surely the existence of four major reports documenting health problems, the lack of trained workers and the inadequacies of various State services is enough. Surely it is time to spend some money and to develop some programs if we are to come to terms with this problem. The Government has had the Ruddock report for 18 months. Its only response to some of the major recommendations is that it will hold discussions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On the major issue identified by the Program Effectiveness Review-it stated that future funding arrangements should be focused away from State programs to Aboriginal medical services-the Government has refused to take the action recommended. This has happened despite the fact that the review clearly identifies State Aboriginal health programs as the major area where money is wasted. The results are poor. The review identified areas of policy difference which exist between the Commonwealth and the States and referred to State policies conflicting with the Commonwealth view that self-management can be pursued concurrently with the training of Aboriginal people in health care. </PARA>
<PARA> When we look at funding for Aboriginal health we understand why we have such a serious situation. Total funding in 1979-80 was $205m. The Aboriginal usage of health related programs amounted to $123m. Aboriginal usage of general health programs was $62m. That figure compares with $2,667m for the whole population. Aboriginal usage of general health programs is only 2.3 per cent of that total. Expenditure on specific Aboriginal health programs amounts to $20m. Of the $62m spent on general health programs most is transferred to State health authorities, hospitals and doctors through bulk billing arrangements. Special Aboriginal health programs operating through State authorities were allocated $13.4m in State grants in the last financial year. In the last financial year 17 Aboriginal medical services received financial support. During that year medical services extended access to an estimated 40 per cent-that is 72,500-of the Aboriginal population. This involved an estimated 120,000 patient contacts. Department of Aboriginal Affairs grants-in-aid to Aboriginal medical services in 1979-80 were $2.9m. Surely those figures demonstrate the cost effectiveness of the Aboriginal medical services. A mere $2.9m goes from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs to the Aboriginal health services which have a very high patient usage and, by all reports, a very effective delivery of service. We must compare this with the millions of dollars which go to State agencies which are failing. </PARA>
<PARA> Surely the message to the Federal Government ought to be clear. Another extraordinary and anomalous situation concerns the employment of Aboriginal personnel in Aboriginal health services. Of the 659 staff employed in State grants programs there were 26 non-Aboriginal doctors, three non-Aboriginal dentists, 241 non-Aboriginal nurses and five Aboriginal nurses. Some 40 per cent of staff are Aboriginal. Of these, 90 per cent were employed as health workers and operational and field support staff of various kinds, that is, non-professional services. If the Government is serious about creating employment opportunities for Aboriginal people it is clear that health funding should be directed to Aboriginal medical services. If the Government is serious about taking effective steps to deal with the crisis in Aboriginal health, surely it should act on the one basic and clear structural recommendation of the Program Effectiveness Review which was that where State agencies are failing, as they clearly are, federal money should be withdrawn from them and redirected to the one kind of health program which we know is working, and that is the directly federal funded Aboriginal controlled health services. That really is my concluding point. </PARA>
<PARA> I was very concerned and distressed to note that in the statement which has just been tabled the Minister took the opportunity, I believe, to be unfairly critical of the Fitzroy Aboriginal Health Service. I am very well aware that there have been problems in the administration of that service. Of course there will be problems in a service which is attempting a virtually impossible task with few resources. I feel that it is not in the interests of developing effective Aboriginal health services for the Minister to criticise in such terms a service which is doing what all of the reports say ought to be done, and that is attempting to develop Aboriginal participation and control in effective Aboriginal health services. I think the Minister has revealed himself and his Government in their true light and has shown hostility to Aboriginal-controlled health services by his absolutely inflammatory comments on the Fitzroy Aboriginal Health Service. I condemn the Minister for doing so. I repeat that the statement is weak and inadequate. It contains no specific details and does not address the basic problem. Until such time as the Federal Government is prepared to act according to its constitutional responsibility and to take direct steps to improve Aboriginal health in this country, surely the problem will continue to be a national and international scandal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I rise to support my colleague Senator Ryan in her comments on the statement by the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar). As she said, the statement is very short on detail. I say, as my colleague did not, that it is very long on rhetoric. This statement has been awaited avidly by members of parliament and the Press in the last couple of weeks because of the resignations, as Senator Baume, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, pointed out, of Professor Hollows and Mr Gordon Briscoe from the National Trachoma and Eye Health Program. This development created a stir because Professor Hollows said that he was concerned that the Federal Government was handing over to what he described as racist States, the very people who nearly succeeded in the genocide of Aboriginals throughout Australia, too much of the health programs concerned with improving the lot of these people throughout our nation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Professor Hollows was described by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs as acting in a crazy way. He questioned whether Professor Hollows was fair dealing or stunting and described his actions as irresponsible and political. Apart from the irony-I do not quite know what it is-of a professional politican referring in a perjurative sense to someone acting in a political way, I think Professor Hollows has been badly treated by Senator Baume in his remarks. Professor Hollows expressed the concerns of many people in this community. Nothing in the Minister's statement in this place or in the statement by the Minister for Health in another place leads us to believe that Professor Hollows has done anything but the responsible thing in this matter. Professor Hollows described several problems in his Press statement and Press conferences last week. He expressed concern about the lack of support for Aboriginal controlled health services in the community and drew attention to the low level of Commonwealth funding of these services compared with other health services. Secondly, he expressed concern over the inadequacy of the support for and the hostility to such Aboriginal controlled and community controlled schemes by State governments, in particular the State governments of Western Australia and Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA> He drew attention to the inadequacy of existing State health departments in handling the affairs of Aboriginal health. Thirdly, he expressed concern about the attitudes of the States, again in particular the States of Western Australia and Queensland, to the National Trachoma and Eye Health Program in which he played such an important part. He pointed out that he had no intention of abandoning the Aborigines under these circumstances and that he would continue to work as best he could with the Aboriginal health services where they were effective and relevant to the Aboriginals' problems. Yet this honourable man who has taken such an interest in this matter in recent years has been described as taking part in the craziest action that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has ever seen. He is described by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs as taking part in a stunting exercise. </PARA>
<PARA> No one in this place needs to be reminded that the situation of Aboriginal health in this community is a disgrace. In particular the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs need not be reminded of this. After all, he is on the record in his statement today and in repeated speeches in this and other places as describing the situation of Aboriginal health in this community as being in a deplorable state. Indeed, he quite rightly takes some responsibility for the setting up of the National Trachoma and Eye Health Program. When this program was set up, and when the report on the program came down giving the appalling results of its survey of Aboriginal affairs in the community, Senator Baume, like everyone else in this place, expressed considerable concern at the appalling situation which exists not only as far as trachoma is concerned but also as far as syphillis, leprosy, nutritional disorders, middle ear disorders in children and nasal and respiratory disorders in children are concerned. No one needs to be reminded that in some areas in fact the incidence of trachoma reaches as much as 90 per cent to 100 per cent, and in the best areas 20 per cent to 30 per cent of the community is affected. </PARA>
<PARA> After the trachoma survey team carried out surveys on some 100,000 patients in the community, after it treated some tens of thousands of them with chemotherapy and some lesser number with surgery, the report came out. Everyone in this place was appalled. Every newspaper in this country was appalled. Senator Baume expressed his concern and has continued to express his concern since that time. But the reaction of what Professor Hollows describes as some racist governments was different from the reaction of honourable senators in this place. In Queensland we know that Mr Bjelke-Petersen and his colleagues severely criticised the National Trachoma and Eye Health Program and demanded the resignation of some members of the staff of that program, against the protest of Professor Hollows and others, and loudly proclaimed that Professor Hollows was telling us nothing new and that in fact the States had the program in hand. In Western Australia the program came under considerable attack and we had the first indication that Senator Baume may not agree with Professor Hollows and his colleagues when he said, as recorded in the Hansard of 2 December 1980:</PARA>
<PARA> I do not think anyone would want to argue with the observations of the College . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is, the Royal College of Ophthalmologists. He continued:</PARA>
<PARA> If I read its report correctly it was actually on my suggestion that it did this. The argument that emerges is whether its proposal for implementing a program of treatment is the one that should be followed, or whether alternative proposals within the systems of health care of the State governments could do the job equally well. </PARA>
<PARA>One can imagine Professor Hollows' and his colleagues' concern at that statement-a concern that was expressed by other people in this place. </PARA>
<PARA> The deplorable situation of Aboriginal health in this country, which is related not only to the organisms which cause the diseases, but also to the nutrition, to the adequacy of their health services, their education housing and everything else, is the direct responsibility of the neglect of the State governments of this country in the past. In 1967 everyone in this community believed that the passing of the referendum at that time meant that there would be a new deal for Aboriginals, particularly as far as health was concerned, because it was going to be the responsibility of the Commonwealth, it was going to be a national responsibility, and the Commonwealth was going to introduce programs which were special programs, because the position of Aboriginal health is a very special case. When a group in the community has seven times the incidence of blindness, when a group in the community has many times the incidence of respiratory and nutritional diseases as does the Aboriginal community, it needs a very special program to combat these things. It needs a program which is directed by people who are not involved in local parochial or racist views; it needs the sort of program which was suggested by Professor Hollows and his colleagues in the report of the National Trachoma and Eye Health Program which we examined in this place last year. </PARA>
<PARA> All through the statement of the Minister for Health, even when he is mouthing words of support about increasing Aboriginal involvement in health affairs in this country, he refers to the way in which we must induce the States to co-operate, the way in which we must encourage the States. I refer to page 9 of the statement which reads:</PARA>
<PARA> To achieve this goal-</PARA>
<PARA>That is, to provide greater opportunities for Aborigines to play a significant role in this area-</PARA>
<PARA>increasing numbers of Aboriginals will have to be trained for, and employed at, all levels . . . The way each State government meets this goal may be different. </PARA>
<PARA>Time and time again in this statement we go back to the situation about which Professor Hollows complained in the past, namely, that we are going to do this by encouraging the States to spend money and co-operate with the Federal Government. They have failed to do this in the past and at present they are hostile to this approach, with the exception of probably New South Wales and Victoria. There is no indication that they will change their attitude. There is no indication that we will have an effective trachoma treatment plan in Western Australia in view of the critical words of the Western Australian Minister for Health about Professor Hollows, about the Federal Government, about the Federal Department of Aboriginal Affairs and about his colleagues. We cannot expect them to do any better and they will not do any better because they are philosophically opposed to this sort of approach. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Walsh says-I will not repeat his words-they are racist in their attitude to their own citizens. What the Minister for Health is saying to us in this statement-this is what Professor Hollows is complaining about-is 'We recognise that we have a special responsibility for Aborigines but we cannot do anything because we are hamstrung by the States, because we must co-operate with the States, we must co-operate with the Queensland Government which is against the outstation movement, we must co-operate with the Western Australian Government which is against the national trachoma program and which considers its own trachoma program'-it is demonstrated by this statement to be an abysmal failure-'has been a successful program'. What he is saying is that we must have more of the same again. The 'same again' means a continuation of the deplorable state of health of the Aborigines in this community. The 'same again' means in fact a deterioration of the health of Aborigines; it means no correction of the causes of their ill health, which are pointed out in this and the other reports mentioned by Senator Ryan. Therefore, we are disappointed, and share the disappointment of Professor Hollows and Mr Briscoe, with the attitude of this Government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-There is little indication in the two statements, from the Minister for Health (Mr MacKellar) and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume), that the Commonwealth Government proposes to tackle the overall problem of Aboriginal health any better now than it has done in the past. Professor Hollows expressed fears of a shuffling off of responsibility to the States. That seems to me, on an initial reading of these statements, especially that of the Minister for Health, to be only too well founded. It is a fact that many people who work in this whole area are disillusioned. I have spoken with some of them. Those people feel that our disgraceful record in regard to our treatment of the whole Aboriginal problem-it is a problem of great proportions-will continue. That problem-particularly concerning health-is known internationally and has been for some time, to this country's discredit. From these statements it appears that that situation will continue into the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Of course Aboriginal health can be improved. It does not need the high sounding objective which the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs gave at the bottom of page 2 of his statement. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Therefore we are seeking discussions with the States and the Northern Territory to re-define objectives for the provision of health care to Aboriginal people. </PARA>
<PARA>Those objectives do not need to be redefined. Heaven knows, the problems are clear and stark enough. I suggest that the solutions are quite obvious-more money, more expertise and more effort. When one talks to those dedicated public servants-State government and Commonwealth officers who are working in this area-that is the story one gets. From time to time I have had occasion to raise a matter which, to my great distress, is not mentioned at all as far as I can see in any of the statements and that is the problem of continued leprosy in Australia among our Aboriginal people, particularly in West Australia. The Northern Territory and Queensland to their credit I think have made some efforts to deal with this problem, although in Queensland a great deal more money could be spent. I suggest it is ridiculous and absurd that in the 20th century a country which describes itself as a modern, enlightened, Western society should still have this mediaeval disease. I suggest that this is unnecessary when a little more effort and a little more money would eliminate the problem. That epitomises the problem. The top of page 3 of Senator Baume's statement reads:</PARA>
<PARA> We are seeking increased Aboriginal involvement in the design, control, management, delivery and evaluation of health services affecting them. </PARA>
<PARA>Of course he means affecting Aborigines. I really hope that that is the case. Last week Miss Val Bryant and Mr Jim Carroll from the Bennelong Haven movement in New South Wales came to see me. For honourable senators who do not know about this facility, these people have worked exceedingly successfully in the field of controlling alcoholism among Aborigines. The Sydney Morning Herald of 13 May states:</PARA>
<PARA> Val Bryant has produced statistics showing that 300 of those 1,200 treated are still sober-a spectacularly high success rate. </PARA>
<PARA> Now, because of lack of funds from the Federal Government, she plans to close one of three Sydney houses and half of the largest operation, in a farm setting at Kinchela, near Kempsey. </PARA>
<PARA> 'It breaks my heart to have to do this. But we have no alternative,' she said yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> 'We've been trying to get the Federal authorities to realise the value of our work, but they just won't give us enough money.'</PARA>
<PARA>The article states further:</PARA>
<PARA> The low level of funding from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs will nearly halve the number who can be treated. </PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Health Department is said to be very impressed by the group's work, and so is the Australian Foundation for Treatment of Drug and Alcoholism. </PARA>
<PARA> The results are outstanding, especially for a depressed group such as the Aborigines, who have to contend with lack of jobs, colour bar and prejudice, the foundation's executive director Pierre Stolz said yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA> 'Among derelict whites the recovery rate is less than 10 per cent and 25 per cent is very good in this difficult area.'</PARA>
<PARA>He was referring to Aboriginal alcoholism. That is quite an accolade. This is obviously a very efficient organisation. Last week when Miss Val Bryant came to see me she certainly left me in no doubt of that and also of her needs. The largest single operation of the country haven at Kinchela near Kempsey has had 50 people under treatment. It has done excellent work but it is virtually crippled through lack of funds for capital development. In simple terms it has been allowed to run down and nothing will be replaced there. So eventually it will be forced into the situation where it can no longer do the work it has done so well. The furniture is poor and transport facilities are rapidly wearing out. I commend to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs a session with Miss Val Bryant and Jim Carroll who I think will be known to him. Perhaps he will see that his Department and the Department of Administrative Services get their act together to the extent that they give this place the support that it deserves. Only then will the Australian Democrats give some credit to the Government for providing some practical backing for this commendable collection of cliches and aspirations which we see in these two statements. The proof of the pudding is in the eating and I suggest that so far we have not had that proof. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that the Bennelong Haven group, which has certainly convinced me, has established a principle of some importance in treating Aboriginal alcoholism, a very important problem in this country; that is, that community oriented programs may not be very effective. All the people who have been treated by this organisation have come from other areas. It has been essential for them to get away from their environment, away from their relatives, and away from the people who told them to keep on with the booze. They had to go to a separate place away from that community. I think that if the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Department of Health pretend to sensitivity and flexibility they should look at the work that has been done by Aboriginal people for their own people that has achieved results and be guided by that. So far there is no evidence that that has happened. </PARA>
<PARA> On the question of leprosy, I have placed in the Minister's hands a basic study paper which the Australian Democrats have got together. I do not want to raise the matter in a large way because I feel that the Minister should have time to consider the matter properly. However, some very interesting new approaches might be used in this whole area. I believe that it is proper for this country, for the sake of our national pride and prestige, to get rid of leprosy. After all, most other societies got rid of it at least a century ago. The means are there for treatment; it is only a matter for a little more application, a little more sincerity and a little more desire if the governments of this country really want to do something for the people whom they have dispossessed and who were treated so badly by this country earlier in their history. I believe that most Australians agree that we have a social debt in this area. If any government wants to pay that debt off I believe that most Australians will be glad enough to help in that process. I turn briefly to the ministerial statement of the Minister for Health. Page 1 states:</PARA>
<PARA> Whilst there has been some improvement in the health status of Aboriginals, health services alone cannot provide the solution for all the problems. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister for Health has really said something there. I would have thought that a total Aboriginal policy-including education and housing; it is noted on page 4 of the Minister's statement that housing is important-has yet to be devised in Australia. It has not happened yet. After all the centuries and decades of problems this has still not happened. I cannot see this being done properly in a piecemeal fashion by State governments. Let us acknowledge that it must be a substantially national responsibility and let us get away from this idea, which goes right through the statement like punctuation marks, of a sidling away from the national responsibility, that the States will be encouraged to do things and somehow or other this encouragement will achieve results. I do not believe that that would happen. On page 2 of the statement of the Minister for Health he said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Commonwealth support for Aboriginal health programs will be made conditional upon a set of specific goals and objectives, which include Commonwealth Aboriginal Affairs policy, being drawn up for each program, against which its attainment can be measured. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a fair enough principle and a respectable enough point of view so long as it is not made an excuse for doing less or to decline to help innovative or perhaps even controversial programs which will be of value. I am thinking of the high vitamin C dosages given by Dr Archie Kalokerinos, which have undoubtedly improved Aboriginal child health. Yet the medical profession would say that this cannot happen. I suggest to honourable senators that this is something we have to support. If it works and if it achieves results let us go along with it for a while and see where we get. On the same page the Minister mentions how he has the support of the Royal Australasian College of Physicians and he says the Australian Medical Association has expressed its concern and offered assistance. Good luck to those organisations. I am glad they are doing that. I suggest this is not a matter for organisations but rather we are going to get results in this field, as we have done in the past, through the idealistic enthusiasm of individuals. I think we should see that to be of great value and that process should be encouraged. On page 4 the Minister outlined the problems. I do think it is worth reading, if the Senate will forgive me for taking the time. The statement reads:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the disruption of Aboriginals' traditional lifestyle has given rise to a number of widespread health problems, especially where Aboriginals have been obliged to live on reserves or settlements, or in camps, or in rural or urban areas, under conditions of poverty. The problems include poor water supplies, dangerous sanitary conditions, overcrowding, and limited access to nutritious food. </PARA>
<PARA>That is a fine euphemism I must say, 'limited access to nutritious food'! There is another way I can put that. The Minister went on:</PARA>
<PARA> The spread of illness and disease has been facilitated, especially respiratory, ear and skin infections, and intestinal parasite illnesses. The disruption of their society and lifestyles and its effects have also produced despair, chronic disadvantage and alcohol abuse. </PARA>
<PARA>If I were some kind of space traveller looking from outside in a thoroughly objective way at this planet and I saw that statement I would think that was the grossest indictment of a national society that one could possibly imagine. To list such a thing in a government document and then not to say that every reasonable measure should be taken urgently to ameliorate those conditions seems to me to be quite absurd. It is that degree of absurdity that I am trying to convey to honourable senators. We have a problem of dimensions so great that perhaps we have become blase about it, but to any reasonable outside observer it would display the utmost culpability on our part and demonstrate something which, I believe, we must cope with and soon. On page 5 of the statement the Minister talks about Aboriginal housing and his remarks take into account that statement I have just read. Any of us who have travelled around my own State, especially the country towns, will know that this is a dreadful problem. The Minister stated:</PARA>
<PARA> The last Budget provided in excess of $72m for Aboriginal housing and accommodation. </PARA>
<PARA>The statement is made almost as something which deserves praise. Far from it. It is much too meagre an amount to solve this problem. One only has to look around Australia to see that that is the position. It does not solve anything. I believe if we have any conscience and any desire to help this country in the future we will ensure that that position changes. We can well afford that in this country. Of course we can well afford it. I trust too that the Aboriginal people themselves will be consulted in the type of accommodation they want because those people I have discussed this with have got ideas about it. They do not want a Western style Blacktown house. They would like probably a hamlet type of village area, even with shared communal facilities, but something which is much more tied to their own way of life and their own, I suggest, wholly laudable extended family traditions from which, I believe, the European people in this country might benefit. I trust when we go on to the question of Aboriginal housing those things might be considered a little more than they have been in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> On page 6 of the statement there is another extraordinary statement which reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Finding, storing and distributing clean water supplies, and installing waste disposal systems are costly exercises. We must get our priorities correct, and make sure that Aboriginal communities' priorities are fully known. </PARA>
<PARA>I find that a quite staggering statement. After all, we are not talking about Africa in the seventeenth century. We are talking about Australia in the twentieth century. Yet a Minister is actually able to make those kinds of statements which suggest that there might even be some question of priorities over whether clean water supplies and reasonable waste disposal systems should be provided to Australian citizens. But no, that is not it. It is put forward as some sort of option which has to be considered against other priorities. The Australian Democrats are very pleased to see on page 7 the comments which indicate that the Government appears to see value in outstation communities. I have visited one or two of these recently. I can assure honourable senators that these are the places where Aboriginal people really feel they are finding their feet again. They feel their dignity and self-respect and their way of life can succeed. I believe amongst some of these communities there is a great incentive to succeed. They want to be successful. It is of value to our country that they should have the chance to be successful. We do not want to have them turn into little Anglo-Saxons. Let us see that what they have is of value. Believe me, they have the things of value and I think it is in the outstations that we are going to see them. </PARA>
<PARA> On page 9 of the statement we get some of this tricky stuff about the States. The statement reads:</PARA>
<PARA> There is a need for the States and the Northern Territory to provide greater opportunities for Aboriginals to play significant and expanded roles. To achieve this goal, increasing numbers of Aboriginals will have to be trained for, and employed at, all levels. Aboriginals must also take a real and decisive part in policy and program decision-making. The way each State Government meets this goal may be different. We are firmly committed, however, to ensuring that the goal is met, and we will be taking these questions up with State Ministers. </PARA>
<PARA>That worries me. Is this not what Professor Hollows is worried about? It is all very well for the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to say in this place that Professor Hollows is wrong when he says that the Government is virtually shuffling off the responsibilities to the States. I suggest that in this statement the Government is coming very close to doing that. All the indications are that this is where the initiative is going to be. On page 10 of the statement the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> It is vital that Aboriginal doctors, nurses, administrators, nurses' aides, and other health care staff should be available. </PARA>
<PARA>Great, I agree with that. The sooner the better. The Minister went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> We acknowledge that the necessary education and training will take time. </PARA>
<PARA>How much time-five, seven, 10, 15 or 20 years while people suffer and die from starvation; with children dying at an enormous rate in the meantime? I would have liked to have seen somewhere in this statement a concession that the Government in its wisdom might look at the Chinese example, and we might have some paramedical people like the barefoot doctors, a quickly trained people-perhaps Aboriginal people-who might go to work in these communities and cut back the amount of time in which these people are suffering, are ill and are dying. I think it should not be put at any lower level than that. On page 11 of the statement the Minister said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government will be prepared to consider provision of assistance to similarly innovative approaches elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA>The Minister was referring to Aboriginal medical services. That is great. I predict to the Government that it will be getting approaches quite soon from people who have quite interesting and innovative ideas. I and the Australian Democrats who know of some of these approaches will be watching closely to see whether the Government really means that or whether the statement was put in as a kind of pious hope. </PARA>
<PARA> We find on page 12 one of the greatest causes for unease. The Minister referred to a discussion on the officials' report which proposed that future funding arrangements should be focused away from State programs to Aboriginal medical services-in other words, a kind of central point of view. This is rational. Let us face it. It is much cheaper to run one overall service than it is to run six or seven. Therefore, why not do it? But, oh no! The statement says:</PARA>
<PARA> Conscious of the fact that many Aboriginals are dependent, to some extent, upon the States' general health care systems, we took the view that we should direct more effort into encouraging the States--</PARA>
<PARA>I stress the word 'encouraging'-</PARA>
<PARA>to involve Aboriginals in the planning and provision of all health services to their people. </PARA>
<PARA>On this question of encouraging, there has not been much success in encouraging the State to do things in the past. I suggest that this is again an indication of an opting out. On page 13 of the statement there is a definitive statement on the status of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs which I find most interesting. It reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The parliamentary report recommended that a new unit be established in the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. It was proposed that a group of experts on middle level technology should be set up to advise on, amongst other things, the most practical means of providing communal and household facilities in Aboriginal communities. </PARA>
<PARA>An excellent concept, if I might say so, enlightened even and something which a reasonable society would do. No, we are not going to do it. We are not going to do it although it has been suggested we might. We are told that the Department of Aboriginal Affairs is essentially a policy co-ordination and funding body. That is a categorical statement. Of course it is not true. What is really said is that the Government wants the Department of Aboriginal Affairs to be essentially a policy co-ordination and funding body, regardless of the fact that other people who are expert, enlightened, reasonable and decent have said that it should not. I think that is how we should read that. I will be most interested in the Minister's statements on that point. I shall quote again from the Health Minister's statement. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government considers, therefore, that it would not be appropriate or necessary for the proposed special group to be located within the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA>It does not say, of course, where that group would be. If it ever does exist, we understand that it would be in some kind of limbo. The Australian Democrats indict these statements. They are of no value. They identify problems-problems which for the most part are already well known-but they provide pitifully little in the way of practical initiatives to solve those problems. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted: debate adjourned. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I wish to make a personal explanation. It would not come as news to anybody in this chamber that there has been mention in the Press of recent days of a proposed trip that my colleague Mr David Jull and I were to make to the United States. This matter has been mentioned in both Houses today. It is on that matter that I want to make a few brief comments. We in this chamber are all aware that we are offered various sorts of trips at one time or another. There are trips to Inter-Parliamentary Union conferences, trips to Commonwealth Parliamentary Association conferences, what are commonly known as working parties, trips as a result of invitations of governments around the world and trips offered by airlines on inaugural flights, and so the list goes on. Most of us avail ourselves of those trips and make good use of them to be better informed on the various operations of Parliament and the various pieces of legislation so that we can make a far more informed comment on them and provide a more objective input. Unfortunately, in the minds of most Australians they are junkets. I guess any member of a political party who goes on those trips would know that there is really no joy in them and that they are darned hard work. On an Inter-Parliamentary Union trip I made last year I availed myself of the opportunity to go earlier and look at F16s, F18s, satellites, air transport, rail transport and that sort of thing. I made an offer to the Press. Indeed I circulated my timetable to the Press so that it could try to keep up with me if it so desired or so that representatives of its overseas bureaus could join me somewhere along the road so that they could be as well informed as I hoped to be. It is quite significant that that offer was never taken up by any section of the Press in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The trip I proposed to make to the United States came up when a consortium represented by the Myer group wrote to the Minister for Communications (Mr Sinclair) and suggested that members of the Government Communications Committee might go to a conference on cable television taking place next weekend in Los Angeles. The letter was passed on to the Chairman of the Committee, David Jull, and myself. We discussed it at length and in the first instance thought that, because of the pressure of work here, we did not really have the time and would not go. Indeed we probably said no to that trip two or three times until ultimately further discussions took place. I am the first to admit that there would be a lot to be gained from attending a conference such as that. Ultimately, I think on the last day of the last week Parliament was sitting, it was agreed that we should go. As I said before, there is no joy in these trips. There certainly would have been no joy in this trip. I have no desire to spend the required hours on international airliners just to go to conferences for enjoyment. </PARA>
<PARA> We had intended, at the conclusion of that conference, to cram as much as we could on communications into a little less than two weeks. We were to go to Canada where I have been before. Canada's Department of Communications has so much to offer the Australian situation in regard to the use of satellites, television for educational purposes, and telidon or videotext, or whatever one like to call it. So we were going there to avail ourselves of the latest in Canada's technologies and we were hoping to get to remote areas to be on the other end of the satellite. As I said, it means so much to our country and particularly to the people in western Queensland. That was what we were planning to do. There would not be much enjoyment, there would be a lot of hard work, but we would be better informed people. I say at this stage that no guarantees were sought from any member of the consortium. I do not know who the members were other than the Myer group. No guarantees were sought in any way, shape or form, and, what is more important, none were given. In the other place, Mr Hayden, when he spoke about this matter, mentioned the ethics involved. I have already mentioned the numbers and types of trips which are available to members and senators on both sides. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What I have not already mentioned but which most senators are aware of is that we are offered lots of other things such as a discussion over a meal and the use of transport when we go on trips. If we want to see something, representatives from a firm will pick us up and take us around. As one of my colleagues has mentioned by way of interjection, there is a Pandora's box, but I believe that we have checks and balances in this very institution. There is the safety for the people of Australia. This institution, this federal Parliament, is so geared that the people of Australia are protected. This matter of ethics is one that they need not ever fear. I think Mr Hayden did this parliamentary system a disservice when he suggested that a back bencher such as I could ever influence an ultimate government decision as to who should get a contract or something like that. What is worse, I think he did his own members a disservice because they are indeed watchdogs in this place. They serve very well on the standing committees and Estimates committees of the Senate. I am quite sure that if anybody such as I or any other member of the Parliament were to seek to use undue influence on the Government when a decision was taken the members of the Opposition here would be very quick to fasten on to it. Such are the processes in this institution. They are guarantees to the people of Australia that this institution operates at all times in their best interests.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Recognising that this trip was starting to be an embarrassment to the Government, my colleague Mr Jull and I had quite a few discussions. We decided for that reason, and for that reason only, that we should withdraw from this trip. I feel that it is unfortunate. Physically, I guess I am rather relieved because we have had a few heavy weeks recently. There is certainly no joy in spending all night on international aircraft and then going straight into conferences. Other than that, I am a little disappointed because there is a tremendous amount of value in trips such as that. There is a lot of knowledge to be gained which will be of eventual use to Australia. </PARA>

<PARA> That the Bill be now read a second time. </PARA>
<PARA> I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Wool Industry Act 1972. Honourable senators will recall that previous amendments which became law on 23 May 1980 provided for wool grower levies in the Market Support Fund to be progressively refunded to wool growers as the credit balance in the Fund reached agreed satisfactory levels. The Market Support Fund was established in September 1974 to provide funds to operate the Wool Reserve Price Scheme. Since that time wool growers contributed to the Fund through a 5 per cent levy on their gross sales value of shorn wool. </PARA>
<PARA> The 1980 amendments to the Act were introduced after the Government acceded to strong requests from the Wool Council of Australia to revolve the Fund. The views of all sectors of the industry were canvassed at the time and not all agreed with the Council's proposals. However, contributions to the Fund are made by wool growers and it is only right that the views of growers should be given primary consideration. Revolving the Fund means that repayments will be made to the wool growers who contributed the money on a first-in-first-out basis after the Fund has reached an agreed satisfactory level. The Act provides that the Minister for Primary Industry will, with the written agreement of the Wool Council of Australia, make a declaration specifying a period of contributions to be returned to wool growers. </PARA>
<PARA> The level of the Fund currently stands well above $400m. This is in excess of requirements to operate the Reserve Price Scheme and it is realistic at this stage to consider refunding levies collected during the first year of the Fund's operation. The continued collection of the 5 per cent levy will enable the Fund to be maintained at the desired level, for its primary role of market support. </PARA>
<PARA> Development of the administrative procedures has been a complex task and has however revealed a number of aspects of the Act which need to be modified to remove certain difficulties and anomalies before the refund scheme is implemented. While the overall administration of the refund scheme is to be in the hands of the Australian Wool Corporation, much of the detailed work will be performed by wool brokers and wool merchants who are registered with the Commissioner of Taxation as agents for the collection of wool tax. These firms are referred to in the Act as 'registered persons'. It is clearly undesirable for the Corporation, which does not hold the necessary wool transaction records, to be burdened with the task of making refunds to individual growers where this task could otherwise be undertaken more simply and less expensively by registered persons. </PARA>
<PARA> Wool growers who sold their wool to or through a registered person will normally receive their refunds through that same person; that is, the firm which collected the 5 per cent levy. The Act as it stands provides that where a registered person ceases to be registered the Corporation will pay the refunds direct to the wool growers clients. To cater for the situation where the firm concerned has since gone out of business, it was provided that refunds to clients of that firm were to be made by the Corporation. Some firms have ceased to be registered persons for the purposes of refunds because they are absorbed in take-overs or because they became registered under a different name. It now appears that many successor firms are capable of making these refunds, but are precluded from doing so by the provisions of section 42K (7) of the Act, which requires the Wool Corporation to make refunds in situations of this nature. Again, it is undesirable that the Corporation be burdened with the cost intensive task of making refunds to individual growers where this work could be performed automatically by firms which have 'inherited' these growers as clients. Accordingly, clause 7 of this Bill amends the Act to remedy this situation. </PARA>
<PARA> A further proposed amendment removes an anomaly created by wool growers entering into certain types of forward selling transactions. Under the Act, as it stands at present, a decision to refund 1974-75 Market Support Fund levy payments would mean that some growers who sold wool forward before shearing prior to 1974-75, and eventually paid the levy during 1974-75 after shearing, would not be eligible for a refund. Other growers, however, who sold forward in 1974-75 but did not pay the levy until the following year would be eligible for a refund in respect of 1974-75. This situation is inequitable and not consistent with the first-in-first-out principle for revolving the Fund. Clause 5 of the Bill corrects the anomaly by deeming the time of sale of wool to be that time when payment for the wool is made. </PARA>
<PARA> An amendment proposed by clause 4 of the Bill will enable the Corporation, and registered persons assisting the Corporation, to be reimbursed for administrative costs incurred before the formal declaration of a refund period. The Bill amends the Act to enable these costs, which could not otherwise be recouped until after the declaration had been made, to be charged to the Market Support Fund. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of other amendments of the principal Act are considered desirable and timely and it is opportune to introduce them now. I will refer to each of them briefly. The Bill provides in clause 10 that a statement given to a wool grower claiming a refund, should set out the findings of the Corporation regarding the facts of the claim, as well as the reasons for the Corporation's decision. The Bill also provides for an increase in the membership, and in the quorum for a meeting, of the Australian Wool Testing Authority. Since a significant proportion of the wool clip is tested in stores controlled by private treaty merchants it is appropriate that their organisation be represented on the AWTA. Additionally, the Wool Council of Australia is of the view that, as growers pay for the bulk of wool testing, the Council should be directly represented on the Authority. </PARA>
<PARA> Honourable senators will be aware that the Government has made a separate decision to sell the AWTA, but no time scale has yet been set. Nevertheless, it is still appropriate for the Government to provide for the Authority's continued administration. Accordingly, clause 14 of the Bill provides for representation by both the Wool Council and private treaty merchants. As a result of this amendment, all major industry organisations will be represented on the Australian Wool Testing Authority. They will thus have an input in consideration of the future sale of the Authority and a first hand association with the shaping of ongoing testing and certification of wool. Clause 16 of the Bill revises the provision regarding decoration of pecuniary interests by Corporation members. The revision is in harmony with the conclusions and recommendations of the Committee of Inquiry on Public Duty and Private Interest. All members of the Corporation are required to declare any pecuniary interests in matters being discussed or considered by a meeting of the Corporation, and for that declaration to be recorded in the minutes of the meeting. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </PARA>

<PARA> The speech read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA> The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill 1981 now before the Senate proposes amendments to the Customs Tariff Act 1966. The Bill, which contains 18 Schedules, is necessary to enact tariff changes which have been introduced into the House of Representatives at various times since May 1980, by Customs Tariff Proposals Nos. 8-20 (1980) and Proposals Nos. 1-5 (1981). </PARA>
<PARA> In the main, the amendments give effect to decisions by the Government in respect of the following reports by the Industries Assistance Commission and the Temporary Assistance Authority: Apples and Pears; Certain Goods Made From Carbon and Graphite; Certain Soft Sided Containers; Certain Works Trucks and Stackers; Cheese; Chemical Products (Part B); Continuation of Assistance for Insulators; Crushing or Grinding Machines; Electric Motors, Generators and Rotary Converters; Fluorescent and Filament Lamps; Gearboxes, Gears and Shaft Couplings; Iron and Steel Industry; Manufactured Tobacco, Metal Cans and Canisters of Iron or Steel; Musical Instruments and Parts and Accessories Therefor; Polymeric Plasticisers and Certain Polyester Polyols; Tanned and Finished Leather; Dressed Fur, and Textiles, Clothing and Footwear. On each occasion when the Tariff Proposals were introduced, a comprehensive account of the IAC's recommendations and Government decisions was outlined. </PARA>
<PARA> Other amendments contained in the Bill provide for: Amended tariff preference rates for certain goods from developing countries; changes arising from Australia's commitment to the South Pacific Regional Trade and Economic Co-operation Agreement-SPARTECA; and the addition of certain goods to Schedule A of the New Zealand-Australia Free Trade Agreement. The only amendments not already included in Proposals make provisions for the removal of all remaining preferential rates for goods from the United Kingdom and Ireland with effect from 1 July 1981 and for some changes of an administrative nature. A summary of amendments for each Schedule setting out the nature of the changes has been prepared and copies are available from the Records Office. I commend the Bill to the House. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill represents a retrospective validation of a quite familiar kind of some 20 customs tariff proposals which have been introduced over the last year. The tariff changes in question encompass such things as textiles, clothing and footwear, products of the chemical industry, carpets, metal products and rural products of various kinds. They range from items as prosaic as cheese and gearboxes to items as exotic as polymeric plasticisers and certain polyester polyols. The Bill also embodies a number of changes involving preferential rates of tariff, which are to apply to certain goods from developing countries, changes to the New Zealand-Australian Free Trade Agreement and changes involving closer trading relationships with several Pacific island countries under the South Pacific Regional Trade and Economic Co-operation Agreement, which is known as SPARTECA.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A number of issues are raised by the Bill and I propose to spend just a few moments on three of them. The first concerns the question of South Pacific trade, a rather under-debated matter in this Parliament but one that is assuming increasing importance. There is emerging in the South Pacific a growing concern that Australia is by no means as generous as it might be in trade and tariff arrangements, especially when its position is compared with that of the European Economic Community. That concern is built upon a number of different elements which might briefly be described as follows: Under the first Lome convention the EEC has been, at least in the case of Fiji, far and away that country's most lucrative sugar market. Again, Pacific countries generally receive far better access to EEC markets-duty free and unrestricted-than the forum regional trade agreement or SPARTECA provide for in respect of Australian and New Zealand markets. The Lome convention provides assistance for investment, trade promotion and natural disaster situations in a way that is not seen in any agreement in which Australia is involved. </PARA>
<PARA> The second Lome convention, which involves Pacific, African and Caribbean countries, provides for bilateral aid to island countries being given in the form of grants, not loans. Again, that is something in which Australia has been reluctant to participate, much to the disappointment of the Pacific countries concerned. Generally speaking, I am advised that Australia's attitude overall has been one, not of encouraging-despite some rhetoric to the contrary-genuine regional co-operation, but rather the perpetration of quite a number of divisive colonial distinctions which are certainly felt quite deeply by a number of countries in the area in question. </PARA>
<PARA> Thus the point is made by a number of these countries in the Pacific area that the EEC gives direct bilateral and regional aid, thereby encouraging a regional approach, whereas neither Australia, nor New Zealand for that matter, gives regional aid. Also, it is said and felt that Pacific countries are attempting to take the Lome-sponsored regionalism concept further with a Pacific islands development conference but that Australia has expressed only very lukewarm support for it, as compared with the much more vigorous support that seems to be expressed in many places these days for the larger concept of a Pacific Basin community. Again, it has been said that the Lome convention treats all Pacific countries as equals and does not discriminate in favour of former colonies as Australia, particularly by way of the South Pacific Forum, does; that Australia's and New Zealand's trade and aid policies, generally speaking, in a whole variety of ways-I will not stop to spell them out now-have perpetuated the division of Pacific island countries between those that historically have been within, and those that historically have been outside colonial control, whereas the Lome convention, by contrast has not done that. </PARA>
<PARA> A number of large and difficult questions are raised by these kinds of contentions which are part of the common currency of political and economic debate within the South Pacific area. I do not seek nor am I in a position to judge here tonight the merits of the particular points or claims that are there being made. I simply take the opportunity afforded by this debate, since the Bill does embody questions of preferential trade arrangements with the South Pacific, to make the point that these sorts of considerations ought to loom very much larger than apparently has previously been the case in our trade and tariff negotiations with these countries. </PARA>
<PARA> The second matter I want to raise arising out of this Bill is that the Bill reveals evidence-not that evidence has been lacking in the past-of a general incoherence in the Government's industry policy. This is a very large question and again I propose to deal with it in a matter of only a few moments. The Bill raises some tariff rates and decreases others, in each case without explanation or logic and, indeed, certainly not always in accorcance with the terms of the Industries Assistance Commission recommendations which are relevant to the industries in question. The honourable member for Adelaide, Mr Hurford, in speaking to this Bill in the other place, gave a number of examples with respect to recent experience so far as carpets are concerned and also to a whole course of erratic treatment in relation to the steel industry which is felt very deeply in that industrial context. Proposals of this tariff kind tend to emerge in splendid isolation in each case with no evident understanding of where and when Australia's industry should in fact be developed. Again, as Mr Hurford put it very nicely in the other place, the Government's approach here represents 'a shaky marriage between free-market fundamentalism on the one hand and political expediency on the other hand'. Mr Howe, the honourable member for Batman in the other place, in the course of what I think was an excellent speech, the substance of which I do not stop to repeat here, made the point that the basis of our protectionist policy can best be described as 'sophisticated political opportunism'. The point is-there is ample evidence for it; this just happens to be one very detailed Bill, and even passing scrutiny of which will necessarily draw one to this conclusion-that the Government in this whole industry policy area staggers from one ad hoc decision to another. </PARA>
<PARA> One particularly good recent example of this sort of attitude which runs in parallel with the particular subject matter of this Bill concerns the razor gang changes that have been made to investment and depreciation allowances whereby investment allowances have been reduced from 20 per cent to 18 per cent and depreciation allowances by a similar proportion. That reduction may or may not have been acceptable to the industries concerned. Certainly it was not very satisfactorily argued for, but then nor was anything else in the razor gang report. What was manifestly unacceptable to the industries concerned was the curious ad hoc, erratic way in which this change was introduced and they were obliged to live with it. Mr Eric Risstrom, the Secretary of the Taxpayers Association, put it rather effectively in a letter which all honourable senators will have received, when he said that with the depreciation change in particular scheduled to commence from 30 April rather than from the new financial year, this means that businesses will have to produce not just one but two depreciation schedules in respect of all their plant and equipment, one of them applying in respect of ten-twelfths of the year and the other in respect of two-twelfths. So much point can be made of this Government's obsession with efficiency and productivity and the minimisation of red tape and so on in industrial performance. </PARA>
<PARA> Symptomatic again of the whole of the Government's approach to industry policy generally, especially manufacturing industry, is this kind of state of mind, this unplanned ad hockery which is evident in this legislation before us tonight. The situation of manufacturing industry could, of course, be the subject of a very much lengthier contribution than that which I propose to make at the moment. I simply make the point that it is evident to every commentator in the country that, although the outlook for manufacturing industry is not quite as desperately alarming now as seemed likely to be the case only a short time ago, it is continuing to limp along in a persistently retarded growth pattern despite all the attentions and the apparent profitability that is being given these days to manufacturing by transnational corporations. </PARA>
<PARA> By contrast, and I think this is a point that must be made whenever Bills of this kind come before the Parliament, the Opposition, the Australian Labor Party, does have a coherent approach to industry policy, one which does offer an excellent prospect for generating the extra 1.5 million jobs that we need to create, that we must create, during the 1980s. It is a policy which follows quite naturally from our intellectual commitment, our principled commitment to co-operative economic planning, a commitment which, of course, puts us right in the mainstream of the countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, all of which, whether they have a primarily socialist or primarily non-socialist mode of political operation, without exception adopt a far more rigorous approach to the desirability of planning than seems to be within the contemplation of this Government. </PARA>
<PARA> The elements of our approach and how it is distinguished from that of the Government were set out in the course of a lengthy and substantial and excellent speech by the shadow Minister for Industry and Commerce, Mr Hurford, when he spoke to this Bill in the House of Representatives on 14 May. Again, I do no more than, in a sentence or two, summarise the gist of Labor's approach in this respect which can be put in the form of three propositions. First of all, we very strongly advocate and acknowledge the need for long term planning; the need, that is, to set objectives for industry and to try to create agreement about shared objectives between the public and the private sectors and, of course, between Federal and State governments, noting as we do-again this should be evident to any impartial observer-that our rejection of planning has been a manifest disaster creating particular strains and stresses in regional areas and that without an overall approach to planning we will never be able to solve these fundamental problems associated with the maintenance of a manifestly unsatisfactory protectionist approach. </PARA>
<PARA> The second element in our approach, and what distinguishes us from our political opponents, is our very strong belief in the need for a co-operative approach, particularly involving both sides of industry, labour as well as management and capital. The third element in our approach, which again distinguishes us very obviously from our opponents, is our very strong held view that market forces alone are inadequate to produce a rational industry policy situation in this country. There is a need for leadership by government for regulation where regulation is necessary and for government incentives where they are necessary in order to ensure effective small business development and everything else that goes with the development of a viable industry policy generally based on a strong manufacturing sector. Unless the Government can rid itself of the present free market nonsense which so obviously permeates everything it does, it will tend to blunder on in the present ad hoc backwards and forwards industry policy fashion which this Bill so obviously represents. </PARA>
<PARA> The final matter to which I wish to advert, and again it will be much more briefly than one could advert to it in these circumstances, is the matter of the procedures by which we in this Parliament deal with Customs tariff proposals and the legislation of the kind which we have tonight which follows on from it. The way it works at the moment is that there are introduced from time to time, following government decisions to alter tariff rates upwards or downwards in respect of imported goods, Customs proposals so labelled. They are tabled in the House of Representatives, usually accompanied by a short and not very informative explanation from the Minister and the debate on that statement is invariably adjourned and never brought back on for proper discussion by the Government. The only opportunity that ever arises to discuss the legitimacy of the particular protective arrangements involved comes some six months later, or even sometimes 12 months later, with a kind of catch-all tariff Bill of the kind before us tonight which retrospectively validates all those piecemeal Customs tariff proposals. That is at least the situation as far as the House of Representatives is concerned. </PARA>
<PARA> As far as the Senate is concerned, the situation is even worse because the Customs tariff proposals are not even tabled, for legal reasons which are clear but for policy reasons which remain to me utterly obscure. So there are not even the beginnings of a formal opportunity, other than by leave, for them to be debated at the time of their introduction when the change in question is relevant and is subject to legitimate public attention. I believe the Senate should consider very seriously-I do not propose to move it now as an amendment although it is a position that could have been taken-the merits of the kind of proposal that was advanced in the other place by the shadow Minister, Mr Hurford, as indeed he has advanced it on previous occasions, to the effect that this Parliament ought to establish a parliamentary standing committee on Customs and excise tariffs to examine each change in Customs and excise tariffs following the gazettal of proposals or their being introduced into the Parliament and before related Bills are subsequently introduced into the House. </PARA>
<PARA> The point being made is the obvious one that if parliamentary consideration of these things is to amount to anything, if it is to be relevant and if it is to contribute rationally to the process of policy formulation which is limping along on such a manifestly unsatisfactory and ad hoc basis at the moment, some institutional vehicle of this kind ought to be created within Parliament. We have roughly analogous mechanisms already in existence, notably in the form of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee which routinely scrutinises proposals for changes in delegated legislation. Of course, that does not have a policy examination function in the way that perhaps would be contemplated here, but it is an indication of the kind of machinery possible. The point simply is that unless we begin in one way or another to devise machinery that will allow a more rational and systematic consideration of these protective arrangements as they are devised and introduced we will never get a semblance of the kind of planned development and rational growth of our industry that is so obviously necessary. </PARA>
<PARA> They are the sorts of issues which are raised by this legislation. There are many others, but in deference to the obvious pressures of business I do no more than take the matter that far and I do not proceed to move the amendment to the motion for the second reading that was moved in the other place. I think I have given to the Senate ample indication of the substance of the proposal. We would certainly welcome a response to that proposal from the Minister for Finance (Senator Dame Margaret Guilfoyle) if she is minded to give one. But it is more a matter of putting it into the pot in the hope that one of these days it is an idea that will take root. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is the first of the razor gang Bills. The Opposition opposes it straight out, absolutely and unequivocally, not for the kind of reflex ideological reasons that no doubt motivated its creation but rather for quite systematic and rational reasons which I hope I will be able to articulate to the Senate. The Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission Act, the legislation which is being emasculated by this Bill, has been on the statute book only since 1977. It must be acknowledged at the outset that when it was introduced by the present Government it was not exactly to universal acclaim, least of all from the Opposition. In the first place, the Opposition was concerned-as indeed it still is-about the dismantling of the Australian Legal Aid Office, a creation of the Whitlam Government and in particular of a former Attorney-General, Lionel Murphy, which was part and parcel of the concept of the creation of the new national commission, although we acknowledged that there were obvious constitutional and jurisdictional difficulties involved, given Australia's constitutional structure, in the continuation of the divided system of delivery of Federal and State legal aid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second consideration was that the Opposition was concerned in 1977 at the rejection of the proposal-a proposal which is still Australian Labor Party policy-to establish a joint Federal-State commission which, among other things, would allow the Commonwealth to play a continuing direct role in the provision of legal aid within the States. We were concerned further at the lack of any power retained under the proposed new set-up by the Commonwealth, despite the proposed extent of Commonwealth funding, to play anything other than an advisory role in determining how the new State commissions were to allocate their resources. Further again, we were concerned that the Commonwealth Commission might not have the muscle in the form in which it was created to exercise an effective independent role and that it might be reduced to peripheral advisory functions with all the actual funding and such decisions being made by the Commonwealth Government for reasons of its own which might not necessarily be very good reasons in terms of proper legal aid policy. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, we were concerned about a number of aspects of the composition of the Commission that was established in 1977. We were concerned in particular at its potential for dominance by private legal practitioners with all the narrowness and the self-interest that tends to be part of the practice of law privately. We were concerned at the dominance that was possible for the private profession, with the prospect being that the representatives of salaried and community legal services would have an insufficient voice on the Commission and insufficient opportunity as a result for creative, imaginative and sensitive input into the formulation of legal aid delivery policy. Despite all those various reservations, qualifications and arguments of one kind or another with varying degrees of force against the establishment of the Commission, the Bill, as inevitably seems to happen in this Parliament, went through. </PARA>
<PARA> Our feelings were assuaged a little by the then Attorney-General, Mr Ellicott, who told us that the Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission thus created in 1977 was 'a basic element' in the development of a comprehensive legal aid scheme in Australia. He was saying in effect that the introduction of the Commission, with all its powers and functions there set out, was an indispensable linchpin for the new era of legal aid and that it was heralding in a new dawn of Federal-State co-operation and, indeed, of continuing Commonwealth financial commitment. So the Commission was established. </PARA>
<PARA> Despite the fact that it has not, during its life since 1977, always acted as sensitively or energetically as many people would have liked, it has undoubtedly come to play a central role in researching, advising, evaluating, co-ordinating and monitoring the funding and the general delivery of legal aid services. On its advice Commonwealth funding has been maintained at more or less the real levels originally established by the Labor Government between 1972 and 1975, although there have been recurring crises in particular areas, especially in Victoria, and although, of course, there has been a perennial concern that the means and needs tests being applied under the advice of the Commission are being applied to stringently so as to exclude everyone except those in dire poverty and, indeed, not even all those. </PARA>
<PARA> The State commissions which have come into operation in all but two States, where they are about to come into operation, have been, on all the evidence, working reasonably well, subject inevitably to reservations of one kind or another. Overall, that is not an inaccurate conclusion. The Commission has set in operation at least one major research project designed to settle once and for all the central and enormously important question as to the comparative cost of delivering legal aid via salaried professionals on the one hand or private legal practitioners on the other. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commission by its statute in 1977 was given a very large number of specific functions to perform. Despite the disposition of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack) in his second reading speech to down-play the actual role that the Commission has performed in recent months, and indeed recent years, the Opposition takes the view that the Commission has been performing most of its statutory functions very effectively indeed and certainly to the maximum extent possible, given the kinds of resources available to it. Rather than waxing any more lyrical or lengthily on this subject I shall simply seek leave to incorporate in Hansard at this point a list of activities of the Commission in its heyday rather than in its somewhat attenuated form of recent months. Notwithstanding, I believe it to be an accurate list of what it has indeed been up to. The document in question is not dated, but I think it is acknowledged by the Attorney to bear the marks of verisimilitude. Accordingly, I seek leave to incorporate it in Hansard as a description of what the Commission at the height of its operations had, in fact, been up to. </PARA>

<PARA> The document read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>SUMMARY OF MAJOR OPERATIONAL ACTIVITIES</PARA>
<PARA>1. 'Legal Aid in Australia: An Annotated Bibliography'</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Activity Description: The Commission is collecting, annotating, indexing and publishing the only national bibliography of materials on legal aid and legal needs in Australia. The bibliography also includes overseas material. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) Relevance of Activity: The bibliography allows all interested organisations and individuals to keep abreast of what is happening in legal aid and provides an information base for further research. This information will be of great assistance in planning new initiatives in legal aid. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) Future Developments: The bibliography will include a more detailed classification and, in particular, categorizes overseas materials in the same manner as existing Australian entries. </PARA>
<PARA> (d) Statutory Function: This activity falls into function 6 (a), (e), (j) and (f). </PARA>
<PARA>2. 'Legal Aid News'</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Activity Description: 'Legal Aid News' is a topical news sheet containing serious articles on legal aid as well as jottings on current events affecting legal aid. 'Legal Aid News' is widely distributed throughout Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) Relevance of Activity: 'Legal Aid News' brings together in one publication those matters that affect legal aid in Australia. It is a useful forum for raising issues and discussing topics of interest and concern. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) Future Developments: 'Legal Aid News' can be used by the legal aid agencies themselves for notifying development advertising staff positions and providing a means of raising issues of office management and relevant legal developments. </PARA>
<PARA> (d) Statutory Function: 'Legal Aid News' falls into function 6 (f). </PARA>
<PARA>3. Evaluating Legal Aid: 'Framework for Accountability and Accessibility Review'; 'Evalu- ating the Effectiveness of Legal Aid Programs: A Description of Issues, Options and Problems'; and 'Handbook for the Self-Evaluation of Legal Aid Agencies'. </PARA>
<PARA> (a) Activity Description: The Commission has already produced two publications:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) 'Framework for Accountability and Accessibility Review'; and</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) 'Evaluating the Effectiveness of Legal Aid Problems'</PARA>
<PARA>which deal with theoretical and practical issues in the evaluation of legal aid agencies. The Commission is in the process of producing the 'Handbook for the Self-Evaluation of Legal Aid Agencies' which may be used by all legal aid agencies for their self-evaluation. This Handbook will be easy to follow and offer practical suggestions to legal aid agencies in self-evaluation. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) Relevance of Activity: These publications and the proposed publication are applicable to all legal aid agencies. They will assist agencies in their management and setting of goals and objectives. The results of the self-evaluation undertaken by legal aid agencies will allow them to approach funders with hard evidence of program needs and data on the agencies' effectiveness. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) Future Developments: With the production of the Self-Evaluation Handbook the Commission will be involved in encouraging legal aid agencies to adopt a process of self-evaluation. One advantage of having agencies being involved in self-evaluation is that statistics and other information can be available for not only the agency itself, but others for formulating legal aid policy. </PARA>
<PARA> (d) Statutory Function: The evaluation of legal aid falls into function 6 (a), (b) (i), (b) (ii) and (b) (iv) and, particularly, 6 (d). </PARA>
<PARA>4. Evaluating Eligibility Criteria</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Activity Description: The project is being carried out at the request of the South Australian Legal Services Commission and is evaluating the criteria used to accept and reject legal aid applicants. It is ascertaining what happens to those rejected, how they resolve their legal problems, and whether such people will create barriers in the access of legal aid for others. The Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission has acted in this project as a consultant to the South Australian Legal Services Commission. It has worked closely with the South Australian Commission obtaining material from its files and records and with the Australian Bureau of Statistics, which has conducted the surveys. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) Relevance of Activity: The results of the study will allow the South Australian Commission to review and assess the criteria it uses in granting legal aid. The results will also be applicable to other legal aid agencies, including other State Commissions, that use similar criteria. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) Future Developments: At the moment the study is merely a pilot project and it is anticipated that the more detailed study will be undertaken later this year. </PARA>
<PARA>5. Interstate Cost Comparison</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Activity Description: This project is being co-ordinated by the Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission and involves all State legal aid commissions and the Australian Legal Aid Office. Joint discussions were held with the Directors of those offices to facilitate the implementation of the project. Initially the study is restricted to family law because of uniform procedures. In some instances members of this Commission's research staff have been given access to files and records to collect the relevant data. The project will establish which jurisdiction has the cheapest and which has the most expensive cost structures in the area of Family Law. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) Relevance of Activity: The results of the project will be useful for not only this Commission but also State legal aid commissions in claiming the nature of the legal services they provide. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) Future Developments: On the completion of this project other areas of law will be considered. </PARA>
<PARA> (d) Statutory Function: This activity falls into Section 6 (a), (b) (i) and (f). </PARA>
<PARA>6. Cost Comparison between Private and Salaried Lawyers</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Activity Description: The object of this project is to see to determine which method of delivering legal aid is the most cost effective: private or salaried lawyers. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) Relevance of Activity: With the results of this project this Commission will be able to advise both the Commonwealth and State Attorneys-General and the State legal aid commissions of the most effective and economical method of providing legal aid. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) Future Developments: The project at the moment is limited to a cost comparison, though later it may be developed into a comparison of the different quality of the legal services provided by each method of delivery. </PARA>
<PARA> (d) Statutory Function: This project falls into functions 6 (a), 6 (b) (i) and 6 (b) (iii). </PARA>
<PARA>7. Statistics</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Activity Description: The Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission is developing national legal aid statistics. This will take time to complete, though considerable progress has been made. There have been discussions with State legal aid commissions, Bureaux of Crime Statistics and the Australian Bureau of Statistics. Already, the Commission has obtained from the Australian Bureau of Statistics an undertaking that 'legal representation' will be a data item in their National Court Statistics. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) Relevance of Activity: With national legal aid statistics both this Commission and State legal aid commissions will be able to more efficiently and economically plan the delivery of legal aid. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) Future Developments: It is hoped that legal aid statistics will be available in published form once problems involving the collection of statistics have been resolved. </PARA>
<PARA> (d) Statutory Function: This function falls into Section 6 (c), though statistics are also relevant to Section 6 (a) and 6 (g). </PARA>
<PARA>8. Alternative Sources of Funding Conference</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Activity Description: The Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission is organising a conference on the topic of 'Alternative Sources of Legal Aid Funding'. In the Conference different methods of funding legal aid will be canvassed and examined. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) Relevance of Activity: With the results from the Conference, this Commission will be able to advise the Commonwealth Attorney-General on initiatives in the area of legal aid funding. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) Future Developments: The Conference may suggest new sources of funding that will require more detailed examination by this Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> (d) Statutory Function: This activity falls into Section 6 (b) (iii), 6 (b) (iv), 6 (f) and 6 (g). </PARA>
<PARA>9. Legal Aid Research Conference</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Activity Description: This Conference will draw together researchers in the area of legal aid. It will be an opportunity for the Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission to explain its research program and also obtain information about other research being undertaken in the area. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) Relevance of Activity: The Conference will be useful for the Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission to set its own research program and priorities. It will also encourage co-operation between researchers and Legal Aid Commissions at the local level. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) Future Developments: It is anticipated that a legal aid research conference be held at regular intervals, possibly once every two years. </PARA>
<PARA> (d) Statutory Function: This activity falls into Section 6(g). </PARA>
<PARA>10. Examination of the Relationship Between Legal Aid Agencies and Social Agencies</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Activity Description: This research project examines the relationship between legal aid agencies and social agencies and will determine the extent to which legal aid agencies can use social agencies in their work. It will consider practical, social and economical factors that arise in this relationship. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) Relevance of Activity: The results of this project may be used by State legal aid commissions in determining their relationship with various social agencies. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) Future Developments: With the results of this project the Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission may be involved in community legal education in implementing any proposals and with coordinating any national effect. </PARA>
<PARA> (d) Statutory Function: This activity falls into functions 6(a), 6(g) and 6(h). </PARA>
<PARA>11. Examination of Group Legal Services</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Activity Description: The Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission is examining the feasibility of group legal services in Australia. The focus of the project is on Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) Relevance of Activity: The project will determine whether group legal services are feasible and the relevance of this new method of delivering legal services to legal aid. This information will be useful to all legal aid commissions in their planning of new initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) Future Developments: Depending on the results of this project, the Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission may be actively involved in implementing this new method of delivering legal services. </PARA>
<PARA> (d) Statutory Function: This activity falls into Section 6(a), (e) and (g). </PARA>
<PARA>12. 'Clearinghouse'. </PARA>
<PARA> (a) Activity Description: The Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission is developing a clearinghouse function for legal aid agencies and interested individuals. It is collecting together not only its own publications but also a wide range of information that relates to legal aid, which will be available on request. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) Relevance of Activity: This service provided by the Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission is an assistance to all legal aid agencies in Australia. It may be used for reviewing existing programs or planning new initiatives. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) Future Developments: At the moment the Clearinghouse has only a limited operation, although it is anticipated it will broaden its scope, as demand increases. </PARA>
<PARA> (d) Statutory Function: This activity falls into Sections 6(e) and (f). </PARA>
<PARA>13. Assistance with New Programs</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Activity Description: The policy of the Government is that any new program or any major variation to an existing program requires Cabinet approval the Commission helps legal aid commissions to gather material in support of the program and prepares submissions to the Attorney-General on the feasibility and essentiality. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) Relevance of Activity: With this assistance the State commissions can ensure proposals with all supporting evidence are properly presented and the Attorney-General can be satisfied that the proposal has been thoroughly investigated and its need found. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) Future Development: As well as programs raised by State legal aid commissions it is envisaged that a ''package'' will be developed by the Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission for programs which would assist State commissions (for example self-evaluation program or quality control program). Acceptance in principle at Federal level will facilitate program implementation and funding. </PARA>
<PARA> (d) Statutory Function: This activity falls into function 6(b) and provisions of the Commonwealth/State agreement. </PARA>
<PARA>14. Liaison with the Commonwealth Government</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Activity Description: Many aspects of Government administration and legal administration are restricted to the Federal sphere. The Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission being a Federal body, has developed a particular relationship with Federal authorities in matters that relate to legal aid. For example, the Commission is involved with:</PARA>
<PARA> Implementation of the Galbally Report, being on the Galbally working party</PARA>
<PARA> Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs-particularly in relation to its post arrival information program</PARA>
<PARA> Institute of Family Studies (involvement in determining the direction of research program)</PARA>
<PARA> Australian Bureau of Statistics (inclusion of ''legal representation'' as a data item in national statistics) and development of uniform statistics</PARA>
<PARA> Administrative Review Council (appeal structures in legal aid and Social Security appeals)</PARA>
<PARA> Australian Law Reform Commission (the relevance of legal aid to substantive law issues)</PARA>
<PARA> Family Law Council (advisor to the Legal Aid Committee)</PARA>
<PARA> Parliamentary Committees (e.g. enquiry into Aboriginal legal aid). </PARA>
<PARA> (b) Relevance of Activity: The Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission, in these above activities, is an obvious reference point for the many Federal authorities that operate in the areas of Government and legal administration. Approaches to and by Federal bodies are best made on a Federal level. This ensures that legal aid is always taken into account when those authorities are planning programs which are relevant. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) Future Developments: The liaison and co-operation already being undertaken should continue and develop. Gradually the Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission will become recognised as 'experts' in policy issues affecting legal aid. </PARA>
<PARA> (d) Statutory Function: This activity falls into Section 6 (f). </PARA>
<PARA>15. Financial Assistance</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Activity Description: Liaise with and provide advice to State legal aid commissions in the preparation of estimates programs and prepare them in a form for consideration by the Commonwealth Commission. Negotiates, on Commission's behalf, with the Departments of Attorney-General and Finance for an adequate level of Commonwealth funding for legal aid. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) Relevance of Activity: The role of the Commonwealth Commission is to recommend to the Attorney-General the level of legal aid funding. The staff of the Commssion perform the role of advocate at discussions with the Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Finance when those two bodies are considering the bud for legal aid. Without that intervention commissions would perhaps have their estimates considered less favourably. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) Future Developments: Commission staff are working in cooperation with the ALAO and legal aid commission on a system of data processing using mini-computers with the aim of compiling more meaningful information quickly. It is hoped that this step will allow commissioners to be in a better position to consider programs and estimates from legal aid commissions. </PARA>
<PARA> (d) Statutory Function: These activities fall into functions 6 (b), (f), (j) and (k). </PARA>
<PARA>16. Evaluation</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Activity Description: In co-operation with commissions information is collected as to their operations, especially in the Federal area and these programs are discussed and evaluated. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) Relevance of Activity: Assessment is made of programs on legal aid either in operation or yet to be commenced in legal aid commissions. This allows for an evaluation of these programs in terms of the most efficient use of existing resources. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) Future Developments: The evaluation stage has relevance on all legal aid bodies in Australia. It is proposed therefore that experience gained in assessing the merits of legal aid programs will be passed on to these bodies so that it can be put to more efficient use to their existing resources. </PARA>
<PARA> (d) Statutory Function: This activity falls into function 6 (d), (e), (f), (k) and (l). </PARA>
<PARA>17. Assistance to Voluntary and Community Legal Services</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Activity Description: The Commission recommends on funding from the Commonwealth to voluntary or community legal services and provides liasion, some advice and assistance to these bodies through visits, personal contact, inclusion of such services in conferences/seminars, and the 'Clearinghouse' function. The role of the voluntary services is also relevant to issues of concern to the Commissioner, e.g. funding evaluation and research project. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) Relevance of Activity: The voluntary and community legal services carry out an important role in the overall delivery of legal aid. Their innovative, community devised and directed nature has led not only to innovative ways of meeting legal needs but also to their filling gaps in the current system. The work of such services is therefore a necessary part of the Commission's overview of legal aid in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) Future Developments: Liaison with these services can be developed, in conjunction with the Commission's concern with community legal education programs, some research topics and the services' continuing need for financial subsidy. </PARA>
<PARA> (d) Statutory Function: Relevant areas of the Act are mainly 6 (e) but also 6 (a), 6 (c), 6 (f), 6 (g) and 6 (h). </PARA>
<PARA>18. Consultancy and Resource Role</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Activity Description: As well as providing information for all legal aid agencies, the Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission can provide expertise in the area of legal aid policy. In this role it may even act as a 'consultant' for State legal aid commissions. This is what has occurred in the recent study being undertaken by the South Australian Legal Services Commission in its evaluation of eligibility criteria for legal aid and to an extent in the interstate cost comparison. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) Relevance of Activity: This expertise in the Commonwealth Commission is of great use to State legal aid commissions and other legal aid agencies. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) Future Developments: In time the expertise of the Commonwealth Commission may be used by the various legal aid agencies in a more formalized method than at the moment. The development of the 'Clearinghouse' is an example of the direction in which the Commission may move. </PARA>
<PARA> (d) Statutory Function: This activity falls into Sections 6 (f) and (g). </PARA>
<PARA>16. Future Research Projects</PARA>
<PARA> It should be briefly noted that the Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission is undertaking to perform other projects. Some of the projects anticipated are:</PARA>
<PARA> An examination of the impact of legal aid on the administration of justice and the legal system. </PARA>
<PARA> Issues on community legal education, with particular reference to migrants. </PARA>
<PARA> The legal needs of various groups of Australians e.g. rural poor, migrants, prisoners etc. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, the Commission is interested in the quality of legal services that are provided to clients of legal aid commissions. Following the lead of the Legal Services Corporation in the United States, it could consider issues of 'quality control' and 'peer review'. </PARA>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission could also become involved, and to a certain extent it has already done so, in important issues of office management, e.g., word processing and the creation of 'systems' in a legal aid office. </PARA>

It is also an indication for the record of what, in fact, has been done. It is incorporated on that basis. I am indebted to the Attorney for not exercising his undoubted power to refuse leave even though he knows perfectly well that had he refused leave I would have spent another 20 minutes reading the document into the record.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A further general point relates to the general role of the Commonwealth, which I think is crucial to the background of this legislation and to the Opposition's response to it. It is proper that the Commonwealth should be playing a major role here, not only because it is providing funds for legal aid out of its own Treasury but also because the role of the Commonwealth is crucial in the development of legal aid policy and the co-ordination of legal aid delivery. We ought to remember, if we have already forgotten, the bad old days which existed before the Labor Government introduced the Australian Legal Aid Office and simultaneously engaged in some very substantial funding of the existing State legal aid services. Those were the days-before the Labor Government came into the picture in this way-when legal aid was wholly in the hands of voluntary law society schemes supplemented in some States by funding derived from the trust account interest which was required to be separately collected and, in some other States, supplemented also by very small subventions from the State Treasury. It resulted in the situation in which the concept of equal access to the law and to legal procedures was no better than a joke. It was a pitiful and bad joke, but a joke notwithstanding. Legal aid for all practical purposes simply did not exist. It is clear that it would be disastrous for the Commonwealth to abandon any of its role in this field. </PARA>
<PARA> The States have not traditionally had any inclination to play any kind of significant financial role in funding legal aid. Even if they had had that inclination, as one or two of them have had in a very small way, they simply have not had the resources to translate that inclination into the viable levels of financial assistance. Nothing has happened since the early 1970s to change that situation. If anything, the financial situation of the States is becoming undeniably more constrained as a result of the razor gang ideology and the insistance of this Government on vesting unwanted functions back in that level of government. </PARA>
<PARA> Against that background, it is with real apprehension that we in the Opposition approach the present Bill. It is with very real, genuine trepidation that we contemplate the implications of this Bill. It is with considerable alarm that we have to approach a Bill that abolishes, as this one does, the Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission with its existing staff of around 20 officers and replaces it with a part time advisory council with no staff at all working to an already manifestly overstretched Attorney-General's Department. It is with alarm that we see that the composition of the new advisory Council abandons even the pretence of independence in respect of the interests that are represented on it. Appointees are now to be nominated, not by outside organisations of relevant kinds but by the Attorney-General, albeit after consultation. It is still his appointment. </PARA>
<PARA> It must be with alarm that we see that the functions of the advisory Council now created have been stripped back under this legislation to negligible proportions. I will say something more about these points later. It is with alarm that we see that the advisory Council has no longer in particular any direct advisory role in relation to the States. It has to be with some alarm again that we notice in the Attorney-General's second reading speech that it is not proposed to transfer all the existing staff of the Commission back into the Attorney-General's Department to perform legal aid, or indeed any other functions. That, of course, will create a situation in which there is that much less chance of the kind of the functions that were previously exercised by the Commission now being performed by anyone. </PARA>
<PARA> It is with alarm that we note furthermore the context in which this Bill has been presented to us as the first part of the razor gang package, in that context necessarily bearing all the hallmarks of this Government's obsessive preoccupation with winding back the Commonwealth presence in areas of activity in favour of private sector activity, including private sector professional activity, and also with returning Commonwealth functions to the States. Finally, in this list of genuine grounds of alarm, we also note that the Bill has been introduced in the context of a major squeeze currently being applied in legal aid funding, with a manifest attempt being made, as I will explain again in a few moments, to wind back the base level of financial commitment which the Commonwealth is then obliged to offer to the extent that it maintains any role at all in this area in the future. </PARA>
<PARA> The demise of the Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission has been writing on the wall for some considerable time. There has been ample evidence of that, not least the non-replacement of a number of retired commissioners in recent months and, indeed, the operation of the Commission without even a formal quorum, I notice, for that period. There are some people-apparently among their ranks is the present chairman of the Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission, Mr Justice Else-Mitchell-who will not be heard publicly to be mourning its passing. But the Opposition does mourn the passing of the Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission. It opposes this Bill. We take this view because we regard the Bill as being important for what it does in itself-that is, as I will go on to explain, substantially limiting the effectiveness of legal aid research, co-ordination, funding and delivery-but also, because of what it presages or foreshadows, perhaps what it forebodes, about the future of Commonwealth involvement in the whole area of legal aid funding. The basis of our opposition to this Bill is perhaps most succinctly embodied in the second reading amendment which has been circulated to honourable senators. I move:</PARA>
<PARA> Leave out all words after 'That', insert 'the Senate is of the opinion that-</PARA>
<PARA> (A) The Commonwealth has a continuing national responsibility for the funding of legal aid, the States having amply demonstrated in the past that they have neither the resources nor the inclination to ensure equal access to the law;</PARA>
<PARA> (B) The Commonwealth has an indispensable national role in the formulation of legal aid policy so as to ensure that legal services are delivered on a co-ordinated, rational and equitable basis;</PARA>
<PARA> (C) The Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission has a central national role to play in research, evaluating, advising upon, co-ordinating and monitoring the funding and delivery of legal aid services;</PARA>
<PARA> (D) The present functions of the Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission cannot be performed as adequately or effectively by a part time advisory Council and an Attorney-General's Department already subject to severe staffing constraints; and</PARA>
<PARA> (E) The proposals to abolish the Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission, to curtail the functions and limit the independence of its successor advisory Council, to limit the number of full time officials working on legal aid policy and funding, are all to be deplored as marking the first steps toward the Commonwealth's ultimate abandonment of responsibility for legal aid funding'. </PARA>

All the worries that we had back in 1977 about the creation of the Commission and the institutional limitations on the Commonwealth's role that were thus involved have now been necessarily multiplied a thousand-fold by the terms of this Bill. In the first place there are to be substantial reductions in the functions that will be exercised by the new advisory council, not least in the area of research. I believe that posterity will best appreciate the point I make if I seek at this point-I think on this occasion no neurosis will be expressed by the Attorney-General-to incorporate in Hansard, in juxtasposition with each other, two clauses from relevant legislation. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard section 6 of the Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission Act 1977, which outlines the functions of the Commission as they exist at the moment, and secondly, section 5 of what will become the new Commonwealth Legal Aid Act as amended by the present Bill.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The second point is that the lack of independence in exercising those functions that are to be retained is again evident when we look at the language in which these functions are described. When we go down the list of functions that are set out in the 1977 Act, we see that the role of the Commission is to advise, to conduct research, to collect information, to act in various ways in each case on its own motion, there being only one exception, in section 6 (j), which states that certain advice about State commissions is to be offered only as requested by the Attorney-General. But overwhelmingly the functions are to be exercised by the Commission itself, whereas by contrast if we look to the relevant clause of the current Bill just incorporated in Hansard, which will go into the Act, we see that advice on the advisory council's own motion can be given only with respect to a quite narrow range of financial questions and that the larger questions as to the appropriateness of particular mechanisms for legal aid delivery and so on can be the subject of attention by the advisory council only if the Attorney-General specifically requests the council to engage in that sort of activity. There is a very real question as to whether an Attorney-General-any Attorney-General-in this particular brand of government would request the advisory council to look at things which might undermine the particular ideological fixations which this Government has.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Again looking at what this Bill does, the third point is that no advisory function at all is now specifically identified with respect to the funding and delivery of legal aid in the States or through State commissions. Since most legal aid, to the extent that funding is to continue at all, will in fact be delivered via State commissions, this clearly renders quite negligible any residual function the advisory council might have been able to perform in respect of the co-ordination or the rationalisation of legal aid services-the making of a more equitable system of legal aid delivery around the nation. I further make the point that the composition of the new advisory council is not to be such as to encourage any rational belief in the independence of the new council either from the Government or, more importantly perhaps, from the mainstream private legal profession. I think this point is again made most succinctly by incorporating in Hansard the two relevant provisions from the respective pieces of legislation, that is, section 5 of the existing Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission Act and what will be the new section 4 of the Act as amended by the present Bill. I seek leave to incorporate those two provisions in Hansard. </PARA>

The most distance that its rights extend at the moment is to be on the receiving end of consultation from the Attorney-General as to who the nominees should be. It might be claimed that this is some kind of purely technical provision to accommodate the change in the contemplated structure of the Council from a commission appointed by the Governor-General to simply an advisory body. I simply make the point that the change in the composition of the body in this way has manifestly, on the face of it, created the possibility for less independent voices being part of its operations.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course it would depend on the way it was administered. The option is there for it to be administered credibly and sensibly with nominee of ACOSS being given the appointment automatically. But it also has the potential for maladministration, and I think it is proper for the Senate and the Parliament to seek some further and better explanation for why the language has been changed, if indeed it is the intention to proceed in the future by way of there being an express nomination from ACOSS, and indeed, from the other bodies which are subject to these same proceedings, namely, the Law Council of Australia and the State commissions which are to have two representatives, if that is still the right word, on the new council. The Attorney-General retains the right to appoint not only the chairman but also two additional members solely at his own discretion, and again one would hope that he would use that right to appoint persons who have had a background or have current experience in the delivery of legal aid at the work face level, either in community legal services or in the salaried State commissions. But there is absolutely no guarantee that that will in fact happen, that those two residual places will be used up in that way.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think the point can obviously be made that with the composition thus being as it is and with the abandonment, incidentally, of the position of deputy chairman, which hitherto has been the sole full time part of the operation, the situation remains that there is a very real possibility-I refer again to the context in which this Bill comes forward; it is very much a part of the razor gang exercise-and, indeed, a probability that excessive deference will be paid in the future operation of legal aid and the operations of this Council to the interests of the private legal profession rather than to the consumers of the services that legal aid lawyers should provide. Certainly, there is ample evidence mounting generally that this Government is all too happy to look after the interests of the private legal profession. </PARA>
<PARA> The razor gang report makes explicit reference to the decision of the Commonwealth to make increasing use of private lawyers to perform essential functions on a contract basis. I ask the Government: Has it not heard what the leading lights of the profession have been charging the Commonwealth lately for the exercise of their services? Has it not heard-no doubt the Attorney-General will have heard this because he was sitting in on the Estimates Committee hearing on 27 April when this matter was discussed; it is recorded at page 17 of the Hansard report of Estimates Committee A-that Mr David Rofe, Q.C., is now being paid $1,070 a day as the social security conspiracy case in Sydney moves into its twenty-fifth month? The Attorney will also be aware that Mr Frank Costigan is being paid $1,200 a day for the first nine months of his chairmanship of the Royal Commission into the Federated Painters and Dockers Union of Australia, although here no doubt there is an element of danger money built into this particular commission, as was indeed acknowledged when this matter was discussed in the Senate Estimates Committee on 27 April, as recorded at page 19 of the report. </PARA>
<PARA> No doubt he will be aware also-I hope that he is aware also-that Mr Richard Searby, Q.C., is being paid $20,000 for the three months that he spends between attending CRA, Murdoch, Ansett and Shell board meetings as a consultant to the Commonwealth in its current review-what the status of this will be in light of its new proposed review nobody knows-of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, even though Mr Searby's actual experience in the industrial jurisdiction has been 'limited' according to Mr Mick Keogh, the Secretary to the Department of Industrial Relations in his evidence to Senate Estimates Committee A on 27 April. That evidence appears at page 50 of the report, should anyone be minded to look up the saga of Mr Searby. </PARA>
<PARA> Those sorts of illustrations can be multiplied-maybe in funny sorts of ways they are one off cases-but the basic point remains that it is an enormously expensive business to deliver effective qualified legal services otherwise than on a salaried basis. That is crucial when one gets to the area of legal aid. It is crucial across the board. No doubt honourable senators will have seen the rather cautiously prepared statement of the Australian Government Lawyers Association in the Press recently as its response to the razor gang statement that I quoted, that the best estimates were that for the general provision of legal services on routine Crown law type matters the proper comparative cost basis was about $20 an hour for the salaried lawyer as compared with much closer to $60 an hour, because of the overhead factors that have to be built in, in the case of work performed by the private legal profession. All the evidence is that, in the context of legal aid, which is the one with which we are concerned in this case, it is at least twice as cheap to deliver legal aid through salaried professionals as it is through the private profession. </PARA>
<PARA> Until perhaps further research is done, the most authoritative study is the 1980 report of the research and education section of the South Australian legal services commission-research reported in a recent issue of the Legal Services Bulletin which shows quite beyond doubt that it is three times more expensive to go to private lawyers in criminal cases, and on average twice as expensive to do that in family and civil matters generally. That estimate follows earlier ones which were prepared by the Australian Law Reform Commission in 1975 in its criminal investigation report, and also by the Sackville law and poverty report which suggested again in both cases that salaried lawyers could handle cases at roughly half the cost of them being referred out to private practitioners. </PARA>
<PARA> The point is that if the composition of the Advisory Council is to reflect, as it now quite manifestly can should the Attorney-General be minded to appoint its members in this way the dominant concerns of the private legal profession, which the razor gang ideology would have us overtly believe is likely to be the case, then it will be a very much more expensive business to deliver effective legal aid. Either it is going to be more expensive or only half the number of people are likely to benefit from such largesse as the Commonwealth will provide. </PARA>
<PARA> I make one further point about comparative costs of these things, and that is that it is crucial that the work which was set in train by the Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission to establish the cost effectiveness on salaried lawyers delivering legal aid once and for all to put the matter absolutely and unequivocally beyond doubt by a very expensive and thoroughly researched project be brought to completion. Already there has been something like $45,000 of taxpayers money spent to bring that study to its present stage. It will be a most unhappy result if the ideological combination of this Government and the private legal profession, which we can see is all to cosily likely to emerge under the new arrangements if this Bill is carried, killed off that project. I make the point that generally, since we are on the subject of costs, that the costs of the operation of the Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission, for which the original estimate for this financial year 1980-81 was $700,000 is absolutely negligible when it is set against the total funding provided by the Commonwealth for legal aid-$26.9m in this financial year, and that is excluding Aboriginal legal aid. Of course it became negligible when we take into account the functions that the Commission has been performing and is certainly likely to go on performing if its survival were assured. </PARA>
<PARA> Rather more briefly, let me now finally turn to the other ground of opposition of the Australian Labor Party, and I hope of other honourable senators, to this Bill. I have been talking so far solely about the implications of the Bill on the structure of the Commission, now to be the Council, and the implications that that will have for the effectiveness of the research, the co-ordination and the monitoring role that that body has been performing. I have been indicating how unhappy I and the Opposition are about the implications of this change. Let me now talk to the other side of our concern which goes rather beyond that, and that is our concern about what this Bill foreshadows or forebodes so far as the future of Commonwealth funding in this area is concerned. It is the contention of members of the Opposition, as we say in paragraph (E) of the amendment, that the proposal to abolish the Commission, to curtail its functions, to limit the independence of its successor council, to limit the number of full time officials working on legal aid policy and funding all, when read together, do mark the first steps toward the Commonwealth's ultimate abandonment of responsibility for legal aid funding. </PARA>
<PARA> The Attorney-General has made various public statements that the Government has no such intention, that it will stay in the field, that the real level of Commonwealth commitment will be maintained. Indeed, he has gone so far-it is unusual for the Attorney in public-as to describe my claims as being absurd. I remind him of what another government Minister said recently of another set of Government commitments of an almost equally precisely formulated kind. I refer to what Mr MacKellar said in the House of Representatives on 5 May as recorded at page 1960 of Hansard. He stated:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . no government can be required to continue with policies which bring about results inconsistent with other government policies . . . </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, how can we be expected to keep our promises when we change our policies? What I am suggesting here is that what we are witnessing is a very definite change in direction on the part of this Government. It foreshadows as clearly as any signalling could possibly do that the Commonwealth is ultimately getting out of legal aid. It wants to wind back its degree of commitment. It does not want to have a mainstream policy role in the formulation of legal aid policy and determining the way in which legal aid services are delivered. It wants to opt out and stand back from the fray and invest more and more of these sorts of functions in the State commissions which have now been created. </PARA>
<PARA> The Attorney talks about the Commonwealth's funding commitment being embodied in agreements-agreements with four States, Western Australia, Queensland, South Australia and Victoria. But in a recent Estimates committee hearing it has emerged-the very same committee hearings that we talked about on 27 April-that the language of these agreements, to the extent that they have been made public, is very rubbery indeed. The Commonwealth's commitment to maintain 'the level of legal aid' means no more or less than what the Government chooses it to mean. To the extent that it does mean anything it does, of course, mean that it is very much in the Commonwealth's interest-at least in the case of Victoria where the agreement comes into effective operation at last on 1 July this year-to wind back its present level of funding to the minimum possible because it is on this year's figures that future funding, if this is to be taken at face value, will be based. As I have suggested, this consideration is the origin of the present crisis in the funding of legal aid in Victoria which as already been the subject of a good deal of attention in recent weeks. </PARA>
<PARA> As time is getting on I do not want to retread unnecessarily the ground which has been well covered in various contexts in this Parliament, particularly by Estimates Committee A on 27 April, but I remind the Senate that this year there is a shortfall of $1m in the Federal funds available to the Victorial legal aid office. This means that unless some counter action is taken around 1,800 people who would normally have got aid in the last three months of this financial year will not be able to get it. I remind the Senate that attempts have been made, on the word of the Attorney-General, to cover the extra load by bringing more work back into the office. I advise the Senate that this measure has failed because of the absence of a sufficient number of lawyers and back-up staff to enable the work of that office to proceed effectively. It is a situation which has become so bad that legal aid lawyers in Melbourne-as dedicated as they are-have had to impose work bans in a so far futile attempt to get their message across. I remind the Senate that attempts to use additional lawyers to cover the backlog have proved quite ineffective to the extent that in a number of instances it has been merely a matter of robbing one service in order to provide another. The duty solicitor system in the Family Court of Australia has had to be wound down in order to try desperately to redress the situation in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> I further advise the Senate that on my advice none of the measures that have been taken so far appears to make any difference whatsover to the circumstances. The Attorney promised that he would review the situation this month-round about now-and determine what, if any, extra assistance would be offered but nothing has emerged so far from the Attorney's lips to tell us what is going on. That is the situation in just one State. I could spend time, but I will not, describing what the situation is in Queensland, which I visited a few days ago. I examined in a lot of detail the legal aid situation on the ground there. What I am simply doing is suggesting that the Commonwealth is no longer providing a proper level of funding for legal aid. The situation, certainly in Victoria, demonstrates that. That in turn demonstrates that the writing is on the wall so far as the future for legal aid is concerned. I make the point that the winding back in Commonwealth finance and in the whole policy that is associated with that is entirely consistent with the razor gang ideology that we have seen emerging to fruition in recent days and weeks. </PARA>
<PARA> I make the further point that there is an inexorable connection between a continuing Commonwealth financial commitment to legal aid and the continued existence with significant functions of the Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission. Finally, I make the point that the abolition of the Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission is bad in itself but it is absolutely disastrous for what it promises for the future. That is why we oppose the Bill and urge the Senate to support the amendment which makes that concern clear. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to the Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission Amendment Bill and support its second reading. I have heard the speech which Senator Evans has just delivered and I readily agree that there are problems and worries associated with legal aid and the future of Commonwealth involvement in this area. However, I recognise the reasons which have been given for introducing this Bill and which can be seen in some detail in the second reading speech of the Attorney-General (Senator Durack). The Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission, which we have had for some years but which will be abolished by this Bill and replaced by a council, has undertaken a role described by the Attorney-General as an advisory, co-ordinating and monitoring role. The functions which are set out in the original legislation include the right and duty of the Commission to perform these various roles. I think that in the last few years the Commission has performed a good service in these areas.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commission also has the functions of keeping the need for legal assistance in Australia under review, of making recommendations to the Attorney-General and to the State and Territory commissions, of collecting and publishing statistics, of undertaking research and furnishing an annual report for tabling in Parliament. I believe that it can be said that the changes which are made in this Bill do not fundamentally change those roles although, of course, it will be necessary for us to supervise carefully the way in which the roles are performed by the new council. Senator Evans spoke of it as being a part time operation. The amendment which the Opposition puts forward refers to it in that way. But of course it has been essentially a part time operation. There was a full time vice chairman but most of the officers were part time. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It had a separate full time staff. I am speaking here of the governing bodies. Of course it will continue to have full time staff but they will be people allocated from the Attorney-General's Department. I understand the reasons that have motivated the Government in feeling that the maintenance of a commission, with the trappings and solemnities which it has and with a separate staff, was an uneconomic and to an extent inefficient method of providing the supervision of legal aid.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I believe that the Council will be properly appointed. I do not accept the criticisms which Senator Evans has made that somehow it will lack independence-I think that is the word he used-because members are appointed on the recommendation of the Attorney-General. In particular Senator Evans referred to the appointment which will be made under this Bill of a member after consultation between the Attorney-General and the Australian Council of Social Service. I do not see any reason for believing that because that is done after consultation there will not thereby be appointed a person who will have the confidence of ACOSS and who will therefore be able to represent on the new council the views of and problems experienced by ACOSS and similar organisations on the delivery of legal aid in this country. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YL7">Senator MISSEN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The change is actually from a commission to a council. A body is being formed which will not have separate staff or a separate structure. Therefore one imagines that the cost of providing legal aid services will be less. The Attorney-General in his second reading speech gave very clear undertakings that there will not be a reduction in the Commonwealth's responsibility in the legal aid field. Of course, it is up to Parliament to scrutinise carefully and to ensure that reductions do not occur and that the fears which the Opposition has expressed in the last part of its amendment do not come to pass. The amendment, which I do not support, goes well beyond the criticisms that I think can properly be made or the fears that can be held. I refer to the part of the amendment which states that the proposals are to be deplored as marking the first step towards the Commonwealth's ultimate abandonment of responsibility for legal aid funding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Commonwealth Government has accepted a considerable responsibility for funding. Members on this side of the House are very conscious of that fact and are personally committed to the continuance of that responsibility. I draw attention to that part of the second reading speech where the Attorney-General referred to a question asked by Senator Evans without notice on 26 March. The Attorney-General said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . there is no intention on the part of the Government to reduce its commitments to the level of legal aid or the commitments it has made in agreements with the States to maintain the level of activity of legal aid. </PARA>
<PARA>I remind the Senate of those commitments and ask it to consider the Bill in the light of those statements. The Attorney-General goes on to say that he wants to emphasise that it has always been the policy of the Government that no person should be denied legal aid because of lack of means. This is a continuing aim of the Government and is evident from the annual appropriations for legal aid to which the Attorney-General referred. I am not satisfied at this stage that we have achieved that aim to the extent that we ought in this country. I have long felt that the amount which we spend on legal aid, when compared with the expenditures in other areas of social welfare, is not adequate. Perhaps there is not sufficient demand in the community for it. Nonetheless, I think there has been a considerable lack of legal aid particularly for people who have relatively low means but who are not necessarily pensioners or on the poverty line. </PARA>
<PARA> I refer now to the remarks which I made last year in the dissenting report of the Joint Select Committee on the Family Law Act. At page 209 of the report I said:</PARA>
<PARA> After an analysis of the evidence available to the Committee as to the limited availability of legal aid through the Australian Legal Aid Office . . . Kerry A. Peterson, LLM, reached this conclusion:</PARA>
<PARA> 'On these figures the A.L.A.O. aid is seen to reach only the poorest 10 per cent of the population. It might be thought that all of that group were suffering hardship, but they must all pay a contribution towards costs unless they can show that they suffer real financial hardship.'</PARA>
<PARA>I went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> The limitation of legal aid basically to those below the poverty line, and the requirement imposed on litigants to pay fees and contributions have all led to a defeat of expectations about the ready availability of family law services. </PARA>
<PARA> Because of the limited guidelines, legal aid is largely confined to pensioners, but the real problem is that other persons of small means are thereby deprived of the opportunity of pursuing their rights. Alternatively, they are, in many cases, forced into disadvantageous settlements because of the lack of availability of legal aid. Legal aid given to one party, and unsupervised, may often lead to the bankruptcy of an unaided party. These problems have not been examined in detail by the Committee, but I believe legal aid inadequacies should be regarded as a key defect limiting the effective operation of the family law system. </PARA>
<PARA>I was dealing only with family law, but family law is the consumer of a substantial part of Commonwealth legal aid. I believe that that position continues. We have not debated that report yet; we have not considered the matters raised in it. I believe that we cannot in any way be complacent or satisfied with the extent to which legal aid is being delivered in this country. There are many people who may not be the poorest in this country who cannot afford, in any sensible way, to expend the money that is required for litigation and therefore do not secure justice before our courts. I believe we must not in any way let up on the needs which we have to supervise legal aid. The fact that we have now a number of State commissions-not all States have commissions-does not mean that we should not still be scrutinising the situation. I believe that the new council, despite what Senator Evans has said, has substantial power, under its functions, to investigate certain areas. I remind Senator Evans of proposed new section 5 (a) which states that the functions of the Council are:</PARA>
<PARA> to ascertain, and keep under review, the extent of the need for legal assistance in Australia and, in particular, the need for legal assistance in respect of Commonwealth matters and to make recommendations from time to time to the Attorney-General as to the most effective, economical and desirable means of satisfying that need;</PARA>
<PARA>That is a very broad function. It is not confined to Commonwealth matters; it is concerned with the whole situation of legal aid in this country. I have listened to what has been said in respect of salaried services. I believe that investigations have to be made constantly in that area to see whether legal aid is being delivered in the most efficient and effective way in this community. I believe that in many respects there are areas where there should be less reliance on the private legal system. In fact, the salaried service in many areas can provide quite effective aid to more people than would be the case with the private service. We must know, as must the council which is being appointed under this Bill, what investigations are being made in this area overseas-a lot of work is being done in the United States on this matter-and also what facts are coming forward in Australia as the State commissions operate. We must know whether they are effectively achieving the best use of the legal aid dollar, as it is described from time to time. Overall, I believe that this country has to spend more on legal aid if it is to provide justice for all before the courts. </PARA>
<PARA> Some reference was made to the legal aid position in the State of Victoria, from which I come. I am concerned at some recent indications of the way in which the legal aid position has deteriorated, particularly in that State. I am concerned at the overall general financial position of the Victorian Government. My colleague Senator Hamer in a speech last week and Senator Lewis in statements over the weekend have pointed out the perilous situation in Victoria because of the injustice which is being done to this State by the way in which Commonwealth moneys are provided to it. Leaving aside that overall situation, what has been brought to my attention particularly recently in regard to the legal aid situation in the State of Victoria and about which I have had communications with the Attorney-General, are matters, I think, of considerable concern. I have had brought to my attention a document which is a report made by the Legal Aid Commission in Victoria to the State Attorney-General, the Honourable Haddon Storey, Q.C., concerning the availability of Commonwealth funds for the ALAO in Victoria. In the course of that statement the following references are made:</PARA>
<PARA> The Deputy Director of the ALAO has estimated that the most optimistic view is that the staff will carry an extra 50 or 60 cases per month by the end of June. </PARA>
<PARA>That is June this year. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA> This compares with an average shortfall of approximately 600 cases per month.</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Durack is correct in stating that the duty lawyer in the Family Court has only been temporarily suspended: Whilst the reallocation of the solicitor will assist capacity, it effectively is a reduction in the level of existing legal aid services immediately prior to the advent of the Commission and would therefore appear to be contrary to the spirit of the Agreement. </PARA>
<PARA>On the subject of redefinition of merit, the statement reads:</PARA>
<PARA> Whilst Senator Durack states 'no arrangements are in hand to redefine the notion of merit to exclude applications which would otherwise be within the guidelines' it is clear that the guidelines are being applied more stringently so that some persons who would have qualified for legal aid a month ago are now being rejected. </PARA>
<PARA>* * * *</PARA>
<PARA> It will be disastrous to the working of the Commission and the provision of legal aid in Victoria if the Commission is forced to commence operations with a backlog. </PARA>
<PARA>The Commission is about to commence in Victoria in this situation. Finally the statement reads:</PARA>
<PARA> I am informed that the restrictions imposed by the ALAO has resulted in an increased demand for aid to the Legal Aid Committee which if granted will of course increase the State's level of funding for the 12-month period leading up to the commencement of this Commission. </PARA>
<PARA>This material was forwarded to me by Mr Richard Alston, who apart from being the President of the Liberal Party of Victoria is an eminent barrister in that State. In the letter which he wrote to me at the beginning of this month in connection with this material he said:</PARA>
<PARA> You will note from the enclosed material that the funds made available to the Victorian office have been consumed more quickly than had been anticipated because of an unexpected increase in the number of applications. The end result is there are presently very many persons who are not able to receive Legal Aid not because their applications are unmeritorious but because funds are simply not presently available. The problem is especially criticial in that the formula for future funding will be related to the base figure established for the current year and if such amount does not meet current demands the problem can only be exacerbated. </PARA>
<PARA>I am concerned that, as we move into an era in which State commissions are taking their place, as one is in Victoria, there is a backlog of cases. It is not a matter of inefficiency on the part of the ALAO in Victoria because the number of items dealt with by the legal aid staff for each person each year was 524 in Victoria compared with 291 in New South Wales. So it is not a matter of inefficiency on the part of the office in Victoria which has been operating for some time, but it is a problem which obviously will continue to confront legal aid in Victoria in particular. I am concerned that the Commonwealth, which is maintaining its present obligation, should be very concerned about the legal aid situation, particularly in the State of Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA> I therefore believe this Bill cannot represent any winding down of the commitment of the Commonwealth. I am sure that we on this side of the chamber will be most vigilant to ensure that nothing like that occurs. I urge the Government to consider the crises which exist at the present time and in particular to keep a very vigilant observance of the obligations which the Liberal and Country Party governments have now accepted for a number of years to ensure that nothing that comes from this Bill, which is a variation of the system of legal aid, shall lead to any running down of the commitment which we have. I trust that the Attorney will in his reply avert to the situation in Victoria which concerns me very much and I also hope that we will see a continued success and an increase in the effective use of legal aid in this country. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sorry that the Opposition has seen fit to oppose entirely the Bill which seeks to replace the Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission with the Commonwealth Legal Aid Council. I thought from the tenor of the amendment to the second reading motion that the Opposition was attempting simply to put down on the record some of its concerns and its own policy in relation to this matter, but it is obvious from the speech by Senator Evans that the Opposition will oppose the Bill. However, I am heartened by the support of Senator Missen in this matter-I am sure he is speaking on behalf of honourable senators on this side of the chamber-and with that support I am confident the Bill will be given a second reading by the Senate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I will deal with the points that have been made by Senator Evans as quickly as I can because time is becoming somewhat limited for the debate on this measure. The Commonwealth does recognise that it has a continuing national responsibility in funding legal aid. It is, I think, perhaps a little unfair to describe the States in the language used in one limb of the amendment, but it is a fact that State contributions have not been very significant in this area. I would hope that with the State commissions that are being established the States will in due course will be able to contribute a little more than they have contributed so far. Of course the legal aid effort has varied between the States. Some States have provided significantly more than others and before the Legal Aid Commission was established they traditionally provided more legal aid than the Commonwealth. Broadly I think the picture now is that the Commonwealth has acquired a greater responsibility for funding legal aid than the States. </PARA>
<PARA> The structure that we now have to implement, that is, the establishment of State commissions as the bodies which will deliver the legal aid, is, I believe, a very proper one. I have spoken on this matter on other occasions. I believe it is not appropriate to have any Commonwealth department as a vehicle for the actual delivery of legal aid because of conflict of interest problems that emerge. It is better for legal aid to be delivered and to be administered as close to the clients as possible. That is one reason why I am particularly keen to encourage the development of community legal aid centres. I am very pleased that I have been able to get an ongoing program, small and all as it is. But the important thing is that it has been established. I hope that over the years ahead these bodies will grow and that there will be an ability on the part not only of the Commonwealth Government but also the State governments to provide funds for these bodies. I have no doubt that legal aid is better delivered, as I said, the closer one is to the client and to his problems. </PARA>
<PARA> The third point of Senator Evans's amendment, which I accept, is that the Commonwealth has a role to play in providing research and in generally evaluating the way in which legal aid is being delivered and the funding that is necessary. Of course, the Commonwealth's role is the vital role of providing the funds. The role of the Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission was set out in my second reading speech. The priorities which it adopted in this area and the functions that the advisory council will perform are broadly the ones that the Commission, of its own motion, has adopted in recent times. It may have had larger ideas about what it would do if the document that Senator Evans has incorporated was at any time the policy of the Commission. I do not know whether it was, but I do not dispute that the document was a genuine document emanating at some stage from the Commission. I would have just liked to know when it was and who prepared it, but Senator Evans has not been able to provide us with that information. Nevertheless, at some stage an expanded role was certainly entertained for the Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the Commission had come to accept a more realistic role. I referred in my second reading speech to the priorities which it established. I might say that that is the basic reason this Bill is before the Senate. We do not see in the long term a large bureaucratic body providing purely an administrative and co-ordinating role, which undoubtedly is a most expensive exercise and, in the view of the Government, an unnecessary exercise. I have had some calculations made as to what savings may be anticipated by the change from the Commission, with all the panoply that goes with these independent statutory commissions, to a more modest body such as the proposed legal aid council. I can speak to the estimates only in the broad at this stage as they have not yet been through the Budget process, but we expect a saving next year of approximately $450,000. The present Commission has a staff of 18. Of that 18 only three are lawyers. There are nine clerks and one clerical assistant, together with some steno-secretaries. Really, that shows the sort of thing that happens when these independent statutory bodies are set up with the structure of a commission. They become bloated administrative structures. That is the very thing we are trying to avoid. I might say that $450,000 might go quite a long way at present towards solving the problem in Victoria. I will come back to that in a moment--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, but I cannot say that at the moment. That is the trouble. We budget from year to year, as the honourable senator well knows. It is intended that research should be continue on a modest scale. It is certainly a role which I think the Commonwealth, as part of its responsibility, should maintain. The exercise that Senator Evans is interested in many-lawyers concerned with legal aid and I would be very interested in-is to evaluate the relative cost of providing legal aid by salaried officers as against the private profession will continue. It has already been assigned to Professor Meredith of the University of New England. The funds will continue to be provided for that purpose, and I have no doubt that other research projects will be embarked upon from time to time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The structure of the Commission has been mentioned. I have deliberately incorporated in the Bill broadly the same structure for the Council-that is, the representative nature of the council-as was provided for by the Commission. I do not favour-the Government agrees with this proposition-a situation in which one is bound to accept the one nominee of a body. I believe it is much more appropriate that names should be submitted and consultations should take place in relation to a person who is to represent that body's interests. But I can assure the Senate that it is my intention that the representatives of these various bodies would be concerned with the administration of legal aid. That is provided in the structure of the Council. I think I am entitled to expect the Senate to accept my bona fides in this because I am the person who set up the Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission. In addition to those who were actually nominated, I appointed to the first commission a representative from community legal aid centres and a professor of social work. At this stage I have not decided upon the final structure of the Commission but I think that the Senate might bear in mind that I have a record of appointing to the Commission people who are concerned broadly with legal aid and I have not confined the Commission simply to those representing the private legal profession. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that most of the matters, apart from the Victorian situation, have been mentioned. I have already made a commitment to the continuance of Commonwealth funding for legal aid. I note that Senator Evans has again said that this proposal spells the end or is what he describes as the first steps towards the Commonwealth's abandonment of responsibility for legal aid funding. I can only reiterate the commitments that the Government has entered into, which I have constantly stressed and which I stress again. In fact, the Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission does not provide the funds. The funds are provided through the Budget process by this Parliament. As responsible Minister my responsibility is to obtain those funds. There is no difference, in obtaining the funds, whether we have the existing Commission or an advisory council. There is absolutely no basis whatever for the proposition contained in the amendment that this is the first step to the Commonwealth's abandonment of responsibility for legal aid. </PARA>
<PARA> I did not wish to enter into a debate about the Victorian situation. It is really not relevant to the matter before the Senate. However, Senator Evans has referred to it and Senator Missen, in particular, requested that I mention it. As I have said when I have been asked questions about it, I am keeping the matter under close observation. It is one that causes me concern. It is unfortunate that the demand for legal aid is not always predictable, that with the best planning in the world-it is necessary to have strict planning and commitment levels, financial controls and so on-the actual demand does not always match one's predictions. Certainly it seems now that the demand for legal aid in Victoria and in Tasmania-a State whose needs should not be forgotten-has exceeded the forecasts. That is showing up at the end of the financial year in the problems that are now being experienced. Those problems are not new. They occurred several years ago, but not then in proportions quite as serious as those of the moment. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to give the Senate the figures on the provision of legal aid in both Victoria and Tasmania. When all is said and done, in the end it is a question of how much money can be found for the purpose. In 1979-80 expenditure on legal aid in Victoria totalled $4,845,000. For this year the estimated expenditure will be $6,534,000, which represents an increase of 33.84 per cent over the figure for 1979-80. For Tasmania the respective figures are $1,217,000 and $1,637,000, representing an increase for this year of 34.53 per cent. Thus there have been great increases in expenditure on legal aid in both States and it cannot be said, to use a favourite phrase of many people, in Victoria especially, that the Commonwealth is cutting back. </PARA>
<PARA> Certainly there is a problem in that unfortunately those who fall within the guidelines and whose cases render them eligible may not, because making provision for them would be outside the commitment budgeted, be the subject of a reference being made immediately. That is not to say that they will be denied legal aid; it has merely to be deferred. Of course urgent cases are not deferred. If a case should become urgent it will be reviewed. Unfortunately, the problem is compounded because the officers of the Australian Legal Aid Office have then to do a lot more administrative work. </PARA>
<PARA> The problem should not be seen in the light that 1,500 or so people are to be denied legal aid, or that the Victorian Legal Aid Commission will be landed with a deficit when it takes over. I hope that ways and means can be found to avoid that prospect happening and that no one whose case makes him eligible, even though a reference may be deferred, will be denied legal aid. Its granting may simply be delayed. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not in a position at this stage to say anything further about the Victorian situation except to assure the Senate that it is one which gives me great concern and which I hope we will be able to resolve in due course, without the Victorian Legal Aid Commission beginning its operations with a deficit. As I understand it now, the Commission will not begin to operate on 1 July. I do not know how many such deferments have taken place. The Commission has been set up for some time. Perhaps we would not have had quite such a problem now if the Commission had been in business. It would have been meeting only 80 per cent of the cost of fees, instead of the 90 per cent that must be met by the Australian Legal Aid Office-except in family law matters, in respect of which a special scale applies. Thus, if the Victorian Commission had been in business earlier savings could have been effected this year. Therefore, I am very anxious that the Commission should become operative as soon as possible. I do not want to see it begin its operations with a deficit.</PARA>
<PARA> I hope that the Senate will agree that this proposal is a sound one. It will not mean the abandonment or diminution of the Commonwealth's role in providing legal aid. I believe it will result in the saving of administrative costs and will prove a beneficial proposal. I hope that the Senate will agree to it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think there may be some substance in the broad criticism by Senator Evans in relation to these matters. If we look at the drafting of the functions of the Commonwealth Legal Aid Commission, I think we will find that there are a certain number of perhaps unnecessary words. The intention, I take it, is that the Commonwealth Legal Aid Council would have a very broad function. I think one ought to look at the first limb, proposed new section 5(a), at the question generally of the extent of the need for legal assistance and at the provision of very broad advice on the various means of satisfying that need. Under proposed new section 5(b) the Council will be concerned to advise on the amounts that perhaps the Commonwealth should be required to provide. The Council is concerned generally to report upon the effectiveness of the institutions that have been established for the delivery of legal aid. I think proposed new section 5(b)(i) deals with the advice as to the financial assistance by the Commonwealth and paragraph (ii), as I have said, deals with the effectiveness of the bodies that have been established. I have said that I hope there will be a variety of such bodies, that there will not simply be State legal aid commissions. As I interpret the meaning of the paragraphs, they concern the effectiveness of the role of those bodies and the methods by which the Commonwealth is assisting them. That is how I interpret the meaning.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to raise several matters. Before I do so, I express my concern that, at this late hour, we are embarking on a debate on legislation which, according to my quick calculations, involves about $452m. I think this action at this hour implies that the Government gives no consideration to the expenditure of taxpayers' money-the Government is asking senators to stand in this place and give proper attention to the expenditure of that amount-especially if it expects the Committee to go through the whole list of the departments that we have in front of us.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I turn now to the matters I want to raise. I am sorry that the President is not in the chamber because I have some questions I want to put to him which deal with the Joint House Department. They are matters that I have raised over the years in the Parliament particularly since we were told that security arrangements were to be introduced in this place. I expressed concern, both in the Parliament and as a member of the Senate House Committee when these new security arrangements were talked about, that some of the permanent employees of the Joint House Department might be disadvantaged by the change of attendants. I expressed concern that some attendants would be put into the security division and some would be put into other departments. When I came back on Monday of this week, it was drawn to my attention that some changes have been made. Temporary staff have now been appointed to grade 3 level and some staff who have been permanents here for quite a while have been superseded by temporary staff. I had hoped that Mr President would have been able to make a statement here tonight to clarify the situation. </PARA>
<PARA> I raise this matter under the expenditure for the Joint House Department which seeks an addition estimate of $130,000 to provide for salaries and payments in the nature of salaries and allowances. Also in Document A an additional estimate of $30,000 is shown for the introduction of new security procedures, and this is to be provided partially from the Advance to the Minister for Finance. That means that it was not provided for in the Budget Estimates and an additional amount now being sought under division 105 is an additional estimate of $38,000, but $2,000 of it is for expenses related to conduct of special security courses for the Joint House Department. </PARA>
<PARA> I am informed, reliably-I will not divulge my informant-that last Thursday the members of the Joint House Department were called together and told that certain new arrangements had been made, that certain temporary employees who were put on when the security arrangements were made were to be promoted to grade 3 over and above people who have served in the Parliament for quite a number of years. I am also concerned about statements-this is what I wanted Mr President to verify-that if anybody who attended that meeting spoke to a member of parliament about what was taking place, he or she could expect some dire circumstances. As a member of parliament, I am very concerned about that matter. I think Mr President, the Presiding Officer who is responsible, should have made a statement on the matter in the Senate today. I hoped that he would be here tonight to make such a statement. I well recall on 14 September 1978 raising a matter concerning Parliament House security. Mr President, in answer to me, said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . this is a matter for . . . Presiding Officers to determine. </PARA>
<PARA>Having served on the Joint House Committee for a number of years, I am well aware of that fact. I am not a member of the Committee now, but the way things are going, I might seek nomination to serve on it again in order to be kept up to date on what the Joint House Department is doing. As you would know, Mr Chairman, the last time we talked about the Parliament in the Senate I put the proposition that the minutes of the Joint House Committee ought to be tabled in the Parliament so that every member of parliament would be aware of the activities of the Joint House Department and the decisions made by it. That request has not been acceded to. I do not know where to go from here because Mr President is not in the Senate. I can ask-I hope that the Government will agree-for a postponement of the consideration of the estimates for the Parliament until Mr President can be present to give the Parliament an answer as to what the new circumstances are in relation to the promotion of temporary officers above permanent officers who have served the Parliament loyally and are now being overlooked and who, as I have said, are under some threat that if they speak to their union or to a member of parliament they can expect some recriminations. I take great offence at statements such as that. I think I am reliably informed. I would like to hear Mr President's version of the matter. For that reason I ask the Committee to postpone its deliberations on the appropriations for the Parliament. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GM7">Senator MULVIHILL</NAME><ELECTORATE>(New South Wales)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(10.43)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to make some remarks concerning the Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Industrial Relations. I refer to an announcement by Sir John Moore, the President of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commision, about the duties of people in the aribtration structure. He said that he would handle industrial matters involving the North West Shelf. I appreciate, as everyone does, Sir John Moore's high standard of industrial mediation but I see a conflict arising between the Western Australian awards and the Federal awards. I have directed numerous questions to the Attorney-General, Senator Durack, about the joint dialogue that was necessary to overcome some of the problems concerning the Kurnell oil refinery where, in the main, oil refinery operators belonged to the Australian Workers Union and were covered by a State award. I wish to ascertain from the Minister in the light of Sir John Moore's announcement-nobody cavils at his ability-what relations we anticipate having with the Western Australian Industrial Commission. The Western Australian industrial relations Minister seems to be a remarkable person from what we read in the eastern States newspapers of his extremely provocative remarks. I do not question the capacity of Sir John Moore, but it does not help matters to have maverick industrial relations Ministers at the State level. That is the first matter about which I wish to receive information.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second matter I wish to raise relates also to industrial relations and is linked with the Attorney-General's Department. I refer to the accessability of Commonwealth parliamentarians to Conciliation and Arbitration Commission judgments in general. Early in the piece I found it was difficult to gain access to these judgments, but I would pay tribute to the Arbitration Commission officers in Melbourne for providing for a speedy transmission of awards to me since then. However, an unusual situation has arisen in that it is necessary sometimes for unions or employers involved in some industrial disputes to go to courts in other jurisdictions. I refer to a very difficult case that has arisen in the port of Sydney. It is really an internal dispute within the Federated Clerks Union about the rights of tally clerks to elect vigilant officers of their choice. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GM7">Senator MULVIHILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am an industrial Diogenes here tonight. I am after the truth. Perhaps a Minister can give me the information. This case has gone outside the arbitration jurisdiction to the extent that another court is determining whether a rule is tyrannical. I want to know whether we have the same accessability to the judgment that will be brought down next week in the other court. It will have some bearing on trade union litigation concerning rank and file rights. I will not say any more, but it is a fascinating exercise. I will read avidly the judgment when it comes down.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The other matter I wish to raise deals with industrial safety. As far as I can recall, after the current Fraser Ministry was formed, some industrial safety matters were handed to Mr Thomson, the Minister for Science and Technology. Honourable senators know that I have raised matters relating to the role of the Commonwealth Government in industrial safety on a number of occasions, particularly at the behest of the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemens Association. In correspondence with the new Government the then Minister for Industrial Relations, the Hon. Andrew Peacock, sent me a letter in which he said that he felt basically that some responsibility rested with the Minister for Science and Technology, Mr Thomson. Since then there have been numerous articles about a massive number of days being lost each year because of industrial accidents. </PARA>
<PARA> I am somewhat befuddled as to just what role industrial relations fulfils in this matter. A nice brochure has been put out by the Industrial Relations Bureau about its operations. I have never been one to be overcome by statistics; I like to see the actual performances on the field. Industrial safety is a very important matter. I want to know something about that matter. The brochure of the IRB states that everyone is able to find out his rights. I want to know more about the duties of industrial relations inspectors. I think that they are a component of the IRB. There is a pattern to industrial operations. Many new, small industries are not always properly organised. There can be a grey area between unions as to the coverage of these industries. I am directing my remarks at what I consider to be considerable exploitation of migrant women in the small laboratories in Sydney and, I think, Melbourne to which hospitals farm out specimens for analysis. This is semi-skilled work. At present the New South Wales Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Hills, is conducting an investigation into one of them, but I am far from happy. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe there should be a joint approach. When we deal with the IRB the optimum situation that we should be seeking to achieve is that the inspectors in the field visit an establishment at least once every 12 months. I say that advisedly. I doubt that in some areas they visit an establishment once in two years. We all know quite well that probably on the waterfront, in a foundry, the coal mines or a railway marshalling yard the workers would be well organised, they would not need the IRB. It is largely the lower paid workers I mentioned who are not unionised that I am concerned about. I would like to get specific figures as to when these visits occur. I would also like to know what liaison there is with the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs generally. There is some feedback from these areas, and I understand that there are still language difficulties. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter I wish to raise again deals with what I call industrial-cum-ethnic affairs problems. I did refer in the Senate a couple of years ago to the difficulties that trade unions found with a varied three shift operation. I am speaking of the Federated Rubber and Allied Workers Union of Australia and the need for interpreters in particular languages. I say this advisedly. It may be argued from within the ranks of the union that there are people fluent in a particular tongue. But it has been proved, and we might as well face up to it some time, that in any organisation factions are inevitable. If interpreter A speaks-he may represent the views of the paid officials-some of the members might feel that he is perhaps only putting a point of view. Conversely, another minority group can get an interpreter and he can colour matters. In the industry that I am thinking about, the rubber industry, it has been proved that if there is an impartial interpreter, there is more likely to be a sense of objectivity when the various industrial points are put in a series of different languages. </PARA>
<PARA> This is an area in which I am interested. It may be said of course that the New South Wales ethnic commission, or its equivalent body, is providing interpreters in some instances, but a fee is charged. Quite frankly, I know that there are arguments that there is no such thing as a free lunch. But if we are placing an emphasis on industrial harmony, I still believe the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, in conjunction with the Department of Industrial Relations, should provide these interpreters without charge. Obviously their capacity to defuse a mass meeting of 700 or 800 people can shorten a stoppage by three or perhaps five days. I put that particular matter to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Senator Peter Baume) who is at the table. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn now to the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs. I understand that this Department broadly covers Customs matters. I refer to the export of wildlife. The Senate will know that I did raise a series of questions about the condition in which Australian wildlife is accepted at foreign zoos. The Lone Pine animal sanctuary in Queensland exported some kangaroos to the zoo at Rio de Janeiro. This incident is indicative of how stupid the people in the zoo were. They applied some particular brand of paint in the area. The kangaroos apprently licked the paint and there was a complete extermination of the six kangaroos. I put a question on notice about the incident. I asked whether the Government, in accord with the formula given previously, would put a permanent ban on the export of any Australian wildlife to that particular zoo in Brazil and, for that matter, whether it would ban exports to an area where there was a fatality and there was no adequate reason given for the particular death. That is the other matter on which I want information. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr Chairman, if I might intervene, I understand that Senator McLaren's question was for Mr President, who has now been able to come into the chamber. I understand that the question concerns some problems with the promotion procedures in the Joint House Department in relation to certain officers associated with security. Senator McLaren had some concerns about the promotion procedures. I think his main concern-I say this for Mr President's edification-is that Senator McLaren believed that there were some threats made against these officers if they spoke to their unions or to the Press about a meeting which took place last week. I think I have paraphrased the question properly.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA> Senator Mulvihill raised a number of points, some of which I think I can answer at this stage. The last matter he raised concerned the export of certain animals. That is something we will have to take on notice and refer to the Minister. I think it is a fairly detailed matter. The point he makes is one that we appreciate. I think we would want to ensure that adverse conditions would not arise which would harm Australian animals exported for foreign zoos. We will draw the attention of the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs (Mr Moore) to the situation Senator Mulvihill has set out and ask that that be looked at. </PARA>
<PARA> Senator Mulvihill also asked some other questions. The answer to the first matter the honourable senator raised is that Commonwealth and State Ministers for labour meet regularly. They can clarify the appropriate handling of major resource development projects which clearly involve Commonwealth and State interests. That would include things like the North West Shelf. There is no difficulty with that matter. I think that clears up the point raised by the honourable senator. The honourable senator also raised a matter in respect of the Federated Clerks Union of Australia. I took on board what he said. I do not think these points require a particular response. The honourable senator raised another matter which concerned industrial safety. He observed that certain functions following the Review of Commonwealth Functions had been transferred from the Department of Science and Technology, which had taken on certain productivity functions, to the Department of Industrial Relations. The details are subject to a detailed review which is currently taking place. Therefore, the detailed answers as to what the arrangements are going to be may still need to be finalised-we will have to come back to the honourable senator with that. I must say that the National Labour Consultative Council will maintain continuing discussions and considerations of occupational health and safety matters, certainly at a policy level. I hope that covers some of the matters raised by Senator Mulvihill. I now defer to Mr President. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Minister for Aboriginal Affairs) (10.59)-Perhaps I could answer two questions which were raised by Senator Mulvihill. The first concerns the Industrial Relations Bureau. I note that some figures are given at page 53 of the Hansard of Estimates Committee A which are germane to the matter raised by Senator Mulvihill. There has been some improvement recently in the performance of the Bureau as regards the inspections that it has been able to undertake. The honourable senator commented on the exploitation of migrant women and other disadvantaged groups.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I note the honourable senator's comment. The honourable senator's request for statistics of the Bureau's work and its contacts with the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs will be referred to the director of the Bureau. We will need to get some more detailed information for the honourable senator on that point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Senator Mulvihill also asked a question about the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. It is sensitive to the problems which can arise as a result of lack of communication through language difficulties. This area is of interest to the honourable senator. There are members on the staff of the industrial registry who can speak more than one language and who can be relied upon if necessary, particularly in relation to counter contacts and telephone inquiries. </PARA>
<PARA> The registry is aware of the interpreter service provided by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. The interpreter service provides interpreters in almost any language at very short notice. Recently Commissioner Walker in Melbourne required the service of interpreters in several languages. The proceedings were important as the rights of individuals were at stake. Interpreters were provided from the registry and the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. I think that is a useful example. The registry is currently investigating the feasibility of installing a dual hand set telephone which can be used to obtain a translation service when a language other than English is spoken. This facility could be used to deal with multi-language inquiries relating to awards and award rates as well as other inquiries relating to the business of the Office of the Industrial Registrar. I hope that supplies some information for the honourable senator. </PARA>

Mrs Cleary will be in Canberra tomorrow. I took Mrs Cleary and several other women in a delegation to see the then Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, Mr Fife. Tomorrow petitions will be presented asking what happened regarding the matter. I do not expect the Minister to answer that question now.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to add to the information that Senator McLaren gave regarding seniority and promotion not being a subject which comes before the Joint House Committee. As the Joint House Committee is regarded in the Senate as being a body which looks after the housekeeping of this place, I think that the matters that Senator McLaren raised should come before the Joint House Committee for its consideration. I am aware that on occasions when I have suggested to the Joint House Committee that it take a stand on the matter, Presiding Officers have informed us that we have no power over the Joint House Committee, that giving us information is a question of courtesy and the Committee cannot make any binding decisions. In raising the matter of questions of seniority and promotion not coming before us, I raise again for the President's consideration my belief that the Joint House Committee should be able to make binding statements on matters as far as the Senate is concerned. I do not believe that it is worth spending time on a committee if the only motions that can come out of it are those of advice or suggestion. I think that the Joint House Committee, as a housekeeping committee of this Parliament, should be able to make decisions on how the Parliament and the various areas of departments are run. Those decisions should be binding. I suggest that the President might look at that matter to see whether something can be done to make the Joint House Committee a real committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I also wish to refer to something in the Joint House area that has worried me over the last two or three months. We have an information desk out at King's Hall and women work at that desk only between 1 p.m. and 6 p.m. We are supposed to be encouraging tourists to come to Canberra. Tourists come into this building before 9 o'clock in the morning and I dare say that if honourable senators went out into King's Hall now, they might even find some tourists still around. Almost every time I have crossed King's Hall in the last two and a half months, I have been accosted by females who, behind their hands, have said to me, 'Can you tell me where the ladies convenience is?' I have pointed out its location to them. These females have asked a woman this question because they do not like to ask the male attendants. I recall that during the first week I was on the Joint House Committee-this is seven years ago-this matter was raised. We suggested that there be female attendants in Parliament House and/or that we have a female staff member in King's Hall as long as Parliament House is open so that women coming into this place can ask another woman personal questions. I suggest again that this matter be dealt with, this time on a permanent basis. </PARA>

I am somewhat surprised that the situation is now back to what it was last year when I raised the matter of the information box being staffed by male personnel. I think I took the matter up with Mr President. I thought the matter was rectified and that female attendants had been put back in the box. I am rather surprised to hear Senator Melzer say that that is not so now and that there are only male attendants working in it. I was a member of the Joint House Committee at the time the information box was first put in King's Hall. The sole purpose was to have a female attendant to help women and children in distress.

<PARA> The report read as follows-</PARA>
<PARA>ESTIMATES COMMITTEE A</PARA>
<PARA> REPORT TO THE SENATE</PARA>
<PARA> Estimates Committee A has the honour to report to the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA> 1. On 2 April 1981, the Senate referred to the Committee the Additional Estimates for the year 1980-81 relating to the following Departments:</PARA>
<PARA> Parliament</PARA>
<PARA> Attorney-General's</PARA>
<PARA> Industrial Relations</PARA>
<PARA> Business and Consumer Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA> 2. The Committee has considered these Additional Estimates, together with the Departmental Explanatory Notes, and has received evidence in relation to them from the Chairman of Committees, Senator Maunsell, the Attorney-General, Senator Durack, and officers of the Departments concerned. Copies of the Minutes of Proceedings and Hansard reports of the evidence taken by the Committee are tabled for the information of the Senate in connection with Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1980-81 and Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1980-81. Answers to questions which were deferred and subsequently given in writing since the Committee's last hearings will be tabled in the Senate and incorporated in the final Hansard report of the Committee's hearings. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. The Committee draws the attention of the Senate to the following matters arising from its consideration of the Additional Estimates:</PARA>
<PARA>ATTORNEY-GENERAL'S DEPARTMENT</PARA>
<PARA>(a) Counsel's Fees</PARA>
<PARA> On 18 September 1980, the Senate adopted a report of the Committee of the Whole which included a resolution affirming:</PARA>
<PARA> that the right to privacy of individual counsel accepting a brief on behalf of the Commonwealth for which money is appropriated by Parliament is supervened by such acceptance, subject to the reasons for the information being clearly defined and to the proviso that injudicious or unwarranted invasion of privacy is not the intention of the Parliament or its Committees. </PARA>
<PARA> During debate on the Report of Estimates Committee B which gave rise to the affirmation, the Attorney-General indicated in the Senate his reservations concerning the desirability of releasing such information. </PARA>
<PARA> This question was again raised during the Committee's most recent hearings. The Attorney-General advised the Committee that he had received representations from Counsel, and from the President of the Bar Council of New South Wales supporting the representations made, concerning the implications of the Committee's request for details of individual counsel's fees. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee, having considered the matter further at a private meeting, concluded that for the purposes of this hearing it must, under the terms of the Senate resolution, continue the established practice. It emphasises the point made in its last Report that, in each case where the information was sought, the specific reason for seeking such information was clearly defined, and that injudicious or unwarranted invasion of privacy was not the Committee's intention or practice. </PARA>
<PARA> However, in view of the concern expressed, the Committee has written to the President of the New South Wales Council inviting him to make a submission to the Committee expanding upon the reasons for the Council's objections to the attitude the Committee has taken. Should the Council put forward a compelling case in support of its objections, the Committee could raise the matter for the further consideration of the Senate. In the meantime, the Committee intends to continue the current practice which applies to all consultants and others providing professional services paid for from public moneys. </PARA>
<PARA> The decision of the Committee was conveyed to the Attorney-General, who provided the Committee with the outstanding information which had been sought at the public hearings on 27 April 1981. </PARA>
<PARA>(b) Payments to Judges</PARA>
<PARA> A recurring theme in Estimates Committees' examination of the proposed appropriations for the Attorney-General's Department has been the making of certain payments to judges without legislative authority. The objections raised over a long period were finally met by the passage of appropriate legislation through the Parliament in 1979. </PARA>
<PARA> The Additional Estimates for 1980-81, however, revealed that a total of $154,400 had been paid through the Advance to the Minister for Finance to certain Australian judges of the Supreme Court of Justice of Papua New Guinea. It was explained to the Committee that the payments had been made in fulfilment of a long-standing agreement made between the Attorney-General and the judges concerned, at the time when independence was taking place and before the question of legislative backing for such payments was finally determined within Australia. Legislative provision for this agreement was made in Papua New Guinea and upon a basis that Australia would pay any amount not paid by the Government of Papua New Guinea. </PARA>
<PARA> It appears to the Committee, following consideration of explanations provided at the hearing, that there is an identifiable difference in principle between payments made without Australian legislative authority in this instance, on the one hand, and payments made to judges within Australia without such authority, on the other. The major difference perceived by the Committee is that the payments made to the judges serving in Papua New Guinea were a form of international aid for which Australia has assumed a responsibility to make payments. This is in contrast to the principle which the Committee has sought to uphold-that the financial arrangements between the government and judiciary of a country should be totally known and made public within that country, to avoid the possibility of a government influencing a judiciary by offering private terms. </PARA>
<PARA>DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS</PARA>
<PARA>Industrial Relations Bureau</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee noted that the Industrial Relations Bureau had been able to absorb all National Wage and work value costs within its existing appropriation for staffing. The Director of the Bureau explained that this had been achieved because certain separations and retirements allowed for in the original estimates had not eventuated. The Committee notes that as a result of the Committee's report to the Senate in September 1980 and the Senate resolutions of 18 September and 4 December 1980, the Department of Finance is conducting an investigation into the Bureau. We await with interest the report of the Department of Finance, which is expected to be tabled shortly, on the financial management of the Bureau. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee also identified two problems experienced by the Bureau in relation to telecommunications costs. The first concerned the Bureau's seeking an increase in Estimates flowing from two-monthly billing in lieu of quarterly billing by Telecom. This problem did not appear to have occurred within other departments examined by the Committee. The second related to the cost of a Telecom installation within the Bureau, which was seriously underestimated at the time the original estimates were prepared. It was not clear to the Committee whether the miscalculation had occurred as the result of inadequate technical advice or of uncertainty as to the requirements of the Bureau. The Committee suggests, however, that both matters might be taken up by the Committee responsible for examining the Telecom and Industrial Relations Bureau Estimates during the Budget Sittings. </PARA>
<PARA>General Comments</PARA>
<PARA>Departmental Hire Car Charges</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee noted, in the course of its hearings, the dependency of all departments and authorities upon the purchasing and hiring practices of the Department of Administrative Services in relation to the provision of cars. For example, following its examination of the Estimates of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs-a substantial full-time user of Commonwealth vehicles with a hiring cost to the Department of more than $1 million annually-the Committee concluded that, with the average cost of hire cars being approximately $4,000 per year, and bearing in mind the sales tax exempt discount buying facility available to the Commonwealth, the Department of Administrative Services must be receiving almost the full purchase price of the average vehicle in annual hiring charges. Officers of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs informed the Committee that the vehicles used by the Department were replaced every 2 to 3 years. Thus, prima facie, the Department of Administrative Services appears to be charging more than double the new-car price over the life of a hire-car. </PARA>
<PARA> It was further ascertained that the hire charges were increased in November, with retrospective application to 1 July, and that hapless departments and authorities, with no recourse to other measures such as purchasing their own vehicles, had no alternative but to seek additional estimates or absorb the increased costs. </PARA>
<PARA> Estimates Committee B has had occasion in the past to query the high level of hire car charges made by the Department of Administrative Services, and this Committee again draws to the attention of the Senate and the relevant Estimates Committee these latest examples which, in the Committee's view, require further examination. </PARA>
<PARA>Departmental Explanatory Notes</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee has commented in previous reports on the gradual evolution of Explanatory Notes so that, with some exceptions, departments and authorities are now providing the Committees with invaluable information in a readily-understood form. In the course of the Committee's current examination of the Estimates, two suggestions were made for the improvement of the standardised format, which the Committee commends to the Senate and the Department of Finance for consideration. The first relates to the provision of details of the variation between moneys provided under Appropriation Acts Nos 1 and 2, and the amounts proposed in Bills Nos 3 and 4. The Committee considers that the insertion of such a breakdown in each item would greatly assist in the evaluation of the amounts sought. Secondly, the Committee considers that confusion might be avoided if the headings of the dissection of each item were designated 'Revised' rather than 'Additional' Estimates, or, alternatively, followed the same headings as those used in the general breakdown of the items. </PARA>
<PARA>Estimates Committee Hearings</PARA>
<PARA>Some discontent was expressed by members of the Committee concerning the circumstances surrounding the holding of the meeting of Estimates Committee A. It was pointed out that, as a consequence of both the airline strike and decisions made in relation to the Committee's hearings, the opportunities for preparation for the meeting were less than adequate. </PARA>
<PARA> The Committee was pleased to note, however, the beneficial effects of having a full-time research officer available to it. While, for the reasons mentioned, the Committee was not able to take full advantage of the increased service provided, the Committee has no doubt that its capacity for more effective examination of Estimates at future hearings will be greatly enhanced. </PARA>
<PARA> In conclusion, the Committee expresses its appreciation of the assistance given by the Chairman of Committees, the Attorney-General and the officers of the various Departments who assisted the Committee. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Chairman of Estimates Committee B I tabled the Committee's report in the Senate a couple of weeks ago. It is an unusually long report for a report on the supplementary Estimates and there are a number of recommendations in the report relating to different departments. It is my intention to confine what comment I shall make this evening to the departments in the order in which they appear on our list, namely, Department of Education, Department of Communications and the Department of Home Affairs and Environment. It is not my intention to make any comment on estimates in relation to the Department of Education, so initially I shall be making comment on some items relating to the Department of Communications. However, there are a number of recommendations in the report that certain matters go to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations. They affect both the Department of Communications and the Department of Home Affairs and Environment. I intend to move one motion relating to both departments and picking up those recommendations, even though initially I shall comment only in relation to the Department of Communications. This motion will be voted on at the end of the debate. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Committee, having considered the Report of Estimates Committee B, refers the following matters to the Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations for examination and report:</PARA>
<PARA>(A) the First Annual Report of the Special Broadcasting Service for the period 1 January 1978 to 30 June 1979;</PARA>
<PARA>(B) the Second Annual Report of the Special Broadcasting Service for the period 1 July 1979 to 30 June 1980;</PARA>
<PARA>(C) instances where Departments and Authorities may have breached statutory reporting requirements; and</PARA>
<PARA>(D) the matter of financial assistance for the exhibition tour of the United States of America by the speedboat 'Spirit of Australia'. </PARA>
<PARA>The Committee has recommended that the Finance and Government Operations Committee examine instances where deparments and statutory authorities may have breached statutory reporting requirements. Estimates Committee B in its brief research has come across a number of reports the tabling of which would appear to be inconsistent with the intention and spirit of the Acts under which the bodies were set up. Each instance involves the first annual report of a statutory authority. Either the reports have been very late in tabling or it would appear that the provisions of the Act have not been complied with. </PARA>
<PARA> The first annual report of a statutory or other body is probably the most important annual report presented to Parliament for its perusal. Parliament should be aware of how each authority is progressing in its early stages, and of any teething problems that are occurring. It should be aware of the direction in which such bodies are moving, and so on. In many respects, I think it is a mistake for an authority to wait until it gets its act together before reporting to the Senate. The Special Broadcasting Service surely is an obvious example of the principle that newly established bodies should present their first annual report, or at least an interim report, to Parliament at the earliest opportunity. However, notwithstanding all that, there is no excuse for a statutory authority not reporting to Parliament when its Act requires it to do so. </PARA>
<PARA> In the progress of investigations of supplementary estimates for the Department of Communications, questions were raised about the tabling of the report for 1979-80 of the Special Broadcasting Service. There followed a great deal of highly confusing evidence. We were given some evidence by the witnesses appearing before us that the reason why the report to 30 June 1980 had not then been tabled in the Senate-I add as an aside that it was tabled in the last week when we sat-was that the report was for a period of 18 months and therefore some difficulties in reporting were involved. That reply led to a series of questions about the requirements for reporting under the Broadcasting and Television Act. We did not receive satisfactory replies, and the Committee left the matter at the stage where the Act was to be checked. Because that was a day on which transport arrangements to Canberra were affected by the air hostesses strike, the Committee agreed to suspend consideration of those estimates. </PARA>
<PARA> Subsequently, the witnesses came back to the Estimates Committee when it resumed consideration of the same item of expenditure. The Committee was informed that the evidence it had been given earlier in the day was not correct, that in fact the report to 30 June 1980 was not for a period of 18 months but for a period of 12 months, and that the report had not been tabled in Parliament because of printing difficulties. That is a matter we can come to later, and it is a matter that in any event we have referred to the Finance and Government Operations Committee for an exhaustive inquiry. We were informed that the 18-months report was for the period 1 January 1978 to 30 June 1979. </PARA>
<PARA> Then ensued some highly confusing evidence. The Committee, I think, understood that it was talking about the period 1 January 1978 to 30 June 1979. However, not all the witnesses from the Special Broadcasting Service understood that. If honourable senators refer to the evidence on this they will find it confusing because they will find that from page 144 on of the Senate Estimates Hansard for 27 April 1981 Mr Fowell was talking about a report from 1 January 1978 to 30 June 1979 and the other SBS witness, Mr Stokes, had his dates confused. So the evidence is difficult to follow in the sense that two of the witnesses were at odds about the dates we were actually talking about. In the process, understandably, they also confused the Minister who was with us at that time, and that does not assist the reading of the evidence. One could not blame the Minister because he had not been present at the Committee earlier in the day when we started on this. Nevertheless, an undertaking was given to provide an answer to the Committee on why there was no report to Parliament for the period to 30 June 1978. The first report should have been for the period 1 January 1978 to 30 June 1978. In the course of evidence witnesses told us repeatedly that the SBS had not reported for its initial six-month period in accordance with the requirements of an Act of parliament because of the then Minister. On page 141 Mr Stokes used these words:</PARA>
<PARA> This was done by agreement with the Minister . . . </PARA>
<PARA>On the same page this question was asked:</PARA>
<PARA> Were you not required to report publicly by 30 June 1979?</PARA>
<PARA>There was still some confusion at that stage about whether it was June 1978 or June 1979. It should have been the 1978 report. The answer was:</PARA>
<PARA> With dispensation from the Minister we did not do so. </PARA>
<PARA>The Chairman then asked:</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister has the power to dispense with the report?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Stokes replied:</PARA>
<PARA> We took the advice from the Minister. </PARA>
<PARA>In evidence later that day, as recorded at page 145 of the Hansard, the Committee was told:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the first annual report by decision of the Minister was one which covered that first six-monthly period . . . and then the full financial year 1978-79. </PARA>
<PARA>On four instances we were told that a Minister of the Crown was responsible for this statutory authority not complying with an Act of parliament. As I have indicated earlier, witnesses undertook to give written evidence to the Committee that the Minister was responsible for their not reporting. I refer the chamber to evidence which has already been tabled on a letterhead from the Department of Communications dated 8 May 1981 addressed to the Secretary of Estimates Committee B. The reference is 'Department of Communications-Additional Estimates 1980-81'. This statement is contained in information from the Acting Assistant Secretary of the Management Services Branch of the Department of Communications:</PARA>
<PARA> The Special Broadcasting Service has advised that it is not apparent why a report for the period to 30 June 1978 was not submitted after the expiration of that period. </PARA>
<PARA>That, of course, is in contradiction to firm evidence we were given on four occasions. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA> It is believed this may have been due to the unsettled staffing and heavy load during the initial formation stages of the Special Broadcasting Service. SBS records indicate that in August 1979 the matter was raised with the Minister who agreed that, in view of the relatively brief period of activity to 30 June 1978 it would be desirable to report on this period concurrently with the report for the financial year 1978-79. </PARA>
<PARA>It is not appropriate or even desirable that we should exhaustively try to get out the evidence which was promised but which was not provided to the Estimates Committee. The motion I have moved provides for this matter to be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations. It will be able to examine the evidence given to the Committee both orally and in writing. I point out these matters to the Committee as an indication of what I think is an extremely serious matter-an allegation that a Minister of the Crown could advise officers that they did not have to bother complying with an Act of Parliament. As an aside, I would like to draw attention to another letter from the Department of Communications, signed by E. E. Payne, Deputy Secretary and dated 14 May 1981. It is addressed to the Secretary of Estimates Committee B. Apparently exception is taken to the fact that in my tabling statement I referred to evidence from departmental officers instead of officers of a statutory corporation. It refers also to other evidence given by other departments. The statement concerned says:</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Communications did not give any evidence or comment to the Committee on that matter. </PARA>
<PARA>I will accept that strictly speaking they were not officers from the Department of Communications but were Special Broadcasting Service officers. Nevertheless, I point out to the Senate that all the supplementary information we have been given has come under the Department of Communications letterhead, so clearly it has a responsibility for providing evidence. I do not know what the purpose of that letter is or why it would have come to Estimates Committee B. It looks a little as though somebody is trying to slide out from under, but whatever the reason I do not think it is very important at this stage. That is another point that the Finance and Government Operations Committee can take up if it chooses because it is a matter to which it has addressed itself in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> In regard to the annual report of the Special Broadcasting Service for the period from 1 July 1979 to 30 June 1980, by recommendation we will send that off to the Finance and Government Operations Committee. On 27 April we asked questions as to why this report, to 30 June last year, had not yet been tabled. We were not satisfied with the answers we were given. We asked for supplementary information and this has been given. An outline has been made of the reasons why the report had not then gone even to the Minister. Ten months after the end of the financial year the report had not gone to the Minister although there was evidence before the Committee that the Auditor-General had approved the accounts in January of this year. On 16 January 1981 the Auditor-General provided the necessary certificate but three months later the report still had not been printed and had not gone to the Minister, which does not speak very highly for the responsibility that the Special Broadcasting Service may feel it holds to Ministers. I would like to draw the attention of the Senate briefly to a comment in this report, which was tabled in the Senate two weeks ago. </PARA>

I note, therefore, that Estimates Committee B has reported with certain recommendations and that Senator Martin has moved that these matters be referred to the Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations for further investigation. I simply indicate that I believe it is consistent with Senate practice for the Senate to accede to that so that the matters may be further investigated in whatever way the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations deems appropriate, having accepted a reference, first from the Estimates committee to the Senate and then from the Senate to the Standing Committee.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is late at night. My notes are less than adequate but I have a couple of comments about one or two matters arising from Estimates Committee B. Senator Martin has dealt with some of them in some detail but, perhaps, in a characteristically nicer way than I would like to deal with them. The first matter concerns the section of the report of Estimates Committee B relating to the Special Broadcasting Service. Totally unsatisfactory evidence was given to the Committee by representatives of the Special Broadcasting Service, particularly in relation to the over-expenditure which the SBS has apparently indulged in and which, in part, was a matter for comment by the Auditor-General.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I suppose that it is in order to relate my remarks in part to issues involving the SBS which were not fully canvassed at the Estimates Committee hearing. The whole of the evidence presented a saga of chaos which is not very encouraging or optimistic for the future of ethnic broadcasting in Australia. The suspicion must emerge very strongly that Mr Bruce Gyngell who was responsible for buying films on a European trip for the proposed Independent and Multicultural Broadcasting Corporation may have been responsible for some of that exorbitant expenditure. Of course, it is widely rumoured at present that Mr Gyngell is to be appointed as a member of the SBS after he has publicly announced that he will go in to a film investment company which will be a private concern of his own. I raise that question because, in view of the Estimates and the evidence given to the Estimates Committee by the SBS, one must have grave doubt about the financial propriety of that organisation, and even greater concern about its financial propriety in the future if someone such as Mr Bruce Gyngell-a person whose creative talents, though not financial skills, I greatly admire-is to be appointed to it. </PARA>
<PARA> Another matter relating to communications was the question of the legal fees paid in respect of hearings before the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal in regard to the application by News Corporation Ltd and associated companies for the licence of Channel 10 in Melbourne. According to the Estimates, Mr Tom Hughes, Q.C. was paid an amount of $7,815 and his junior counsel was paid in excess of $3,000 for an appearance before the High Court when the Labor Party, which was the plaintiff in that action took that matter, and the conduct of the Broadcasting Tribunal therein, to that court. Subsequently Mr Hughes appeared as counsel assisting the Broadcasting Tribunal in a somewhat lengthy hearing in Melbourne. The purpose of that hearing was to determine whether the Murdoch News Corporation was an appropriate licensee of Channel 10 in Melbourne. During the course of the inquiry much information about the nature of Channel 10, as it then was, and of News Corporation's wishes in relation to Channel 10, was tendered. Mr Hughes, as counsel assisting the Tribunal in that matter, was of course privy to that information and to conferences with witnesses who appeared before the Tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA> I find it extraordinary that the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, having rejected the application for a licence and the applicant having appealed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, Tom Hughes also should pop up in the appeal-an appeal from a decision in respect of which he assisted the Tribunal in the earlier hearing. In one matter he appeared for the purpose of assisting the Broadcasting Tribunal, yet when an appeal was lodged against the decision of the Tribunal he appeared for the purpose of arguing against it. I am very old-fashioned. I am a Victorian and Mr Hughes comes from the New South Wales Bar, but I find it absolutely extraordinary that a person can earn, as he did, $18,000 in assisting the Broadcasting Tribunal arrive at a decision and then, when someone appeals against that decision, can appear for one of the parties which seeks to overturn it. I hesitate to use words such as 'ethics' or in this case 'absence of ethics' but that is what I am talking about. It is an extraordinary situation which I would hope no tribunal financed and established by this Government and this Parliament would countenance. I only hope that Mr Hughes did not learn that sort of behaviour here, as a parliamentarian. That he should carry it on in the Sydney Bar is a disgrace. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to refer to two other matters. The first relates to the estimates of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. I mention those estimates in this context: Officials from the Australian Broadcasting Commission told the Estimates Committee of their concern about the buildings which the ABC occupies. Their concern was expressed in terms of a multiplicity of locations, especially in areas such as Sydney. The report of the Review of Commonwealth Functions, the so-called razor gang report, came out with the fascinating statement that the Australian Broadcasting Commission should take steps as part of government cost saving measures to rationalise its buildings facilities-to rationalise the location of its building facilities particularly in Sydney, one would imagine, because that is where the least rationalisation exists. </PARA>
<PARA> The Estimates Committee was informed of this. It was told last year that the Australian Broadcasting Commission was in this difficulty with its buildings. The last three reports of the Commission have stated that it was concerned that its building facilities should be rationalised. In each report it has said to the Government: 'We cannot do that unless you provide us with the money to do it'. Then we had this extraordinarily incompetent report of the so-called razor gang which states, bald faced, as it were, that the ABC should rationalise its building facilities as a cost saving measure. That is an absurd piece of material that came before the Estimates Committee. More particularly, it illustrates the absurdity of the ministerial review committee on Commonwealth Government functions. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I express my concern about a gentleman called Mr Warby. I think that Senator Martin has mentioned something about him. This matter relates to the estimates for the Department of Home Affairs and Environment. Mr Warby is a member of the National Australia Day Committee, a position to which, I suppose, he was appointed because of his transparent virtues. If he has transparent virtues, they are not in the area of finance because Mr Warby also has a motor boat of some kind-I have not been informed about the technical details-which he has been showing around the United States of America. As I recall it, he has now received the benefit of the best part of $200,000 from this Government in order to promote that speed boat around the United States. Senator Martin, as chairman of our Committee, together with other member of the Committee, arranged for the publication in the Committee's report of some comments about the fact that Mr Warby has not accounted for any of the money in any satisfactory way. When he went, as he was required to do, to a firm of accountants in Los Angeles to try to provide some documentary support for his activities in the United States, that firm of accountants had this to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Warby has elected to omit substantially all of the disclosures required by generally accepted accounting principles. If the omitted disclosures were included in the statement of cash disbursements, they might influence the user's conclusions about the projects disbursements. Accordingly, this statement of cash disbursements is not designed for those who are not informed about such matters. </PARA>
<PARA>What those accountants are saying is that the money spent on them was a waste of money too because Mr Warby has given no account of his expenditure in relation to the speed boat called Spirit of Australia. What is in fact happening in this time of alleged strictures in government expenditure, documented poverty and discontent over low levels of social services in Australia and so on, is that Mr Warby, who is on the National Australia Day Committee-one can only assume for services or something of that kind to the Liberal Party-has been junketing around the United States incurring an expenditure of $200,000 for which he has not been required to account. </PARA>
<PARA> How did that come about? It is quite clear from the proceedings of the Estimates committee that no public servant is responsible for that coming about in the way in which it did. It is quite clear that Ministers in this Government-I nominate particularly Mr Ellicott, the former Minister for Home Affairs, and the Prime Minister (Mr Malcolm Fraser)-were responsible for arranging for Mr Warby to have that money contrary to the rules which normally apply to grants of this kind. All sorts of sportsmen in this country cannot get support for sporting activities. There is one-not a sportsman in the traditional sense-who is showing off a speedboat around America and who can get $200,000 without accountability because the former Minister for Home Affairs and the Prime Minister say so. That is what happened in relation to that person. I do not know whether it is for those reasons, his skill in bamboozling the Prime Minister of this country and the former Minister for Home Affairs, that he is on the National Australia Day Committee. No other reason for his being on it was drawn to the Committee's attention. </PARA>
<PARA> I should say, in conclusion, that the National Australia Day Committee also seemed to represent a farcical expenditure of government money. </PARA>

The reason it occurred in Melbourne is that the extraordinary Melbourne establishment, under the Premiership of Dick Hamer, is great on celebrations of that kind at the Palais Theatre, St Kilda. The activities of the National Australia Day Committee need some examination. If they are not examined by the Government before the next Estimates committee meetings, they will certainly be examined by Estimates Committee B when it meets again.

I intended to do so by way of a question today but, as so often happens in this place, I missed the call. The Minister will recall my many requests to him since his appointment to the ministry to visit the Point McLeay Aboriginal settlement in South Australia to have discussions with the residents regarding the problems being experienced by the Ralkon Agricultural Co. In view of the fact that the Minister visited Point McLeay on Friday, 22 May, I ask him now: What action does he intend taking to resolve quickly the problems that have beset the community for a long period? Will he be making a definite statement to the Senate on this matter? It is a very important matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am pleased that the Minister went down to Point McLeay although I was not very pleased with the way I got a message from his Department in Adelaide that he was visiting the area. The message came in on my answering machine in my office some time after my office closed on Thursday night. The message was to the effect that the Minister wished to advise me that he would be visiting Point McLeay the next day. The message came in late on Thursday night advising me that he would be visiting that area the next day. </PARA>
<PARA> So, I ask the Minister why the visit was so hurried. Only a few days before, he had written to the people at Point McLeay stating that he had not set time to visit the area. I ask him also whether he will tell the Senate the names of the people he invited to accompany him on this visit. He may not be able to tell me tonight. Perhaps I will raise the matter further when we consider the Estimates for the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. I will not delay the Senate any later as it is nearly midnight. But I ask the Minister whether he will make a statement on his intentions to help to solve those current and very pertinent problems at Point McLeay. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator McLaren has asked some questions regarding my visit last week to Point McLeay. I went to Point McLeay, firstly, to honour my promise to him to get down there when I could. But the honourable senator is quite correct. The decision was made hurriedly because I received an urgent request from the Point McLeay community to visit that community. I received that request by way of telex or telegram; I cannot remember which. It was made urgent because there was an imminent decision to be taken by the Aboriginal Development Commission in relation to Bartlett's farm, which has been the subject of Senator McLaren's concern. That decision was to be taken within a few days. In fact it is to be taken some time this week.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Aboriginal community was very keen to meet me. From an examination of my diary it was quite clear that either I went the day after receiving the telegram or I did not go at all for some time. I made a decision to go and we set about making the arrangements. Among those arrangements was a decision that we should notify Senator McLaren. Obviously that was one of the things that we wanted to do because we knew of his interest. We wanted to make sure that he was informed of the decision. I am sorry if a message was left on Senator McLaren's answering machine when his office was not open, but the instructions were that he was to be informed. It was a fairly rushed set of arrangements. I am not sure at what time the telegram arrived during the day but we made the arrangements on the Thursday to go down on the Friday. I ask Senator McLaren to accept that that was the case. </PARA>
<PARA> I was accompanied by my area officer and the acting regional director of my Department. I was accompanied also by the local State member-I think I am correct in saying he is Mr Peter Lewis-and by the Federal member, Mr James Porter. I had hoped, if Senator McLaren had been able to go, that he would have been there as well. I was not accompanied by Mr Randall, the other parliamentarian who had an interest, as I did not have room in the car and could not offer him transport. But I informed him that we were going down there in case he wished to make his own way down. </PARA>
<PARA> The matter which concerned the Point McLeay community was some uncertainty of my powers in relation to the Aboriginal Development Commission. Two sets of opinions were going around that community. The first was that, as I had informed the community, I had no power to direct the Aboriginal Development Commission on particular matters. The matter in this case is the disposition of the title deeds to Bartlett's farm. The other view arose from someone's reading of the Act that section 11 of the Act gave me power to direct the Commission. I knew that that was the matter concerning the community so I took a copy of the Act with me. We checked before I went there on what my powers were. I spent some time with the community meeting with the councillors at Point McLeay. Directors of Ralkon Agricultural Co. were present, although I am not certain whether they were all present. I think most of them were present. The community adviser, Mr Colin Probyn, was there, as was Mr Ian Hillock, who is the manager to the Ralkon company. Mr Garnet Wilson, the local National Aboriginal Council member-an elected representative-also accompanied me. I am sorry I did not mention him earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> I made it clear to the community, as I think Senator McLaren would agree I should, what my powers were and were not under the Aboriginal Development Commission Act. I made it clear to the meeting which was chaired by Mr Rankin that I had no power to direct the ADC in what it did with Bartlett's farm and the title deeds in the dispute that has been going on between Ralkon and Point McLeay. I think that this cleared the air because at least the communities gained some clear idea of what the options were. One of the options was not that the Minister should intervene to give instructions to the ADC. The whole purpose of the Aboriginal Development Commission is that it should have a capacity to make decisions on behalf of Aboriginal people free from direction on detailed matters by the Minister of the day, generally a non-Aboriginal. I thought the meeting was very useful to that extent and there followed a whole series of discussions. I followed that by getting the permission of Mr Spencer Rigney and driving there to look at Ralkon and some parts of the farm. I made sure that I went on to the property before I came back. </PARA>
<PARA> It is not my intention now to make a full statement. The purpose of my visit was to put the community in a position in which it could go on and negotiate what it has to negotiate with the ADC. I am confident that that is what it wants to do. In fact, I am informed that it sent a telex to the ADC either yesterday or today. The ADC is meeting in Canberra and it has informed me that it has received the telex. I cannot say what the state of negotiations between these two bodies is at the moment. I believe it is desirable-I think everyone would agree it is desirable-that some accommodation be reached between the Point McLeay community and the Ralkon Agricultural Co. in a dispute which has been going on for a very considerable time. </PARA>
