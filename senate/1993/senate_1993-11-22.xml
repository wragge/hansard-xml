<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me get a few things clear about this. In the first place, there is no application before the government to increase Mr Black's shareholding in John Fairfax Holdings Ltd. When the last increase was granted in April this year, the Treasurer said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government will not countenance further increases in the permitted level of foreign involvement in mass circulation newspapers.</PARA>
<PARA>The Treasurer confirmed that in a press release last week, 19 November, and those words should be taken at their face value.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister met Mr Black in Canberra a few days ago. In his <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lateline</EMPHASIS> interview, Mr Black said in relation to that exchange that the Prime Minister:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . certainly did not give any undertaking to do anything and I made no specific suggestions.</PARA>
<PARA>The opposition has constantly tried&mdash;and again now through Senator Parer&mdash;to imply some kind of impropriety in discussions between Mr Black and Mr Keating before the federal election. We all know that Dr Hewson himself held at least one discussion with Mr Black before that election because, on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Business Sunday</EMPHASIS> program yesterday, Mr Black said in relation to both that and his discussion with Mr Keating&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I raise a point of order. This is an utterly predetermined and programmed answer. It is in no shape or form an answer to the question, which was: did the government make good on the commitment and increase the foreign ownership limit to 25 per cent? That is a very simple question. The minister has not in any shape or form purported to answer it, and you ought to bring him to order.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am dealing with the question in the way that I want to deal with it. I will get to the specific immediate point in issue in Senator Parer's question, but that can only be understood in the context of the whole series of events.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Of course I am tired; I just got off a plane two hours ago. In the context of this particular exchange, Mr Black said that he wrote about Dr Hewson's position that `this was not an issue with him and he was, in agreed phraseology, very relaxed about what our level of ownership would be in the event that he won the election'. So Dr Hewson's position, we are told, was to indicate very clearly to Mr Black that he would put no obstacles in the way and, in fact, would be `very relaxed' about an increase in the percentage after the election, regardless again of the balance or the fairness or the quality of the Fairfax newspapers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Black has stressed repeatedly that Mr Keating did not seek partisan pro-Labor treatment. Certainly Labor did not get any such treatment from the Fairfax press, as the editorials during the campaign amply confirmed. The point about the increase from 15 to 25 per cent was very simply this: it was to give Mr Black a stronger commercial basis on which to commit the finance and the technology that were necessary to rebuild Fairfax&mdash;something that was in everyone's interest.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was not a question, when this was discussed between the two of them or when it was dealt with by the government, as it was in April this year after the election, of any political judgment being made, but an economic judgment&mdash;what was necessary to protect an investment that worked to everyone's advantage. That is the context, that is the background, they are the specifics, and that is the balance of this affair between the government's involvement through the Prime Minister and the opposition's involvement through Dr Hewson. Both of them had discussions with Mr Black about aspects of the issue. Dr Hewson's commitment to Mr Black, on the face of it&mdash;on the face of Mr Black's own account of those conversations&mdash;was a commitment that went much further than anything that Mr Keating or anyone in this government has been prepared to say to Mr Black at any time.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BS4">Senator LOOSLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer to the conference of APEC leaders in Seattle which has just concluded. What outcomes were of particular significance to Australia? Does the government regard the APEC initiative as having been successful? What evaluation might reasonably be made at this time?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3304" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It must be said that APEC, in both the ministerial meeting and the leaders' meeting which occurred over the weekend, was an absolutely outstanding success from any perspective, including&mdash;one would hope&mdash;that of the opposition in this country. There were at least seven major achievements from that meeting that I will enumerate quickly in explanation of that judgment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Firstly, there was the mere holding of the meeting&mdash;the chemistry of its conduct which, on any view, on every account, was outstanding&mdash;and associated with that the decision to hold another meeting next year in Indonesia. Personal relationships and confidence building of this kind are a very necessary prelude to effective policy making. This simple aspect of the occasion, despite the cynicism which we are hearing already from those on the other side, simply cannot be overstated. In that respect, if nothing else, Mr Keating's judgment about initiating this would have been vindicated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point is the terms of the vision statement itself and the commitment that entailed&mdash;that explicitly embraced&mdash;to a collective, self-conscious role by what was described as `the community of Asia Pacific economies'. In particular, the goal that was spelt out in that vision statement was a commitment to freer global and regional trade.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third thing which was a crucial outcome and which contributed to its success was the very explicit statement by the leaders themselves, and even more explicit statements coming from the ministers on the Uruguay Round&mdash;the commitment to the successful conclusion of that round, combined with some very specific proposals about market access, which no doubt Senator Cook will want an opportunity to say something about at some later stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth element was the commitment which emerged from all of the meetings to a very explicit and clear-cut trade facilitation agenda. A trade and investment framework document was agreed. A work program was agreed extending to the issues of standards, recognition of qualifications and harmonisation of procedures&mdash;especially in relation to customs&mdash;of addressing non-tariff barriers generally and addressing competition policy and its implications for anti-dumping. It was also agreed to work towards the establishment of a regional investment code.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is absolutely crucial that it be understood, in a way that many commentators have not understood, that this is the heart and soul of the activity that APEC is now embarked upon&mdash;the specific nuts and bolts trade facilitation measures that will have enormous implications for reducing costs and barriers to access in this particular region. It is crucial that it also be realised that this meeting represents a very big step forward from what has been the preoccupation, up until now, with simply information gathering, transparency information exchange and policy dialogue to specific action programs that will produce agreed results of that kind.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fifthly, there is the technical cooperation agenda, especially in the areas of energy, telecommunications, transport, human resource development and addressing the infrastructure bottlenecks that have been so well described by Mr Keating and others in their contributions to that meeting.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A sixth outcome of the meeting&mdash;if this still is not good enough for Senator Hill&mdash;was that several new dimensions to the APEC dialogue were established and put on the record: new meetings of finance and economic ministers to discuss macro-economic developments and responses to them; new attention being paid to the establishment of a trade and environment dialogue; and a new kind of involvement of business through business round tables.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Seventhly, and finally, there was a resolution of some very difficult and sensitive questions about the membership of the organisation with a very clear-cut agreement being reached on the need to consolidate it at its present manageable levels. I think Australia can be very pleased and proud of this particular meeting and the contribution we have made to the initiation of APEC in 1989 and its development since, particularly on this occasion.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LD4">Senator ALSTON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Could the Leader of the Government in the Senate explain why the Treasurer's press release of 20 April 1993 implied that the decision to raise the foreign ownership limit was made to accommodate `the valid need of foreign investors to safeguard their financial and managerial commitment to their newspapers', when we now know from the Prime Minister's `shameless in Seattle' comments that before the election he wanted a commitment that coverage of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> would be balanced and that after the election `I on behalf of the government made good a commitment to reconsider them and took them to 25 per cent'? Why did the Treasurer's press release disguise the real reasons for this decision when it was announced?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="3305" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer's press release articulated exactly the reason that the government had regard to in increasing the stake from 15 to 25 per cent. That is exactly the reason I spoke about a few moments ago when I said that the kind of financial and technological commitment that was being sought by everyone of Conrad Black, in relation to the Fairfax group, was one that could realistically and commercially be guaranteed and ensured only by a consolidation of the shareholding in question at a higher level. That was the central reason and certainly it is the reason that I recall being absolutely central in the discussions that took place when this matter was considered by the government after the election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course it is the case that governments will always have regard, just as oppositions will always have regard, to the quality of the news media. The Prime Minister made the point in Seattle on the weekend that no government is going to give such agreement to a proprietor who behaves, as he said, in a partisan way or immaturely. That cuts both ways.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not talking about giving special deals to people who give special support to their own side. We are talking about having an attitude, as a responsible government, which is in favour of a responsible media. Of course it is the case that we were not seeking at any stage, nor do we now, nor is it the Prime Minister's view that he wants, any kind of craven obsequiousness so far as the press of this country is concerned. That is highly unlikely ever to be achieved. It certainly was not achieved in the last election where, as I remember, every Fairfax paper came out against the government. Nonetheless, we made the decision that we did on 20 April to increase the stake because of the economic reasons and commercial reasons that I have mentioned which constitute a very clear-cut, very self-contained and very self-evident rationale for that particular increase.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question.

The Prime Minister's statement in Seattle was as I have described it, but it was in the context that I have described. The government's decision was made for exactly the reasons that Mr Dawkins set out on 20 April and which I have stated again here today.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator McKiernan for his question about the important developments taking place in the development of an Australian space program in conjunction with the South Australian government. It is the aim of both governments to have a viable space program operating in Australia by the year 2000.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the existing infrastructure that is available at Woomera from the space program that operated in Australia in the 1960s and 1970s, Australia is well placed to launch light earth orbiting satellites, LEOs, particularly those satellites in low polar orbit, because of our geographic, climatic and political advantages. With the development of Woomera we will be able to provide interested countries and space programs with the ability to launch satellites from Woomera on a commercial basis&mdash;I emphasise `commercial basis'.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been estimated by some commercial consortiums that the existing infrastructure at Woomera, left over from the space program in the 1960s and 1970s, at today's value is probably worth around $100 million. I have asked my department and the Australian Space Office to investigate what it would cost to bring these facilities up to standard to launch light earth orbiting satellites on a commercial basis.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Irrespective of that study, there has been interest from overseas in using Woomera, particularly from Germany. Next year Germany will want to recover one of its scientific satellites in its express program at Woomera. I hope by February next year that Australia and Germany will have signed a treaty to enable the recovery of that satellite. Discussions are now continuing with the Germans to see whether it is possible for future express satellites to be launched from Woomera.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are also opportunities emerging from Russian interests which, with their capabilities, may be interested in launching LEO satellites from Australia. As a result of my visit to Japan three weeks ago, I arranged for a delegation from the Japanese space agency, NASDA, to visit Australia early next year to look at ways in which cooperation between both countries can take place to develop a space program.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These opportunities, collaboratively developed between the federal government and the state government of South Australia, are opportunities for the future. I remind the Senate that it was also a Senate transport and infrastructure committee report some two years ago that raised these issues. It is good to see that some honourable senators opposite acknowledge that. There are opportunities for us. I congratulate the South Australian government for taking up these initiatives with the federal government to develop a space program during the 1990s.</PARA>

If she was in some doubt before, I advise her that it is an advisory body and decisions are made by ministers, as they should be in a representative democracy. The nature of its advice is not disclosed because it is advice in the normal decision making process for ministers. General policy positions are disclosed but the handling of individual companies' applications has always been treated as commercial-in-confidence and that commercial-in-confidence principle has also been applied in the normal course.</PARA></TALK.START>

There are a whole lot of reasons that can be given for why, for example, the Australian Independent Newspaper consortium bid was rejected.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The heart and soul of APEC is trade, investment and regional economic growth. We did a lot of things in Seattle which have advanced the cause for Australia in all of those areas. I should count the ways in which we did those things. I subscribe to and support the answer that Senator Gareth Evans gave earlier in question time to a question about the Seattle conference. The leaders and the ministers did advance our regional interests quite considerably.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first and fundamental thing that should be said is that APEC commits itself absolutely to the idea of multilateral trade negotiations. That is the overarching principle that we recognise. In Seattle we brought down a major statement which has advanced, in my view, the progress towards the successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We did not content ourselves with fine rhetoric and nice words; we actually did practical things. We tabled a market access proposal which most of the countries which are contracting parties to the GATT in APEC put their names to and which has advanced market access debate in the Uruguay Round much further than what it was when the G7 last met in Tokyo back in July. We have done that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The significant beauty of all of that for Australia is that, since we have been on a course of reducing tariffs ourselves, there is no area in that enhanced market access package in which we need to modify any of our tariff policies at all. We are within that according to our existing tariff policy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regionally, we also did a substantial body of work on trade and investment. Senator Gareth Evans mentioned the trade and investment framework for the area. That does three things.

Why should the people of Australia believe the Treasurer's statement last Friday that there will not be any change to the government's policy in relation to foreign ownership, given that he said precisely the same thing in February 1992 and having regard to the fact that the Prime Minister made it clear that Mr Black's latest request for an increase was still under active consideration, saying, `something easily given isn't generally something worth having'?

The relevant passage of the transcript is as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . I had a conversation with him last year when John Hewson had offered him 50 percent equity in John Fairfax &amp; Sons, and I said to him, "Oh, I wouldn't consider that." I would consider going to 25 percent, because his claim was that he couldn't run the business at 14.9 per cent; that he had just concluded that day, a meeting at the Opera House where he had been pilloried in running the business with 14.9 per cent, and I said, "Well, we'll think about it but we want a commitment from you that the paper will be balanced''.</PARA>
<PARA>What we were being told before was that there was nothing that the Prime Minister had said in Seattle about the particular subject matter of the Treasurer's statement in April&mdash;and that is the particular commercial consideration, the economic consideration, the business consideration which justified the increase from 14.9 per cent to 25 per cent. That was the centrepiece of the Treasurer's assessment and understanding of the situation; it was the centrepiece of the government's assessment and understanding of it in cabinet, as I have just said; and it was the centrepiece of Mr Keating's assessment and understanding of it, as he, Mr Keating himself, said in Seattle last week.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of initiatives in the budget for the film industry, the most important of which, in my view, is the additional $3.5 million over four years to the AFC for script development and producer support.

The Commonwealth is very keen to cooperate with the states to ensure that this does happen. However, this does not mean that all logging in old growth forests should stop; it recognises that some logging in old growth forests and wilderness areas is necessary to meet industry requirements during the transition to regrowth and plantations. Some environmentalists have claimed this to be a moratorium on old growth logging, but that is not the case.</PARA>

Similarly, areas which have been formally nominated for World Heritage status, such as Fraser Island, are excluded from logging operations. In this regard, it should be noted that under the inter-governmental agreement on environment the Commonwealth will consult with the relevant state for any future areas nominated for World Heritage listing.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The concerns that exist relate to two unregistered products imported from Europe under the special access scheme. These were brought in to treat a very rare form of haemophilia. It is treated by what is called Factor IX. The special access scheme allows individual doctors or institutions to bring in products which have not been approved by the TGA, the Therapeutic Goods Administration, for the treatment of serious or life threatening illness. The use of such drugs is determined by the doctor and can only be supplied with the informed consent of the patient. This is particularly important because drugs brought in under the SAS scheme are essentially experimental, and the Commonwealth can give no assurance as to the quality, safety or efficacy of such usage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The TGA has been assured that, of the two products imported from Germany, the first, Fibrin, was not manufactured from the contaminated plasma. Two batches of the second product, Immuno Factor IX, were prepared from plasma supplied by UB Plasma, one of the companies involved in the use of the contaminated blood, although there is no evidence that contaminated blood was actually used in preparing these batches. It must be emphasised that the possible contamination of blood products with HIV is considered very unlikely, particularly in the use of Immuno Factor IX, because the preparation of that product involves heat treatment and filtration which should ensure the product is virus free.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Both batches were used by the same medical specialist and he has confirmed that only two patients have been treated with the suspect products. The treating doctor has been required by the TGA to take any necessary action with regard to testing the patients for the presence of HIV virus.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This incident demonstrates the wisdom of the Australian policy of pursuing self-sufficiency in products derived from human blood or plasma. There is only one imported product on the Australian Register of Therapeutic Goods which has an active ingredient derived from blood. It is not involved in the contamination scare.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia's high degree of self-sufficiency and high quality in this area are very much a tribute to the Australian Red Cross and to the voluntary blood donation scheme which we have in this country.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The federal government is very conscious of the particular dangers that are being faced by Australian school children in their daily task of getting to and from school. I think all honourable senators would agree that it is particularly tragic that families should suffer the loss of young children travelling to and from school. This is an exercise which should be safe. The real tragedy is that most of the deaths&mdash;and there are a significant number of them; I think honourable senators may be surprised to know just how many&mdash;are completely avoidable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, a common thread runs through these accidents and this indicates how completely avoidable they are. While there has been, I think rightly, a focus recently on the safety of school children while in a bus&mdash;that is, we are focusing on, for example, fitting seat belts to buses&mdash;the statistics show that without question the greatest dangers faced by school children are not when they are in the bus but when they are approaching or leaving it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A report that has just been released by the Queensland parliament's travelsafe committee indicates how appallingly high the tragic loss of young life is when children are travelling to and from school. This report reveals that in the state of Queensland alone between 1986 and 1991 there were 54 fatalities involving school age children travelling to and from school&mdash;54 deaths of school kids in five years. A school bus was involved in 10 of those cases in which a child was killed, but only one of the fatally injured children was actually an occupant of a bus at the time of the accident.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two recent fatal accidents&mdash;one in Sydney, where two children were hit, and, unfortunately, one only a week or so ago in my home town of Darwin&mdash;had the common thread of children running around the front of the bus before the bus had left the bus stop. Such children cannot be seen by traffic that is coming from behind. From personal observation, I can attest to the fact that both children and drivers seem to have a total disregard for the safety problems that occur at congested times of the day when children are arriving at school in the morning and leaving in the afternoon.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have recently written to all state and territory transport ministers seeking their agreement to a joint national review of the dangers for school children in getting on and off school buses. The review will identify the existing measures that are being taken by the states and develop a national program building on those initiatives.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are two common factors that contribute to this unnecessarily high number of kids being killed. The first is that children run in front of the bus after they get off. The second, often related to the first, is that the parents or the carers of these children wait on the side of road opposite the bus for the children to get off. There is often a combination of the kid running in front of the bus to the adult who is waiting on the opposite side of the road.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tragically, a lot of these deaths could be avoided if parents would simply wait on the same side of the road as the bus for their kids to get off. This would avoid the problem of the child running in front of the bus in the first place and running to the parent. That child has eyes only for that parent and is completely ignorant of the traffic coming the other way. I hope this review will be completed in time to allow it to be considered by the transport ministers conference that will be convened early in the new year.</PARA>

<PARA>What we have seen today is yet another example of this government's willingness to say or do anything to justify itself and disguise the sordid nature of its political decision making. Anyone who was in Seattle&mdash;indeed, I would have thought anyone in this country&mdash;would recognise, as Laura Tingle who was there, and Lenore Taylor who was not, said in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS>:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Conrad Black might be allowed to lift his stake in John Fairfax . . . the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, said yesterday, and admitted he had demanded "balance" in Fairfax political reporting before Cabinet's approval earlier this year . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Those, I would have thought, are incontrovertible facts. That is why it is extraordinary that Senator Evans should come in here today and go through this absolute charade and pretend that somehow this decision was made on the basis of management issues. I can understand why he would want to do that. On 13 May last he was at great pains to answer a question from Senator Hill about why the FIRB advice should not be tabled when Mr Black had consented to it. He went on to explain how the decision had been made and how the government took account of national interest pertaining to social and cultural values. He then talked about financial and managerial commitment and said that that was the context in which the decision was made. Later, on 27 May, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government's decision and the reasoning behind it have already been clearly articulated in the Treasurer's press release of 20 April.</PARA>
<PARA>What those press releases and that answer&mdash;that utterly disingenuous answer&mdash;were saying was that somehow there was some high principle involved in this decision, that it was somehow to do with the national interest. In fact, what we got from Mr Keating in Seattle was the naked and shameless admission that this was all about a conditional promise. In other words, there would be a willingness on the part of the government to lift the level of foreign ownership if Mr Black's newspapers behaved themselves. Mr Black's newspapers were, therefore, on probation. </PARA>

I will make very significant commercial decisions that affect the interests of media proprietors and all those who serve with them on the basis of our perception of fairness', when this bloke has a reputation for belting up on journalists at the drop of a hat, has no compunction about ringing people and abusing them and has no compunction about complaining whenever he sees an article which he disagrees with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is one thing to say that everyone is entitled to take the point and take up the issue with the journalist or the editor; that is fine. But to say that a national interest decision in relation to foreign ownership should be entirely based on `whether we think you have done the right thing' is an utterly shameless situation and indicative of the low point of political morality that we have reached in this country. There is not one word in what Mr Keating said in Seattle that in any way talks about the national interest or the need to take into account other factors. He said:</PARA>

If Mr Keating did not consider that the coverage was balanced, then the message was very clear: Mr Black would not get his increase in media ownership. For the Labor ministers who have spoken in this debate to say anything other than that Mr Keating was going to be the judge of whether it was fair or not and that, if Mr Keating did not like it, Mr Black was not going to get his media increase, is a bald faced lie&mdash;and that is well acknowledged in this place. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why Hewson should win</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This newspaper supported Labor in two of the past three federal elections. It did so primarily because Labor, under the leadership of Mr Hawke and Mr Keating, appeared most likely to implement the reforms so badly needed by the Australian economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this election, we are recommending a vote for the coalition, precisely because Dr Hewson is more prepared than Mr Keating to press on vigorously with that crucial reform process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, after 10 years, Labor appears to have reached the limit of its ability to push reform past the stubborn resistance of the unions and other vested interests.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Micro-economic reform has almost stalled over the past year. The Government seems unable seriously to tackle the issue of labour market reform. It seems unable to cut through the gross, union-imposed inefficiency of the transport sector that still undermines the competitiveness of the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cook's version of enterprise bargaining is a parody of labour market reform, in which only agreements by registered unions are accepted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the Government, enterprise bargaining is essentially an add-on to the award system. The opportunity for bargaining is strictly limited&mdash;and so, therefore, is the opportunity for genuine workplace productivity gains.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his economic statement in the first week of the campaign, Mr Keating proclaimed the Government's commitment to continue micro-economic reform. However, the Prime Minister's "forward agenda" was just a restatement of the very modest initiatives of the preceding 12 months.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating's formal policy statement two weeks later confirmed the disappointment. In the crucial area of land transport there was to be another committee: the National Transport Planning Task Force; in coastal shipping, which remains a drag on industry, there was to be yet another bribe for another round of gentle reform. And that was it.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, there would be economic reform under Labor. Despite the pressure from the unions and sections of industry, Mr Keating has courageously stood by the Government's policy of tariff reform, which will see most tariffs fall to 5 per cent by 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The pressure of lower tariffs and increasing import competition in the product markets will force more reform on the labour market and the rest of the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, Labor now seems to have settled into a strategy of doing the minimum: of simply trying to nudge the unions and the other vested interests in the right direction as the tide of competition carries everyone slowly along. That's not good enough.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look at transport. A recent report for the Australian Business Council estimated that in water transport less than 50 per cent of the possible savings identified by the Industry Commission and other inquiries had been achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The productivity on Australia's reformed waterfront is still less than New Zealand's. And while the Government boasts of the progress made by the coastal shipping industry, it dares not expose the industry to international competition, which is the real test.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the railways, only a small fraction of the productivity gains identified by the Industry Commission have yet been made. In domestic aviation, there are still large barriers to competition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a vast amount still to be done to make the economy more efficient and internationally competitive. And that task is urgent. Only fundamental reform of the economy will produce the long-term growth necessary to reduce the high underlying rate of unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of economic reform is the most important of this election. It is more important than the popular issues of the campaign: the GST and Medicare and even the high level of recession-induced, or cyclical, unemployment.

It is the same energetic commitment to the transform the Australian economy that once characterised Labor.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Why the coalition should win tomorrow</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The outcome of tomorrow's poll will not alter the challenges facing Australia in the final years of the 20th Century. In essence, these challenges involve managing profound but necessary change, change that is likely to reshape&mdash;is already reshaping&mdash;the nation. For all the talk that the 1980s was a decade of greed, selfishness and waste, it was nevertheless a time of transition when it became clear that the old ways of doing things could no longer be sustained. It became a matter of national consensus that if Australia was to remain a prosperous liberal democracy with rising living standards offering a brief future for its young people, Australians would have to embrace change. Rising living standards were not a national birthright. The notion that we could rely on commodity exports to finance the protection of inefficient manufacturing industries that were there to provide employment had proved to be a costly fantasy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To its credit, for much of its decade in power, the federal Labor Government understood all this. It recognised the need for sweeping changes in the way the Australian economy was structured and that these changes would amount to nothing short of an economic revolution. Paul Keating will be judged well by history for the dominant part he played in that process. The deregulation of the financial system, the floating of the dollar, the opening up of the banking system to foreign competition were all designed to sweep away the idea that Australia could somehow isolate itself from the rest of the world and remain an economic backwater with its living standards maintained by selling stuff we dug out of the ground or grew on top of it. The steel-industry plan, the car-industry plan and the program of tariff cuts&mdash;among other reforms&mdash;were all part of an attempt by the Government to open up the Australian economy to what was clearly a new and, in some ways, harsher international economic environment. The Government also deserves credit for the tentative and often painfully small steps it took to reform the industrial relations system even though it did not do enough. For much of the `80s, there was a general consensus between Labor and the coalition that change was necessary. There was even agreement on the direction of that change. It was the means rather than the ends over which the parties differed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recession, with its toll of more than a million unemployed, ended that consensus. Since he became Prime Minister, Mr Keating has been much less committed to the program of reform than he was during the years when he was federal Treasurer and the intellectual driving force of the Government. The recession brought about a loss of nerve, an uncertainty about the direction in which Australia should be headed. In a sense, the watering down of Mr Keating's commitment to change explains why he has, throughout this election campaign, been a Prime Minister neither able to defend his record nor map out the direction in which he wants to take the country. Instead, he has fixed his sights on the coalition's proposed goods and services tax and has sought to invest it with a sinister and wide-ranging significance. The GST, according to Mr Keating, will be a cancer on Australian society. It will fundamentally change the Australian way of life. It is a malevolent, evil tax. Quite frankly, this is nonsense. The irony of this election campaign is that the GST is really in no way a vital ingredient of the coalition's Fightback proposals nor, indeed, would it be vital to any reform program. While the GST will allow some restructuring of the tax system, it is a change we could have done without at this time. If the coalition loses tomorrow, it will be because  a minor part of its reform proposals became the main issue of the election campaign.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, it is the proposed changes in Australia's industrial relations system that are central to Fightback, for it is in this area that Labor has proved to be most timid and in which change is now most urgent. Whatever the benefits of the Accords I to VII between the Government and the ACTU since 1983, and these are arguable, the industrial relations system remains outmoded and rigid. Enterprise bargaining, for all the lip-service given to it by the Government and the trade unions, remains the exception rather than the rule. We believe the coalition's proposed changes in industrial relations are sensible and necessary if the goal of making Australian industry internationally competitive is to be achieved. The move away from a centralised wage-fixing system to a system of individual contracts between employers and employees will probably mean in the long term that workers with skills that are in demand will be better off, while those with few or no skills will be worse off. But there is no real alternative that will produce what we now desperately need: more productive workplaces. Labor, with its ties to the trade union movement, is never likely to be able to force through these sorts of workplace changes. On that basis alone, we believe the coalition ought to form the next government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another major reason why the coalition ought to win tomorrow. Changes of government should be a regular occurrence in any liberal democracy and, after a decade in power, Labor has, despite Mr Keating's best efforts, become a Government that has lost much of its appetite for reform and renewal. There are echoes in the choice facing Australians tomorrow of the choice a previous generation faced in 1961 when the Menzies Government, after 12 years in power, and in the middle of a recession, scraped home by one seat basically because of the shortcomings of the then Labor leader, Arthur Calwell. In retrospect, it probably would have been better for Australia had Labor won that poll and been given the chance to implement some of its reforms then. Instead, it sat on the Opposition benches for another decade and, when it came to power, set about making up for its 23 years of frustration by trying to transform Australia in a matter of days. The failures of the Whitlam Government can in part be attributed to that extra decade of debilitating powerlessness that Labor experienced on the Opposition benches.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia needs a government in the `90s that will maintain the momentum of change, that will continue the transformation of the economy begun by the Labor Government. There is still a long way to go. The goal of that transformation ought never to be lost sight of: an Australia that offers its young people real hope of a decent future. We believe that a coalition victory tomorrow will best serve that goal.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is time for a change</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of the millions of words spoken during this marathon election campaign, none were truer than those uttered by the Prime Minister when he launched his policies. "When you wake up on March 14, whoever has won the election, there will still be unemployment. There will still be problems to solve," Mr Keating said. Throughout the campaign the Labor Party has been keen to play down the magnitude of those problems; the Coalition has often exaggerated them. Nevertheless they are real and none of the parties has convinced us they have all the answers. The question confronting voters tomorrow is which of the parties is the more likely to have the conviction to tackle those problems. And, just as importantly, which is more likely to possess the occasional humility to admit that policies proposed in Opposition or in the heat of an election campaign are not necessarily appropriate when confronted by the harsh realities of the government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In answering these questions, Australians have cause to take heart. This has been a contest between two very intelligent and tough-minded men. Both have shown they are not the sort of leader who will shirk tough decisions. Mr Keating has already served Australia with distinction as Treasurer, as a guiding force in Mr Hawke's Government and as Prime Minister. If he loses on Saturday, history will certainly acknowledge the role he played in forcing his party to confront the realities of the broader scale, he has commenced the vital task of convincing Australians of the opportunities to be gained from becoming a more  competitive country. Floating the dollar, the entry of foreign banks, reform of the taxation system, a controlled reduction in protection&mdash;these are just some of his achievements. And their significance, in the context of the traditionally cantankerous Labor Party, cannot be underestimated.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Hewson, for his part, has united a party which had been debilitated for most of the past decade by the rivalry between the former leaders, Mr Howard and Mr Peacock. No-one can now argue, as was the case in the last few elections, that the Liberals stand for nothing. Fightback, an unmistakably Hewson program, has unified the party and has also cemented relations within the Coalition. Whoever wins tomorrow, we will have a Prime Minister who will lead, not follow.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many problems</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Strong leadership will be required to confront the economic realities facing Australia. While it is now clear that talk of a "double dip" recession is part of the hyperbole of the campaign, the economy is obviously stuck in a path of weak recovery. Economic growth must continue to be encouraged but extreme care has to be taken not to again overheat the economy. Real wages must continue to be restrained. The spark of new business investment we have seen lately must be fanned. Inflationary expectations must be kept down. The expanding national debt must be reined in. And the tangle of subsidies, tariff barriers and work practices, which impede the growth of our export industries, must continue to be dismantled. These are some of the problems about which Mr Keating spoke; regrettably neither party has been prepared to fully address them over the past five weeks.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, the fiscal stimulus implicit in the policies of both Labor and the Coalition have been such as to alarm the Governor of the Reserve Bank, Mr Fraser. In an unprecedented intervention, he warned last week that economic growth was unlikely to be strong enough to reduce the budget deficit at a sufficiently rapid pace. The new government, Mr Fraser said, would have to rethink its spending and taxation pledges or face a substantial increase in interest rates which would wipe out economic recovery. It has been said, not entirely facetiously, that voters should endorse the party which is more likely to break its promises.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Hewson has insisted throughout the campaign that unemployment, not the Goods and Services Tax (GST), is the major issue of the campaign. As he rightly says, Labor has proposed no solutions which will help get the dole queues down quickly. The job creation projects of One Nation, about which Mr Keating has boasted, are certainly exaggerated and problematic. His central campaign pledge&mdash;to create half-a-million new jobs over the next three years&mdash;has been exposed as unlikely to make a dent in the unemployment rate. This is because the Australian Bureau of Statistics estimates the labour force will grow by at least this amount over the same period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Faster reform</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But Dr Hewson cannot claim any magic answer to unemployment either. The Coalition's assertion that Fightback will create two million jobs by the year 2000 has always lacked credibility and it is no credit to Dr Hewson that he has continued to peddle this claim when he knows it has no econometric foundation. The Coalition is on firmer ground, however, when it argues that its commitment to a faster pace of structural reform of the economy and to deregulation of the labour market will make the economy more efficient and will boost jobs in the long run.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While unemployment is the most pressing issue, it is the GST which has dominated the campaign. Dr Hewson's decision to give it such a high priority, at such a political cost, is puzzling. The Labor Government has undoubtedly exaggerated the impact that it will have on individuals. But the Opposition is also guilty of overselling its reform. The majority opinion of economists now appears to be that a GST, and the tax reforms that will accompany it, will have a small, beneficial effect on the efficiency of the economy. But it is no economic salvation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fundamental labour market reform, for example, probably offers greater scope for economic efficiency gains. Labor's Accord was an important factor in restraining real wages during the economy's boom years. What is now needed, as Labor itself has acknowledged, is a means of continuing this restraint in total wages while also delivering sharp productivity gains. Properly handled, the strategy of encouraging voluntary employment contacts, proposed under the Coalition's Jobsback policy, seems far more likely to deliver these gains than the slowly-paced enterprise bargaining approach of Labor.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past decade, the Labor Party has overcome the traditional suspicion of the electorate and demonstrated that it can govern responsibly. Its legacy is impressive in many areas. It has been Mr Keating's misfortune to have taken the reins too late. Although he has tried hard to rejuvenate the Government, it is showing unmistakable signs of chronic fatigue. It is time for a change. Without endorsing all aspects of the Coalition's program, Dr Hewson and his team should be given the opportunity to tackle the many problems which will still confront us when we wake up on Sunday morning.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Meet the Press</EMPHASIS>, Senator Alston was asked whether balanced political coverage was one of the merits that one would look for in arriving at decisions on media ownership. Senator Alston replied, in terms of balanced media coverage, `Not from us'. It was not an issue as far as Senator Alston was concerned. He was then asked by the interviewer:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You don't care about balance in coverage?</PARA>
<PARA>Senator Alston replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We certainly don't believe it's the role of politicians to demand that media barons portray media coverage in a way that is sympathetic to that political party. That is an outrage.</PARA>
<PARA>I refer honourable senators particularly to pages E533 and E534 of the Senate estimates <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. Only last week both Senator Macdonald and Senator Alston were demanding of the Managing Director of the ABC that the committee be provided with detailed personal information about the political allegiances of the ABC's employees. Quite rightly, Mr Hill refused. In fact, Senator Macdonald went so far as to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When are you going to get 50 per cent of your staff as Liberals, instead of one per cent, as it is now?</PARA>
<PARA>That was a totally offensive request from Senator Macdonald. It was rightly refused by the Managing Director of the ABC, who is not going to conduct a witch-hunt into the political affiliations of employees of the ABC. It demonstrates that Senator Alston is the hypocrite I said he is. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This whole debate has balanced on the word `balance'. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) asked that the press coverage be balanced. `Balance' in the Prime Minister's vocabulary, I have no doubt, has a different interpretation. The Prime Minister is well known for his vocabulary. He has put the word `scumbag' into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Macquarie Dictionary</EMPHASIS>, amongst other things, to the extent that, my teacher friends tell me, regrettably, the children at school are now aping him and performing in the same way in the school grounds.

It is the same interpretation that I am sure the whole public takes in regard to this. There is a smell about that word in this context.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There seem to me to be three quite separate and distinct matters in issue here. The first is the so-called imputation that Senator Herron is so frank about; that is, the imputation that there was a link between the increase to 25 per cent in the equity and an alleged demand or claim or request or direction for Mr Black that a particular kind of balance was required. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The imputation was that when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) used the word `balance' he was referring to a particular kind of balance in favour of the Labor party being sought. Senator Herron has been quite explicit about that as have others on the opposition side. That is a matter in issue and a matter to which there are some very clear answers.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="10000">The PRESIDENT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Order! I will let Senator Evans continue.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There are some very clear answers because any such link has been very clearly denied, not only by the Prime Minister but also by Mr Black himself. If those opposite need any proof of the outcome of the sequence of events they will find it in exactly what was tabled by Senator Collins in his contribution to this debate; namely, stark, clear, overwhelming evidence that, whatever the performance of the Fairfax papers might have been during the campaign, it was certainly not to favour the Australian Labor Party.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter in issue is whether Mr Keating had it in mind at the time before the election, and continues to have it in mind now, that there should be a balance in the way in which the media portrays political events or represents political points of view, particularly at election time. Of course, the</PARA>
<PARA>answer is yes. Mr Keating has been quite explicit that it is his view that the media ought to be balanced in that way. In that respect he is no different from Senator Alston, who has been on record on this matter, as Senator Collins just amply demonstrated. He is no different from Dr Hewson, who effectively made the same points in a series of responses he made to questions in various interviews last week. It is a point of view that Mr Keating himself expressed last week in Seattle in his doorstop interview on 19 November in the following terms. He was asked:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Do you think, for instance, that a Liberal Prime Minister might make a different judgment of balance as a Labor Prime Minister?</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Keating answered:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I shouldn't think so. I mean, I don't think it is an unreasonable thing to require of a newspaper that it be balanced.</PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly the context in which Mr Keating has made his point in which he stated his preference for balance. It is not a partisan context; it is a context that is simply demanding a reasonable sense of responsibility from the newspaper proprietors of this country. It is a position that has been taken over and over again in public statements by people on Senator Herron's side of politics. It is a perfectly reasonable position, one that does not distinguish the opposition side from the government side and certainly does not justify the imputations that have been involved here. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third matter in issue here is what was the fundamental, underlying basis of the decision that was actually taken, foreshadowed before the election and taken after the election, to increase the Black stakeholding from 14.9 to 25 per cent. Here the answer is unequivocally clear. It is unequivocally clear in the text of the Treasurer's statement back in April; it is unequivocally clear in what I have said this afternoon in retailing what the basis of that decision was as a member of the government who participated in it; and it is unequivocally clear in what Prime Minister Keating had to say in Seattle, notwithstanding various suggestions earlier in question time that in Seattle the Prime Minister had done no more than refer to the balance question. In fact, it is abundantly clear that the Prime Minister did refer quite explicitly to the financial, economic and managerial considerations that were involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I referred to and quoted into <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> one such passage in an interview he gave last week, on Thursday 18 November. In retailing his conversation with Mr Black, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would consider going to 25 per cent, because his claim was that he couldn't run the business at 14.9 per cent; that he had just concluded that day, a meeting at the Opera House where he had been pilloried in running the business with 14.9 per cent. . .</PARA>
<PARA>Again in Seattle, the following day, last Friday 19 November, the Prime Minister said in answer to a question:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I mean, Mr Black made the point that it was very hard to manage the newspaper with 14.9% of the stock and it's a pretty reasonable point to make. We've given him 25% and 25% is nowhere near a commanding position in terms of the equity but it gives him the authority to manage it.</PARA>
<PARA>There it is clearly and unequivocally on the record. On both occasions when Mr Keating addressed this issue in Seattle, he referred specifically to the economic, financial, managerial and business justification for this decision. That was clear at the time, it was clear in Mr Keating's original conversations, it was clear in what was said publicly, it has been clear in what has been said publicly since, and notwithstanding the assertions of people in the opposition here today, it was clear in exactly what Mr Keating said in Seattle. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When you are going to get 50 per cent of your staff as Liberals, instead of one per cent, as it is now?</PARA>
<PARA>I will explain that. Mr Hill was going on at very great length to explain why an ABC advertisement had called for a rural reporter of a specific ethnic origin. I think Senator Kemp and Senator Alston questioned Mr Hill about that. They asked, `Why did your advertisement, in breach of the equal opportunity rules, specifically mention a particular person of a particular ethnic origin?'. Mr Hill conceded that the advertisement was wrong and that he was wrong in that instant.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Hill then went on to explain at some great length that he wanted ABC people to reflect the position of people in the community.

I said, `I'll bet you they're not', and I will bet that with anyone as I think it is a well-known fact.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My concern is that this matter clearly comes under the  control of the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs. The matter comes under the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean). The minister responsible for this matter would be the Minister for Resources, Mr Lee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has recommended that this matter be sent to a committee that now does not deal with energy matters. The reason is that earlier we formed a rural and regional affairs committee which deals with references that relate to rural and energy matters. It also deals with the annual report of the department and other matters. If we are to have standing committees that develop a corporate knowledge of the ministries they cover and if we are to have senators who become experts on particular areas, we should follow the guidelines that are laid down and have the committee that shadows that ministry&mdash;if I can use that expression&mdash;deal with the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry committee does not deal with those matters and has properly not dealt with them since the formation of the rural and regional affairs committee. I appreciate that from time to time a reference is not given to the standing committee that has that ministerial coverage, but I ask the committee to consider very carefully recommending the reference of a bill to a committee that does not have that ministerial coverage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are not careful we will end up with a situation where the caprice of a particular senator determines that a committee will deal with a matter.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is an extremely important report because, as mentioned in the report, the rate of growth of research and development expenditure by Australian business is one of the fastest, if not the fastest, in OECD countries. Nevertheless, we are still 17th out of 24 OECD countries&mdash;that is, seventh from the bottom&mdash;for our expenditure on R&amp;D by Australian businesses. The government's efforts to make sure we got further up the ladder resulted in the 150 per cent research and development tax incentive which was introduced for the six-year period from 1 July 1985 to 30 June 1991. There was a suggestion in 1991 that the rate should be continued until 30 June 1993 and then reduced to a rate of 125 per cent to apply until 30 June 1995. However, in August 1992 the government announced that the incentive would continue at the rate of 150 per cent in recognition of the fact that research and development is an important factor in increasing the export capacity of our industries, particularly in the area of innovation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report is extremely disturbing because it addresses the effectiveness of this tax incentive. The recommendations disclose that currently we do not know whether this incentive is functioning or whether it is providing the increased expenditure by business. We do not know because the two bodies that are responsible for it&mdash;the Industry Research and Development Board and the Australian Taxation Office&mdash;do not have proper procedures in place to monitor and assess the benefit that Australia derives from this incentive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 1 says that action should be taken to enable the Industry Research and Development Board and the department to acquire the relevant information which is necessary for them to discharge effectively their respective responsibilities under the tax concession scheme. Quite clearly, the information flow is inadequate at the moment. The two bodies agree that this should be improved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 2 states that the monitoring responsibility of the board is certainly not clear and that the department will seek authority to be able to monitor. Recommendation 3 suggests that there are no comprehensive assessment criteria for monitoring because the Auditor-General recommends that the board establish comprehensive assessment criteria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 4 suggests that the management information system currently is not adequate and that it should be improved. Again, the department agrees that this needs to be done, quite clearly admitting that the current management information system is simply inadequate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recommendation 5 suggests that the data processing needs need to be satisfied and that currently the data processing capacity is simply not adequate. Recommendation 6 suggests that the data management for tax assessment requires amendments so that retrospective claims for concessions can be processed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could continue: I have notes for recommendations 7, 8, 9, 10, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16 and 17 which indicate that neither of those bodies currently has the capacity to assess whether this particular tax concession produces the results that we should expect from it. There are also 17 recommendations&mdash;starting with recommendation 18&mdash;which address work practices in both the department and the Taxation Office. To a large extent these recommendations also address their capacity to provide a reasonable assessment of where we are going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report must be of very great concern, disclosing as it does the fact that, despite the considerable number of years that this tax concession has been available and its having cost the taxpayer in the order of $300 million a year, the government departments administering it do not have the capacity to assess&mdash;and clearly, therefore, have not done so during all those years&mdash;the extent to which it actually produces the result of increasing expenditure on research and development and whether the expenditure on research and development, to the extent that it is undertaken, actually produces results in assisting our industries to become more competitive in international markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is a scandalous situation. Obviously, action is long overdue. I suggest that the government take action to ensure that both of these bodies take action as quickly as possible.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler has noted, and it is noted in the report, that it is no longer a program that has a sunset clause on it. It is now accepted by the government as an indefinite program. We, and industry, are delighted to have it accepted as an ongoing program as a feature of our support for R&amp;D in Australia. We note that the report says that there is a difficulty in making a true assessment of the value of this program so far. All I can say is that in my time as Minister for Science and Small Business, going to many functions involving industry, small business and the scientific community, this program of 150 per cent tax deduction is very strongly supported. In fact, many industries now tell us that if it were not for the tax deduction they would not have increased the level of R&amp;D. They tell us that, as a result of this concession, they are able not only to increase their R&amp;D expenditure but also to get a commercial outcome as a result of their R&amp;D expenditure that leads to extra goods and services being produced in Australia, extra income for the economy and jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We accept that in the time the scheme has been going it has not been able to be measured according to perfect economic theory.

The value of the scheme  would be affected and people could use as an excuse to undermine the scheme, to try to get rid it, the cost-benefit analysis and so on. I can assure Senator Spindler that, in Minister Griffiths and me, he has two strong devotees of the scheme. I can also assure him that all the anecdotal evidence we have from around industry is that there is very strong support for it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As minister for small business, I get many queries raised, with people wanting the cut-in point lowered so that it is easier for small business to get R&amp;D measured and accepted for the 150 per cent tax deduction. I also get requests that the definition of R&amp;D be expanded into assistance for some aspects of marketing. These are all issues that have been raised with us because, overwhelmingly, industry accepts that it is a very valuable tool. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the points raised in the report which Senator Spindler has mentioned is the conflict of responsibility of officers in both DITARD and the Australian Taxation Office. The ATO believes that providing the information that DITARD officers would like to have to properly assess the scheme, providing transparent information about its success and about improving the scheme, could be in breach of the Income Tax Assessment Act's secrecy provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the report&mdash;and we welcome this&mdash;these shortcomings and this difficulty have been dealt with and overcome. We hope that is correct. We want to follow that through. If it means that we can therefore have better information available to us to improve the management of the scheme and understand in a more defined way how it is working, that will add to the value of the scheme itself. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Hill moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of the Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to General Business notice of motion no. 438 standing in his name for this day, relating to the reconvening of Estimates Committee E.</PARA>
<PARA>This matter relates to the scandal currently before the Australian public identified by the Auditor-General in his audit report No. 9 into the community, cultural, recreation and sporting facilities program. That is the program administered by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly). Honourable senators will recall the findings of the Auditor-General in relation to that program when he had the opportunity to have a look at it. He was particularly concerned that, on the evidence available, he was unable to determine the basis upon which grants were made to particular beneficiaries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about a lot of money here. It was a program of some $30 million. In November of 1992, the reallocation of funding for projects originally announced in the One Nation statement resulted in the government allocating an additional $18.75 million to the program. When we talk about those grants that were made in November of last year&mdash;that is, just a few months before the federal election&mdash;we are talking about an allocation by the minister of many millions of taxpayers' dollars to benefit certain sporting or cultural or recreational clubs in relation to their facilities. That, on the face of it, might not seem extraordinary. The question is the basis upon which Mrs Kelly chose one applicant over another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has come out in very recent times as a result of the Auditor-General's findings is that, extraordinarily, it was Labor seats, which accounted for 53 per cent of the House of Representatives, which received 73 per cent of the number of grants and 66 per cent of the value of those grants. Also, on average, the total value of grants to a Labor-held seat was $257,000 and, to a coalition seat, only $141,000&mdash;almost  half. On average, the total value of grants to a marginal Labor-held seat was $326,000 and, to a marginal coalition seat, $163,000&mdash;again, almost double the grant went to the Labor-held marginal seat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question is: was that purely coincidental or was there some political bias, as one would tend to suspect with such extraordinary figures? What is most disturbing is that the Auditor-General was unable to find, from the documents available, the basis upon which she chose one applicant over another. What we do know is that she signed the letters for those who were successful; the department signed letters for those who were unsuccessful. We know the department sent her a schedule, divided into three, of those applicants who were more demanding than others, but the department was then not told of the basis on which she made the final decisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also know, rather interestingly, that she asked the department for details of the electorates within which each grant application was located. How that could be relevant in her determination? Interestingly, the department, to its credit, was not prepared to provide that information until she requested it in writing, so one suspects that the department was suspicious that something unsatisfactory was going on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Auditor-General said, the public of Australia has the right to know the basis upon which applicants were deemed to be found successful or unsuccessful. The most appropriate body in this parliament to get to the bottom of this mess, on the basis of historical experience, is the estimates committee of this parliament. It did not consider this particular matter because the Auditor-General's report came out a few days after the closing date for notice that would have got the matter before the supplementary hearings of Estimates Committee E.

It is impossible to conclude that this motion has been moved in any genuine spirit of inquiry. It is yet another gigantic trawling exercise by the opposition; it is another example of political driftnet fishing. That is what those opposite have been reduced to doing. It is also reflective of the style of politics which has crept into our system over the last weeks and months whereby the personal vendetta replaces other kinds of political approach.

What he is really proposing is that we have a continuing closed loop of politics&mdash;that is, that we have the estimates committees continually sitting all year around, in duplication and in waste.

What we have before us is yet another case of how this government rorted its way to an election victory. It is hard to find people who admit that they voted for the Labor Party. One of the reasons is the rorts that were going on; one relates to the electoral system, which we are uncovering in a committee at the moment; another is the outrageous lies that the government told in lying its way to the election; and here we have an example of blatant pork-barrelling right around the Commonwealth.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has actually given a new meaning to the term `triennial grants'.

Labor seats received 73 per cent of the grants. Marginal Labor seats received double that received by the coalition seats. Labor marginals received $326,000; coalition marginals received $163,000. If anyone wanted to investigate this, there is some factor operating there. Why is it biased one way and not the other?</PARA>

An amount of $96,000 was given to the Logan City workers, rugby and sporting club. One might ask: what is wrong with that?  At the time the grant was made the so-called club did not have a playing field and did not even have a team, yet it got $96,000. I was listening to Mrs Kelly today in the other chamber. In response to a question from Dr Hewson, she said, in terms of the guidelines, that it must be for the upgrading of existing facilities.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1)That, notwithstanding anything contained in standing orders, Estimates Committee E reconvene as soon as practicable to reconsider the estimates of the Department of Environment, Sport and Territories in the light of the significant reservations concerning aspects of the department's expenditure expressed by the Auditor-General in Efficiency Audit Report No. 9, 1993-94, entitled `Community Cultural, Recreational and Sporting Facilities Program', tabled in the Senate on 16 November 1993.</PARA>

<PARA>I move this motion in the hope that the Senate will now agree that the most appropriate method of financial accountability&mdash;the tried and tested method, the estimates committee&mdash;be permitted to be utilised to get to the bottom of this very serious concern that has been uncovered by the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was astounded that the attitude of the Australian Democrats in the previous debate, on the suspension of the standing orders, appeared to be that they would not support the reconvening of the estimates committee. This is the party, of course, that said that it was here to keep the bastards honest, which we always presumed meant the government; yet when we move in this place to allow the Senate committee&mdash;the most appropriate committee&mdash;to simply hold a day's hearing to examine these very serious revelations of the Auditor-General, the Australian Democrats say, `No, we won't permit you to do that. We will not permit the Senate to look at these very serious concerns raised by the Auditor-General in his report'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the problem which was raised by Senator West as to the reason why the committee did not look at this matter when it met a few weeks ago. Of course, as I indicated, the reason was that the Auditor-General's report was put down a few days after the closing of the time by which we would have had to give notice of this line of questioning. So this is the first opportunity we have had to enable and facilitate the committee to meet its responsibility; that is, to be called and, in turn, to call the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) and the bureaucrats to get to the bottom of this very serious matter&mdash;and it is a very serious matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that since this scheme was established there have been some four allocations of money. We are talking about some $60.3 million of taxpayers' money that has been disbursed to sporting, cultural and recreational bodies at the apparent discretion of the minister. That is a very large sum of taxpayers' money. All we are seeking to do is to take up the challenge of the Auditor-General and to try to find out the basis upon which the minister has allocated the money to certain applicants over others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I put to the Senate a few minutes ago when speaking to the motion to suspend standing orders the fact that, coincidentally or otherwise, it seems that these grants that were made just before the federal election were biased very much in favour of applicants from Labor Party electorates&mdash;almost to a ratio of two to one in dollar terms. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That, not surprisingly, was regarded with some disquiet by the Auditor-General, who then sought the documentation which was the basis of the minister's decision regarding allocation. The minister then referred the Auditor-General back to the department. The Auditor-General had already seen the documents in the department and, therefore, advised the Australian public that there was nothing on the record in the department that indicated why the minister chose one applicant over another. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General's view was, quite clearly, that the minister should have to demonstrate why one good cause was regarded as of greater value than another good cause, why it was that so many of these good causes were apparently within Labor Party electorates, and why the Labor Party therefore had the benefit of a huge sum of taxpayers' money immediately before the election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it unreasonable that, in those circumstances, circumstances of major disquiet brought to the attention of the parliament by the Auditor-General, the estimates committee should not be reconvened for a day's hearing to do that job which it does well; that is, to examine the minister and the bureaucrats, get to the bottom of this matter and seek to answer some of those questions that have been left unanswered by the Auditor-General because the Auditor-General has not been able to get the documents? Is it unreasonable that the Senate should be permitted to fulfil the function that it has fulfilled so well over the years?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not talking about great expense to the taxpayers in the scrutiny function; we are really talking about a day's hearing. As I said, when one compares that with the some $60-odd million that has been appropriated to these programs by the government, a day's hearing by a committee that is skilled and experienced in this task is not unreasonable. It would not need any longer. It would meet next week and, as we say in the motion, it would report to the Senate on 6 December. On the first sitting day in the next sitting week, the committee could report to the Senate and the Senate would then be able to address the questions that were left unanswered by the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The argument that cost is a barrier simply does not stand analysis. Senator West argued that point. The argument that the Senate should have looked at it earlier is also not an argument because, as we found out, the Auditor-General's report was, in fact, put down thereafter. The argument that a committee of the House of Representatives is also looking at this matter does not really stand scrutiny because that does not excuse us from our responsibility in this place. </PARA>

I will be interested to hear from the Greens the reason they are apparently not prepared to support the estimates committee fulfilling its function. I likewise ask Senator Harradine, who is here.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be brief because, as is normal with these debates, most of the substantive issues were canvassed during the debate on the motion to suspend standing orders, so I do not see any need to delay the Senate unnecessarily by canvassing those same arguments again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will certainly be opposing this motion. Minister Kelly herself has indicated that she has commissioned a comprehensive review of all of these matters with her own department&mdash;the program, of course, comes to an end at the end of this year, in any case&mdash;but also a reference has been given to the appropriate House of Representatives committee. The chairman of that committee has already made a statement saying that the committee will deal with the matter expeditiously. Why the Senate needs to duplicate that&mdash;the minister of course is in the House of Representatives&mdash;is a strange indictment of the capacity of the opposition members who are on that committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might point out some of the points that have been made that I find passing strange. The government has a majority on both the estimates committee and the House of Representatives committee. That has never prevented the proper scrutiny of these affairs, which will stand or fall on their own merit, I might add, irrespective of what report the committees bring down. The opposition members of those committees are quite capable of bringing down dissenting reports, which is their wont, but all of the issues will be canvassed publicly and that is the key issue. No matter what the report says, we are dealing with the question of public accountability. That will happen in that House of Representatives committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People talk about the estimates committee. I do not know how Senator Hill can talk about the professionalism of Senate estimates committee with a straight face.

If the chairs of Senate estimates committees attempt to bring back the examination and scrutiny of those committees to the estimates&mdash;the committees are hardly ever used for that, in my experience&mdash;they are condemned outright by members of the opposition for trying to hide the truth or trying to cover things up and we then get the issue visited in this chamber. If the chairs of those committees try to be half reasonable, as Senator West was, they are then pilloried for not discharging their responsibilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Tierney asks how I dare criticise the operation of Senate estimates committees. The chair should have been more rigorous, says Senator Tierney, in bringing senators into line. What a load of nonsense! In my experience&mdash;it has been of some years now, both as minister and as a government member of Senate estimates committees&mdash;that when the chairs try to do that, they are instantly pilloried by people like Senator Tierney for attempting to prevent senators from asking questions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A classic example that I recall only too well&mdash;I have never forgotten it because it was one of the most substantial budget variations in my portfolio to come before an estimates committee&mdash;is the $100 million that we put into Aussat. That was one of the biggest supplementary estimates variations to a portfolio that I have seen.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the scrutiny of public expenditure has sometimes been hindered. Senator Schacht, who appeared before us in Estimates Committee E, agreed that the lack of information in program performance statements sometimes leads to an inability, certainly on the part of public servants, to provide answers on the spot. Many of the program performance statements contain only one line. We ask questions; and public servants are required to give the answers. But they do not have the information because not enough information is put into the program performance statements. We are unable to scrutinise properly the spending. Certainly, in many cases they are unable to answer the questions that we put before them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator West, or it might have been Senator Collins, made a comment about public servants coming from all over Australia. I think both Senator West and Senator Collins ought to acknowledge that we made every effort, particularly during the supplementary estimates hearings, to accommodate on the agenda those public servants who were travelling long distances. On almost every occasion they were able to leave early or we were able to make sure that we finished their program so that they would not be an added cost to the country by being kept here overnight. It would not hurt the government to acknowledge the fact that we made particular reference to this at estimates hearings. We made sure that, wherever possible, public servants were not kept waiting for their program to come up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Minister Kelly may have said in the other house that she would deal with this matter as expeditiously as possible. But the only place where this can be dealt with properly, where the Democrats can have an input if they wish and where the whole of the expenditure can be reviewed, would be before Estimates Committee E. Estimates Committee E should be recalled in just the same way that Senator Schacht recalled the estimates committee when he had further information that he wanted to put before it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I withdraw. Senator Loosley chose to make some remarks about something I had said in an estimates committee hearing. He tried to grace himself with glory by saying that he would not name the senator who said it, but that it was a disgraceful remark. I am happy to nominate myself as being the senator who said, `A lot of money for a bit of paint and cardboard'. On this occasion, the difference is, with Senator Loosley not having his facts right&mdash;as has been the case with him on numerous other occasions&mdash;that he either knows the facts are wrong or has not bothered to find out.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When I approached Senator Loosley to try to save some time&mdash;because I know honourable senators do not want to go on for a long time about this matter&mdash;and said, `You'd know that is untrue if you'd bothered to check the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>', he threw up his hands and said, `Well, look, the perception is that that's what you said about the Gould prints, so that's the perception'. He did not come in here and say, `The perception is that a senator said that a lot of money had been paid for the Gould prints and that they were a bit of paint on a bit of cardboard'. He actually said that that is what a senator said. So, for Senator Loosley's benefit and that of others, I make the point that I was on the estimates committee that was looking into the purchase of the Gould prints for the cabinet room, on the instructional preference of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). I asked a question with respect to the framing and mounting of those. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not need to make the obvious point that I will be speaking but ever so briefly, but I am provoked to rise because I heard the latter part of the remarks of Senator West, who was Chairman of Estimates Committee E. She drew in an unhappy way, in my view, the observation that there were members of the opposition not present at Estimates Committee E during the deliberations of the supplementary estimates. She further noted that there were very few questions on the matter of sport and, for reasons of which I am not certain, referred to questions on drugs in sport.</PARA></TALK.START>

I was unable to be at the estimates because I was at the European Parliament on the first occasion and I was overseas again, but ever so briefly, on the second occasion. On both occasions I asked whether the hearing dates could be changed. I do not think it was a problem for anybody on our side of politics, but it was a problem for the minister. I think he was wanting to go overseas himself or wanting to undertake some other duties. So, to that extent, the committee's dates, as I recall at least, were to accommodate the minister. </PARA>

So, in a sense, during the tribunal's first 12 months the superannuation committee will be monitoring its operation as to the manner in which it assists consumers in their difficulties in relation to superannuation. We believe that this is a not unreasonable approach under the circumstances because the tribunal will be very conscious that a parliamentary committee, in the form of the Select Committee on Superannuation, will be monitoring its actions, at the end of 12 months will be conducting an inquiry, and by the first sitting day in October 1995 will be reporting back to the Senate in the terms of the three issues that I have put before the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us see how it copes with it. But establishing the legal centres does not overcome that problem, if there is going to be a problem, for the tribunal. I suspect there will be a heavy initial workload on the tribunal. I believe that would be the case for two reasons.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think many companies, once they know the tribunal is coming into operation, will modify their practice&mdash;at the moment some are responsive to consumer concerns but some are not&mdash;and I think that will minimise a lot of the consumer complaints.

I still do not believe that that phone-in tomorrow, even if it shows up significant numbers of concerns, will necessarily translate into huge pressure on the tribunal and I do not accept that we set up the legal service prior to the operation of the tribunal. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for the first point that the ISC leans towards the funds, I do not agree with that. If Senator Kernot means it leans towards the funds in the sense that it is tolerant of mistakes that are made by the trustees of funds often in ignorance, I believe that to be the case. For the trustees, for example, to change the rules of the fund&mdash;having been a trustee myself&mdash;is not an easy thing to do. There have been many changes to the law that were applied retrospectively, so I think the ISC is tolerant of those sorts of problems that a fund encounters. It is tolerant of that also because it is dealing with, in a sense, lay trustees and it has not been easy during this transition period of improved regulation over the last years for fund trustees in some cases to cope with that change in legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not accept that the ISC leans towards the funds in the sense that it is tolerant of trustees not taking into account the legitimate concerns of the members of the funds. I do not believe that happens. The difficulty at the moment is that the ISC does not have the sorts of powers that it should have to deal with member complaint. At the moment we have a voluntary code of practice where the companies are supposed to&mdash;and I think in a significant number of cases do&mdash;respond to complaints of members of the funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to get around that problem, we are establishing a tribunal. One of the reasons the tribunal is being established is that I do not believe the ISC has been able to deal with those consumer complaints in a ready and effective way. I accept that the ISC leans towards the funds&mdash;for different reasons from those Senator Kernot has advanced&mdash;in the consumer area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, Senator Murphy has just reminded me that many of the funds over the last year or two have established the practice of setting up their own independent offices within the fund. So there is another mechanism.

We must find a way that does not create more financial and economic burdens for a community which could not feasibly support itself for some time to come. We must find a way that ensures that the interests of other Queenslanders living on the Torres Strait who do not originally come from the islands&mdash;some 20 per cent, according to Senator Ray&mdash;also have their needs met. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the islanders are claiming that the Mabo case strengthens their call for self-determination in the form of free association from Australia, the government must clarify whether, if a right to their land is not extinguished by the accession of British sovereignty, the right of self-government also survives. The point also should be made that even if the Torres Strait were to be constituted as a federal territory, this is no guarantee of greater political or economic autonomy to Torres Strait Islanders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been to all the territories in my position as shadow minister for territories. Norfolk Island almost has self-government and autonomy. The Norfolk Island Act gives Norfolk Island a responsible legislative and executive government to enable it to run itself as much as possible. The federal government makes a contribution of only about $1.15 million a year. That is a totally different situation from that which applies to the Cocos Islands and Christmas Island, both of which have administrators. I believe that those administrators run those islands with very little input from the constituents of the islands. Having been to the Torres Strait a number of times, I think that it does have local self-government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill we are debating now gives the Torres Strait Islanders their own important commission. It creates a separate Torres Strait regional authority&mdash;something the islanders have always wanted. I would say that they would possibly have as much as or even more autonomy than do the two territories of the Cocos Islands and Christmas Island. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point should also be made that, even if Torres Strait Island were to be constituted as a federal territory, it has to be very careful that what it will get is more autonomy. Section 122 of the federal constitution allows for the Commonwealth to make laws for the government of any of its territories, which may or may not include self-government legislation. Bipartisan support is therefore necessary if this were to be the route to self-determination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot help but feel that the islanders have been led up the garden path by the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner), who cannot possibly have cabinet support to endorse self-government by the year 2001 in these terms. In the Queensland state parliament last Friday, Mr Goss, when asked about self-determination for the Torres Strait, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have given no support or encouragement whatsoever for a self-government proposal. I believe it is fraught with difficulties.</PARA>
<PARA>I think it is absolutely irresponsible for Mr Tickner to tell the islanders that self-government by the year 2001 is an option when, in fact, it would have to have the support of the Queensland government to go through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister, by not ruling out some of the demands, encouraged the islanders to believe they are feasible. To be master of one's own destiny is granted to a very few. Most of us do the best we can with what we have, and Australia has plenty. Any Queenslander who feels they want to have self-government and retain free association with Australia must carefully consider what they would be giving up in terms of social, economic and political aspects and ordinary security and support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of self-government in the Torres Strait raises a number of questions which I believe the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Senator Sherry) who is at the table should answer now. How far are the state and federal governments prepared to go with regard to self-determination? We have heard from Premier Goss and he has given it no encouragement. Therefore, I ask the parliamentary secretary to advise how far the federal government is prepared to go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When will the government make the decision clear to the Torres Strait Islanders? What are the constitutional and legal implications of self-government with free association with Australia?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of matters should be made clear to the parliament of Australia and also to the Queensland parliament. But, most of all, they should be made clear to the Torres Strait Islanders who have been led to believe that self-government by 2001 is on the cards. If Mr Tickner has received the go-ahead from federal cabinet, this government is obliged to make that decision clear. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill (No. 3) seeks to make a range of amendments to the ATSIC act. Many of the suggested changes arise as a result of the review of ATSIC carried out under the principal act to mark three years of ATSIC's work. I had some questions relating to the changes to general funding powers and to budget drafting processes which have partially been answered and which, no doubt, will be clarified by the minister during the committee stage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In looking at the overall thrust of the bill, I could not help but wonder whether all the accountability changes will see ATSIC so bound up in accountability that it will not be able to deliver services on the ground. As these changes go so much to the heart of ATSIC, it seems odd to foster them. For this reason, the Greens will not be supporting the thrust of the opposition's foreshadowed amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When concerns about ATSIC's accountability are raised&mdash;as, for example, in Senator Panizza's inquiry&mdash;it is relevant to put on the record the reasons why the Greens are not supporting these changes. I will summarise them because they also apply to the opposition's amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am sure that we will. I am sure that we will keep that option open. I will summarise the reasons why greater scrutiny and new processes being introduced to ATSIC are not favoured at this time by the Greens. Clearly, we are not saying that the agency is perfect. We can all point out areas in which money could be better spent or saved. In that regard, ATSIC is by no means unusual. There are some specific reasons why the Greens do not favour these changes. The chief amongst them is the forthcoming ATSIC elections which will be held in the next few weeks. We believe that an inquiry could dissuade some Aboriginal people from exercising their right to vote in the elections, thus making the regional councils less representative than they should be. As a number of criticisms of ATSIC seem to revolve around complaints of a lack of adequate representation by various communities and groups, such an effect would be counterproductive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I would be very concerned if the incoming councillors and commissioners were thrown straight into a major inquiry when they should be settling into doing the best job they can for the Aboriginal communities which elected them as their representatives. Also, the inquiry would absorb a great deal of the agency's resources at a time when they are needed in other areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third reason that I have given for not supporting Senator Panizza's concerns has also, I believe, been addressed by ATSIC's own review of its first three years of operation. The results of that review are expressed in this legislation. An inquiry could duplicate a lot of the work that has already been done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, an inquiry is possibly premature, considering that ATSIC has not yet reached its fourth birthday. We agree that there is room for improvement but, because of the atmosphere that would be generated, we do not believe that either a parliamentary inquiry or the opposition's suggestion of increased accountability and procedures of greater scrutiny would be necessarily, for the reasons I have cited already, the best means of addressing the issues which have been raised. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="SN5">Senator CHAMARETTE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Panizza asked what the alternative is. The alternative that we suggest is that the newly elected representatives of ATSIC be given a chance actually to put into action the kinds of procedures that are already established. They should be given the opportunity to truly represent their regional councils. Senator Panizza said he will be here next year. If there is a need for an inquiry or further accountability procedures, then that may well be an appropriate time to look at them. The Greens do not feel that now is that time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We support the aspects of the bill relating to the establishment of the Torres Strait Regional Authority. The major concern of the Greens revolves around part 8, clause 18, on page 12 of the bill, in respect of the minister's involvement in making appointments relating to ATSIC. I foreshadow that we will be presenting amendments at a later stage. These amendments have the same effect as the government's proposal contained in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1993. As honourable senators will remember, the government's proposal was rejected by an amendment moved by the opposition and supported by the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the time, I supported the government's proposal but was in no position to influence the decision. Since then I have received a strong lobby from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people across Australia, including the ATSIC commissioners themselves. These people believe that it is only appropriate that if ATSIC is to be, and is to be seen to be, a vehicle for self-determination for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, then all the commissioners who head this organisation should be elected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is in the interests of the government and of the parliament that ATSIC be fully empowered to set its own course in determining what is best for its constituency. Naturally, all the normal accountability functions will remain, and so they should when any government organisation is spending considerable amounts of public funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments that I have circulated would come into operation from I January 1994, so they would not in any way affect the current round of ATSIC elections. In fact, the first time they would be used would be to elect the new commission in 1996-97. This is a full three years away&mdash;almost the same length of time as ATSIC has existed. During that period the organisation would have as much time to mature as it has since its inception. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will present the amendments at the committee stage, unless two eventualities occur. Firstly, the government has expressed a concern regarding the starting date of the change. We want to put on the record that if the government circulates amendments that will ultimately succeed in achieving the same purpose as our amendments are designed to achieve, then I will be happy to withdraw them at that stage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, I understand that the Democrats have some concern about the number of elected commissioners. They feel that, rather than there being 17 commissioners, the number should be raised to 19. I would like to assure them that if they wish to change the numbers, that essentially will have the support of the Greens as well. However, in this instance the particular proposition I am foreshadowing will be to make sure that election is the method by which the commissioners are chosen. This will add to the self-determination principles that the Greens support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I wish to support the foreshadowed amendment by the Democrats regarding the preamble. I only wish that the rhetoric will be matched by the activities of this government and the activities of all the agencies that are attempting to support Aboriginal people on the ground. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1993 is the third and final part of the changes made to the ATSIC act. As we have heard, the impetus for these changes was the report to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) arising from the commission's review of its operations. How healthy it is that the commission should be prepared to review its operations at the end of its first term and how healthy it is that it should be willing to implement significant and meaningful changes as a result of that review.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill puts in place additional provisions for evaluation and audit procedures which will significantly improve accountabilities at all levels of the commission. The government's bill amends the ATSIC act to strengthen annual reporting provisions for regional councils, and guidelines are set down for the preparation of draft budgets which are to have reference to regional plans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overall, this bill puts in place a more simplified and efficient regime for the commission to apply when making grants or loans. These funding powers may be exercised only for the purpose of furthering the social, cultural or economic development of Aboriginal persons or Torres Strait Islanders. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill marks the beginning of a new phase for ATSIC and an opportunity to cement the vision of reconciliation and indigenous self-determination which the commission embodies. I believe strongly that the establishment of ATSIC has been one of the most important developments in Aboriginal affairs in recent times. It is clear that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are determining their own future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">ATSIC, through its system of elected regional councils and policy making board of commissioners, provides a means of empowerment and self-determination. While white Australia is grappling with the processes and consequences of owning its real history, indigenous people are claiming their future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is wonderful to note that there is a record number of nominations for the regional council elections of ATSIC to be held on 4 December. A total of 2,001 candidates have nominated for the 573 positions. This is an increase of 400 since the last and first election. Numbered among the candidates, interestingly enough, are many who have previously been very unsupportive of ATSIC. ATSIC has obviously proven its worth as a representative structure for Aboriginal peoples. These people now want to be part of the action. Three years ago, many people, including many from Aboriginal communities, doubted that ATSIC would survive. But now they realise that ATSIC has established itself as a forceful and independent political voice with real economic power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since 1990&mdash;and I remind honourable senators that ATSIC has been in existence for only three years; one term&mdash;ATSIC has been streamlined, with a reduction from 60 to 35 regional councils. This bill will put in place the final stage of that streamlining process and it dictates the new roles and responsibilities the elected councillors will have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has put forward amendments which will allow the commission to remove regional councillors from office in certain situations. This will ensure that any failure to comply with those duties and responsibilities laid down in the act will be dealt with swiftly. It will mean that a high standard of administrative excellence is expected and will be maintained. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Electoral Commission has noted that the much greater interest in this round of ATSIC elections has had one beneficial side effect&mdash;that is, it has increased the number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people on the electoral roll. It is estimated that an additional 6,000 indigenous Australians have enrolled to vote. I think it is also pleasing to note that of the 2,001 nominations for the elections, 700 are women. This represents an increase of 35 per cent over the 1990 figure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regional and national Aboriginal politics are unlikely to be fully representative of Aboriginal aspirations until they are able to reflect the extent of female influence within the Aboriginal population. Despite the outstanding accomplishments of ATSIC's current chairperson, Lois O'Donoghue, media attention to high profile Aboriginal spokespersons might suggest the dominance of males in Aboriginal politics. But it is the women in many Aboriginal communities who become active at the grassroots level to address concerns about housing for their families, the health and education of their children and employment opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As is the case with most political structures, the broader collective objectives of higher levels of Aboriginal political activity&mdash;whether national, state or even regional&mdash;are often seen as being too distant from the day-to-day struggles of people concerned with immediate needs and the allocation of those resources which might be available to satisfy these needs. ATSIC's emphasis on regional representation stands a real chance of overcoming this problem, perhaps more so than our state and federal parliaments. It is in this regional representation that we can increasingly see the position of Aboriginal women reflected in local communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also provides for the establishment of the Torres Strait Regional Authority, which will supersede the Torres Strait Regional Council and will have powers and functions similar to the commission. I believe these changes will provide more effective representation in policy development and more efficient service delivery for Torres Strait Islander peoples within their region. I assure Senator Boswell that I have noted the arguments he put this evening and I will consider them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principle is that indigenous organisations and representatives should be able to shape policy for their people and not simply manage government programs. They should be able to run cooperative enterprises and administer local government functions for communities which happen to be indigenous. That is what self-determination has come to mean. But it is a political term with no guaranteed legal content. The concept of self-determination must be considered broadly. Indeed, subject to the constitution and laws of the Commonwealth, self-determination ought now to be seen as a non-controversial statement of the legitimate and recognisable aspirations of Aborigines seeking maximum community independence while remaining part of the nation state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To this end, it seems appropriate that the enabling act of the commission should include a preamble which outlines the raison d'etre for the commission and provides a framework for its mission. The original ATSIC bill had one. I revisited the history and I know that the Democrats had a role in having that preamble removed. I want to rectify that this evening. That is why I wish to add a further amendment to the government's bill to include such a preamble. The addition of this preamble is not intended to change the overall operation of the act. The preamble I propose takes into account the High Court's decision on native title and acknowledges the indissoluble link between recognition of the rights of indigenous people and the process of reconciliation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I congratulate ATSIC on its pivotal role in achieving positive outcomes in the negotiations on the native title bill. This role has demonstrated, as nothing else probably has, that Aboriginal politics have come of age. While there is still much to be achieved as ATSIC goes through an important and next transitionary stage towards becoming even more effective, it is important to acknowledge that it is moving forward all the time. The future of ATSIC, as a force in indigenous affairs, depends on strong community support through the regional councils structure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I urge all indigenous people to vote in the elections; I am pretty sure we will have a fairly high turnout. Participation in these elections sends a clear signal that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are very much a part of this nation's political processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also includes amendments relating to an independent review panel which will be set up to review the electoral systems put in place for the elections in December to enable permanent boundaries of regions, wards and zones to be determined before the following elections in 1996. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats support this bill as a continuation of our longstanding commitment to ATSIC as the representative body for indigenous peoples. As I have said before, I think the attacks on ATSIC from indigenous and non-indigenous Australians are basically very unfair. ATSIC has had one term. It is unfair for us to expect a monolithic political view of indigenous people. We do not expect that of ourselves; we are here in our various political parties. I think it is unreasonable for us also to impose on ATSIC higher accountability than any other statutory authority. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak briefly to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1993 because of some concerns I have relating to replies received to questions raised in an estimates committee. Part 28 of the ATSIC bill relates to the establishment of the Torres Strait Regional Authority, which will replace the Torres Strait Regional Council. The coalition supports the setting up of the TSRA, particularly if its establishment leads to less duplication with ATSIC in the Torres Strait Islands.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I would like to bring to the attention of the Senate several concerns I have been pursuing through the Senate estimates process. I have asked a series of questions of the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories relating to the implications of the High Court's Mabo decision for the Torres Strait and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has set very high environmental standards relating to the protection of our waters and the marine, animal and plant life contained in those waters. These are standards that we should uphold at all costs and, where necessary, seek to improve and strengthen. Therefore, I am concerned to ensure that if a marine native title claim is successful in either of these areas, which I understand is a distinct possibility, the owners of that marine native title would continue to be bound by all the environmental protection laws and conditions which currently apply in these very sensitive waters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to say at the outset that I am definitely not implying that the owners of any marine native title in the Torres Strait or in the Great Barrier Reef area do not or will not share these objectives of upholding our environmental protection record. There is no doubt that people of Aboriginal and Islander descent care very much for our environment and have a great affinity with the land and our waters. However, I am concerned about equality before the law of all Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the light of the ambiguous and confusing answers that I have received through the estimates process, I am concerned that a different set of environmental protection laws could apply to holders of marine native title. If this were to occur, it would result in Australians&mdash;indigenous and non-indigenous&mdash;sharing the same waters and coastline being treated differently if a dispute about breach of our environmental protection law occurs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the first hearing of Estimates Committee E on September 21 I asked: if the Torres Strait Regional Authority is established, who will have the ultimate responsibility for environmental controls in the Torres Strait, particularly in the event of a claim for marine native title being accepted? The answer that I received via the Attorney-General's Department was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The existence of any marine native title could have implications for the exercise by the Torres Strait Regional Authority of functions in relation to environmental and other matters. In particular, powers in relation to environmental matters would have to be exercised in a non-discriminatory manner. That is, any native title holders would have to be accorded the same rights and procedures as those accorded to any other interest holders in the area. Further, the proposed Torres Strait Regional Authority would also need to comply with any requirements in relation to dealings with native title areas that are contained in the Government's proposed legislative response to the High Court's Mabo decision.</PARA>
<PARA>Following the receipt of this answer, on 4 November I sought clarification as to this advice and asked which environmental powers of the Torres Strait Regional Authority the Attorney-General's Department was referring to. In an answer provided on notice by the Department of the Environment, Sport and Territories, I was advised that the functions of the authority, as set out in the bill, would not extend to controls currently in place with regard to the environment and fishing and would not entitle the authority to act inconsistently with the environmental legislation administered by the department. But while this is encouraging, on the very next page the clarification I sought from the Attorney-General's Department states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If environmental functions were to be conferred on the Torres Strait Regional Authority then, irrespective of the source of any such powers and functions, their exercise by the authority in respect of any marine native title holders would have to be non-discriminatory for the purposes of the Racial Discrimination Act 1975. Once the proposed Commonwealth Native Title legislation commences operation, they will have to be exercised in accordance with it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Whether a particular environmental law applied to any marine native titleholders would depend on the terms of the particular legislation. If in its terms it did apply, then to be valid it would need to satisfy the conditions referred to in the previous paragraph. Assuming that it did, then any native marine titleholders would have to comply with the law.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the face of it, I think that this answer from the Attorney-General's Department raises more questions than it answers. While I understand the issue of traditional hunting and fishing and other similar issues where indigenous Australians are allowed to continue, within limits, traditional hunting of endangered species&mdash;like dugongs, for example&mdash;I am concerned that this answer from the Attorney-General's Department implies that other laws, like those relating to pollution controls, might not apply if somehow they were seen to be discriminatory against indigenous Australians under the Racial Discrimination Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no intention of scaremongering on this issue; I am just highlighting the response that was given to me by the Attorney-General's Department. I will be seeking further information and advice in the coming months. I certainly would have liked more time to be able to examine this advice from the Attorney-General's Department. The answer was delivered to my office only some time on Friday so I have not had time to examine it any further. However, I will be pursuing this issue along with other information that I have received through the estimates process relating to marine native title, environmental controls in the Torres Strait and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and the discussion regarding self-government in the Torres Strait. I believe that these issues are of concern to all Australians. I simply wish to place on record my interest in this area. </PARA>

Senator Chamarette and Senator Kernot used the excuse that there was another inquiry going on in another place, namely the ATSIC standing committee in the House of Representatives, which was charged with looking at the Auditor-General's report. That was why I decided to move for an inquiry&mdash;going on the Auditor-General's report and the demand I have had from a lot of Aboriginal communities around Australia. </PARA>

I was happy to accept the decision at the time and said that it was only the end of the beginning. Senator Kernot used the excuse that there was an ATSIC election coming. I offered to Senator Kernot to put it off until next year. She did not accept that. I was prepared to put it off to next year, but no, Senator Kernot did not take that one up.

I have never proposed putting a higher degree of accountability on anyone than I am prepared to accept myself. As I have said before, Senator Kernot and Senator Chamarette will have their chance next year, but they should not accuse me&mdash;or my colleagues, for that matter&mdash;of trying to impose a higher degree of accountability on ATSIC than we impose on anyone else. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Bill that is currently before us. I do so because this evening on the channel 7 news there was a very important feature news item in the section called `Money Matters' that related to the implications that could flow from the native title Mabo legislation and also the current situation with regard to the various audits that are being very properly conducted into the operation of the Northern Land Council and the Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account in the Northern Territory. In the context of that interview this evening, the director of the Northern Land Council, Mr Darryl Pearce, made a number of comments that very specifically addressed the issues of audit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I was also interviewed in that particular program. I alluded to the fact that it had been necessary very recently, arising from the considerations of the Senate estimates committees during this year, to refer a very important audit reference to the Auditor-General with regard to a number of very unsatisfactory financial arrangements of both the Northern Land Council and the Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During this year, Walter and Turnbull, consultants to ATSIC, have now made two very significant audit reports to ATSIC on the implications of the Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account which concern me greatly because they affect many constituents in the Northern Territory. I am sure that Senator Collins would share my concerns about the operation of the Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account in the last few years, particularly the issues that have been addressed in that fundamental report of Walter and Turnbull where millions of dollars that is directly the property of Aboriginal people have gone in funny ways and not been properly accounted for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account, whilst it flows through consolidated revenue, is really the accumulation of mining royalties that are very properly the private ownership of the Aboriginal traditional owners. Because a certain proportion of those funds flows to the land councils in the Northern Territory for their administration, it is concerning when the auditors then identify that, because of either lousy administration or perhaps more serious considerations, millions of dollars of funds are, in effect, siphoned off and are not then available to the traditional owners directly or for the operation of Aboriginal communities specifically in the Northern Territory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had early discussions with the Australian National Audit Office as it was setting in place the preliminary audit and I know the range of issues it will be addressing. I am very hopeful that the Auditor-General's report will be tabled in this parliament before we rise in December. As I said earlier, that report is fundamental because it goes to the core of millions of dollars that are not flowing properly for the individual benefits of Aboriginal traditional owners and Aboriginal communities for grants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addressing this legislation specifically, I look particularly at page 5 dealing with amendments relating to the functions of the Office of Evaluation and Audit. I am well aware that my colleague Senator Troeth will be moving a number of amendments to beef up this area so that the specific areas of audit should embrace those that relate to a regional council. This is most important. I would like to have seen the whole section go much further, particularly with regard to the audits of the land councils that operate in the Northern Territory under the provisions of the Aboriginal land rights act and also to the Aboriginal Benefits Trust Account itself. Unfortunately, at this stage it was not appropriate to move that as an amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would certainly urge Mr Pearce, the Director of the Northern Land Council, and Mr David Ross, the Director of the Central Land Council, to very carefully take note of the functions that have now been added to the Office of Evaluation and Audit under ATSIC, to be very mindful of those powers and, in response to the Auditor-General's report that will be tabled here this year, to consider further legislation that may be necessary. As I said in my opening remarks, I was concerned at the exclusive and proprietary interests that Mr Darryl Pearce attempted to take tonight in the debate. I do not think there is any need for any Aboriginal leader or person to get precious on this particular issue particularly where issues have been identified, through the process of audit, as being of very major concern. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe we do have to wait for that report of the Auditor-General in the next few weeks. I anticipate that it will raise very significant principled issues. On behalf of those Aboriginal people living in the Northern Territory, I hope that this will be an ongoing process in the further reviews that will be necessary to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Amendment Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I join with Senator Kernot in expressing my joy at the number of candidates who have offered for election at the ATSIC regional council elections on 4 December. I think it is a very democratic and principled process that has now been set in place. I trust that the new councillors, and subsequent commissioners in the next ATSIC commission, will be very mindful of their audit and evaluation roles. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will address briefly a couple of substantive concerns that were raised by Senator Boswell and Senator Ferguson. Senator Boswell raised the question of the government's position on a potential form of self-government for the Torres Strait Islands. I can assure Senator Boswell that the government has not taken a policy position on what that might be. I would imagine that a great deal of discussion and consultation with the communities in the Torres Strait will have to occur before the government moves to a position on that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to note Senator Boswell's support, as indeed the support of Senator Ferguson, for the establishment of the authority because I believe that it will lead a greater efficiency in terms of the operations of the responsibilities in that region and will be far more warmly embraced by the people of the Torres Strait as a result. But it should not be confused&mdash;and I am sure Senator Boswell is not confusing it&mdash;with any proposition to provide a form of self-government for the Torres Strait Islands. The government does not have a position on that at this time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of the very important question that Senator Ferguson raised of conservation laws, I did not note anything inconsistent in the advice that Senator Ferguson read out. In fact, that advice confirms my own understanding of the primacy of these laws. The reference, of course, to not being applied in a discriminatory way in respect of the Racial Discrimination Act is correct; that is, that conservation laws which apply to all people in Australia will apply to Aboriginal people in a non-discriminatory way. So the RDA does not have any impact on that. I can assure Senator Ferguson that native title rights to hunt, gather and fish will be subject to normal conservation restrictions. I have provided, if not the Senate then a committee of the Senate, with that advice previously. That is the case.</PARA>

The RDA simply says that one cannot discriminate against a group of people in a way which is racially based. Providing that the conservation laws apply to everyone else in Australia in that same way, they will apply to Aboriginal people. That will not be a breach of the RDA if that is the case. If a conservation restriction applies to Aboriginal people, providing that that restriction applies in precisely the same way to any other group of people in the Australian community, it will not offend the RDA.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, Senator Crichton-Browne could not because, with respect, he is turning the Racial Discrimination Act on its head. As I have said before, native title rights to hunt, gather and fish will be subject to normal conservation restrictions. One will find contained within those restrictions the provision for Aboriginal people to hunt, gather and so on. I might add that those rights do not involve the right to hunt, gather or forage to the extinction of the particular wildlife that we are talking about.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Normal conservation rules will apply and, providing they are applied equally to Aboriginal people, they will not offend the RDA.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The one thing I would say in conclusion on that point, though&mdash;and I do not think a lot of people realise this yet&mdash;is that there will be a raft of consequential legislation required to be passed by the states and territories following the passage, which I hope will be speedy, of the Native Title Bill through the parliament. There are a number of laws that will be immediately and obviously affected, a classic example being the Land Rights Act in the Northern Territory. Others include the deeds of grant and trust legislation in Queensland; the Pitjantjatjara lands legislation in South Australia; the sacred sites legislation, and so on. Legislation will need to be examined by all states and territories&mdash;and the Commonwealth will certainly be encouraging them to do so; not that I think they need any encouragement&mdash;and the Commonwealth also, over the next one or two years, will be examining all of its own legislation to ensure that that legislation also is brought into accordance with the provisions of the native title act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We heard a cry of concern in the Senate the other day that the federal government's Native Title Bill is complex.

The thing that is most offensive and obnoxious about the Western Australian Mabo legislation is that clause 7 of that bill purports to extinguish all native title rights in a blanket extinguishment and replace them with a so-called right for occupational uses by Aboriginal people.

Then, to top it off, just in case people think that is giving Aboriginal people too much of a fair go, at the end of that division, it gives the minister the right to even extinguish completely those rights of Aboriginal people in accordance with `for any purpose' under any law of Western Australia simply by the publication of a notice. With the greatest respect to Senator Panizza, what the Mabo legislation in Western Australia says is that Aboriginal people have the right to walk around the place until somebody says they should not, and then they cannot. It is obnoxious indeed and does not, I am afraid, provide the simplicity that Senator Panizza thinks it does. In my view, it will be successfully struck down by challenge to the High Court, which means it does not give anybody the certainty that they are looking for&mdash;which the Commonwealth bill does.</PARA></TALK.START>

I think it has done it exceedingly well. I believe, along with other senators in this chamber, that the passage of this last package of amendments to the ATSIC legislation will help it to do that a lot better.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In general terms, the question is, with respect, premature by a long way. There are a host of constitutional and legislative procedures that would need to be examined. Primarily, there would obviously need to be a significant amount of discussion and consultation with the people of the Torres Strait Islands before the government even came close to clarifying what its position may or may not be at the end of the day in respect of those issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, whether the matter needed to be addressed by referendum would depend on whether the decision taken by the government at the end of the day had any constitutional implications. At this point there is no reason to presume that that would be the case. In fact, my own view&mdash;for what it is worth, and it is worth as much as Mr Tickner's at the moment, considering that the matter has not come to cabinet&mdash;would be that the government would be very loath to propose any solution that would require constitutional amendment. I will tell the Senate what grounds I have for saying that, I think, with some authority. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Christmas and Cocos Islands elected to become part of the Australian community, constitutional considerations prevented those territories being incorporated into the state of Western Australia. I do not remember the detail of the constitutional advice but I certainly saw it at the time. It was a matter of constitutional convenience that the territories had to be incorporated for electoral purposes into the territories of either the ACT or the Northern Territory. I see that Senator Tambling, who I know recalls this&mdash;he was active in public life at the time&mdash;is nodding in agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the reason. Not surprisingly, the Commonwealth was loath at that stage to contemplate something as horrendously complex and, I might add, expensive as constitutional change to incorporate the territories.

<PARA>The amendments allow for the election of the chairperson of ATSIC. In doing so, we have to reduce the number. The existing subsection (1) says, `A chairperson and 18 other'. The effect of this amendment is to substitute the number `17'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first amendment is that this second part will take effect from 1 July 1996. Senator Chamarette's original amendment took effect from the beginning of 1994. This would have affected the coming December elections because the last stage of those elections, which is the election of the zone commissioners, would not have happened until February 1994. It was not intended by Senator Chamarette, I think, that this should take effect until the next round of elections in 1996. So the first amendment deals with the starting date and, basically, the second amendment and consequent amendments to the schedule are consequential upon the definitions of `elected commissioner' and `non-elected commissioner'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was my intention to move this package of amendments in February next year. I would like to have had the opportunity to have spoken with the new board of commissioners. I would particularly like to ask members of the board how to deal with the problem of the reduction of numbers because I know, in consultation with ATSIC, that we have not found an easy solution to the situation in which when the chairperson is elected the zone from which he or she comes will not have its zone commissioner. Therefore, it is desirable to have a by-election or a casual vacancy so that the chairperson can be an ambassador at large for ATSIC and then the zone from which the chairperson comes will still be represented by another commissioner. We could not arrive at an agreed upon position whereby, if the chairperson were to retire halfway through his or her term, the person filling the casual vacancy may come from a zone different from the next elected commissioner. That is something that I want to take up with the new board of commissioners when it meets next February.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said during the second reading debate, the government is as concerned as the opposition about accountability for ATSIC to the point where I think more scrupulous accountability provisions have been provided for ATSIC than have been provided for many other organisations. The difficulty we have with the proposal of Senator Troeth is not so much its accountability ramifications but its unworkability. Frankly, I did not think the opposition would press this amendment because of the horrendous implications that it involves in terms of administrative unworkability and, I might add, sheer cost. It is just out of all proportion to the alleged benefit that would be received.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clause 1 of the amendment deals with regional councils. I make the obvious point that regional councils are not actually in receipt of grants from ATSIC. They consider how those grants are to be spent, but apart from their own relatively small operating budgets, the regional councils themselves are not recipients of these grants. They are simply conduits for the grants to be sent out to the recipients and clause 2 of the amendment covers all of those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government proposals currently before the Senate allow the minister&mdash;a power he does not currently have&mdash;or the commission to request the Office of Evaluation and Audit to evaluate or audit the activities of grant and/or loan recipients. That already exists in what the government is putting to the Senate. What the opposition's amendment does is make those audits from the Office of Evaluation and Audit mandatory. I see Senator Troeth nodding in agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a difficulty with that. ATSIC currently provides around 6,000 grants or loans a year to approximately 1,500 organisations, all of which are subject to financial scrutiny. In fact, the grants cannot be provided unless the organisations are subject to financial scrutiny. Every Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisation is required by its incorporating legislation to have its books of accounts audited every year. Those organisations are required to provide a copy of their audited financial statements to the commission as a condition of the grant. Unless they provide proper audited accounts, they do not get the money. Organisations which do not comply with the requirement cannot receive any funding until they comply. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations incorporated under the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Act, which are still the vast majority, are also required to lodge a copy of their audited annual financial statements to the Registrar of Aboriginal Corporations. The registrar has powers to investigate irregularities in their activities. The registrar may also take action to deregister an organisation which does not supply audited annual financial statements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Office of Evaluation and Audit, which Senator Troeth wants to visit with this responsibility, currently has a staff of about 20 people, and utilises external consultants. With that staff of 20, and utilising external consultants, during 1992-93 the office was able to conduct about 40 audits and complete eight evaluations of ATSIC programs and offices. I might add that this is an additional audit. The organisations themselves, I stress again, have to provide proper audited statements or they do not receive the grants in the first place. But the Office of Evaluation and Audit, with 20 staff and external consultants, did carry out 40 audits and eight evaluations of ATSIC programs and offices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the office was required, as this amendment will ensure that it will be, to conduct an additional 1,500 audits a year, whether they were needed or not, it would require in the order of an additional 200 staff to be employed, plus infrastructure, costing in excess&mdash;I think this has been a conservative estimate&mdash;of $15 million. The proposed coalition amendment, therefore, is clearly impractical. It is unworkable and unnecessary. That is why I am surprised that it is even being pressed. The current government proposals allow the minister to call in that office and request an audit to be done where necessary, on top of all the arrangements that are currently in place, as I have said. It makes no sense to expend this enormous amount of additional money or employ these additional people on the requirement of mandatory additional audits by this office to what literally would be hundreds, if not a thousand, organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment currently before the Senate is already a major enhancement of the accountability of ATSIC funded organisations. The OEA cannot at present audit the activities of any Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisation and the government proposals ensure that that can be done when it is necessary. Concerns about individual organisations can be, and are, raised from time to time in the Senate, the House of Representatives and the committees of either house of parliament. If these concerns are raised with the minister and are given public scrutiny and the minister believes that to involve the office would assist in the clarification of these issues the minister can do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Tambling has already mentioned tonight a number of occasions where the minister has involved this office. We are awaiting&mdash;I can assure Senator Tambling with as much interest from me as from him&mdash;the report of the councils which will be lodged, I hope, in a couple of weeks time. To require by rote, as this amendment does, those additional audits where they are not necessary would, as I say, require the expenditure of around $15 million of public money totally unnecessarily and the employment of a further 200 people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the government's proposals, any organisation which accepts ATSIC funds will henceforth be obliged to agree that it may be subject to OEA audit if either the commission or the minister have cause for concern. I might add, in conclusion, that I think the way that has been carefully constructed, with the greatest respect to the desire of the opposition, which we share&mdash;that is, to ensure the most scrupulous accounting requirements&mdash;involves ATSIC in a significant degree of initial responsibility in that under the government's proposals for optional audit by this office, ATSIC has the power itself to ask for these audits to be carried out without the minister even requiring them to be carried out. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Community concern about accountability is on the rise, expenditures on Aboriginal programs are large and, usually in public administration these days, rising. Outcomes are widely criticised by the media, by politicians, by Aboriginals and by taxpayers and other members of the public. At the same time significant moves are being made both within and without ATSIC for increased Aboriginal control of the agenda. There is a new group of very competent Aboriginal people who along with veterans like Charles Perkins, are determined to use government programs and funds to create a long term independent economic base for Aboriginal Australians. The Federal government of the day, through its establishment of ATSIC and annually increased funding allocation to it supports the self management of Aboriginal persons, in its rhetoric it acknowledges their right to self determination as well as recognition of their indigenous cultural heritage. Self evidently some of these commitments lead into uncharted and unpredictable circumstances from an administrative viewpoint. But at the same time ATSIC commits itself to "ensuring the highest possible standards of accountability for the administration of public funds, (2) a commitment which the most cursory examination of its procedures shows it takes very seriously indeed. And even if it did not want to do so, what choice does it have with the vast array of checkers looking over the metaphorical ATSIC shoulder, each ready to condemn any failure.</PARA>
<PARA>It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It should be stressed that there is nothing new in this trend towards greater accountability. Over a long period in parliament a number of people, but particularly Senator Grant Tambling of the Northern Territory, have raised a series of allegations about maladministration in the old Department of Aboriginal Affairs and in Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC) during the 1980's. The Fraser Government having established the Aboriginal Development Commission in 1980 with a very significant reduction in the extent of ministerial control and oversight&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I am again quoting Mr Fred Chaney&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(for which I was responsible as minister at the time) the present government found defending the allegations difficult. With the proposal to establish the ADC and to substitute a much broader body with democratic Aboriginal control&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>namely, ATSIC&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the then Minister, Gerry Hand, told the parliament "There is no other department or statutory authority in existence in the Commonwealth which will be as accountable as ATSIC". (8) and as Frank Brennan describes Hand went on to defy the opposition to find him "any organisation under this government or any other government which will be as accountable as this structure" (9)</PARA>
<PARA>Well, I think the challenge remains. Who on the opposition side can meet that challenge today? Where is there any organisation under this government or any other government which will be as accountable as ATSIC? The last part that I will quote is whether we:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . apply the same rigorous accountability standards to the States and to other Commonwealth Departments receiving money for Aboriginal advancement. States receive all manner of special funding to meet the needs of their disadvantaged Aboriginal citizens. Aboriginal citizens in any event are entitled to the same consideration as non Aboriginal citizens. Where is the web of accountability&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>where is the opposition seeking this&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">identifying failures in such provisions?&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>to states and other Commonwealth departments? I think we are being unfair here. We expect ATSIC to comply, but we do not apply the same rigorous provisions to state government and departments receiving money for Aboriginal advancement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The committee is really talking about two things: accountability and policies. We are all concerned about the fact that, in many cases, taxpayers' money is not going to assist the people whom it is meant to assist&mdash;the Aboriginal people. It is not even hitting the mark. It is not being properly shared. In many respects, it is not being properly managed. All of the accountability in the world will not overcome that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have seen a number of projects where the money was impeccably accounted for but was a complete waste of taxpayers' money. I have been on the receiving end myself. Some years ago, I suppose 19 years ago&mdash;nobody in this chamber will remember it&mdash;I was accused of losing $55,000 of funding for training and education. I did not lose it; I invested it. I was not prepared to see that money expended because I knew that there was another program of trade union training. It was state government money. Muggins that I was, I saved it; I invested it for the state government in order to acquit it at the end of the year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was barrelled from pillar to post because I had done that. I could have spent it. I could have called for applications for a director of trade union training. I could have set up a number of `courses'. I could have paid for people to get off work and attend those courses. All of that could have been acquitted, but it would have been a complete waste of money because that money was being duplicated by a federal scheme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this situation, we are all concerned that a lot of the money is being wasted. Some of it is being used to very good effect, but some of it is being wasted. I maintain that all of the accountability that can be imposed is not going to overcome that particular problem. The problem really is with the policy direction that is required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe very strongly in accountability. I listened to what Senator Troeth said. I read the opposition's amendment. On the face of it, it seemed to be attractive. It seemed to me that maybe it was not appropriate for the minister, as well as ATSIC, to determine when an audit should take place. That may put a question mark in some people's minds about a particular scheme which may be running quite well. Having heard what the minister said about that&mdash;we have no alternative but to listen to and consider what the minister says, particularly as to the cost involved in any amendment that is put forward in this place&mdash;we probably have to consider whether, whilst the intention is perfectly legitimate, the cost of this particular exercise will far outweigh the benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister said tonight that, clearly, the government intends to ensure that the ability of ATSIC and of the minister to request audits will not be a few words in legislation; it is definitely going to be acted upon. Under those circumstances, unless other discussions in the committee stage go further to clarify the situation, I will support the legislation as it stands. </PARA>

<PARA>This is an improved version of the preamble which was removed from the original ATSIC bill. Some of the main features of this preamble are that it recognises the role of the Commonwealth government in making special laws for people of Aboriginal race. It talks about how Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders were the inhabitants of Australia before European settlement and how they were progressively dispossessed of their lands. It makes mention of real and lasting reconciliation and overcoming the disadvantages of Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders to facilitate their enjoyment of their culture. It is consistent with the aims of self-management and self-sufficiency. It makes mention of ensuring maximum participation of Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders in the formulation and implementation of programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The preamble also makes mention of enabling Aboriginal persons and Torres Strait Islanders to increase their economic status, to promote their social well-being and to improve the provision of community services. It refers to Australia's international standards for protection of universal human rights and fundamental freedoms through the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination and other standard setting instruments. I am pleased to move that this preamble, which was not able to be included in the original bill, be included in the amending bill. </PARA>
