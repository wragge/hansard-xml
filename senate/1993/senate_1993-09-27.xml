<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. In view of the government's decision to split the so-called deficit reduction bill into a series of bills, could the minister explain why the test bill does not constitute precisely the same risk of unconstitutionality as did the original bill? In view of the government's humiliating backdown on the latter, why is the government deliberately prolonging doubt and uncertainty by not splitting the test bill?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The strangest irony is to find the opposition coming in here asking why we are concerned about uncertainty with regard to the budget. The most serious concern that one could have about the processes of consideration of the budget, particularly the revenue measures of the budget, relates to the tactics of the opposition in its absolute intransigence in refusing to recognise the proper processes and the conventions as to the way in which the Senate has dealt with revenue measures in the past and the government's basic thrust of revenue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, I remain as confident today as I was on the day the budget came down that its core legislation will pass. It has always been the case that it would, and it will. I have always been confident of that and I remain confident of it.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a difference between saying there will be a challenge and having it upheld, may I explain to Senator Macdonald, but probably, once again, not in words he could understand. The deficit reduction bill would have been held up and that could have had significant detrimental concern to the revenue of the Commonwealth and, therefore, macro-economic implications. Nevertheless, it is an important constitutional point to be resolved. So the government formed the view, and the Treasurer articulated the view, that there should be an opportunity to test that principle in a manner which does not threaten the revenue. Given the timetable for the introduction of the two measures in the so-called test bill, it will enable those matters to be tested in the High Court without in any way threatening the revenue of the Commonwealth and, therefore, not in any way exacerbating the uncertainty which has been so unnecessarily created.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask a supplementary question. I know that this government may not be particularly interested in the parliamentary process, but how can it be sound parliamentary process to introduce, and expect this Senate to debate and pass, a bill about which there is serious constitutional doubt, as advised to the government by a committee of this Senate, when that doubt can be so easily overcome by the bill being split?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government does not share the view that the original bill was unconstitutional or the view that this one is. We accept that it is important that the potential revenue implications of the challenge to the first bill created too much uncertainty, but it is important that the issue is tested in a manner which does not threaten the revenue and, therefore, have adverse macro-economic implications. Of course, the parliament often passes legislation which people threaten to challenge in the High Court. We are proposing to introduce industrial relations legislation that some of the states wish to challenge in the High Court. We are proposing to introduce Mabo legislation, which some people might wish to challenge. Nevertheless, if it is the majority view of the parliament that it should pass, then it should pass, and the courts are the place to test it&mdash;not here.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs, Senator Cook. I refer to the political upheaval in the Russian federation over the past week or so, in particular, disturbing reports at the weekend of continuing confrontation in Moscow between the executive and legislative branches of the Russian government. What is the Australian government's assessment of President Yeltsin's action in dissolving the Russian legislature and calling parliamentary and presidential elections? What are the consequences for the future of democratic reform and economic liberalisation in Russia? What view has the Australian government formed of events?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1138" SPEAKER="Cook Sen The Hon P.F.S." NAMEID="RF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="WA" MINISTERIAL="TRADE" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The confrontation between the executive and the legislature in Russia should be seen against the background of the historic transformation that is under way across the vast area that was the Soviet bloc; for example, the building of an open democratic society and a prosperous economy in Russia on the rubble of the Soviet system is an undertaking on an epic scale. It should also be borne in mind as a comparison with other newly independent states, which highlights how much President Yeltsin and his government have achieved in the mere two years since the break-up of the Soviet Union. We should not forget that only a few years ago very few people thought that fundamental change was possible in the old Soviet Union.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the path to a durable and legitimate political system is strewn with the relics of the old Soviet era. One such remnant is the congress of deputies itself. Another is the existing constitution, a Soviet document of limited post-Soviet era use. Congress deputies were selected by the old apparatus, the Communist Party, and 90 per cent of them were party members. The congress has rebuffed all attempts by President Yeltsin to compromise with it and rejected virtually all of his reform policies. It openly sought to wreck the Russian government's responsible budget strategy by enlarging the deficit to 25 per cent of GDP.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government believes that congress's intransigence left President Yeltsin no option but to take decisive action to break an increasingly dangerous impasse. President Yeltsin has announced elections for a new parliament from 11 to 12 December, to be followed by presidential elections on 6 June next year. While his action may seem autocratic in style, its democratic content cannot be gainsaid. By calling elections for a legitimate parliament, he is strengthening democratic reforms and preparing the ground for a new stage of Russian transition.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that the finance ministers of the G7 states have added their voices to the broad international support for President Yeltsin's action. That support reflects the fact that the fate of reform in Russia is a global concern. Russia retains 27,000 nuclear weapons. If reform goes wrong, global security could be threatened. The scale of challenge in transforming Russia means the process will take decades.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Russian leaders face frightening dilemmas. Too much protection of the thousands of value subtracting factories means hyperflation, and too little risks unemployment on a scale guaranteeing popular revolt. So even in the most optimistic scenario we are looking at years of continuing tension and turmoil.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be noted that Russia has the richest resource endowment in the world. For instance, it has about 40 per cent of the world's recoverable reserves of natural gas. Two-thirds of Russia lies in Asia, close to some of Australia's most important markets. So, whatever happens, Australia will not be immune to these consequences.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. Notwithstanding the fact that the wrong team won, it is true that a lot of people were there to watch the game. That also occurred somewhat earlier in the finals of the rugby league when the Raiders went out. Everybody recognises that those two events that took place last weekend, which were attended by so many people, the major finals which led up to them and the whole season of those two codes are very important parts of Australian society and are very important to hundreds of thousands&mdash;in fact, millions&mdash;of Australians.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Notwithstanding the fact that, as Senator Zakharov said, during the year four million people attended these various codes of football&mdash;which is a proper reflection of the importance of the games in our society&mdash;historically there has been insufficient recognition of the much greater number of Australians who, during any 12-month period, attend things such as museums, art galleries or many other areas of cultural activity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main reason why there has been a lack of appreciation of this has been the paucity of statistical information until recent times. My predecessors and the counterpart state ministers have taken substantial steps to remedy that through the Cultural Ministers Council and the statistical advisory group in cooperation with the Bureau of Statistics. Some important statistics have been emerging about the economic and social significance of the arts and the cultural industry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, a recent survey by the National Culture/Leisure Statistics Unit of the ABS showed that in 1991 some 8.5 million patrons attended performances by Australian music and performing arts organisations. The Australia Council did research that showed that Australia's museums and art galleries in 1992 received 16.9 million visits; that is, four times as many people went to art galleries and museums last year as went to the various major codes of football in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This does not in any way denigrate the importance of football and sport in Australian society. The fact that Australia takes its sport so seriously was recognised appropriately by the international sporting movement last week. Everybody welcomes that. The last thing I would wish to do is in any way to downplay that. I simply want to put in context that important as that is more Australians get their relaxation, leisure and satisfaction in entertainment from arts and cultural activities than from those major sporting events.

The Treasurer has said that the government's proposed tax cuts legislation is dependent on the rest of the revised budget being passed in `a form acceptable to the government.' Just exactly what does `a form acceptable to the government' mean? Given that the Senate will not be intimidated by such a transparent tactic, is this just a backdoor way of linking the bills together, or does the government now want to avoid paying these unaffordable tax cuts by using a blame the Senate strategy?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Linkage has always been the key element of the presentation and interrelationship between these various tax measures because that is a fundamental question of economic responsibility. We sought to make it clear right from the start, as we do now, that it is fundamental to the deficit reduction strategy and to the medium term economic management that we consider in parallel those things which reduce the revenue with those things which compensate by increasing the revenue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot have a situation where Australia gets to the United States type situation where it becomes impossible for governments to legislate to implement difficult decisions; all the soft, warm and fuzzy parts get passed and the legislature refuses to pass the hard decisions and therefore we get deficit blow-outs and the profound problems of macro-economic policy that concern people.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The lifting of Commonwealth economic sanctions will provide a much needed boost to the South African economy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For Australia, the government sees opportunities for exports of communications equipment, automotive spare parts and accessories, agricultural and mining equipment and technology, environmental technology and services.

I am not in any doubt that the low income rebate will be paid. None of the delay which may occur in the passage of the various pieces of legislation and which could have an impact on the timing of the payment of the tax cuts will affect the rebate because, by its very nature, people do not get the benefit of the rebate until the end of the financial year.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I am confident, as I said earlier, that the legislation will eventually pass in a form acceptable to the government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> With regard to the tax cuts, it is the government's view that the tax cuts should be paid and that middle income Australians are entitled to them, but it is also our view that it is necessary over the four years to pursue a deficit reduction strategy, and we will continue to do so.

Ten of the 14 members of that committee are women. That is one indication of the respect that we have for the role of women in the migration area. Another indication of our respect for women is in regard to the operation of the Refugee Review Tribunal, a body which was recently appointed.

As I said earlier, the role of the committee is to ensure that our contribution to the conference canvasses a range of issues on the relationships between population, development, environment and related matters, including the status of women, health, population distribution, migration, use of resources and so on.

Due to the behaviour of some of the members of the party, they were brought to the attention of both immigration and customs authorities. I believe that that is a normal occurrence when people do misbehave on flights. Each was in possession of a  class 670 visa authorising a stay of one month for the purpose of sightseeing and tourism.

I imagine that, certainly during October, we should be able to announce our new agreed strategy. The reason for the delay is that there has been a pretty lengthy period of consultation between the Commonwealth, the states, the medical, scientific and research communities and, of course, those who suffer from HIV-AIDS or who are at the greatest risk of contracting it. All of that takes time. In the absence of a cure or a vaccine, we need some finetuning and some changes to the previous strategy to make sure that we keep up what has been a tremendous record in the last few years of maintaining a rate of disease that is much lower than many people expected.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Accordingly, there are two main changes to the strategy. One is to give more weight to case load. New South Wales is the state where the rate of infection has been greatest&mdash;it has the greatest number of people infected&mdash;and that is where the burden of treatment falls. Whereas the previous funding formula in its weighting to AIDS cases, as opposed to general population, gave more consideration to the general population than to the actual case load, that has been reversed in the new strategy that will be announced shortly.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other main change is in the area that Senator McKiernan mentioned&mdash;the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. Honourable senators might recall that the late Professor Hollows made a point of saying that because those communities were so prone to sexually transmitted diseases, the day could well come when they would be more than vulnerable to this kind of epidemic and we had to be careful about it. An extra five per cent, or $3 million, will go towards helping those states and territories which have large Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities to make sure that we can combat it. That means that funding of about $52 million will be allocated to the states and territories for hospital based treatment: $30 million will be allocated to the states and territories for HIV-AIDS; and another $21 million will be allocated for Commonwealth education programs, research and the like.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our formula is being altered but the funding is actually being increased. That money for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders does not have to be matched by the states. The new strategy, once it is formally agreed to by cabinet&mdash;I believe it is only a formality&mdash;will please not only those who are at risk from HIV-AIDS but the whole of the community because it is one of those great health worries that we can gradually get on top of.</PARA>

In fact, I have written to the Federal Chamber of Automotive Industries to encourage them to join, and I remain hopeful that they will do so. I strongly agree with the comments that have been made by the Motor Trades Association that it would be a pity if the government had to resort to legislation to bring the manufacturers into line.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The association's view is that the voluntary codes are simpler to administer and encourage a level of trust and confidence between the franchisor and the franchisee. Voluntary codes work better for all sides: for the franchisors, the franchisees and the consumers. I have consistently encouraged all persons associated with the franchising industry to support the code. Whilst to date the response has been encouraging, there is still room for considerable improvement. If significant industry groups do not support the code, then the pressure on the government to legislate will increase. It is as simple as that.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In setting up the code of conduct and the franchising code, the government has given an opportunity to the industry to put its own house in order. I sincerely hope the industry does that in the very near future. I want to emphasise that we do not want to go the legislative route but, in the end, if the major industry groups do not sign the code, the pressure at state and federal level for legislation will grow and I think that would be unfortunate. But if it turns out that way because people have refused to cooperate with a very reasonable code, then it will be on their own heads.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I always enjoy the opportunity to discuss the matters of arcane tax principle and its administration with Senator Watson. It is important for people to realise that there was an anomaly which needed to be addressed with regard to car parking by self-employed persons. Let me make it clear what the circumstance is. That cost of parking by self-employed persons will no longer be deductible for income tax purposes where the parking is at or in the vicinity of the person's place of work; the car is being used by the person for travel between home and work; the car is parked there for more than four hours in total between 7 a.m. and 7 p.m.; and the car is parked within one kilometre of an all-day commercial parking facility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Watson and Senator Kernot, with whom we discussed similar car parking legislation at some length last year, both here and in the committee, will be somewhat familiar with those qualifying conditions because they have a certain familiar ring to them. It is probably appropriate that we should put the taxation of car parking by self-employed persons on a similar footing to car parking for employees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conditions under which parking by the self-employed will be non-deductible are the same as those which make it subject to the FBT. Therefore, because those conditions are the same, it will not be more complex or confusing than the minimum requirement to deal with what is a complex circumstance. People utilise this benefit in a wide variety of ways. Therefore, we cannot have a simple tax measure that will equitably address the very different ranges of circumstances in which people find themselves and which the government and the tax office would have to deal with in setting a proper framework for dealing with what is a very complex situation, particularly with regard to employees subject to FBT.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a complex situation, but complexity of arrangement is not a justification for making something exempt from the proper tax arrangements. Otherwise, we are simply recreating the situation where the people with the best tax accountants pay the least tax rather than tax according to income. Although simplicity in tax is a desirable objective, equity is also a very necessary element. Therefore, we will continue to have to balance those different elements of the tax situation. I do not think it is more complex than the minimum necessary for implementing this equitable measure.</PARA>

The particular testing aspect of the program is being developed and will be introduced in the not-too-distant future. In respect of AMEP and English language training, the government made some quite radical changes to the program 12 to 18 months ago. As part of those changes, there was enhanced funding for the program. As Senator Knowles may appreciate, much of the program is now being administered by the Department of Employment, Education and Training. That may be the reason why there is some confusion in her mind as to the level of funding.

<PARA>Oodgeroo was born in 1920. She was previously known as Kath Walker; a name she renounced in protest at the discrimination suffered by Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders. She gave a gift to the world in the form of her poems and stories about aboriginality and about Aboriginal culture and folklore. Her name Oodgeroo means paperbark; an appropriate name for a writer.

Oodgeroo was a talented writer, poet, artist and educator who made a significant contribution to Australian life, culturally and educationally.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Oodgeroo was born in Brisbane in 1920. She had a tough childhood growing up during the Depression. She was one of seven children in a very poor family. She worked hard at school, consistently topping her year in English. Her education was cut short at the age of 13 when she was sent out to work as a domestic servant. She continued to educate herself through her love of literature. She served in the Australian Women's Army in Brisbane during the early part of the Second World War. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the 1960s she became involved with the government community in adult education.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1970s Oodgeroo became the managing director of the Noonuccal-Nughie Education Cultural Centre on Stradbroke Island as well as establishing the Moongalba Centre where she lectured to thousands of Australians, both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal, on Aboriginal life, culture and history. During her full life she was an unceasing advocate for the rights and advancement of her people. However, she never preached the politics of separatism. She wanted a peaceful Australia with a fair go for everyone, black and white alike. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Oodgeroo enriched this nation during her life with her drive to bring Aboriginal culture and history into the mainstream of Australian education.

Oodgeroo of the tribe Noonuccal died in Brisbane 11 days ago at the age of 72. Many labels have been applied to her in an attempt to encapsulate her extraordinary gifts and achievements. They include: poet, conservationist, Aboriginal rights campaigner, educator, painter and occasional actor. Behind these labels was a person of rare courage, strength and passion. She had a large impact on the development of our nation; an achievement which is particularly extraordinary given the obstacles confronting Aboriginal women.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a schoolgirl, I remember often being asked to read Kath Walker's poetry to the school assembly. I grew up to meet her and know her.

I can testify to the many positive qualities which have been ascribed to her in the tributes which have followed her death. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It goes without saying that Oodgeroo experienced racism first-hand, and it is well documented that she chose to fight it.

<PARA>Oodgeroo's poetry brought her prominence, and with her prominence and eloquence she campaigned for what she believed in. Dr `Nugget' Coombs described her as one of the most powerful influences on public opinion during the campaign for the 1967 constitutional referendum. As a scathing critic of the doctrine of terra nullius, the Mabo decision must have been a welcome repudiation of that legal fiction for her. It remains to be seen whether the promise of Mabo will be realised in law. </PARA>

<PARA>While I would not quite put it like that, it was so typical of her to state her views so colourfully, pointedly and effectively. No-one could possibly miss the point she was making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Oodgeroo was also an ardent conservationist. She practised what she preached. While Moongalba on Stradbroke Island was her home and resting place, it was hardly restful for her.

Oodgeroo was fiery, outspoken and often angry, but she eschewed hatred and violence and preached reconciliation. </PARA>

<TITLE>Medicare Benefits for Optometric Examinations</TITLE>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully shows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.Optometry has been covered by Medicare since its inception in 1975, and currently provides eye care to over 2.4 million people each year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.Removal of optometric benefits from Medicare will increase Government expenditure on eye care, as people will instead obtain their care from a more expensive source.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.The cost to the public of eye care will increase, both through the removal of benefits for optometric consultations and the shift to ophthalmologists who generally charge well over the scheduled fee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.The visual welfare of the community will suffer as people are discouraged from seeking eye care. Many eye diseases, such as glaucoma, do not produce symptoms until they are in an advanced stage. Any discouragement from seeking regular eye care will increase suffering from these diseases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.The removal of benefits for optometric examinations will disadvantage children, as undetected visual disorders will adversely affect their development and school performance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.Access to eye care will be reduced, particularly in rural areas, as part-time and visiting optometric practices will no longer be economically viable, and alternate care is not available.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We therefore request that the Parliament take steps to ensure that Medicare continues to be a universal health insurance system and that all eye examinations by optometrists are covered.</PARA>

I intend to move an amendment to this motion to extend the time for presentation to 30 November 1993. I want to make a couple of very brief points about the reason for the amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The revenue raising measures contained in the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill and the fringe benefits tax on business travel will not take effect until 1 April 1994, so delaying the reporting date of the committee to 30 November will have no effect whatsoever on revenue. In any case, there is a lot of evidence from the industry that this budget has no implications for revenue. In fact, a lot of work is being done by many people in the tourism and accommodation industries which suggests that the contrary will be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is some material in existence which suggests that, as a result of employment losses which will follow any fringe benefits tax on business travel, the federal budget deficit is likely to be increased both because of lower personal income tax collections and because of higher outlays on unemployment benefits. It is suggested that instead of the claimed reduction of $60 million in the first year presented in Budget Paper No. 1, Statement No. 4, these consequential job losses could actually increase the deficit by as much as, or even considerably more than, that amount. Extending the reporting date by a few extra weeks will certainly have no impact upon the budget at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fringe benefits tax matter has been referred to the standing committee which, according to its current schedule, will meet this Friday to hear evidence from the industry, the minister and the department. Unfortunately, the limits above which fringe benefits would be paid on travel and business allowances are not specified in the bill. That is something that will be determined by regulation at a later date. This bill has caused a lot of concern in the hotel and tourist industries and associated industries because of the expected loss of jobs and revenue and because of the compliance costs of filling in the forms and doing what needs to be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has sought information from the industry and has consulted fairly widely on what that limit should be and if the limit should be there. That government inquiry&mdash;it is something the government is doing; it is not part of the Senate inquiry&mdash;has requested that evidence be submitted by 30 September. No doubt, once 30 September comes the government will consider all of that information and will then determine what the limits should be. It is my suggestion and the suggestion of the Liberal and National parties that, having heard what the government has proposed on that limit, the standing committee should then consider that limit, should then perhaps invite further evidence from the industry and should then be able to come to this parliament with a recommendation on this very important matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a very important matter because there have been suggestions that up to 20,000 jobs could be lost. There has been some evidence that the profitability of the industry would be quite severely damaged; that investment in hotel accommodation&mdash;this is very important with the Olympic games coming to Sydney in the year 2000&mdash;could be stopped, and already there is evidence that building projects worth upwards of $30 million have ceased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned earlier, the revenue is not there. The government has assumed that if these proposals are introduced people will keep using business accommodation and travel in the way they did before. That is not the case, of course, as has been shown with the luxury car tax. So the revenue being anticipated by the government is not there. The quality of the Australian product in the hotel and travel industry, in terms of the international competitiveness, would fall, and conferences and meetings would be hit, if this legislation goes through as proposed, as they would be enticed to go offshore, undermining the viability and effectiveness of these facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are alternative ways of addressing any problems that the government foresees with regard to a very few people rorting the system, and no doubt these will be made available to us, evidence will be given on them and suggestions will be made by the industry this Friday morning. I urge the Green senators and the Australian Democrats to support this small extension of time to enable the government to complete its inquiry into the limit of allowances for business travel and accommodation; to allow it to come up with a suggestion; to allow the industry to have a look at that and determine whether the problems it now foresees would still be there if those limits were adopted; and to allow industry to make any other submissions it might like to make on those particular proposals by the government. It would seem to make the work of the committee much more effective if we were to report back after a time when the government had given some indication of what that limit might be. I urge the Democrats, the Greens and the government itself to allow that extension of time in reporting back so that we can properly investigate all these things on the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I re-emphasise that the legislation is not scheduled to come into effect until 1 April 1994, so any delay to 30 November this year will in no way affect any revenue that might be gained. There is some real doubt as to whether there are any revenue implications at all. It will not be holding up the budget bills. I know the Democrats were a little concerned that it might be seen as doing that, but it will not because, as I said, the bills do not take effect until 1 April 1994. But it would allow the committee to make an informed and intelligent assessment and recommendation after the government had come to the industry and said that the limit it is proposing is such and such a figure. So there is no detriment. We are not holding up the government bills. We are not delaying the government in any way. But it would allow the committee to more effectively and efficiently complete its task. I move:</PARA>

Should it be the case that the government does not comply with the committee's request to provide that information or that it is impossible for that information to be provided in any other way to the committee, then the committee has the option to return to this chamber and to ask for a further extension.

With reference to Senator Spindler's remarks, I would say that recently we saw an example where too early a time limit was set in the relation to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and we had to come back to this house to get an extension of time.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of today's date seeking advice on orders by the Senate for the production of documents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Orders for the production of documents, which are known as orders for returns, the documents, when produced, being known as returns to order, can require the production of either documents which already exist and are in the custody or control of the person or organisation to which the order is directed, or the creation of documents which do not already exist by the person or organisation who has the information to compile such documents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Historically, the latter category of orders for returns was more important, and orders were frequently used, particularly by the British Parliament in the last century, to require the compilation of statistics by government departments and other public bodies. Indeed, the OED gives this, a document created in response to an order, as the dictionary meaning of "return" in this sense.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In more recent times, and in the context of the Australian Senate, orders for returns have usually been directed to documents already in existence. There have, however, been occasional examples of the other category of orders.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, during the consideration of the "VIP Planes Affair", the order of the Senate of 5 October 1967 requiring the production of documents relating to VIP flights clearly required the creation of documents containing information culled from various records. The then government, in response to the order, tabled a specially created document and some of the records on which it was based.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More recent examples include the order of the Senate of 29 November 1988 for the regular production of a list of unproclaimed legislation, and the order of 16 December 1992 for the production of a special report by the Auditor-General.</PARA>

<PARA>The General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, GATT, is both the symbol and the substance of global economic rationalism. It is the 1993 equivalent of the 1893 gunboats to China; gunboats to force Chinese trade into the hegemony of European dominance. If it is less physically violent, it is nonetheless the instrument by which the economically powerful seek to dominate and exploit the weak, to dispossess them of their resources and to ensure the unimpeded penetration of the products of rich nations into the markets of the poor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">GATT is euphemistically described as the mechanism for regulating free and fair international trade. This is a cruel euphemism. After 40 years of the operation of GATT, one need only observe the growing difference between rich and poor nations, to note the hopeless debt burden of almost every nation in Africa and South America, the continual flow of material and economic resources from the poor nations of the world towards the rich nations to recognise that GATT has failed&mdash;or has it? Perhaps that has been the hidden agenda behind GATT all along. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">GATT is fundamentally flawed. It is based on the proposition that the market will deliver fairness and equity. All we have to do is remove all the impediments to trade and the market will deliver justice and fairness. This belief is naive at best and at worst a deliberate deceit by those with the ability to control the market. Unregulated markets will always supply the wishes, indeed the whims, of the powerful, before, if ever, they supply the needs of the weak and disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">GATT has been, and will continue to be, inimical to the legitimate interests of the disadvantaged. Moreover, at its very core it runs counter to the urgent need to move toward sustainability every aspect of the relationship between human activity and the natural environment. The GATT overrules environmental consideration. It places a higher priority on trade than on environmental protection. The legitimacy of environmental protection measures is to be judged, not by environmental criteria but by trade criteria. Trade is to take precedence over the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">GATT usurps national sovereignty. Those who worry about international treaties on world heritage or the rights of the child, which includes many people on the opposition side, should be doubly concerned by GATT which subsumes all standards in relation to health, food, environment and investment which may impact on our imports. Abundant proof of this is to be found within the GATT. It is heavily underscored in the cases which have been adjudicated under the GATT rules and also by other analogous trade fora. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The GATT does not allow one country to look at the occupational, human or environmental conditions associated with the production of a good or service from another nation. No nation may look further back than the point at which the good or service enters its territory. The product may have been produced under the most appalling conditions of human misery, exploitation and/or environmental defoliation, yet the importing country is forced under GATT to treat that product in every way equal to the home grown product made in conformity with the higher standards of work and occupational health and environmental protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">GATT thus forces all towards the lowest standards. GATT does not allow the imposition of a tariff to represent the saving made by the country with the low standards. The framers of GATT quite inconsistently will not recognise that, by setting very low standards or indeed no standards at all, the country that does so is providing a subsidy to production. This deliberate blindness, this deliberate double standard, reveals the real motivation behind the GATT. It is to obtain resources and products at the lowest possible price and to hell with the human and environmental consequences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the imposition of high standards of work conditions, occupational health and environmental protection do involve higher costs of production then under GATT the nation that imposes them will suffer declining employment as companies move offshore to take advantage of the exploitative conditions that exist in nations with low or non-existent standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Has a nation the right to protect the conditions of its workers and has the government of a nation a responsibility to protect its citizens and its environment? According to GATT these interests must be subsumed to the pre-eminent importance of trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do the citizens of one nation as citizens of the world, as those with a concern for the world of tomorrow, the world of their children, have a right and responsibility to protect the global environmental when its integrity is being damaged by another nation? According to the GATT they do not. Under GATT Australians may not refuse the importation, for example, of tropical rainforest logs no matter how unsustainably the forests supplying those logs are being exploited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991 a GATT panel began adjudicating a complaint from Mexico that the US was infringing the GATT. The US had passed the Marine Mammal Protection Act which sought, inter alia, to protect dolphins caught by purse seine netting of yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. The law set a limit to the number of dolphins which may be taken relative to the catch of tuna. For imported tuna it set a limit of 25 per cent above the allowable US limits. Under this law imports of yellowfin tuna from Mexico were banned. The GATT panel found that the law infringed the provision of the GATT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether Mexican fishermen were catching an excessively large number of dolphins in the course of their tuna fishing was never at issue. The GATT panel specifically considered this as irrelevant. What was at issue was whether the US could pass that legislation within the GATT rules. The panel found that GATT did not allow laws which operated extraterritorially. For example, the panel said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A country can effectively control the production or consumption of an exhaustible natural resource only to the extent that the production or consumption is under its jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA>The panel also considered that if:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . each contracting party could unilaterally determine the life or health protection policies from which other contracting parties could not deviate without jeopardising their rights under the General Agreement&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the rights of unrestricted entry to markets in that country&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the General Agreement would then no longer constitute a multilateral framework for trade among all contracting parties but would provide legal security only in respect of trade between a limited number of contracting parties with identical internal regulations.</PARA>
<PARA>The principle of the lowest common denominator with respect to environmental and other protection could not have been more clearly spelt out. The panel could not have expressed the dominance of trade over all other considerations more succinctly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The restriction which the US had sought was on the import of tuna caught in such a way that an excessive number of dolphins were also caught. The panel found that the GATT:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . calls for a comparison of the treatment of imported tuna as a product with that of domestic tuna as a product. Regulations governing the taking of dolphins incidental to the taking of tuna could not possibly affect tuna as a product and that therefore (GATT) obliges the United States to accord treatment to Mexican tuna no less favourable than that accorded to United States tuna, whether or not the incidental taking of dolphins by Mexican vessels corresponds to that of United States vessels.</PARA>
<PARA>There are disturbing parallels in bi-, tri- and other multinational trade agreements which are modelled on GATT and from which GATT draws legitimacy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In late 1988 the Canada-US Free Trade Agreement was ratified. The FTA, as it is called, requires both countries to forgo the use of regulatory devices that could prevent the development of fossil fuel resources for export. Subsidies for oil and gas exploration and development are given special status and insulated from attack under the trade protection laws of either country. Subsidies and other programs intended to encourage energy efficiency and conservation are given no similar protection under the FTA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The FTA obligates Canada to share its resources with the US even when it is rationing them domestically and no matter how severe the environmental impacts of exploration or exploitation. The FTA assures the US secure supplies of energy at stable and reasonable prices by proscribing future government interference in the trade in energy resources. It is highly significant that this FTA has frequently been described as a model for other bilateral and multilateral agreements, including GATT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In late 1989 Denmark was taken before the Court of Justice of the European Community because it had had the temerity to issue a waste reduction regulation that required all beer and soft drinks to be sold in returnable containers. In considering this case, the court noted the obligation established by the EEC treaty to preserve, protect and improve the quality of the environment. It found that the Danish regulations were a bona fide and successful effort to accomplish these environmental objectives. Despite this, the court found that Denmark was in breach of its trade obligations under the EEC, saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There has to be a balancing of interests between the free movement of goods and environmental protection, even if in achieving the balance the high standard of the protection sought has to be reduced.</PARA>
<PARA>GATT allows a nation to give priority to human health over trade liberalisation provided&mdash;and I stress this&mdash;that the measure taken is necessary. The panel which considered the Thai tobacco imports said that the import restrictions could only be considered necessary if:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . there were no alternative measure consistent with the General Agreement, or less inconsistent with it which Thailand could reasonably be expected to employ to achieve its health policy objectives.</PARA>
<PARA>The panel then went on to consider some alternatives. In short, the panel, whose brief was trade&mdash;a trade panel not composed of health experts&mdash;made and imposed a decision which vitally affected the health of the Thai people. Again, Australians who have expressed nationalistic indignation at the prospect of international agreements on the rights of the child or world heritage interfering with homemade decisions should really jump up and down, not only at the restriction of sovereignty in the determination of suitable health measures but especially at the very narrow, inexpert and unrepresentative criteria used by GATT panels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Great concern should also be felt at the imminence of the signing of the Uruguay Round and the role of the Codex Alimentarius Commission, the setting of standards for the quality of food products. For example, the Codex allows levels of DDT in various foods between 20 and 50 times those allowed by the US EPA. Aldrin and heptachlor, which are strictly controlled in Australia and which many hope will shortly be totally banned, are allowed in food under the Codex. The patenting of genes, life forms, plants and animals was bitterly debated in this chamber only a few years ago with government and opposition supporting patenting. However, I think honourable senators will agree that profound ethical questions surround this issue. Under the GATT, far-reaching and potentially dangerous decisions in this area will be based on considerations of trade, and not on informed ethics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The careless aside made by officers in Senator Cook's department a few weeks ago that when decisions in relation to GATT are taken by vote, the vote results in the south voting against the north, in itself indicates what the GATT and Uruguay Round are about. The chief priority of the industrialised countries in the Uruguay Round is to extend their control over the global economy. In the past, this was achieved through a mixture of colonialism and the threat of military intervention. Today, it is hoped that GATT and the threat of trade retaliation will serve the same purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the Uruguay Round, under the extension of GATT into financial and intellectual property, Third World countries may be on the point of being pushed back to the colonial era. Third World governments may then not only be unable to advance the economic and social wellbeing of their people, but they may also be obliged to protect the interests of large transnational corporations against their own people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The GATT rounds and processes are primarily oriented towards gaining greater access to resources and markets by large transnational companies. It is naive of our government to think that in our slide towards Third World status we will miraculously become a beneficiary under the Uruguay Round rather than a victim. These rounds and processes are inimical to the wellbeing and health of the majority of the world's people and run counter to the urgent need for a global move towards greater awareness and protection of the environment. This urgent need to develop and implement patterns of sustainable use of the environment is far more important than trade. Australia should lead the way in replacing GATT with GAST, a general agreement on sustainable trade.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not quite sure where I should begin after all that. The accusation that GATT does not represent the general agreement on tariffs and trade, but rather represents some sort of gunboat attack on Third World tariffs, seems to be the theme of Senator Coulter's debate. About the only area of the debate that he did not touch on was to congratulate the French farmers on their current stand in the GATT negotiations. If we followed his theme, that is what he should be doing, but he did not mention that in his speech.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think Senator Coulter has a fundamental understanding of the nature, purpose and process of the GATT. Senator Coulter links the alleged growing gap between rich and poor nations with the last 40 years of the operation of the GATT. Certainly, the GATT has operated for 40 years. Some countries are doing a great deal worse and some are doing a great deal better. That may be fact, but is it fair to link those two factors?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would argue that, for example, in the case of many of the African countries which have not done well over the last 40 years it is not because of the GATT. A variety of economic, political and social factors have led to very severe economic and social conditions in some of those African nations. Conversely, many nations, particularly in Asia and some in Latin America, have done very well over the last 40 years. I do not believe that because the GATT has existed for 40 years and some countries have done very poorly one can necessarily conclude that it is because of the GATT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would argue that many of the former colonies of Africa did not do well because when they became independent much of their infrastructure was destroyed by the removal of much of their bureaucracy. Generally, there was not a lot of preparation for independence for those countries. There was very little education and training of their work forces. The coupling together of ethnic groups in the countries of Africa bore absolutely no resemblance to any logical, geographical ethnic boundaries. There is a whole range of reasons why African countries generally have not done well economically over the last 40 years or so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is an assertion that the GATT usurps national sovereignty. In some respects, it allows countries to provide for a more fair and open trading environment. There are certainly some disadvantages in some sectors of national economies. But, at the same time, there are generally great advantages, particularly economic&mdash;even for the French. France is about the only area that Senator Coulter did not mention. Even French farmers would be better off, the wacky French farmers who are protesting and burning bales and tyres all over France and outside Paris, trying to maintain the ridiculously high level of subsidies on what they produce, all in the cause of some quaint, emotional, notional treatment that French men&mdash;generally French men, not French women&mdash;should be kept on the land. That is just wacky. The notion is completely absurd. As a nation, even the French would be better off if the GATT round that is currently being negotiated is concluded. So, yes, it might usurp some aspects of national sovereignty, but that usurpation of national sovereignty is generally to the greater good of those nations and of world trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coulter poses the question: `Has a nation the right to protect the rights of its workers?'. Very simply, yes, it does. We protect the rights of our workers in this nation. Interestingly&mdash;the opposition disagrees with this&mdash;we can protect the rights of workers by the use of International Labour Organisation conventions, a series of international conventions and treaties which assist the rights of workers. We have an international treaty which actively protects the rights of our workers as well as our own internal legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other criticisms that I have to make of Senator Coulter's approach. I sum them up by saying that Senator Coulter's view is a First World elitist view. He is basically arguing that the countries of the First World&mdash;Europe, North America and Australia&mdash;should maintain tariff barriers to the exclusion of many of the developing Third World countries. I absolutely and fundamentally reject that. If one asserts that we are one world with one citizenry, that we are to have that outlook on the world, then one cannot necessarily come to the conclusion that those former Third World countries&mdash;Korea, Taiwan and Thailand&mdash;are all developing and prospering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might disagree with much of the political, social and economic environments within those countries. I disagree with the way many of the workers are treated. I disagree with the political repression. But generally those societies are performing economically better. To simply say, `Keep tariff walls high, keep out their goods and services and they will be better because of it' is absolutely absurd. As I have said, it is basically First World elitism. The only way the world can grow and prosper economically is for the initiatives that have been launched under the GATT banner to continue and to be developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The GATT sets out principles on which international trading systems operate. It is not a branch of the United Nations. It is not an institution in itself. It is a trade agreement in which all the members, who are known as contracting parties, are in effect the directors of their trade. The GATT secretariat is a servicing body. It has around 400 persons. The GATT has no coercive powers. Disputes have to be referred to the various parties collectively for some form of collective decision making. The GATT itself does not seek out potential breaches of commitment. It does not provide for the payment of fines. The only sanction, which has been used once, is a suspension by the injured parties of their obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The GATT is a code of rules of behaviour in relation to international trade. It provides collective protection for the small country against the strong&mdash;not, as Senator Coulter would allege, an opportunity for the strong to exploit the weak. That is simply not the case. Without the GATT as a reference point the economically strong powers, through their market strength, can coerce and shape the policies, both economic and social, of smaller countries. Many smaller countries have prospered under the GATT regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The GATT does not intrude into the internal sovereignty of countries. They are free to set their own economic agendas, and there is a very diverse range of economic agendas within the countries that are members of GATT. The trade occurs because of the interplay of the world economies, not because GATT exists. All the GATT does is to ensure that trade takes place on a fair and predictable basis. Policies followed by the individual contracting parties are their own affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the context of the motion that is before us today, the statement is made that there is a need to reorient all economic activity towards ecological sustainability. This infers that the GATT itself sets trade targets, directs trade or engages in trade. The GATT does not do that. It is not that sort of organisation. Trade is carried out by individuals within the framework set up by their own countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sustainable development policies, which are very important&mdash;and this government acknowledges that&mdash;are not formulated by the GATT, but are formulated elsewhere. They are formulated at either a national level, as this government has been doing, or by other international negotiations that are especially set up for that purpose. That is in precisely the same way as health, social, employment or industrial relations policies&mdash;I referred earlier to the ILO&mdash;are established. In the 46-year history of the GATT there has been no dispute arising through the carrying out of obligations under other international agreements such as, for example, the convention for the trade in endangered species. The GATT does not cut across that and undermine it in any way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The GATT generally does not have views on these matters nor does it seek to set international standards in those other areas. It defers those questions to other international organisations. It is hard to see therefore in this global universality the acceptance of a perception not only by Australia but also the rest of the world that the GATT is, as stated in this motion, `naive, dangerous and contrary to the urgent need to reorient all economic activity toward ecological sustainability'. In fact, the opposite of what is being asserted in this motion put forward to us by the Australian Democrats today is true. The GATT, by providing a rules based trading system with non-discrimination as its cardinal principle, ensures that the general anarchy that could evolve is minimised and that many of the trade problems are discerned and solutions sought and found. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an agonising process watching this particular Uruguay Round which I understand is the eighth set of negotiations under the GATT. It does have a wide agenda and that will bring services and intellectual property into the GATT system. But this does provide very significant benefits to a relatively small country such as Australia in providing some certainty in our trade negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can still be injured by other countries' trading policies but the position would be much worse in the absence of GATT. There is no way that the destruction of the GATT could be considered in this country's national interest. In any case the GATT is not something for Australia to play with, but is a critical agreement to most of the countries in the world. Australia would not be allowed to damage it; we would only succeed in marginalising Australia. </PARA>

If the Uruguay Round is successfully completed there will be benefits of approximately $2.5 billion a year to Australia. As I said earlier, whilst there will be, as there should be, some reductions in the ridiculous subsidies, those wacky French farmers who are out protesting everywhere and the French nation as a whole will benefit from the GATT negotiations and the Blair House agreement in its current form. </PARA>

In fact, many Third World countries will do much better in trade terms if the GATT negotiations are successfully concluded, so I ask the Senate to reject this matter of urgency. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also oppose the motion, not because we in the coalition are against the principles which the Democrats and Senator Coulter are pursuing&mdash;that is, ecologically sustainable development&mdash;but because we believe that marrying trade negotiations with environment constraints is inappropriate and not very practical.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with Senator Sherry that we have to aim for increased economic growth. One of the preconditions of economic growth and higher incomes around the world as well as here in Australia is freer trade. Trade and competition are not sufficient but are necessary for increased wealth around the world within particular countries and around the whole globe. So we in Australia have been pushing certainly for many years now to reduce the barriers to trade, as have many other countries, and we have been signatories to GATT since its formation after the war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also agree with Senator Sherry that this matter is of particular importance to developing countries. It is the people of the really poor countries of the world who are at most risk from these trade negotiations. We in Australia have had the advantage of experiencing economic growth. In our lifetimes we have seen incomes per capita rise in real terms by three times since the end of World War II. Actual per capita incomes in Australia in about 1947 were about $7,000 in 1991 dollars and in 1991 they were about $22,000. That is a rise of about three times. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all understand that out of that we have had options to spend more on the environment and clean up our environment as well as recognising through better education and communication what needed to be done. The South East Asian tigers have had growth about double the rate of ours and instead of trebling incomes over a 40-year period, they have trebled them over the last 20 years. Compare that with countries which have not pursued free trade such as Brazil and which have gone backwards. So there is not any question: we have to open up the world for trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The GATT is an agreement involving 105 countries. It is aimed at tariff reduction only essentially but without conditions. Of course, the last round, the Tokyo round in 1987, resulted in a reduction of average tariffs in the industrialised world from 7.4 per cent to 4.7 per cent. The Uruguay Round has been under way for seven years. In this whole business Australia is a minor player, but we should be supporting the USA in the Blair House agreement with the EC and we should be pushing for settlement of the GATT agreement by the end of this year. As Senator Sherry said, there are large benefits for this country and large benefits for the whole of the world. For the whole of the world the estimates are about $200 billion, or about half of Australia's GDP, being added to the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We in the coalition are also in favour of ecologically sustainable development, but I believe it is impossible for us to marry one ideal with the other. We are only a small player. If one looks at the history of GATT and the agreement of those 105 countries, one will see that it is virtually impossible to try to impose conditions on those trading agreements. Rather, we should work to try to persuade people in the developing countries in particular, and throughout the world, to improve the way they manage the ecology of the world. It has to be done but it is a very difficult task. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had some personal experience of endeavouring to work in a developing country. Many years ago I had a United Nations job with the Food and Agriculture Organisation and worked for about a year with the poor peasants in the hill country of Jamaica, trying to persuade them to stop their ecologically damaging practices of shifting cultivation. They were actually farming 30-degree slopes, growing beans and other vegetables. When the summer rains came, that soil got washed out to sea, and they would move on and clear the next bit of forest and so on and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Shifting cultivation is basically acknowledged as the worst ecological problem in the poor world. I do not think trade has anything much to do with it, because most of the products that come from shifting cultivation are in fact consumed within the developing countries where they are grown. We have to try to persuade the people who find themselves in those terrible situations to adopt better practices and to open up those countries to trade. In fact, in the country where I was working, it was the rich people of the country who were putting restrictions on trade and therefore holding down the incomes of the poor people in the hills who were indulging in these terrible practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, we have to pursue the GATT trade negotiations. I think it is sad that during his recent visit to Europe, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) did not schedule further trade talks with Germany, France and Belgium in order to put further heat on for finalising the GATT negotiations by the middle of December. Whilst we applaud the intentions of the Democrats, I am against the motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Listening to the last two speakers, I wonder to what extent they are familiar with the current GATT round of negotiations. I wonder whether they are aware of exactly what that round provides. I wonder whether they know that it is aimed at a continuing reduction of any type of support for manufacturing and other industries in any country with the aim of bringing about a global free trade situation. I will return to that in a moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague Senator Coulter has placed before the Senate in considerable detail the Australian Democrats' concerns about how GATT is structured and how it works to depress environmental safeguards, wage levels, working conditions and quality of life to the lowest global common denominator. It will be useful to extract from this detail some general principles which indicate this government's policies on world trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These concerns can perhaps be best illustrated by juxtaposing two items of information. First, evidence was given to my inquiry into tariffs and industry development that Chinese textile industry workers were paid a wage of $20 for a 48-hour week with no work safety provisions and no environmental safeguards. The second item is Professor Garnaut's quite ludicrous&mdash;in view of that fact&mdash;proposal some months ago that we should establish a free trade zone with China; a proposal which was immediately and warmly welcomed by Prime Minister Keating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, it is important to remove some of the outrageous trade barriers which currently exist in the world. I refer particularly to the ones that the United States, France, Germany and, to some extent, Canada have erected against Australian agricultural produce. In the main, these are in the form of subsidies which allow their farmers&mdash;for instance, through the United States export enhancement program&mdash;to push Australian farmers out of our traditional markets. This distortion has gone so far that some American farmers are deriving the bulk of their income from these subsidies. As an example, in Illinois in 1991 farmers derived more than 90 per cent of their income from subsidies while hundreds and thousands of Australian farmers were&mdash;and they still are&mdash;going to the wall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We need to be careful, though, that we do not achieve reforms at the expense of our workers, our living standards, our environment, our industries and even, in the long term, our farmers. In the future when all barriers are removed and all countries are competing on an absolutely free trade basis, our farmers might be forced to farm the land in such a way that they will destroy it&mdash;and we have become conscious of that in recent years. They may fall, once again, below subsistence level, this time not due to the subsidies offered by other countries but because there are absolutely no limits and protections anywhere in the world in respect of maintaining standards either for our farmers or for anyone else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the attempt in the current Uruguay Round to remove these distortions succeeds&mdash;and the Democrats support this&mdash;it will be an extremely good result, for now, for Australia's primary producers. However, it does not follow that the government is entitled, as a necessary consequence of removing such extreme distortions in one particular industry, to continue its suicidal strategy to open up Australia's domestic market to cheap imports, many of which are produced at a cost which is one twenty-fifth of that which Australian manufacturers face, right across-the-board. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a global sense, the Australian government is becoming a party to an agreement which will ensure that goods will continue to be produced in slave labour conditions and with total disregard of the environmental standards which we take for granted. The consequence is twofold: the often subhuman conditions under which these goods are produced will be perpetuated; and bankruptcies and unemployment will continue to rise in Australia. Once again, it needs to be put on record that Australia needs an industry by industry assessment and a sectoral, positive industry and trade policy which integrates economic and social objectives and maximises the comparative advantages that a particular Australian industry has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The GATT agreement, as it stands, clearly does not meet these requirements. Contravention of a country's health standards is the only ground currently admissible under GATT for the refusal of entry to goods into that country and, occasionally, even this may be circumvented. Clearly, if we are to develop an industry strategy which takes into account Australia's wage levels, working conditions, work safety standards and environmental safeguards, and which lifts global standards to at least these levels instead of the other way around, we must introduce a degree of flexibility into GATT. In particular, we must admit factors and circumstances which were part of the production process in assessing how a particular product could be treated under GATT rather than just the condition or properties of the finished product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In direct questions to the minister, in the departmental briefing he courteously provided and in any other government statements, there is no trace, no indication, that the minister, his predecessors or any official acting on behalf of the Australian government have, at any stage, sought to introduce any measures or modifications to GATT to minimise the very real dangers of the present model. Nor has there been any consultation with the community or any public assessment of the consequences if Australia signs this particular GATT agreement. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to address the urgency motion moved by Senator Coulter. As with any of his motions and speeches, on this occasion the former Australian Democrat leader is again doing no more than satisfying his marginal constituency, his marginal followers, who sit in an unreal world and who are constantly going off on intellectual tangents. The former Democrat leader uses words in his motion such as `naive' and `dangerous' in respect of the current formation of GATT.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it is recognised that the GATT discussions&mdash;in particular, the Uruguay Round, launched in 1986&mdash;move at glacial pace and are frustrating, and that at times the word `GATT' is ridiculed as standing for no more than `general agreement to talk and talk', it is neither a dangerous nor a naive organisation, as Senator Coulter would have us believe. Rather, GATT is a well established organisation with 105 contracting parties, a secretariat of over 400, and committees and working parties which are set up to deal with current questions relating to trade between nations. It is, in fact, the United Nations of trade. It is a servicing body with no enforcement powers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be `dangerous' and `naive', to use Senator Coulter's words, not to pursue the current negotiations and format of GATT. It would be dangerous and naive for Senator Coulter to suggest that Australia opt out, or change the current format, of the GATT round. It is estimated that a successful end to the current Uruguay Round of agreements would mean an extra $1 billion per year in agricultural trade to Australia alone; that is some $10,000 per Australian farmer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is estimated, as was stated by the government, that Australia's trade overall would increase by some $2.5 billion. At a time when the Australian rural sector is facing its worst terms of trade in its history, this would be a welcome relief. It means access to new markets; that is the bottom line. At a time when the world growth has come to a virtual standstill with no optimistic predictions being made for over the next five years, the opening of new markets, or better access for Australian produce in agriculture, is fundamental to Australia lifting itself from the bottom of a recession; and it is fundamental to the lives of families of rural Australians. There is no other answer for the well-being of the now struggling and desperate rural sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The alternative for Australia, a small player in world trade, could be ruinous. Without GATT, trade wars would intensify and trade blocs would develop. We would be beaten in this war before we started; Australia would be the first country to go out backwards. It would be a case of: who is in a trade bloc and who is not in a trade bloc? Existing world trade blocs, common markets or communities of cooperation would stiffen their resolve. NAFTA, for instance, could well include agricultural products if the GATT round were to fail, which would exclude important access of wool and beef into that trading region. Australia would be left to rely on membership of an Asian bloc which would be willing to include it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As an economic measure of the effect of the world closing up its trading blocs, I refer to a paper&mdash;discussion paper No. 2&mdash;produced by the Australian Chamber of Commerce. It claims pessimistically that Australia's GDP would be lowered by 3.5 per cent relative to what it would be in 1993; the exchange rate would fall 15.5 per cent; inflation would increase by 4.9 per cent; interest would increase by 2.9 per cent; and unemployment would increase by one per cent. That is what Senator Coulter's sort of economics would bring down upon the Australian economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, given the short time, and the cooperation needed with these motions, I would however say that I do not think for a minute that this is an easy process we are going through; and I do not think the government should build its agricultural policies exclusively, as it has done, around a GATT instigated breakthrough at some point on the distant horizon. Farmers have been told for well over a decade that they have to wait for GATT. They are still waiting. The government has used the GATT negotiations as the cornerstone of its primary industry policy. That has failed too. I happen to think a narrow band of policy settings based on the prospects of GATT is equally seriously dangerous and naive for the Australian farm sector. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In supporting this motion, I would like to point out that the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade was established in the wake of World War II as a counter to colonial domination and control of trade. Ironically, the Uruguay Round would bring us full circle, where it is multinational corporations acting as the dominating and controlling agents of trade. GATT is not an organisation to regulate trade, it is true. It will not make it fair or safe; its brief is to remove regulation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The direct implications of GATT include the erosion of national and international environmental standards&mdash;for instance, the famous US dolphin-tuna standards&mdash;and a similar thing may occur with rainforest timber in respect of the barriers against unsustainably harvested timber. The multilateral trade organisation that is to be set up will specifically target environmental, social and work related `barriers to trade'. There would be erosion of public health and consumer protection standards, through the Codex Alimentaire being substituted for national standards. It is not true that these will not be affected. This would not be able to be addressed by labelling, as differentiation of products may be considered also to be an unfair trading practice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There would be further deregulation of the financial sector and financial services, which was at the root of the currency speculation that arose largely since the middle 1970s. Global trade in the short term money market is now over 75 times greater than trade in all real goods and services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There would be increased regulation of intellectual property, which has been mentioned already. This process guarantees corporate control of items such as the smokebush in Western Australia which has been patented as a treatment for cancer by a United States company. Free scientific information published in major journals has been patented by companies not involved in its development; and recently the United States granted one company a patent on all future transformation by anyone of the cotton genome until the year 2017. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The indirect implications of the Uruguay Round of GATT are even more frightening. They are already evident in areas such as the US-Mexico border. The freedom of movement for corporations allows them to site wherever costs are lower&mdash;for example, where there is the cheapest labour and the least environmental and occupational health regulation. The loss of jobs in nations with stronger standards as corporations relocate creates continual pressure to reduce standards in the nations with higher standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Downward pressure exists everywhere. Korea says that its wages cannot be maintained because they make labour uncompetitive with Indonesia or Thailand. Thailand cannot raise its wages above the present $4 a day because it is already uncompetitive relative to the lower wages in Vietnam. It is not just a problem for the north; nor is it a nationalist protection issue. It is a case of all nations losing for corporate gain. The nations most vulnerable to downward pressures are those which are poorest. Deregulation does not lead to poverty alleviation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequences to date have been increased inequality and absolute poverty world wide. All developed nations have seen a growing division between rich and poor. Globally, we have seen a similar widening gap between the rich and poor nations. This dual economy is the major product of deregulation, as well as the loss of power for nations to respond effectively on economic matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We want fair trade, not free trade. The only people for whom trade is free are the big corporations. GATT will work against people of all nations for corporate profit. Making things attractive for international investment is the most frequent motive in major economic decisions. Corporate profits are booming, despite increases in global hardship. We need to regulate trade on a global basis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Brandt report published in 1980 highlighted the disaster caused by trade. It is not a problem of lack of freedom but lack of fairness.

Quite the contrary; I think the GATT meetings are meetings which occur behind closed doors with a very narrow and specific agenda which is not in accordance with either social justice or proper environmental protection. What I was suggesting was that the GATT process be opened up to take into consideration those far more important matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give my Senate colleagues in the government and in the opposition a little lesson in mathematics. If, as Senator McGauran said, the global economy is not growing and `growth is at a standstill', and Australia is going to grow by $2.5 billion per year, what will happen to other nations? If the global economy is not growing&mdash;and assume for the moment that gross world product is a proper measure of real benefit; it is not, but just make that assumption for the moment&mdash;and if we grow under GATT, it means that somebody else will become poorer. As Senator Margetts has just said&mdash;and as I pointed out earlier&mdash;the history of the world over the last 40 years shows that the difference between rich and poor has become much more marked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The essential point that I want to establish is that under GATT it is not possible to go further back than the point at which goods or services land on one's doorstep. So, if a nation is exploiting forests quite unsustainably, one cannot under GATT say, `We will not import logs from that country'. If a nation is exploiting its workers&mdash;and I will come to the rights of those workers in a minute&mdash;one cannot refuse the entry of those goods into ones country under GATT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Sherry seems to be under the misapprehension that the businesses in Third World countries are under the control of Third World people. The businesses in Third World countries are largely under the control of the multinationals that have gone in to take advantage of cheap labour. I will give the example of such an industry that I saw on a trip to Western Samoa which I took during the winter recess. In the Yusaki factory in Western Samoa, some 1,500 workers, mainly women, are paid as little as a dollar a day for making cabling for motor vehicles which is sold into First World countries. That industry is Japanese; it is not owned by the Western Samoans. The industry has relocated from Melbourne to Western Samoa to take advantage of those very poor working conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we must be able to do is look further back than the point at which goods and services land on our shores, and discriminate according to whether those goods are being produced under conditions which are fair, reasonable and not exploitative, and which protect the environment. GATT does not allow that to occur. The whole point of this debate is that GATT needs to be changed to that extent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To argue that GATT has been operating for 40 years, that the Uruguay Round has been going for seven years, and that we are somehow locked in, is to fly in the face of the evidence of this chamber changing the government's mind on the Antarctic. Former Senator Jo Vallentine raised the issue that the CRAMRA agreement should not be passed, despite the many years of negotiation that had gone on, and that Australia should go back and try to get world heritage for the Antarctic. After some considerable argument, with the opposition first supporting the government and then later recognising the advantage of not supporting the CRAMRA agreement, the government was persuaded to go back and renegotiate. While we did not get world heritage status for the Antarctic, we did get a vast improvement in the environmental management of that continent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For Senator Gibson to say that the economy needs to grow for the environment to be improved is a nonsense. I just simply ask Senator Gibson: is the Australian environment better today than it was just after the Second World War, despite the fact that we have a per capita GDP which has gone up threefold? Did we have 1,000 kilometres of the Murray polluted with blue-green algae back in the 1940s? Did we have the extensive salinisation of soil, which has gone on apace? The economy has grown, but we are spending less on the environment. The opposition, of course, is supporting the government's tax cuts rather than putting some of that increased wealth into looking after the environment. But that really is an aside. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point of this debate is to say to the government that this GATT agreement is fundamentally inimical to proper environmental protection, to proper protection of human standards, to proper protection of work conditions and, therefore, it needs to be modified.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>The document before the Senate today is the preliminary advice of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training and its Higher Education Council on planning for the 1994-1996 triennium. Broadly, NBEET has agreed that growth in the higher education system should be carefully targeted to regions that are experiencing greater than average population increases for undergraduates and to areas of research strength for postgraduate research students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The advice states that while the Higher Education Council does not propose that there be substantial growth identified for the higher education sector, there are a number of factors which suggest that some growth is needed. I find that last statement&mdash;`some growth is needed'&mdash;rather amazing. This government obviously does not understand the extent of shortfall and unmet demand for places in our university system. It is planning small growth at a time when we are turning 50,000 people away from universities every year. That will not go away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training undertook a study into adult and community education and found that there is a tidal wave of demand from people who want to upgrade their skills and move into either TAFE or university education, but the places are not there. The government might think it is going to redirect post-secondary education in this country more towards the TAFE sector, but ANTA has just begun and the preference of Australians is still for the university system. These things will not be turned around overnight, so it is rather amazing that the advice being given to the government is for low growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">NBEET also states in this advice:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Growth in postgraduate student numbers is necessary to accommodate growth in undergraduate completions, to maintain an appropriate level of opportunity for graduates to achieve a high level of research skills.</PARA>
<PARA>There will not just be growth in undergraduate completions; there will be a massive growth in demand for people wanting to go on to further degrees. The fact that the government has suddenly brought in a doubling of the HECS fees for these people will really do nothing towards creating the clever country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot remember any senators opposite suggesting, before the last election, that they would garrotte higher education postgraduate research and student completion of awards in this area by doubling fees. I challenge any of my colleagues to recall any statement by the government before the election that it was going to put up fees in this area. This is just another lie from this government. What will happen is that a lot of people who proposed to do a second degree and gain the skills that a clever country needs will just not go on and do it because of this additional cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">NBEET has also advised the minister that the allocation of research postgraduate load should be based on evidence from institutions of the research management plan. It says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Growth places must be directed to areas where the institution has research strengths and where there are trained supervisors.</PARA>
<PARA>That seems fine on the surface, but people have to realise what the government's hidden agenda is. When that particular piece of gobbledegook is translated, it means that the government will focus its resources and support the `big seven' concept of universities. The effect of this, as our Senate inquiry into university research has revealed, will be to create either a new binary system or a four-level system of post-secondary institutions in this country where the rich will get richer and the poor will get poorer. Those universities that have established track records will be getting preference. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So instead of assisting the newer universities and giving them proper research infrastructure and spending the sort of money the government should be spending in this area, it will is to concentrate on just a few. That is totally at odds with the developing direction of the findings of the Senate standing committee inquiry into universities. People are telling us that the research money should follow expertise wherever that may be&mdash;whether it is in country New South Wales or in the centre of Melbourne&mdash;and it should not be focused in the way that is indicated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My last point relates to the other funding that the government is putting into infrastructure, which is also inadequate. In this advice, NBEET has warned the government that quality of higher education will decline if there is any further funding reduction, and that has occurred, as indicated in this report. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA>This document is one that I have had a hand in writing, as have Senator McKiernan and Senator Chris Evans, who are sitting opposite; Senator Ellison, who is sitting behind me; and Senator O'Chee. The remarks I wish to make relate to that report and, in particular, to the response to that report thus far by the current discredited Treasurer (Mr Dawkins). It is important to address this report tonight at some length because the response by the government is very instructive for us as to the way the government has responded to this Senate report, obviously, and as to the way it thinks about the Senate as a whole. In particular, it is very instructive as to the mind-set, the thinking and the intellectual capacity of the Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The night that this report was released the Treasurer appeared on a national radio program on the ABC, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">PM</EMPHASIS>, saying that he had gone back and asked his legal advisers to see where risk might exist and whether there was anything we could do to minimise that risk. What kind of a disgrace is that? There had been a constitutional cloud of doubt over this bill from almost the minute that it was presented. The government had every opportunity to get every bit of advice it wanted; it had received advice; it had the benefit of the legal advice that the committee had received; and the most pathetic response we got from this Treasurer was, `Well, I'll go and get some advice on it'. Of course, we know what happened. Overnight, the advice clearly was to split the bills. Nonetheless, that is an indication of how recalcitrant and reluctant this Treasurer is to listen to what he is told&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As was interjected by Senator Campbell, it is an indication of how petulant this Treasurer is. He said that the committee had given no explanation as to what the risk was or where it lay in the bill. What the committee did was to answer the questions it was given by the Senate. There were two reasons why a lot of detail was not spelt out. One was that it would be obvious to blind Freddy with a mask on that if the answer to the question, `Does this bill impose taxation?' was `Yes', or, `There is a significant risk that it does', everything else followed. Someone doing constitutional law I&mdash;probably legal studies in year 12&mdash;would understand the reasoning and the relationship between section 55 and section 53, the powers of the Senate and the way in which a bill had to be drafted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, blind Freddy with a mask on could see that if this report said there was a real risk which was substantial, the High Court would hold that this bill did impose tax and the rest followed, namely, because it dealt with a number of subjects of taxation, it would be in contravention of section 55. That did not need to be spelt out to the most inarticulate, ill-informed person that I have come across, so why the Treasurer felt the committee should point it out, I do not know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The following day the Treasurer went on to say that these bills would be split. He made some other remarks and it is those remarks that I particularly want to spend some time addressing. He was asked by a journalist whether he felt somewhat betrayed by the Labor senators in this situation. I think that question goes to the heart of what Senate committees are all about and the Treasurer's response goes to the heart of how he, and probably other members of this government, think Senate committees should behave. The question was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Do you feel somewhat betrayed by Labor senators in this situation?</PARA>
<PARA>The inference being that Labor senators on the other side of the chamber will always do in committees as they are instructed; that they have no regard for the truth; no regard for what the proper story is that should be put before parliament; and, if there is any difficulty created in a report, then they will not sign that report and their job is simply to sign reports that make it easy for the Treasurer. That was the inference to be drawn from the question and, of course, it was a very well placed question because the response was:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I could not, in polite language, describe how I feel about the members of that Committee, including those from my own party.</PARA>
<PARA>So the Treasurer is saying that the members of his party who were on this committee should have ignored the advice that they were given; ignored the evidence that was put before the committee; ignored the real risk, if this bill was left in its current form, that it would later go to the High Court, be challenged and be held to be invalid; ignored the consequences for millions of consumers around Australia who are already, because of this Treasurer's ineptitude, paying higher prices for goods that they need not pay because some of these taxes might not be passed; and ignored what was described by one witness as potentially Australia's greatest fiscal nightmare, in that taxes would have been paid and have failed to have been collected under an invalid law, given that there are exemptions and reductions included. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer is saying that his colleagues on the opposite side of the chamber should simply ignore Australia's greatest potential fiscal nightmare. He is saying that they should put out a report which says, `If the Treasurer wants to have a go at this, let him have a go. We will remain silent about the things we know'. There can be no greater insult to members of parliament&mdash;be they Labor, Democrat, Liberal, Independent or Green&mdash;than to suggest that they will come into this place and simply, on all occasions, sing the tune of their respective parties, whatever the risk to the nation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But that is apparently what this Treasurer expects. This petulant, failed Treasurer, who chose to package the bill in this way, somehow believes that a Senate committee should simply endorse what a bill says and that it has no business in questioning his choice to package the bill in this way. The Treasurer is not that informed. He went on to say that only one sentence in the report includes any sense of wisdom. And I thought Senator McMullan was one of the most condescending people I have ever met!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Dawkins said, `Only one sentence in the report includes any sense of wisdom'. The Treasurer can glean nothing out of the report&mdash;all the work that has been done, all the evidence that has been given by people who are both well-intentioned and well-informed. Some of them came to opinions that were different from others. Nonetheless, all this work had been done and all the Treasurer could say was, `Only one sentence includes any sense of wisdom'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer then went on to say that the rest of the committee report is just speculation and simply the opinion of a `collection of people'&mdash;obviously the terminology is chosen to denigrate the committee in some way&mdash;`who are, after all, just politicians'. We are all politicians. The Treasurer seems to miss the point that he is one too. He said, `They are not High Court judges and most of them are not even lawyers'.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Dawkins said one thing which caused amusement in the supermarkets. Pretty soon there will be a slow clap in the supermarkets like the one which can be heard at artistic performances. When a performance is running late, there is a slow clap from the audience, demanding that something happen. This will happen to Treasurer Dawkins. In response to a question from Paul Lyneham, he referred to the times when it becomes necessary for him to leave Fremantle. Poor petal, having to leave Fremantle! He chose this job and he can choose to leave it any time he likes. It is not necessary for him to come here. One might argue that we would all be better off if he did not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He said that, when it becomes necessary for him to get on a plane and come to Canberra, the prospect of retirement does well in his mind. Let him give the job away. Are we all meant to be lying in the aisles and saying, `Change the Senate committee report because it is all too frustrating for a Treasurer who messed it up in the first place'? Is that what we are meant to do? Oh, no! Mr Dawkins is thinking of retiring. Let us give it away. Let us cause no more difficulty. Let us not look at the constitutionality of this bill. Let us ignore our responsibilities in this chamber to get things right in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us say, `If Mr Dawkins wants to pass this, whacko! Let's pass it and give it a run. Let's give it a burl. Let's run it through the High Court. Let's run this high risk and face this constitutional and fiscal uncertainty and fiscal nightmare; because otherwise Mr Dawkins might have had too much and will want to give it away'. It is obviously a ludicrous proposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of other points need to be made with respect to Mr Dawkins. One colleague opposite, Senator McKiernan, described him as aloof. I do not disagree with that. It clearly indicates that he is somewhat out of touch. In fact, Senator McKiernan was very helpful when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am not surprised at all by his comments and reaction. The guy is an elitist and he is aloof.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not think being elitist is necessarily a bad thing. People are entitled to choose their course in life. But that brings us back to the Treasurer's remarks about senators in this committee not being able to deal with more than one matter at a time; in particular, it tells us something about this Treasurer. He behaves badly under pressure. He feels under pressure; he feels responsible&mdash;which is quite a good thing, because he is. When he gets to a particular stress point, he wants to give it all away. But when he is in that position he does something else which is particularly unattractive. When the blowtorch is applied to him, instead of accepting responsibility and trying to fix the problem, he has a go at his mates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that the concept of mateship, as it has developed in Australia generally, but more particularly in the Labor Party, means that people are accepted with their good and bad points and mates are not bucketed simply because they have a different view. There are two people who sit in this chamber&mdash;I do not know whether they regard themselves as mates of Mr Dawkins; I do not understand the factional arrangements within the Labor Party to the extent that I could comment on that&mdash;who are members of his party. Because they have not done his bidding, whistled to his tune and done exactly as he wanted, he says that there is no way he can describe what he feels about them in terms that could be printed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On one occasion the Treasurer said of senators, `What's wrong with those people? Can't they deal with more than one matter at one time?'. He even described senators as being feeble-minded people&mdash;totally bypassing the point. He insulted us by calling us feeble-minded; it was he, after all, who packaged the bill in an unconstitutional form, or at least in a form that runs a high risk of being considered unconstitutional. He said that we are feeble-minded people who cannot consider a number of issues at one time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He completely bypassed the very important point that what we do in this chamber with respect to bills and how we deal with them&mdash;that is, whether we can introduce them and the way in which we might amend them&mdash;is quite clearly indicated to us by the constitution. We probably all appreciate that the way that we deal with them if we get it wrong is a matter between the houses. But what is important is that section 55 of the constitution, as it relates to this matter, makes it quite clear that when parliament wants to pass a bill imposing taxation, that bill should deal with only one instance of taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the Senate's desire to have this matter investigated by the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs and reported back has nothing to do with the difficulty of considering one, two, three, four, five or six matters at one time; it quite simply has everything to do with a desire to ascertain whether the legislation that we are dealing with would, if passed, be in conformity with the constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At one stage, Mr Dawkins indicated that he thought the Senate inquiry had been a big waste of time and money. It cannot be a waste of time and money for the Senate to ascertain whether legislation it is dealing with would, if passed, be held to be valid or invalid. I would have thought that might be one of the primary things we would be required to look at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Or is Mr Dawkins suggesting that we should sit here and willy-nilly pass things irrespective of what the constitutional restraints might be and without looking back to see the reasons why those restraints are there and attempting to comply with them. In fact what he is saying is that cabinet will decide what the constitution says for the purposes of today and tomorrow and he or she who wins power in the lower house can decide what the constitution should say and everyone else should just accept it. Australian consumers run the risk that the cabinet of the day has got it wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first and most important point I want to make in respect of this report is, namely, that the reaction of the Treasurer tells us something. It tells us that the Treasurer is under pressure and that he is a man who behaves badly when he is under pressure. He comes out on the attack rather than accepting responsibility, attacks rather than trying to find a resolution to the problem, believes the Senate should ignore what the constitutional restraints are on parliament and also believes the Senate should ignore the reasons why section 55 was structured as it was and just pass legislation as he wants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He is a man who when under pressure not only attacks anyone from the opposition or the Democrats, which is understandable in the political process, but also expects his colleagues and his mates to follow his tune at any time. They decided to tell the truth in the unanimous report of the committee by saying that there was no way but to decide that the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill if passed in its present form would run the real risk of the High Court considering that it imposed a tax under section 55. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course the rest follows. On the face of it we can see that if the bill imposes tax, it imposes a number of taxes and consequently it would be held to be invalid. What we learn about the Treasurer is that he is a pig-headed, stubborn man who wants his way on all occasions and when he does not get it he will not only have a go at anyone in sight but also swing the guns around on his own colleagues as well. That is a pretty disgraceful performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point I want to make in respect of this matter is the Treasurer's attitude to the community at large. Mr Acting Deputy President, do you know that Australian consumers, taxpayers and the people in the gallery are paying higher prices now in the shops because the people who are selling them the goods anticipate that most, if not all, of these taxes will be validated? Obviously if these taxes are validated the retailers are going to have to pay the tax, if they have not already paid this tax on the goods that have come in. They have to cover their costs. The last wholesaler is charging the tax to what is presumably the retailer and then the retailer is putting up his or her prices to cover that cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If any of these taxes are invalidated the Attorney-General has indicated, if we do not mind, that he understands that these taxes, if they are being collected now, are being collected invalidly. There is no power to collect these taxes. We have all heard the old saying `No taxation without representation'. That actually means something. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This country is covered by the 1689 Bill of Rights which states that there is to be no taxation unless it is approved by parliament. We have allowed a practice to develop, which some have raised to the level of a convention, that once taxes are announced in the budget people will assume that they will become law and behave as though they are law. Of course this results in the sticky mess that the government has got itself into when it tries to introduce legislation by press release or budget. The government has to consider what happens when it all comes unstuck and people have paid these taxes in anticipation of the taxes being validated. Clearly some of these taxes are not going to be validated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What does that mean? It means that people who bought a bottle of wine that was delivered after this budget was brought down have paid more for the wine than they otherwise would. They have no right to get that tax back. They have no obligation to pay the tax. The obligation falls on the wholesaler. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the tax is not validated and the wholesaler does not have to give the tax to the government, the wholesaler will keep the tax he has collected and the people who have bought a bottle of wine since the budget have got two chances of getting a refund&mdash;Buckley's and none. That applies to every other tax that is at risk. That is the situation that we are faced with. This fiscal uncertainty has been created because of a Treasurer who decided that the best way to proceed was to bully the Senate and try to lock packages in so that the Senate had to take it all as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some members opposite might think that is smart, a good idea and politically and tactically sensible. But when the time comes, as it inevitably will, when the government is on the other side of this chamber, it will have a different view. When the time comes to answer to someone as to why government members bother to collect a salary if they are not prepared to do any more than simply rubber stamp what comes from downstairs, they might have some embarrassment. I would have some embarrassment taking my salary if I thought my only job was to sit in this chamber and say, `Yes sir, no sir' to whatever comes from the other place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see day after day in this place examples of where the other place messes it up, where the people with the majority take no notice of detail, shove bills through with speed, guillotine 40 or 50 bills in a week and then send them to the Senate for us to clean up the mess. If the attitude being taken on the other side is that it is all okay and the Treasurer wants it done this way and they want to be able to blackmail the Senate into all or nothing at all, then the people who are paying for the salaries of senators are wasting their money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, you may as well have the sack. We can send the Deputy Clerk somewhere else because she will not be needed. No-one else will be needed. We can get rid of half of this building that we have just spent over a billion dollars on, throw it all down the drain and go to a unicameral system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The attitude is that we should give the government of the day that is elected on the cyclical fortunes of public will a complete carte blanche. I mean no disrespect to Mr Acting Deputy President because he is from the opposition party in Queensland, but my view is that there is no better example of the problems that a parliament can get into with a unicameral system than the state of Queensland. Anyone who wants to get rid of an upper house need only look there for the troubles that a parliament can get into when it does not have a second house to query what the executive is doing&mdash;there is no effective brake on the executive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So if Senator Chris Evans, Senator Cooney, Senator Bolkus and all government members think that the Senate is being obstructionist because it is doing its job, then they should give their preselections away and let someone else come in here who actually wants to do the job. We need a person who wants to do the job of reviewing what the executive of the day wants to do and who wants to have a real say and not just a token gesture of expressing a view and then leaving it up to the lower house to take any notice of it or not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans is only new in this place and I am astounded that he could be looking over with a frown as if to say he does not understand what his job is.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It does not surprise me that Senator Chris Evans does not understand the argument. For his benefit let me repeat my argument in a very simple and short form. The argument is that if one wants to simply accept what comes up from the lower house and have no say in the benefits or otherwise of it and if one wants to accept it irrespective of its constitutional propriety or otherwise, then the question is raised of why we bother having a Senate. It follows that those on the other side who simply think they should do what their colleagues in the lower house want them to do should give up their preselection. They have no business being in this place and accepting taxpayers money if they are not prepared to do the job.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will conclude by summarising the two points that I have sought to make, which obviously have had little success with Senator Chris Evans. First, what we have seen is that the Treasurer is a petulant little man who behaves very badly when he does not get what he wants. Instead of accepting responsibility and trying to find an acceptable way through the problems, he stands on his heels, stamps his foot and threatens to get out of this place because he does not think that he is getting a fair go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer is a man who, when under pressure, attacks everybody else, including his colleagues and his mates. He expects his colleagues in this place to ignore the clear evidence that is put before them. He expects them not to flag a warning of the risks involved in legislation being packaged in a certain way, but wants them simply to toe the party line. I would say that means he expects them not to do their job, even though they are paid with taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After all, we get paid a significant amount of money. As I understand it, when one adds up the cost of the rest of the services in this place, including office accommodation, it costs pretty close to $400,000 a year to keep one person here. There are eight members of the committee and so it costs $3.2 million a year to keep those senators going. However, the Treasurer cannot understand why the Labor members of the committee could possibly have reached the conclusion that they did. He has nothing kind that he can say about them. That tells us something as to what he thinks about the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second aspect follows from the first. Having received this report, the Treasurer's total demeanour indicates that he would rather not have this place. He would rather be a little dictator who could simply say, `This is going to be the budget. It doesn't matter whether it is constitutional or not. We'll take that chance. Brave us, the government, and we'll take the chance'. That proposition neglects the very important fact that the taxpayers are the ones on whom that chance has a significant effect. If the Treasurer had his way to proceed as he wished, the taxpayers are the ones who would be mucked up; they are the ones who are paying the higher prices; they are the ones who will have the fiscal nightmare; and they are the ones who will have the paperwork nightmare in seeking to resolve and unravel the problem. </PARA>

As a member of the committee, Senator Chris Evans must understand that if we pass this legislation which, if challenged, is then held to be invalid, that does not solve the problem. The seal of approval from this place does not make something constitutional. That is why this committee was being asked to advise on the risk of treating this as legislation that would be held to be valid. That was the whole point of the inquiry.

I would simply say that we did the right thing in proceeding to inquire as to whether they were constitutional. If that bill was not constitutional and it was passed, I feel that London to a brick it would be challenged; there was a real risk that it would be held to be invalid. There was another way to package the bills which would still give the government its way, but that constitutional and fiscal uncertainty would not have been inflicted on taxpayers who are now paying higher prices in the expectation of these taxes being validated.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last but not least, we have a test bill wheeled up to us. The government's idea is: `Why not vote for something that you think is unconstitutional because then we can get the High Court to test it?'. I am not at all certain that the problem has been solved when I look at the repackaging of these bills. I certainly hope that it has been solved but my deep suspicion is that it has not. If I am right, it will tell us that yet again the Treasurer in a determined way is seeking to lock the Senate into accepting a number of options at any one time in order to push the government's view through this place. This would not allow the Senate to operate as a proper house of review. That would a very sad thing not only for the legislative process but also for the Treasurer because, hopefully, if that is the case, those opposite would decide that his time has come, as mine has in this debate, and that he would have to go. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As far as I can see, the additional remarks made by Senator Vanstone, Senator Ellison and Senator O'Chee to the unanimous committee report do not speak about the necessity for this budget to be got through with integrity so that there is a balance between the spending and revenue collecting provisions of the budget. Honourable senators opposite might have come to the conclusion that the bill should be split, but if they had wished to give a balanced opinion, one hopes that at least they would have raised the issue of the necessity for the budget to be balanced. I do not see that issue addressed anywhere in those additional remarks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer has been taken to task. The Treasurer has the constitutional duty to bring forward a budget. He has the moral duty, the political duty and, indeed, the most responsible duty of making sure that the budget that is brought forward is balanced. If he is to be faced with a situation where his spending provisions&mdash;his spending legislation&mdash;are allowed through but his revenue collecting provisions are to be knocked over, then this country is in trouble. That is not addressed in the additional remarks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is in the constitution itself to a large extent. Section 55 introduces legal considerations into a part of the constitution which would otherwise be a set of provisions which allows for the political play between the two houses. Sections 53, 54 and 57&mdash;and 56, for that matter&mdash;talk about proposed laws. That simply means that bills, as distinct from statutes, shall be handled in a particular way. Those provisions set up a scheme for political play. That is what it is all about&mdash;the sorts of things the Treasurer does, the sorts of things the opposition does, and the sorts of things they have done in this particular case, where there is a battle of wills, where political manoeuvres and mechanisms are used to get particular provisions through or to resist them. That has happened. So to that extent it is political. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 55 introduces a provision that allows the High Court&mdash;or requires the High Court, because the High Court might not want to take on this sort of exercise&mdash;to take on the examination of laws that allegedly impose taxation and which are challenged as being unconstitutional. That creates a lot of problems. That very problem was faced by Mr Isaacs, the then Attorney-General for Victoria, late last century. On 8 March 1898, in Melbourne, he raised this whole issue. He said that there was going to be trouble with that provision; he predicted the trouble that has occurred. He said that that provision would `make this constitution, not a people's constitution, but a lawyers' constitution'. That has been proved very correct in this instance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the problems that have arisen in this instance should not be laid at the foot of the Treasurer in the way they have. They should be laid at the foot, if you like, of the constitutional provisions that were put in deliberately&mdash;against, may I say, the advice of a great lawyer and a great politician and, later, a great judge, Mr Isaac Isaacs, and also against the advice of Sir Alfred Deakin, one of the great liberals in the history of Australia, who said that there were some real problems with provision 55 as it was being put in the constitution. So there is, as it were, a tension within the provisions of the constitution which I do not think is a very creative tension at all. I think it is a tension which has caused the present problems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is obligatory on the Treasurer to get a budget through for the good of this country. It is proper for members of the Senate to examine those bills and to exercise their collective minds upon it. But, just as problems have been raised about the attempt, as it is said, of the Treasurer, of the government, to force a matter through the Senate, so there is a problem with the way members of the Senate exercise their minds about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the budget issues are being decided on party lines. If they are being decided on party lines, it is not correct to say that the Senate is reviewing the budget bills. The various parties may be reviewing the budget bills and they might introduce arguments into this house that oppose or support the budget bills, but it is wrong to say, in terms of the way this budget has been dealt with, that the Senate has subjected the bills to review. The Senate has provided a chamber in which various parties have been able to come in and put their position and threaten to stop the budget or certain provisions of it. But it is a wrong analysis to say that this is an attempt by the government to stand over the Senate as a senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Senate was originally put up in the 1890s it was a states house. It is a political decision to either accept or reject a budget, and the Senate can do that on two bases. It could say, as it has here, `Our particular parties have made decisions about these budget bills, and so we will treat them in a particular way'. Or the Senate itself as a unit could get together and oppose what the House of Representatives has done. It was in that second sense that people were speaking in the 1890s about the Senate being a house of review and about the way it was to deal with money bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But it is wrong to say&mdash;I keep repeating this because it is a point that is very much worth making&mdash;in the sense that that expression, that concept, was developed in the 1890s, that the Senate has opposed the bills. Parties in the Senate have done that. Therefore, it has to be looked at in terms of the political give and take at a party political level, not at the political level of one house against the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is up to the parties, if that is the position, to take a responsible approach to this budget, which has not happened in these circumstances. Members of the coalition have made up their minds to oppose the budget because, they say, of statements made during the election campaign. They have made up their minds, given the situation in this house, to oppose the budget bills and it is on that basis that they do it. But that is not looking at the budget on its merit. If one says that the budget should be rejected because of promises made during the election campaign, that is punishing the Australian people&mdash;not necessarily the Labor Party&mdash;for something the government did then. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Macdonald quite properly interjects. But if it is better at this stage for a budget to be put through on a particular basis, it should go through on that basis. The budget either has integrity or it has not, as it stands alone. What is to the good of Australia, and the people of Australia, now in terms of budgetary programs?  That is the question one should ask, not whether or not the government made a particular promise at the last election. The opposition can get up in this house and berate the government for not keeping perceived promises it had made and do all that sort of thing, but in the end the responsible position as far as the budget goes is to decide whether or not it should go through as it presently is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will say something about the way this present position arose. Section 53 of the constitution talks about proposed laws appropriating revenue or money or imposing taxation. Section 54 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed law which appropriates revenue or moneys for the ordinary annual services of the Government shall deal only with such appropriation.</PARA>
<PARA>Section 56 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A vote, resolution, or proposed law for the appropriation of revenue or moneys shall not be passed unless the purpose of the appropriation has in the same session been recommended by message of the Governor-General to the House in which the proposal originated.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a scheme set up in the constitution to enable bills to be introduced into the House of Representatives because that is where governments are made. Then provision is made to handle a situation where those bills come up before the Senate and the Senate wants to do something about them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The constitution states that money bills will not originate in the Senate and it cannot amend a money bill, although it can send it back with a request for the House of Representatives to amend it. To compensate for that, the constitution says that a law shall propose only one imposition of taxation in any one bill. So the scheme is that the bill introducing an imposition of taxation should contain that one imposition of taxation and that is all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The constitution, in section 55, then says that laws imposing taxation shall deal only with the imposition of taxation. In dropping off the word `proposed', the jurisdiction, as it were, of the parliament is taken away and given to the High Court. It was well put by Mr Holder on 8 March 1898 when he stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A measure would be valid while it was a Bill, and invalid when it became a law.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Isaacs said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is a very terse and correct way of putting it, and it proves the absurdity of the provision. We are, in my opinion, making the Senate too strong a body. To allow these matters to be carried into the Supreme Court&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is what they were going to call the High Court at that point&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is to say that the Senate cannot protect itself, and that the states cannot protect themselves.</PARA>
<PARA>He goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Surely that is not to be thought of for a moment. We want a people's Constitution, not a lawyer's Constitution. We shall be making the Supreme Court, not the master, but the tyrant of the Constitution, by inserting a clause of this kind.</PARA>
<PARA>As I said, the worst fears of Mr Isaacs have been realised. But the fact of the matter is that it is up to the High Court to make the decision. The High Court itself has decided some cases which would very much support the contention that the government puts forward, although there is no case which says that what the government contends for is correct. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposition is that we now have a situation where the Senate, the House of Representatives and the people of Australia are uncertain as to what the powers of this chamber are. It is true enough that we have to be cautious in passing legislation which may later be found invalid, but we also need to know exactly what powers this Senate possesses. We need to know what power the government possesses in putting bills up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Vanstone says that in years to come there might be a change in who is in power in this chamber. That well might be so, but if for the next hundred years or the next millennium we are going to go ahead not knowing exactly what the powers of the Senate are, not knowing the way that bills can be put up, then we may well be denying ourselves powers that we should be exercising. If the constitution gives us these powers and we do not use them, then there is much to be worried about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is a very responsible position to get a bill and to create an occasion where that issue can be decided. How else are we to know, as I said before, what the jurisdiction of this chamber is, what the jurisdiction of the other is and what can or cannot be done, for the good of Australia, in years to come?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think also the proposition that there should be a test bill is a good. Just as it may be that these bills were unconstitutional&mdash;the original bills, the ones that have now been withdrawn&mdash;it may also be that they were constitutional. Unless that issue can be decided at some stage, I do not think we can properly carry out our duties because we do not know what powers we have to carry them out. I do not think it can be said that the Treasurer is acting irresponsibly in putting forward a test case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on the constitutional aspects of the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993. A fair amount of time has been expended in the chamber dealing with the reaction of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) to that report and his comments on the committee members, particularly the government members of that committee. I will address that issue only briefly. I find the comments of the Treasurer regrettable. They related to a com-</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to put on record that I believe credit is due to the chairman of the committee, Senator Barney Cooney, and the other government members who devoted themselves to the task of finding the facts, the truth, of the matters before the committee. They did so without fear or favour. I believe it is useful to record that appreciation in a chamber in which party political considerations and party political behaviour very often take the upper hand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also find it regrettable that the Treasurer finds it necessary in the revised bill to again combine some bills, having been advised by the committee across party lines that there is a very real and significant risk, firstly, that the bill is imposing taxation; secondly, that the bill deals with one subject in section 39 which does not deal with taxation; and, thirdly, that it deals with more than one subject of taxation. Therefore, there is a very real risk, which is significant, that the High Court could find that bill to be invalid under section 55 of the constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it would be appropriate for the Treasurer, having received that opinion from the committee, to present the Senate with a separate bill on each topic of taxation and thus to allow the Senate to fulfil its duty of scrutinising legislation before the Senate on the basis of the content of that legislation and not to be pushed into a corner, not to be blackmailed, by considerations that various taxation measures have been combined and that, if the Senate seeks to either amend or request an amendment, the whole package of bills would have to go back to the House of Representatives. I believe it is wrong. I believe it is contrary to the spirit of our constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On reading the debates of our founding fathers, it becomes clear that our founding fathers gave considerable thought to this issue and determined that the Senate must not be restricted in its duty to scrutinise legislation that comes before it. Therefore, in section 55 of the constitution they inserted the prohibition of tacking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real issue in the report before the Senate and the substantive issue that we should address is that it was the clear intention of the government&mdash;admitted in almost so many words, certainly by implication, by both Senator Gareth Evans and the Treasurer&mdash;to provide a package which would put some pressure on the Senate to pass the package without amending parts of it. As I have said, that is against the spirit of the legislation. On this point, I cannot agree with Senator Cooney who tried to develop an argument that, in some ways, it is not the task of the Senate which is being pursued here but that it is the work of individual political parties that are engaging in this job of scrutinising the content of legislation which comes before us. I really fail to see how one can make that distinction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cooney appears to be pursuing the argument that the Senate was established as a states house, that it is no longer a states house, that now it is basically voting along party lines and that political activity is organised along party lines, one cannot therefore say that the Senate as a whole no longer has the task to scrutinise legislation, to act as a house of review.

I was part of that process so I do not speak from hearsay. He reached his conclusion, as did other members of the committee&mdash;it was a unanimous decision&mdash;that the answer that was requested of the committee should be that there was a very real risk that was significant; that this was a bill that was imposing taxation, with everything that flows from that, including the fact that it was likely to be invalid.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the government members, strictly speaking, fulfilled their duty in answering those questions, it seemed appropriate for whoever chose to do so to add some statements on the consequences that this course of action which the government has embarked upon would lead us to. It is for that reason that we pointed to the financial confusion and the loss of confidence in the commercial world that would follow from a situation where people would have to expect that if a challenge were brought before the High Court, it would be likely to invalidate the bills.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might be perhaps pertinent for me to deal with some matter of history in relation to these sections that I have mentioned.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Briefly, those sections deal with what might be termed as bills relating to finance and the machinery for dealing with such matters between the two Houses. Section 53 provides, among other things, that laws imposing taxation shall not originate in the Senate.

The Senate is also free to reject that proposed law or simply defer it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 55 provides that laws imposing taxation shall deal with the imposition of tax and nothing else. Any other foreign subject dealt with shall be of no effect, so that if a bill deals with any foreign matter and that bill is passed, any matter other than taxation is completely invalid. But section 55 goes on to say that only one subject of taxation can be dealt with in a bill dealing with the imposition of taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for that is very clear. It is so that the Senate is not faced with an omnibus bill of the type it has just been faced with. It is that the Senate can then be faced with individual subjects of taxation and deal with them independently, so that we do not have good taxes&mdash;if there is such a thing&mdash;or a reasonable tax mixed up with a bad tax, so that the Senate is then given the option of either rejection or acceptance in toto. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This very point was debated in the constitutional conventions in the 1890s. In what was called the `compromise of 1891' the more populous states formed a compromise with the less populous states that there would be some agreement in relation to the Senate's role in respect of taxation matters. Due to the fact that we have a responsible government and that the majority is formed in the other place, the less populous states wanted the Senate to have some ability to pick and choose in relation to matters of taxation&mdash;that is, the less populous states did not want the more populous states to foist unwanted taxes on them. They wanted the Senate, where each state had equal representation, to be able to consider each individual subject of taxation. That point was mentioned frequently in the convention debates in the 1890s; and here we are, 100 years later, debating this very issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not the constitution which is at fault. Again, I take issue with Senator Cooney's remark that that is what we should look at. I believe that the constitution has served this country very well for nearly 100 years and there is no need to go changing it just because one petulant Treasurer does not like it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst I am on the subject of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), I found it completely abhorrent that he should make a personal attack on members of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, including those good members of his own party. As Senator Vanstone mentioned, the Treasurer could not find polite words to describe those members. It is much like a game of football where one sees the losing side starting to play the man instead of the ball. That is exactly what the Treasurer has been doing. In fact, in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on 21 September 1993 the Treasurer described how feeble-minded senators must be. He implied that we could not deal with more than one subject at a time. That was just another aspect where this Treasurer made a personal attack on the Senate and played the man and not the ball. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He did that when he was questioned on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">7.30 Report</EMPHASIS> recently. He mentioned that the private practitioners who appeared before the committee and who made submissions to the committee should be treated with some suspicion and that there was some question of their being paid. No doubt honourable senators read in the press what Tony Morris QC had to say about that. He was not paid. He devoted two days of his time to appear before the committee. He made an extensive submission and was of great assistance to the committee. In fact, after the Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, was threatened with a writ, he quickly retracted his comments in relation to Mr Morris QC. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw the attention of honourable senators to the report itself. I refer to the third paragraph in relation to terms of reference 2(i)(A). The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee puts on record its view that though it was faced with a range of opinions from highly qualified, highly competent and highly experienced men and women, they all gave an honest, candid and independent appraisal of the constitutional validity or otherwise of the bill.</PARA>
<PARA>That was a unanimous endorsement by the committee of the witnesses who appeared before it. That flies very much in the face of the Treasurer and the doubts and baseless slurs that he cast on those highly qualified witnesses who appeared before the committee. But I will not waste too much time on the Treasurer because, frankly, there are more important things to do than that, and we have the welfare of the country to consider. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Budget legislation is some of the most important legislation on the government's agenda. I am sure that Australian taxpayers would like to know that, in any approach to legislation dealing with their hard earned taxes, parliament exercises the utmost care and scrutiny. To do anything else would be irresponsible. The debate that we are conducting here today is not necessarily about the merits of the budget measures. That can wait for another day. That is not what we are debating here today; what we are debating here today is the question of the potential invalidity of this budget legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In answer to the question in 2(i)(A)&mdash;whether the bill, if enacted, would be a law imposing taxation for the purposes of this section&mdash;the report stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee takes the view that there is a real risk which is significant that the High Court would find the bill, if enacted, to be a law imposing taxation within the meaning of section 55 of the Constitution.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee also went on to find that the bill covered more than one subject of taxation. If we add those two ingredients together, fellow senators, we come up with invalid legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the committee told the Senate and the people of Australia that there is a significant risk that if this bill were passed in its present form, it could be struck down as invalid and unconstitutional by the High Court. Quite frankly, that is an untenable situation. I remember my days in private practice; if I had told someone, `You have a real risk, which is significant, of losing this case', I can bet you London to a brick that they would not have pursued the matter. I can tell honourable senators right now, using layman's terms, that if you said to the average person, `There is a real risk, which is significant, that we could lose this', they would not be in it. They would say, `You're mad to risk it'. It is perhaps even more irresponsible to risk it when we are dealing with the budget legislation of this country. If the bill were to be passed and successfully challenged, the whole piece of legislation would be struck down. There is adequate authority from the High Court to say just that. The whole lot would go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So what would happen then? There would be disastrous consequences for this country. It would result in nothing less than a fiscal nightmare. Can honourable senators imagine a situation where taxes had been collected, taxes had been paid unlawfully? Can they imagine the people of Australia accepting that? Can they imagine the international community seriously giving any credence at all to this country in which tax legislation had been passed and then struck down as invalid, so that taxes had been collected unlawfully? We would be the laughing-stock of the international community. We would not only suffer at home on our domestic front, but the exchange rate of the Australian dollar would also suffer. We might have won the right to hold the Olympics in the year 2000, but we would not be winning any financial Olympics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have to look to is the question of whether this legislation risks the potential of being struck down as unconstitutional by the High Court. I can tell honourable senators that the Treasurer noted this; he knew he was on a losing argument, and that is why he played the man and not the ball. He then attempted, somewhat incompetently, to split these bills so that the legislation would not be dealing with more than one subject of taxation. However, although we have them split into five bills, each respectively dealing with one subject of taxation, we still have problems with the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill No. 1 and the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill No. 2 because those bills cover more than one subject of taxation and it can still be argued that they impose a tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fringe benefits tax in the No. 2 bill deals with accommodation, travelling expenses and the like that can be claimed. What the government is saying is, `Hitherto you weren't liable in relation to these taxes but henceforth you will be'. If that is not imposing a new tax, then I am a Dutchman. I think it is an absolutely plain proposition that anything which introduces a new burden on the taxpayer is an imposition. In fact, for that matter, anything which increases the burden is an imposition. Therefore, any increase in the rate of tax could be an imposition and anything which takes away an exemption so as to expose the taxpayer to increased liability could also be an imposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those arguments were canvassed before the legal and constitutional committee and were given some support by eminent counsel, so the government is still not out of the woods. We still have two bills which, I put to the Senate, could risk invalidity. Remember, we are not here arguing about the merits of the measures; we are arguing about the legitimacy of the way that this legislation has been put forward and whether or not it could be struck down as unconstitutional. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, the government has conceded the point in one case because it calls bill No. 2 its `test bill'. I put it to the Senate and the people of Australia that any capricious suggestion that such an important piece of budget legislation be put forward as a test is entirely irresponsible. In other words, we will use up the taxpayers' money by putting the bill through and then we will run a big challenge in the High Court just to see what the High Court will say; in the meantime, taxes will be collected and other measures taken, and we will see what the High Court says. We just cannot run a country that way and we just cannot introduce budget legislation in that fashion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cooney mentioned that it was the constitutional duty of the Treasurer to pass the budget, and I could concede in some way that that is the case. But it is the constitutional duty of this parliament, of this Senate&mdash;</PARA>

That committee exercised its duties most responsibly and not in any political fashion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The additional comments which have been made by Senator O'Chee, Senator Vanstone and me are additional to the terms of reference and are related to the risk in passing what could be invalid legislation. That perhaps is a political point. Perhaps the only area where the committee approached anything near a political question was as to whether drafting practice in the future should use an omnibus bill to cover several amendments to respective acts dealing with taxation. In the last two paragraphs the committee stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Provided a bill is in accordance with the Constitution it is for the political process to determine the shaping of legislation. However, it is essential to safeguard the Senate's capacity to properly consider and deal with legislation.</PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators will see that there was a division in the committee as to the desirability of combining several amendments in the one bill. That was as close as it got to being political. The question was first, second and third, whether this legislation could stand up to any constitutional challenge in the High Court and the degree of risk that was involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee decided that there was a real risk, which was significant, that this bill could be struck down as unconstitutional. For my money, that is just too high a risk for Australia to take in any budget legislation and the safest way out for the government is to split the bill into respective subjects of taxation. As Mr Pat Brazil, a former attorney-general man who was a drafter himself, said before the committee, it would take a good draftsman half an hour to an hour to knock it into shape and there would be no question at all in relation to the constitutionality of that legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But still this Treasurer is hell-bent on putting forward a test bill. I put it to the Senate that that is not in the best interests of this country. We are not in the business of running flags up the flagpole just to see what the High Court will say. There are 76 of us here with varied backgrounds and a lot of experience&mdash;a lot more than I. We are more than well equipped, with all our advice, to make determinations as to whether legislation could face any constitutional challenge. We do not need to put forward test cases to the High Court to see whether they will pass. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I say that the committee's decision was a sound one. It is an excellent report and I commend it to the Senate.

If I were a bit more cynical, I might worry that it was a plot to ruin our political careers by receiving such praise from the other side of the house, but I am sure it is well-meaning, if not well directed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to put a few remarks on record because I think this whole debate has been somewhat misrepresented. I commence by stating that I am not a lawyer. One of the great advantages I bring to this debate is that I was one of the few non-lawyers on the committee. As such I have not tried to anticipate the High Court's reasoning nor write amateur legal opinions on the question. I concur with the first decision of the committee&mdash;that it was a matter for the High Court to decide, and I think we all should bear that in mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My participation in this committee was limited. This problem stems from the tight deadlines set for the committee to report and the inability of a number of senators to attend all the hearings and the meeting day. I was not able to attend the meeting; I think that at the end there were only four members of the committee present. I think that is a problem in terms of Senate practice and the role of the committees which will have to be addressed. I will return to that later. This is my first experience of contributing to a committee report. Unlike Senator Ellison, I am quite jaundiced by the experience and quite concerned for the processes of the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, I endorse the findings of the report. In hindsight, I would have worded the report differently. I can fairly be accused of being a bit naive in not really responding as we should have to some of the political issues that surrounded the report. The report errs on the side of being a little too legalistic and dispassionate and not political enough. Therefore, I think the government senators are guilty of not having provided enough political support to the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and the government in reaching the conclusions they did. I say that not wishing to resile from the decisions of the report, but as to the way we phrased it and in the way we dealt with the politics of the release of the report. I will return to that in a moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee heard a range of legal evidence and, as with all legal evidence, crossed the whole divide of views on the matter. But essentially it can be summarised that we heard evidence that the bills were constitutional and we also heard evidence that they were unconstitutional. But neither side could provide any legal opinion of direct High Court support for their proposition. It was argued from other precedents&mdash;precedents which were vague and sometimes quite unrelated&mdash;that there was some sort of relevance to those opinions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, the finding of the committee was that there was no High Court decision on this matter and therefore the question of what the High Court would decide was purely one for judgment. People would make an educated guess as to what the High Court would find on this matter and there were strong legal opinions on both sides of the issue, but no-one's legal opinion claimed to have direct authority from previous High Court judgments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that, all witnesses agreed that there had to be some doubt as to what the High Court might do. Even the most ardent advocates on both sides agreed that it was a question of doubt. Therefore, it was possible for each side to sustain its argument and to mount a reasonable case. In my view, that left the committee with only one conclusion&mdash;that there was a real risk that the matter could be declared unconstitutional by the High Court. There was also a real probability that it could be declared constitutional by the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is important to take people back to what the report of the committee actually said because that has been lost in the debate that followed. Certainly it has been lost very much in the debate tonight where opposition senators have tended to concentrate on the Treasurer and his remarks rather than the substance of the issue. Recommendation 1.1 of the committee's report says that ultimately this is a matter for the High Court. The primary recommendation from the committee when stating its major finding was that it is a question for the High Court and one that can only be answered in the end by that High Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's second conclusion was that, given the evidence before it, there was a real risk which was significant that the matter could be decided to be unconstitutional. I find those findings quite unremarkable. If we were operating in a non-political context, people would have said, `Judging by the evidence, that is a reasonable conclusion for a parliamentary committee to come to', and we would have moved on. But it was not that sort of context. There was a massive political and media debate over the budget delay, over the whole question of the constitutionality of the bills and over a whole range of political interests involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In writing the report, government senators should have been a little more political and less legalistic. That is not to say that we would have changed our recommendation, but I think we should have expressed the view&mdash;certainly the view that I held&mdash;that on balance the bills will survive a test in the High Court. But again that is a matter of opinion. It is an opinion from a non-lawyer but I think one that is just as valuable as many of the other opinions expressed in this debate. In the end we will only know when the High Court rules on a case that comes before it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe the Treasurer and the government were left to appear a bit unsupported by the government senators, and I think that is regrettable. Their position is defensible and it is a position that they were prepared to take, but on balance the committee's view was that there was a real risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The politics that surrounded the whole report have hidden the impact that should have occurred. Part of the reason for that flows from the position taken by the opposition senators in this report. The whole debate was played for all its worth. While I guess I should not be surprised by that, there were a couple of things that surprised me considerably. First, the committee report was four pages long. I had seen the draft of the final report, but a couple of days after the committee reported I saw the final published version. I then found there were not four pages of report but 19. I wondered where the other 15 pages came from. It appears that an additional 15 pages were provided by the senators who had voted for the unanimous four-page report, including one by the mover of the motion that we endorse the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am a bit new to this game but I wondered how that occurred. On a closer look, I found there were four pages of additional remarks by Senators Ellison, Vanstone and O'Chee, which went to a bit of political diatribe about the whole debate. This was somehow included as part of the committee's report. It was not a document that was shown to other members of the committee, but something that was included in the printed version. We then had seven pages of legal opinion from Senator O'Chee, an opinion which he preferred to those opinions made by the persons making contributions to the committee. We had four pages from Senator Spindler who also felt moved to make a contribution when he heard that the opposition senators were making a contribution. What was a unanimous four-page report became a 19-page report, 15 pages of which were a political contribution from those who had voted for the majority report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I admit that I am new to this game and I suppose I should have checked the rules and procedures more closely, but I have never yet operated in a committee process where such behaviour is condoned or regarded as acceptable. It is a matter that I will be raising with the committee and with the Clerk of the Senate because I really want to know the procedure governing such reports. I understood that minority reports were acceptable, but we have legal opinions, additional remarks and a whole mishmash of additional views provided by senators who supported the majority report. That raises a question that needs to be looked at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, that was only one of a couple of unsatisfactory aspects of the report. I am not seeking to put all of the blame for that on the opposition senators. The short timetable for the reference to the committee was unfortunate. It meant that the committee really did not get to grapple with the issue as it should have. I think that is reflected in what is a rather inadequate report, but that report is a preliminary report and it reflects the fact that the committee was not able to produce all its documentation and finalise the report in time to meet the deadline. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One problem that needs to be addressed is the pressures that mean that not all senators can attend the meetings when reports are finalised. I am not saying that it was a problem only for members on this side; it was a problem that we all experienced. There is also a question about whether such highly politicised references should be the role of the Senate committees. I have already referred to my concerns about the practice of issuing additional remarks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The time is right for us to move on. The government has responded by splitting the bills. The opposition had called for that approach, and it now has it. It now has to deal with the real politics; that is, whether or not it will support the principle that the government is allowed to frame its own budget. That is the real question at issue here and that is what the Senate will have to deal with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's approach in splitting the bills but also providing for a test of the principle at issue is a good one, because it is a matter that needs to be resolved. I refer again to the primary finding of the committee, which was that the matter was one for the High Court to determine. No amount of pseudo-legal opinion by members of this chamber will alter that fact. It is a question for the High Court and, until it makes a judgment, we do not know what the outcome will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand the opposition is now searching for further legal opinions designed to frustrate the government's new approach to the issue and is trying to argue that there are still some problems with the new split bills. From what I have seen, the only problem so far has been that the shadow spokesperson does not understand and does not have a grasp of those bills, as evidenced in his television interview. Senator Vanstone's gratuitous support for the government senators, in light of the way the politics around this was played, is particularly galling and regarded by government senators as fairly offensive and totally unnecessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot conclude without mentioning the comments about the Treasurer, as it has been such a focus. I am not such a delicate flower that a few off-the-cuff comments by the Treasurer unduly concern me. Having spoken to my colleagues, I do not think they seem unduly concerned either. I had the pleasure of working on John Dawkins's first campaign when he was elected to the parliament in 1974. It was my political baptism. I look forward to working on his 1996 campaign, which should then allow him to complete 15 years as a minister in a Labor government. The heart of the issue is the opposition's inability to come to terms with the fact that it lost the election and its inability to grant the government the right to frame its budget and govern in the best interests of Australians. </PARA>

In this case, the rules were sections 53 to 55 of the constitution. The constitution is a particularly special document because it is not like any other rules that we play by. The constitution is the body of overriding rules. The constitution is not like any of the other rules that we deal with in this chamber every day when we pass legislation, amend this or that and put a new set of rules into place there. The constitution governs how we should conduct the political process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To hear some of the cavalier views from the other side of the chamber this evening&mdash;and certainly to hear from the Treasurer the very cavalier view that `I don't care what the constitution says; I want to do it anyway'&mdash;is wholly unsatisfactory. If we say that sections 53 to 55 of the constitution are not important, then what portion of the constitution will we find unimportant tomorrow? What portion of the constitution will we disregard next week? Once we put the smallest hole in the dike, the rest of the water follows. The Treasurer was attempting to put a hole in the dike so that he could create a flood of action by the government which sought to disregard the constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chris Evans has just told us that he believes that this is ultimately a matter for the High Court. Ultimately, if this bill were to have been passed, it would have been a matter for the High Court because there is no doubt that this matter would have been challenged; there is no doubt that matter would have led to days, weeks or maybe even months of legal argument in the High Court; and there is no doubt that there was the very real risk that all of the tax that the government had purported to collect would have been ruled invalid and this money would have been plucked from the taxpayer's pocket with no hope at all of return or refund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In that sense, it was ultimately a matter for the High Court. But that is not to say that this chamber has no capacity to express a viewpoint; it is not to say that it is for the High Court alone to look at these matters. It is very clear that the High Court has probably at best very limited capacity to look at a bill before it has been passed by the parliament. Those powers given to the High Court in the constitution are in respect of acts of parliament that have already been passed.

Don't bother looking to see whether or not it is valid&mdash;just vote on it'. We would be pretty poor at our job if we took that sort of slapdash attitude.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It would keep the lawyers in business, but would it keep the country in business? Would it be aiding the political process and the good government of this country if we decided to create a piece of legislation which looked on its face to be bad and invalid and passed it through? It could be legislation which purports to validate the collection of millions, if not hundreds of millions, of dollars of taxation. What if we said, `But, look, we are only doing this for a bit of jolly because we want it to go to the High Court so that it can make a decision on it'? That would be ludicrous.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for us to look at the legislation. It would now be poor of us&mdash;this is my very real belief&mdash;to go and take the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill No. 2, the test bill, and pass it so that the whole matter can be decided by the High Court. We are saying, `Here is a report from this Senate committee which says that, on the face of it, the original bill is invalid or runs a real risk of being invalid. Here is a bill which is almost a mirror image of the first bill. We did not agree to the first one, but we will agree to the second one with the same constitutional flaw in it'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When in his press release the Treasurer announced the changes to the tax legislation and the splitting of the bill, he said, `If the original bill were to have been invalid, the test bill will also be invalid'. So it is not as though the government has said, `Okay, we accept what the Senate and the committee have said, we accept that there is a real risk, and  therefore we are going to modify our behaviour accordingly'. Instead the attitude is, `Fine. They said in a unanimous opinion that there was a real risk it was invalid, but we are going to push through with this nonsense anyway'. That is what we are getting from the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Was there any benefit to be gained in putting through this so-called test bill? Was the lumping of the two subjects of taxation in the test bill going to ease the passage of the bill through this parliament? Surely if some honourable senators agreed with one half of the test bill but disagreed with the other half of it, lumping the two provisions together would make it more difficult rather than less for that bill to gain passage through this chamber. If there is an objectionable piece in that bill which honourable senators here do not wish to pass, it means that the other portion must also fail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer said that he is concerned with fiscal responsibility and that is why he wants these bills passed. But if he is so concerned with fiscal responsibility, why has he brought before this chamber a bill which he knows will be more difficult to pass than a bill split into two separate parts? What is the rationale for what the Treasurer has done? There is no rationale here that is based on the good governance of this country or the interests of good parliamentary procedure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The test bill is an effort by the Treasurer to say, `Look, I do not care what you think, this is my viewpoint anyway. So we are going to spend millions of dollars debating this. We are going to create all sorts of mayhem just so that I may have at best a 50 per cent chance of proving a point'. It is my very firm belief that, just as the Senate would have been doing this nation a grave disservice in agreeing to the first bill because of its constitutional flaws, this Senate would be doing this nation the same disservice by agreeing with the test bill, with its same constitutional flaws. That point needs to be recognised by people on both sides of this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now wish to move on to some other comments that have been made tonight. It is very clear that the Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, has behaved in a grossly immature way in dealing with this whole matter. He has been petulant and badly behaved. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Brownhill" NAMEID="RD4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RD4">Senator Brownhill</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And badly advised, too.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EU4">Senator O'CHEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;He has also been badly advised. He was particularly badly advised in attacking the integrity of people who brought honest opinions before the committee. Everybody on the committee would agree that the viewpoints which were brought before us were honestly held and argued. Those who came before the committee gave their evidence in the best manner they possibly could. We had constructive and intelligent debate in the committee hearings.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the Treasurer did not like the way that things were going, so he made a grossly improper personal attack on the people who sought to give the committee advice. Let us remember that that grossly improper personal attack was designed to intimidate people from coming before Senate committees and arguing a viewpoint which is contrary to that of the government and of the Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All wisdom does not reside within the walls of this building. It does not reside in the Senate, in the House of Representatives or even in the two houses put together. It is our task to look at the wisdom which resides outside these walls and, when somebody can give us advice, to say that it is good and worth listening to or that a particular individual makes a point which could aid us in our decision making. That is what good government is all about. But the Treasurer made a wholly regrettable personal attack which was designed to intimidate people and discourage them from giving evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day, all that serves to do is not make the task of the committee, government or parliament easier; all it serves to do is make our task more difficult, because the next time there is a problem people may be reluctant to come forward and offer their honestly held views, whatever those views may be. The Treasurer really did himself a disservice in the way that he conducted himself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have also heard from Senator Chris Evans this evening who said that he is concerned at the process. I know that Senator Chris Evans is newly arrived in this chamber and we all go through a learning curve. Senator Chris Evans has to understand that those of us who added advices or opinions in the report of the committee did so so that those viewpoints, which were our personal viewpoints, were not seen as Senator Chris Evans's viewpoint, Senator Cooney's viewpoint or Senator McKiernan's viewpoint. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know that I necessarily always agree with what Senator Spindler says, but I respect his right to put his view. That is the process. If Senator Chris Evans was upset that there was a personal viewpoint, or more than one personal viewpoint, in the report with which he did not agree, perhaps he should ask himself why we went to the trouble to do so. We went to the trouble so that Senator Chris Evans would not be obliged to agree with a matter in respect of which he disagreed. We did so so that we could have a unanimous opinion of the committee. We could then also express additional viewpoints. But the unanimous opinion of the committee was just that&mdash;it was unanimous. That is the point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Rather than Senator Chris Evans complaining that somehow he felt ambushed&mdash;there was certainly no ambush because I understand the matter had been discussed at a committee meeting&mdash;perhaps he should be grateful that those of us who recognised the position in which he may have found himself were willing to keep in separate parts of the report those comments with which he would not agree, so that they could be attributed only to us and not to him. I hope that he understands that now; I hope that he understands what the process is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say in conclusion that the constitution is a remarkable document. In 1897, when the work was being done to draft these sections, our founding fathers could foresee the danger to this nation which might arise if a government sought to take a small attractive tax measure and lump it in with a series of unattractive and punitive tax measures. Our founding fathers saw very clearly the need for the Senate to maintain its independence in scrutinising properly the operations of government. It saw that the Senate and the Australian people should not be held to ransom. That is why the constitution, those guiding rules, require governments of all political persuasions to deal with tax matters separately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would hope that this whole saga serves not just to add to the good governance of the country but, more importantly, to remind Australians of what a wonderful legal and constitutional system we have and what wonderful protections there are for the liberties and freedoms of Australians. Any government, no matter what its political viewpoint, which seeks to ride roughshod over the constitution does a disservice not just to the members of this chamber but to this nation and to the people of Australia who have to suffer the consequences of arrogance, egotistical behaviour and, most importantly, an outrageous disrespect for the interests of the nation as a whole. </PARA>

I will only say that it would have been better if the good senator had put in the work during the two days in which we heard submissions and the two days of deliberations rather than waiting and doing a bit of grandstanding at this time. Senator O'Chee, who is leaving the chamber, attended for part of the first day. Apart from that, we did not hear from him until we got some opinion faxed to us on the last day of the committee's consideration and deliberations. This is a pity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs was actually quite a good committee. Members of the committee worked extremely hard and extremely well together, despite the fact that each of us was coming from a different perspective in addressing the questions that the Senate put to us. We all realised the seriousness of the matter that the Senate had referred to us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The constitution was mentioned on a number of occasions by previous speakers. I was not able to hear each and every speaker because of other commitments I have in this place. The constitution was referred to by the last speaker as a magnificent document. It would be even a more magnificent document were it able to be picked up by a person in the street, read and very clearly understood. I do not think that can happen in the case of the Australian constitution, and that came out quite clearly in the committee's deliberations on the matters that were before it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The constitution is a very complex document. I am not being critical of the founding fathers who put the words together 100 years ago. What I am saying is not a criticism of them at all. One has to admire their foresight in constructing things the way they did. Perhaps they foresaw the difficulties that the parliament is in at the moment, or was in last week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to be too controversial tonight. I think there has been far too much controversy about this issue. Like my colleague Senator Chris Evans, I will talk about the process. Unfortunately, I was not able to hear all that he had to say and contribute to this debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are allegedly talking about a committee report. But we are not actually talking about the full report; we are talking about half a report because the committee was not able, in the stupid time frame given to it by the Senate, to do justice to the job that was given to it. We have put in a third, or maybe even a quarter, of a document. We all agree that that is inadequate. There will be more to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's report has attracted criticism and perhaps part of the reason is that it is not a complete report. As such, some of comments made in the report by all of the committee members are not able to be referred back to in the evidence that the committee heard over two very long and very difficult days of taking evidence in Canberra and in Melbourne. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might make comment about the conditions in which we had to take evidence in Canberra. We had to use the government party room in the Senate. We worked in very cramped and difficult conditions. It is an indictment of this place that better facilities were not available to a parliamentary committee because of commitments to the Inter-Parliamentary Union conference. These were not good working conditions for the people serving on the committee, for the people supporting the committee or for people recording the processes of the committee. That should be borne in mind next time plans are made to hold such a conference in this building. There has to be some priority given to the work of this parliament. Consideration must be given to the facilities that are available to committees and also to the availability of personnel who serve committees so that the work of parliamentary committees can continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I called this reference a stupid decision of the parliament. On 31 August the Senate referred a series of questions to the Senate committee. It gave us a particularly restrictive reporting deadline of 15 September. When I heard about this at our first meeting, I objected and was able to get an extension of five days to 20 September. That was not enough&mdash;I think every member of the committee would agree that it was not enough. The subject matter that we were charged to investigate required a much longer time frame than that. I think the Senate has to take that into consideration in future when it refers matters of this seriousness to committees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Not only was it difficult for the committee but it was also difficult for the general public. As I recall it, an advertisement appeared in one of the major Australian newspapers advertising the terms of reference of the inquiry and inviting submissions. I think that advertisement appeared on either 3 or 4 September, with a closing date of 10 September&mdash;a week to prepare very complex arguments on a very complex subject. Again, that is not enough. The date was just picked out of the air. We need to keep that in mind for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I certainly for one, being a non-lawyer on the committee, enjoyed the process because it was a real learning experience for me to participate in. It was also a difficult experience because the issue was highly complex and detailed and many skilled and reasonable people appeared before us. It was particularly difficult to meet the deadlines that were imposed by the Senate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also found this to be a ground breaking committee. I have been in this place over eight years and I have been a member of a large number of committees. Some of them divide on political lines from time to time, but more often than not they come around and reach unanimous or near unanimous opinions. I have never participated in a committee where a unanimous decision is reached but then later on, without even the chairperson being informed until the last minute, additional comments are attached to the committee's report. I have not personally experienced that before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That procedure, which was adopted on this occasion by my opposition colleagues and by Senator Spindler, concerns me greatly. A great deal of goodwill exists in the committees&mdash;not only in the Senate committees but also in the joint committees. If there is not trust on one side or the other when decisions are reached, I would suggest that the committee system could break down at some future time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had a real feeling of concern on Monday of last week when I was informed from Canberra that additional matters were going to be attached to the committee report from member colleagues of that committee. I did not see the additional comments until after the report had been presented to the Temporary Chairman of Committees, Senator Childs. It was E-mailed across to me while I was on my way out to yet another parliamentary committee back in my home city of Perth. That procedure concerns me in respect of the future operations of any committee that I may be involved in. After this I would suggest that my colleagues on this side of the house will be very wary in future when they go through the process of committee deliberations after taking evidence, considering draft reports and then agreeing on the report. They will ask: will we be dry-gulched again by colleagues who, whilst agreeing with the majority report, want to add in other bits?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already expressed my concerns on this matter. Obviously, I will take it into consideration as I continue with the committee work of this place. I made a public comment yesterday that I am a member of seven committees of this place; it is actually eight. That is one heck of a workload for any individual to sustain. However, all of my backbench colleagues on this side of the chamber carry an equally heavy workload. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not need this additional element of mistrust placed upon us because it will make it more difficult for committees to reach consensus decisions. There are many issues that the parliament refers to committees for investigation on which consensus can be reached. From my personal experience I could point my finger to a number of examples where committees have actually aided the process of government and the parliament and in turn helped the people of Australia, which is what we are elected to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I want to recapitulate some of my public comments about the processes that have been engaged in and the critisism by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) of the government senators on the committee. I will not repeat what I said, but I am certainly not running away from my public comments made in anger in response to what I suggest were comments by the Treasurer that were also made in anger. Again, it is a learning experience for each and every one of us. It was never my intention to enter into a donnybrook with the Treasurer over this or any other matter. He and I have disagreed in the past, but we have agreed more often than we have disagreed. There is a tendency in my race for one not to automatically turn the other cheek when one gets smacked. Unfortunately, on this occasion I did not do that. But this is not the first time that I have been known to not meekly accept something and turn the other cheek. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is a problem for me, but it is also a problem for government ministers. I think that Mr Dawkins should have had that in mind when he made those comments the other day. He has certainly known me long enough to know that I would not meekly accept the admonishments that he was handing out; that is, I would not just pack them in a nice little satchel, run off and say, `Thank you very much, John'. It is not in my nature to do that, as he would be very well aware. I am certain that if the roles were reversed, if I were Treasurer and he were a member of the committee, knowing John the way that I do know him, he in turn would have reacted similarly to me, but I suggest that he probably would not have been quite as restrained as I was last week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to canvass the matter again. It is unfortunate when these things happen in this process that we are involved in. It does not add to good government when one has the back bench coming out criticising senior government ministers&mdash;ministers whom one holds in very high regard in normal day to day activities. I regret the fact that I was forced into the circumstance of making some criticisms about the Treasurer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by again drawing attention to the processes and procedures that we experienced on this committee. I think it was very bad form for my opposition colleagues and Senator Spindler to put in their additional comments in the manner in which they did, without even having the decency of letting us have a copy of the comments beforehand. While we were deliberating in the committee everything was out on the table; we each in turn argued our points, scored some and lost some as we went through. But this was very bad form. It is something that will be remembered, certainly by me, in future committee deliberations that I may be involved in. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee agreed to a report which was called a unanimous report. When we picked up the report on Monday, after it had been formally presented, we saw the words that our colleagues had put together in the form of additional comment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak to the motion of my Senate colleague Senator Vanstone that the Senate take note of the report by the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on the constitutional aspects of the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993. This inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs commenced with the motion that I moved in this chamber that the committee should look at the constitutionality of various parts of the government's taxation package, in particular, the omnibus tax bill, which it seemed to me was very likely to be unconstitutional.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government objected to that process. Nevertheless, the Senate very wisely sent to its committee consideration of the matter. It is history now that the committee unanimously reported that there was considerable risk in pursuing the legislation on the basis that it be presented to the Senate by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins). </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The motive of the Government, I think, is undisputed. The government sought to link a series of taxation matters with other matters in order to make it more difficult for the Senate to vote for and against certain tax measures. That was a strategy adopted by the Treasurer. Instructions were specifically given to the draftsman to that effect. The fact that the political objective of the government was likely to run counter to the constitutional requirements for legislation was simply ignored by the government. The government and, in particular, the Treasurer then clearly failed in their responsibility by seeking to pursue a very important piece of legislation in this chamber in a form that was very likely to be unconstitutional. Not only was that an offence to the Senate, but it was a highly unwise course of action for the government to have taken because, as was advised by a number of the constitutional experts, the chances were that the whole bill would fail upon subsequent challenge in the High Court. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So all of the new taxes that were being imposed, the additional taxes that were being raised, and some benefits that were being given would, somewhere down the road&mdash;perhaps next year&mdash;have been lost. The result in this nation would have been total turmoil. But that consequence to the nation apparently was disregarded because the government saw some short-term political advantage in pursuing its objectives in this way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate can certainly be proud of the contribution that has again been made by its Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional affairs, chaired very ably again by Senator Cooney. It has done the job well. It has advised the Senate of the legislative danger of what was being put to it. It has in effect advised the government of the folly of its proposed course of action. I regret that, instead of the Treasurer graciously accepting the advice of the Senate committee, putting the bill in a form that was clearly constitutional and avoiding the difficulties that were previously presented, he has not been prepared to act in that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In fact, what he has put to the parliament and what has been introduced in the House of Representatives today would appear to contain considerable constitutional doubt, at least in relation to the first and second bills, and possibly the third bill as well. In regard to the second bill, the Treasurer has acknowledged that there is a constitutional doubt. What he has sought to do is to ask the Senate, notwithstanding the previous experience, to pursue and pass that piece of legislation with the constitutional shortcomings in order that it might be tested in the court. That is in my opinion, and I put to you, Mr Acting Deputy President, improper parliamentary practice. It is wrong&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It might be the way that Senator McMullan thinks the parliament legitimately functions; I do not think it is.

I do not think that is good parliamentary practice and I am sure Senator McMullan does not think so either. But he is, of course, locked into the particular role being played by this Treasurer in his last days, probably, in office.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to that, as I said, it seems that the first bill that the government has introduced and which it does not refer to as a so-called test bill also deals with more than one imposition of taxation and is also, therefore, very constitutionally doubtful. Why has the government gone down the same track again? Why has it not learnt from its experiences of the last few weeks? Why is it putting its own program in jeopardy to try to win some cheap political point? It is a very hard question to answer. The most likely answer is that the Treasurer is simply not adequately coping with the process. We saw it in the way he abused his own colleagues on the committee for only doing their job. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even worse, we saw it in the way he abused the outside advisers who gave of their time to help the parliamentary process. Learned counsel from around Australia, people like Tony Morris QC, David Jackson QC, Stephen Charles QC and others, gave of their time and effort in order to help this parliamentary process and deal with a difficult constitutional question. What thanks did they get from the Treasurer of this nation? They got a mouthful of abuse. That is simply not good enough. It demonstrates that the Treasurer is not coping. That is presumably why he has brought back to the parliament today a set of bills which in part appear very likely to be constitutionally flawed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third area in which there is still some doubt relates to the third bill.

You should withdraw and redraft it in a form in which it is clearly constitutionally valid'. That is not an unreasonable thing for the Senate to expect and, in fact, demand.

We are not some form of constitutional guinea pig. We should not be treated in that way. It is so easy for the Treasurer to correct the doubt that exists in this test bill. He can simply split the taxes that are included within it and then there will be no constitutional doubt at all and the Senate will deal with the bills as it is obliged to deal with them under and in terms of the constitution. That is what the Treasurer should do. He should take it back, get it right and bring it back finally to the Senate in the proper form in order that it might be then dealt with here in this place. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Poor old Senator Cooney found himself having to argue that virtually everyone in the place was being political except the four members of the committee. I take off my hat to them as well because they did their job in the only way they could have done it. They came to the only conclusion that was open to them on the evidence. As a result, this government finds itself in very big trouble. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question that arises in my mind is whether Mr Dawkins ever bothered to inform himself about progress in that committee because we had the most inept performance on the part of both the Treasurer and Senator Gareth Evans, if they were seriously wanting to get this Bill through. They let the cat out of the bag on day one. They admitted that this was a political stunt. They admitted that it had no legal justification. This was being done for the very purpose that the constitution says is not to be permitted. In other words, you cannot tack. You cannot have a clutch of bills designed to put improper pressure on people who might otherwise want to vote against one on the merits and for another on the merits. You cannot compromise them in that way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With all the supposed legal skills that Senator Evans constantly self-proclaims in this chamber, he was not even able to come up with the slightest legal justification. In other words, he made it clear that this was a naked political ploy. Of course the Treasurer, who I think is still only a law student and probably ought to concentrate more on attending constitutional law lectures than he seems to have done at the present time, made abundantly clear in his submission to the committee that this was again a naked political exercise. He went on to say in his release that the test bill, which the government believes is consistent with section 55 of the constitution, allows the bill to be tested in the High Court. The deficit reduction bill (No. 2), the test bill, would be regarded as invalid by all those who have argued that the current bill is invalid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One does not have to be too smart to work out that the government backed down, humiliatingly, after two weeks of pretending that there was some sort of magical interlocking, that it could not separate any of these bills without disturbing the fundamental integrity of the package, and that somehow they were all perfectly above board and beyond challenge, for the simple and obvious reason which it now acknowledges: there is a significant risk. Otherwise, why is it playing these current splitting games? It has done it simply because it has to acknowledge the inevitable. In those circumstances it is simply outrageous for the Treasurer to go off on a frolic of his own to offer some poor, unfortunate litigant the opportunity, presumably at his or her own expense, to go to the High Court to establish what, as the Treasurer and everyone else seems to acknowledge, is a flawed bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Hill says, there is a very simple way out of all this. It is for the Treasurer to take heed of all the objective and impartial advice that has been available and the quality of submissions that have been made to the committee from those with no axe to grind&mdash;people who were not in any way chasing publicity or wanting to earn money, as Mr Dawkins quite outrageously suggested; people who simply felt compelled by the very nature of the actions of this government to spell out what they saw as the proper legal interpretation. They spelt it out in no uncertain terms, to the point where we had&mdash;as we often do in constitutional law matters, particularly when there is no authority right on the point&mdash;conflict between the experts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Putting aside Mr Rose, for the obvious reason that he does not fall into the category of impartial, independent experts, we are faced with a very one-sided contest&mdash;in fact, a no-game. The government, with all its resources, was not able to marshal even one independent practitioner to come along and support its case. In those circumstances, one can only draw the inevitable conclusion that it backed off for the very obvious reason that there would have been chaos and uncertainty on a continuing basis until the inevitable result had been handed down by the High Court. The logic of that decision has to be that the same approach ought to be adopted in this case. If it is not, the government and the Treasurer will be on a hiding to nothing, and deservedly so, because they are not in any shape or form required to take the action they have. It is simply, to use Senator McMullan's term, a childish political response to what ought to be a very serious legal issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can understand that the Treasurer might be under all sorts of pressures, but the fact remains that he ought to have had the opportunity to get impartial advice from experts, who I suggest would have come to only one conclusion: what we are proposing tonight is the proper way to go. The sooner the Treasurer acknowledges that, the sooner he will minimise the obvious continuing uncertainty that he himself has created, and that will obviate the necessity for this ludicrous proposal for test cases to go before the High Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The High Court is not in existence to provide advice to those who might seek it on a whim or to those who might be playing political games; the High Court is there for when there is a genuine and obvious matter of constitutional importance to be determined. That is clearly not the case here. All the actions of the government indicate that it acknowledges the force of the opinions that have been made public. In those circumstances, it ought to do the decent and honourable thing and cave in to reality as quickly as possible. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document. </PARA>
<PARA>The report by the Auditor-General, who, as honourable senators would know, is the watchdog of expenditure of taxpayers' money in Australia, was brought about because of a question asked by me in Estimates Committee D. I asked the Auditor-General whether the Australian National Audit Office had noted any increase in fraud involving government finance and activities over the past 12 months. The Auditor-General responded by saying:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have detected a very significant fraud which we have drawn to the attention of the Commonwealth police. For jurisdictional reasons, it then brought in the New South Wales police. We had been working with a New South Wales state instrumentality to get the evidence. It then was passed again, for jurisdictional reasons, to the Victorian police who, I think within the last three or four weeks, have taken sledgehammers and crowbars and knocked down their final doors and opened their final safes. . . . The Victorian police have appeared on television and said it is the biggest fraud they have ever seen.</PARA>
<PARA>It appears that the federal government and at least two state governments have become the victims of this major fraud. According to the evidence given by the Attorney-General, it was so widespread that it needed the resources of the Australian Federal Police, the police in Victoria and the police in New South Wales to unravel it. Because of the complexity of this scam and the staggering amounts involved, those investigating it took the unusual step of letting it continue for some three months so that solid evidence could be gathered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was quite apparent during the estimates committee that, for legal reasons, the Auditor-General could not or would not identify the area of service involved. The first detection, as I mentioned earlier, was based on services to New South Wales. The Auditor-General said that with further investigation and with the cooperation of victims&mdash;to use his words&mdash;it became evident that other governments, particularly the Victorian and federal governments, were involved. According to the Auditor-General, the scam had grown like a mushroom because no-one was watching or checking that contractual agreements were being met, particularly in relation to the type of servicing; whether it was being done and whether the bills being submitted&mdash;these are the accounts being submitted&mdash;were in fact correct. There were indications that some clients found themselves unable to assess the standard of service and merely paid up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tactics involved included threatening by writ the Auditor-General himself because of some sort of a release that got into the newspapers. When someone&mdash;apparently from the audit office&mdash;appeared on television and said no more than, `I cannot understand how our letter was leaked to the media', this prompted the threat of a writ by a solicitor. As far as I know, no writ has ever emerged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It appears from what the Auditor-General has said that there is little doubt that the end result will involve criminal charges being laid. However, the most pressing problem for the government was to review management procedures to ensure there was proper scrutiny and approval of accounts before any bills were paid. I think that is the crux of the matter. This shows that, while the government has been playing around with silly things like republicanism and flags and all this other red herring stuff, if it actually directed its attention to the management of government, to the management of taxpayers' funds, it would be more productive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I refer to a part of the Auditor-General's report which I think is particularly frightening. Item 13 under the heading `Implications for risk management' states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ANAO believes that the shortcomings revealed in the check of payments for this service may be only an indication of wider problems where functions previously carried out in-house are out-sourced. The daily dealings with contractors and the integral relationship of the work to an agency's operations can induce an environment in which there is an unrealistic assessment of risk in certification of payments. The Victoria Police Fraud Squad also has advised that this case highlights `the need for people to institute appropriate audit systems'.</PARA>
<PARA>I suppose this report will inevitably ask a lot more questions than it answers because, at this stage, all the Auditor-General has done is put out a preliminary report as a result of the interest shown in this particular significant fraud case during the estimates committee hearing. I suppose questions will be asked that I do not know the answers to, and I suppose it is best that we do not know the answers to some of these questions until the charges are laid. Where apparent fraud to this extent is carried out, it is important that those people involved be charged and brought to trial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet again, we have an instance which shows the importance of the Auditor-General in the whole concept of government and its operation. The Auditor-General has a record of producing excellent reports, not only in regard to this sort of thing but also with respect to efficiency of government operations. It is generally thought&mdash;the scuttlebutt around the place is&mdash;that the Auditor-General feels that there are parts of government that really do not appreciate the attention he gives, but it is attention that is absolutely vital if we are to have accountability of government, proper government and proper management of the economy of this country. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this bill will give effect to the government's decisions, announced in the "Investing in the Nation" statement:  to reduce the Commonwealth's shareholding in the Commonwealth Bank;  to provide a capital injection and a continuing subsidy to the Commonwealth Development Bank and: to amend the Commonwealth Development Bank's charter to expand its lending activity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main purpose of this bill is to amend the Commonwealth Banks Act 1959 to facilitate a reduction in the Commonwealth's equity in the Commonwealth Bank from around 70 per cent to a minimum of 50.1 per cent. This will not affect the government's guarantee of the Bank's liabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Originally, it was announced that the sale would proceed in the 1994-95 financial year. However, as the Minister for Finance announced on 2 July 1993, the proposed sale has been brought forward to the 1993-94 financial year. This decision enables the government to mitigate the impact that the postponement of the Qantas float would otherwise have had on this year's Budget.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At current share prices, the sale of this portion of the government's equity in the Commonwealth Bank is expected to raise around $1500 million.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I shall now outline briefly the measures contained in this bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments contained in Part 2 of the bill provide for the Commonwealth to reduce its shareholding in the Commonwealth Bank and stipulate that the Commonwealth cannot reduce its shareholding to below 50.1 per cent. This ensures that the Commonwealth will continue to retain majority ownership of the Commonwealth Bank.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sale of shares in the Commonwealth Bank could leave the purchasers of equity liable for certain State and Territory taxes and charges, in particular stamp duty. In the absence of any action, this would depress the expected returns to the Commonwealth (and hence to all taxpayers) from the sale of these assets and would benefit only the taxpayers in the particular State or Territory where the taxes are paid. It would also complicate the sale process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To avoid these issues the bill provides that the sale of the shares in the Commonwealth Bank and related transactions to the sale are to be exempted from State and Territory taxes and charges.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, the bill facilitates the government's decision to expand the role of the Commonwealth Development Bank by providing a one-off capital injection of $30 million in 1993-94 to allow the Commonwealth Development Bank to expand its lending, and to provide a continuing subsidy of $20 million per annum, to begin in 1993-94.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The capital injection will be in the form of an issue of Commonwealth Development Bank shares to the Commonwealth. The value of the shares will be determined by agreement between the Treasurer and the Commonwealth Bank Board. As a result, the Commonwealth, as beneficial owner of these shares, will be able to receive dividends from the Commonwealth Development Bank. The bill also amends the Commonwealth Banks Act so that the Commonwealth Development Bank is empowered to accept the subsidy from the Commonwealth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The capital injection and the continuing subsidy to the Commonwealth Development Bank will aid lending to the small business sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also amends the Commonwealth Banks Act to extend the Commonwealth Development Bank's charter to enable it to meet the full credit requirements (including refinancing) of small and medium size business customers. In the past, the charter has restricted the Bank to providing only part of these credit requirements in most instances. This change will ensure that the Bank is no longer largely restricted to providing supplementary finance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the amendments contained in this bill will benefit a wide cross section of the Australian population. Taxpayers will benefit from the proceeds of the sale, while the wider Australian public has a further opportunity to buy shares in one of Australia's premier financial institutions. And the general economic recovery will be assisted by the provision of additional funding opportunities for small and medium businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Full details of the amendments are contained in the Explanatory Memorandum being circulated to honourable senators.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill proposes another set of amendments to the flawed One Nation Development Allowance Authority. That authority was established as part of the One Nation proposals. These amendments&mdash;and they are the second set of amendments in just 12 months&mdash;propose further broadening of the eligibility for the development allowance in line with Labor's election promises to include some printing production and motor vehicle projects. These amendments reopen applications for these now eligible areas. The cost of these amendments is estimated by the government at $9 million this year, extending to $14 million by 1996-97 by which time the projects are required to have been commenced. The coalition will not be opposing this bill.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In May 1992 when the development allowance was introduced into parliament the coalition criticised a number of aspects of the proposed administration. The Senate will recall that that proposed administration was a one man, $1 million authority. We also criticised the restrictive nature of the allowance. It was restricted to projects over $50 million. Therefore, a vast bulk of those medium order range of projects that are so necessary to get this economy going again were excluded. We also questioned very carefully the inclusion of an unclarified test that was called a world competitiveness test. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That latter inclusion was all the more odd because it was waived for initial applicants. To this day we still do not have any idea what world competitiveness means in this context. As I understand it, no applications have been rejected on this ground. So the minister may provide an answer to this question to the Senate and the community in due course. It sounds like yet more of the Keating hyperbole and rhetoric. Since the original legislation in May of last year, the government moved amendments in September 1992 to broaden the scope and flexibility of the allowance and now the further election motivated commitments to fix unnecessary restrictive problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this authority was first debated in May 1992, I said three things on behalf of the coalition about the proposal. I said first that the legislation was a very shoddy piece of work; secondly, that it was a bureaucratic solution being imposed on investment decisions; and, thirdly, that the proposed list of projects smacked of little more than a political stunt. Nothing that we have seen in the now near 18 months since then has led me to any other view. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first point in relation to the shoddiness of the original legislation has been shown to be true by the major amendments introduced both shortly after its initial passage and again today in the bill that we are now debating. The second point&mdash;namely, that a very bureaucratic solution was being imposed on investment decisions&mdash;is a far more serious criticism, certainly when one looks at the overall national interest. Private investment has failed to recover from the depths that it sank to during the recession. Last year private business investment, as illustrated in the budget, fell by a further 3.8 per cent and that was after a fall of 15.3 per cent the year before and falls in the two preceding years before that. So we have had a continual progressive fall in the level of private business investment in this nation over a period of at least four years. There is precious little sign of any significant or sustainable recovery in that investment level. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst private business investment continues to languish the way that it has for so many years, there is no hope that we will see a sustainable and strong recovery in the economy, an improvement in job creation and a reduction in the appalling unemployment figure that we have seen for far too tragically long now. This year private business investment is forecast to rise but by a minuscule one-quarter of one per cent&mdash;in other words, really no change at all. That figure is so small that it could be put down simply to statistical error. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has failed to realise that investment does not occur because the Prime Minister says it should or will occur or because some bureaucratic authority is established to process it. Business investment only occurs if the climate is right. The continued absence of investment and the further run down of Australia's productive capacity are matters of serious concern for all public policy matters. As I said, without it there can be no sustained economic recovery, no improvement in living standards, no hope of any reduction in unemployment and no chance of reducing the crippling current account deficits and associated foreign debt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is at the core of our economic problems and a key to solving our social problems that we get investment rising again. Instead, we find that the economy, in so far as some of the vital statistics are concerned, is going from bad to worse. This year the government is forecasting a further worsening in our current account deficit to the rest of the world back to $18 billion&mdash;a 50 per cent increase over the deficit of just two years ago&mdash;at a time when the Prime Minister of Australia tells us that the budget will whirr back into balance and exports will go gang busters and so on. His very same budget documents show that far from exports going gang busters, what is going bust is the Australian economy with a further massive increase in our external deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result our dollar will continue to weaken which in itself, increases our foreign debt&mdash;a gross debt now well in excess of $200,000 million, a net foreign debt in excess of $170,000 million. Far from those figures improving, and by that one would have to mean reducing, they are all going the other way, the wrong way&mdash;and not just in terms of our indebtedness to the rest of the world, but this government is going into increasing debt as well. This year we will not have an improvement in the budget deficit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> For the last several hours and weeks we have been talking about what the government calls a tax deficit reduction bill. That is a misnomer. Now we have seven or eight tax deficit reduction bills. The truth is that this year the deficit will not be reduced; it will blow out by another $1 1/2 billion from last year's already huge figure of $14.5 billion or thereabouts to a figure of $16 billion this year. That estimate is based on pretty shonky projections in terms of growth and some of the other economic parameters which have been used. Indeed, there is every probability that that figure of $16 billion will prove to be a gross underestimate. In arriving at that figure, the government has used what can only be called some highly creative accounting. So we have a climate in which the government is fundamentally doing nothing at all to stimulate or encourage sustainable private investment, and we all know the consequences of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point of criticism that I made when this authority was established last year was that the proposed list of projects that was touted around at the time by the government smacked of little more than a political stunt. The One Nation exercise was politically motivated. One Nation was going to save the world. It sank without trace within a matter of weeks or months and the economy has continued to sink. One Nation was intended to provide a list of investment proposals that the Prime Minister could boast about in the context of an election, and boast he certainly did as the months ran through from the middle of last year to the election in March of this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators will recall that the Prime Minister hailed the coming of an investment avalanche. He said, `We'd better watch out or we'll get knocked over along with the budget whirring back into balance'. Indeed, he had the hide to claim that, as a result of the development allowance in particular and associated proposals, there was $130,000 million worth of investment projects under way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Right from the start there was no way that that was going to be anything other than yet another election lie. There was never $130,000 million worth of projects ready to go. Never for one single second was there a project list totalling that amount. That development allowance proposal was designed to draw out ever wilder and more fanciful schemes just in case it ever came off the drawing board. Possible projects to a value of $100,000 million might have been submitted for approval. Have we ever seen the evidence of that? The answer is no. There is no evidence that they were even submitted for approval. Certainly, the number of completed projects proves that the whole thing was a monstrous furphy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recent report of the Development Allowance Authority for the year to 30 June 1993 states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the total capital value of all projects registered to date is of the order of $14.5 billion &mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I stress the word `registered'. That is approved but not necessarily commenced projects; there is no guarantee that they will commence. Even those figures&mdash;projects worth less than $15 billion, and 18 months after this initial proposal was announced&mdash;are light years away from the Prime Minister's wild, unsubstantiated assertions of a $130,000 million pot of project gold. It is incomprehensible how any person could face the electorate and say with any degree of veracity that there was such a pot of projects in the pipeline. It can only be put down to yet another of the cynical, deceitful lies that the Labor government engaged in during the run-up to the last election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, 18 months or more after the grand release of the One Nation statement by the Prime Minister, the Development Allowance Authority lies tattered and completely discarded. In that time, Australia's investment ailment that One Nation was supposed to cure has gone from serious to critical. Investment is in need of intensive care. But this government seems intent on ignoring meaningful, worthwhile real solutions to the problems that face us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That situation, of course, will hurt and damage Australians even more than it has in the past. One million Australians are unemployed and another million are underemployed or have dropped out of the work force in despair. That is a tragedy that lies at the feet of this government. It is a tragedy that will only be solved by a change of government and a complete change of policy direction in this nation of ours. The proposals that are contained in the Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill, whilst we do not oppose them, will never start the serious process of providing the real solutions that we so desperately need to our problems. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The stated purpose of the original bill, the Development Allowance Authority Amendment Bill 1992, was to enable corporations to aggregate two or more joint venture projects. That really meant that subsidised expenditure in the long term would lead to certain new capital. But why? Employment creation was not a criteria. Expenditure in a new productive facility or expanding, improving or upgrading an existing productive facility was its stated aim. A condition was that the project was not in an industry which had an effective rate of assistance of more than 10 per cent. This, as I looked further, became more and more ludicrous as a criteria in relation to the kind of industries which were chosen for this allowance. Who calculated this effective rate of assistance and on what basis? Were royalties, electricity and water tariff subsidies and infrastructure provided at the public expense included? Obviously not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The One Nation statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in February 1992 provided for the acceleration of depreciation of plant and equipment to give Australia a more competitive investment environment. That was for projects which offered particular benefits for Australian competitiveness on world markets. The development allowance was to be at the rate of 10 per cent and allowed when plant was first used or installed ready for use. But it came with a series of selection criteria, including the absence of any substantial assistance or protection; positive facilitation by state and local governments in relation to such matters as project approval processes; where appropriate, the economic and efficient pricing of inputs under the control of public utilities and statutory marketing authorities&mdash;unfortunately, in Western Australia this means subsidised tariffs for many of those aspects&mdash;and similar or complementary action at a Commonwealth level. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak about the comments of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), as reported in the media, whilst he was overseas. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> of 27 September 1993 stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister attacked the French, asking whether the tens of thousands of Australia's war dead buried in France meant anything to the French. He said, `I was there with the names of 11,000 Australian servicemen and women engraved on the wall of that place'.</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Keating was referring to the Australian War Memorial at Villers-Bretonneux when he said `that place'. Referring to Australia's trade links and trade possibilities in Europe, Mr Keating went on to say:</PARA>

<PARA>Again, he stressed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Did it mean anything to them?</PARA>
<PARA>That is, Australia's contribution in World War I. The linking of Australian graves that lie in France along the Western Front to an attack upon the French and France's current economic policies by our Prime Minister deserves the utter contempt of Australians. I say this with the deepest conviction and I say it with the qualifications to do so. Belonging to the National Party, representing the rural sector of Australia, I know only too well the lack of advantage given to our efficient farmers by European trade walls. I am on record in my time in parliament for stepping forward and condemning the French many times for their nuclear testing in the southern Pacific. </PARA>

In many ways those visitors see the soul of Australia&mdash;the touchstone of our nationhood. But when this Prime Minister walked up to those white crosses he took the opportunity to desecrate their memory and to forge a lie&mdash;that their sacrifice meant nothing to the French. It is a lie because there is no doubt that between the Australian people and the French, and the Europeans generally, the worth of the Australian sacrifice has not been forgotten from generation to generation.

While at least three of the non-government organisations will be sending female representatives and there is scope for certain departments to select women to represent them on the committee, to this point the government has seen fit to exclude women from the national body which will consider important population issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find this very disturbing, as no doubt have many others who have contacted my office about it. I am also surprised that no women were specifically appointed to the committee by the government when the government has set as its goal a requirement that a minimum of a quarter of all members of committees should be women. As I mentioned earlier, I was alerted to the fact that no women were appointed by the government and that all the government appointees were male; therefore, I have put a number of questions on notice about this issue. I am particularly interested to know whether the register of women was used when the government appointed the members and the chair to the committee. If no reference was made to the register, I will be even more interested to know the reason why the government decided not to refer to it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The acting head of the Office of the Status of Women has recently stated that Australian women's participation on the register of women makes a significant contribution to their part in the decision making process in this country. I would like to believe that was true. However, I find it difficult to believe that the register makes a significant contribution to the appointment of women on government boards and committees when it is rarely used by government departments. The answer which I will table later shows exactly that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an answer to one of my questions, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet has revealed that in 1993 only 29 searches on the register of women were requested by departments. In fact, the Department of Social Security has never requested a search on the register of women since its inception. This is hardly a glowing record, and I suspect that it is not likely to improve in the near future. I often have people say to me, `I've been on that register of women and have never been contacted'. We can well understand why when we see the answer that has been given to my question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The register of women was set up with a great fanfare. In 1987 former Senator Ryan said that it would make a great difference and that the number of women participating in committees would increase because of that. If one looks at the document I will table later, one will realise why it has not been as successful as perhaps former Senator Ryan and many women who put their names on the register would have hoped.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In October 1987, Senator Ryan announced the upgrading of the register. In the year after the review only 44 searches on the register of women were requested by departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that this government has been very good at lecturing and berating sections of the community&mdash;and that includes state governments and business&mdash;about their treatment of women, but it has not practised what it preaches. It has failed to encourage departments to use what could be a very useful tool for advancing Australian women's participation in the decision making process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I seek leave to table the answer to my question in estimates which lists, quite clearly, the number of times various departments have used the register of women. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LI4">Senator PATTERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As I said, one department has never used the register; a couple of departments have managed the wonderful score of two in the whole time since it was revamped in 1987; a couple managed 13 consultations; some managed 15; another one used it seven times; and another one used it five times. That is not a very good record of using the register of women.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that issue will be addressed by departments and at least by Senator Bolkus in his answer to Senator West's question today. I could see why there was consternation on that side of the chamber when he answered that question, because members opposite obviously have had representations, as I have, that he would address that issue with Senator Crowley. I hope the government will do that because its record does not match its rhetoric. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) I am advised that on 19 March 1993 Mr Gregory Symons entered into a `plea bargain' with the Marshall Islands' authorities in relation to 15 counts of forgery arising out of his alleged involvement in a scheme to obtain Marshall Islands' citizenship for Taiwanese nationals in exchange for money. I am further advised that the result of the plea bargain was that Mr Symons was effectively sentenced to 10 years imprisonment suspended on the following conditions: first, that he spend 90 days in imprisonment on the Marshall Islands; second, that he repay the Taiwanese nationals over the next ten years the monies he received from them; third, that he make a public apology to the Marshall Islands in relation to the matter, and fourth, that he not leave the country until extradition arrangements are in place between Australia and the Marshall Islands.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) I am advised that the Office of the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions has completed its consideration of this matter and has advised the Australian Federal Police that Mr Symons should not be prosecuted for an offence under the Migration Act 1958. I am further advised that Australia and the Marshall Islands do not need to conclude an extradition treaty because both countries enjoy a non-treaty extradition relationship based upon reciprocity. The relationship is based upon each country's ability to extradite to the other in the absence of a treaty. Australia became aware that the Marshall Islands could extradite to Australia when the Marshall Islands extradited a person to Queensland for murder in 1990. Since then, Australia has been seeking to establish a non-treaty extradition arrangement with the Marshall Islands. This arrangement, for Australia, was put in place when Australia's extradition law was applied to the Marshall Islands on 30 June 1993. The recent application of Australian extradition law to the Marshall Islands is not specifically related to the matter of Mr Gregory Symons or any other criminal matter pending in either country, nor has the Australian Government given the Government of the Marshall Islands any undertakings or assurances in relation to Mr Symons' or any other individual's possible extradition.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) A five member delegation of Burmese officials visited Australia from 29 July&mdash;8 August as part of a three month international tour which also took in Austria, Germany, the United States, the United Kingdom and Japan. The delegation was led by U Win Pe, a member of the Myanmar Historical Commission. Major Ngwe Tun of the Burmese Defence Ministry did not lead the delegation, but acted as secretary for the group.

During the meeting I stressed to the delegation that Burma was widely perceived to be out of step with the broader regional trend towards more participative systems of government and that Burma's acceptance into the regional and international communities was unlikely until there had been meaningful political and human rights reforms.

These circumstances did not apply in the case of the proposed visit of Lieutenant-General Chainarong Noonpackdi, who was refused entry into Australia in May this year because his visit was assessed as not meeting the public interest criteria as set out in our migration regulations.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Aircraft flying over Darwin will be in transit to or from exercise areas. Any flights near the city involving formations of aircraft are conducted for necessary practice or for air traffic control related to the efficient recovery of the aircraft to the base or departure to the exercise area. Flying in pairs actually reduces disturbances because it halves the number of passes over a particular area for the same traffic volume. Nevertheless, in all cases, separation requirements are designed to ensure safety and prevent conflict between aircraft. Minimum altitude requirements over populated areas are comparable to those applying to civil aircraft which are designed to permit aircraft to fly clear of populated areas to the maximum extent possible, in the event of any mishap. In fact, when military aircraft are in the airfield environs they fly at a higher altitude than the minimum allowed in aviation publications.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Live weapons are not carried on exercise aircraft unless their employment is necessary for the exercise. This essential practice will relate to live firing in suitably safe locations: safe as to both the ground or water over which it occurs and the management of airspace in conjunction with the Civil Aviation Authority to ensure compatibility with civil aviation or at air weapons ranges with strict controls applied. Most practice is carried out with inert weapons with no high explosive content. Advanced technology and extremely stringent maintenance standards make any possibility of accidental release of weapons virtually impossible. Protective mechanisms are engaged in any flight over populated areas.</PARA>

This second document is the RAAF policy document which details the three phases of accident response: Preparatory Phase, which includes the evaluation of hazards and resources, the preparation of plans, training and the regular practice of emergency arrangements by emergency services; Emergency Phase, which includes the alerting and dispatch of emergency services to the accident site, extinguishing of fires, rescue/recovery, treatment and removal of casualties, and the command and control over emergency services operations; and Recovery Phase, which includes the security of wreckage, inquiries by the Director of Air Force Safety (now retitled to the Director of Flying Safety&mdash;Air Force) and formal investigations, salvage and disposal of wreckage, care and disposal of survivors, casualties and cargo, and the administrative aspects of aircraft accidents.

Thus the fact that funds are earmarked for housing for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people under the  Commonwealth-State Housing Agreement (CSHA) does not of itself mean that any additional demand has been created for public housing. By the same token, ATSIC's funding for rental housing relieves the need for funding through other public sources.
