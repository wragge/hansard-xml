<TITLE>Drugs</TITLE>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth; that we support your efforts to strengthen our family and community life particularly by increased penalties for "drug pushers" and distributors. We, however, wish to register our firm opposition to any legal changes which would increase or encourage the distribution or availability of so-called "soft drugs" such as marijuana. We believe such drugs to be harmful to the physical and psychological health of the individual and therefore to the interest of the community of which such individual is part. Although there is current controversy concerning the question of such harm it appears to us quite foolish to legalise and encourage the use of such drugs unless or until it be shown that such drugs are in fact harmless. The serious social problems of alcohol should provide sufficient warning to our society.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any efforts to legalise or decriminalise usage or distribution of such drugs will have the following results:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">1. Encourage and inculcate a social acceptability towards such drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">2. Increase the volume of usage of such drugs in schools and the community by present users and by "drug pushers" through the proposed one ounce legal possession.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">3. Extend the usage of such drugs to persons who would previously have abstained because of the legal sanctions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">4. Put pressure upon Parliament to establish and license import, growth, manufacture and/or distribution of such drugs, that is, to regulate another destructive industry contrary to the best interest of the individual and society.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">5. There would be the probable temptation to tax such drugs as another source of Federal revenue.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We urge the Government to increase the medical and counselling facilities for the assistance of drug users and to expand existing Drug Referral Centres and Clinics. We have general confidence in the existing law and its sympathetic implementation by the Police and Courts.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that your honourable House will firstly take no measures that could extend the major social problem of drug usage and secondly will oblige those who are promoting marijuana and/or similar drugs to prove without doubt that such drugs are harmless before any legalisation or decriminalisation of use is introduced. And your petitioners as in duty bound, will ever pray.</PARA>

<TITLE>Influenza Vaccine</TITLE>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The humble petition of we, the undersigned citizens of Australia, respectfully showeth:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We wish to draw your attention to the urgent need for funding for the recently released Hib vaccine. Hib disease causes suffering, death and permanent disability in babies and young children.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Hib vaccine is recommended by the NH&amp;MRC for all babies and children from the ages of 2 months to 5 years. It is to be added to the routine immunization schedule and is the first significant addition since measles in 1968. All other routine vaccinations are free.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Hib vaccine is presently only available to those who can afford to pay for it on a user pays basis. This will effectively result in many babies and children remaining at risk of contracting the Hib disease. This is a social justice issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe it is inappropriate to add this vaccine to the recommended schedule when it is unfunded or only partially funded.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are asking that this vaccine be made accessible to all babies and children from 2 months to 5 years of age. Please fully fund this new Hib vaccine for all Australian children.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;When speaking to this motion on 19 May I made the point that due consideration ought to be given by the Government and by the Opposition to the points that were advanced in support of the disallowance by Senator Sowada and, if they would be kind enough, to the points that I was making. I am now even more convinced of the justification for Senator Sowada's motion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The disallowance is an attempt to rectify what we see as discrimination, particularly against families who have a number of sons and daughters in secondary or tertiary education. Regulation 51 says that students are not entitled to Austudy that is $1,000 or less per annum. As was indicated in the debate on 19 May, this will impact quite seriously on a family which contains three or four students. In respect of Austudy, this regulation would reduce the income of a family with four students by $4,000, minus $4&mdash;in other words, by $3,996. That is not chickenfeed when it comes to a family trying to make ends meet. As I mentioned on 19 May, it does not fit comfortably with the Government's policy&mdash;and, indeed, with the policy of the Opposition&mdash;and the general desire of the Australian community to encourage young people to acquire skills so that they will be able to obtain jobs and enhance their creative capacities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government may say, `Well, this particular proposition will not deter persons from pursuing that objective'. It may also say that, in its view, it is too costly to continue the current process of paying on a regular basis that amount up to $1,000 a year. The Government relies fairly heavily on the Chapman report and on an Australian youth survey conducted by DEET in 1990 which showed that when it came to Austudy of $25 or less per week the proportion of parents who said their children needed it to stay at school was rather small. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not apparent from this document whether the parents understood that that $25 per week meant $25 per student or $25 per family. Because of the operation of two factors&mdash;the present sibling concession and the operation of regulation 51, which Senator Sowada is seeking to disallow&mdash;a family with four students could be affected by as much as $3,996 a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government will say, `Well, if two of those students are secondary students, family payments can be claimed in respect of them'. Even so, there would be a gap of around $10 a week. The difference between Austudy and a family payment of $1,000 per annum would be about $10 a week. Families would still be losing roughly $500 a year per student. Then the Government might say, `Well, in respect of those students who are receiving less than $1,000 a year, the operation of the regulations would enable those students to take out a loan of $1,000 a year'. They lose $999 and are told they can get a loan for $1,000. To be quite frank, that is of small comfort. That loan, as we know, will need to be repaid if the student is able to obtain employment. Once the remuneration for that employment has reached about $27,000 a year, then the repayments, as I understand it, start to operate at a rate of about two per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those responses by the Government do not in any way deter me from my very strenuous support for Senator Sowada's disallowance motion, particularly as it attempts to rectify what is seen as discrimination against larger families. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;I have already indicated on the coalition's behalf that we do not support Senator Sowada's motion for disallowance. When I spoke previously, I outlined as carefully as I could the reasons for this. Those reasons remain persuasive in the view of the coalition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the course of the debate on this motion, Senator Harradine very genuinely&mdash;and I think with Senator Sowada's nodding approval&mdash;appealed to the chamber and not least the coalition to give consideration to the effect that this cut-off would have on families which have more than one child. He asked us to consider whether there would be a harsher effect on families with more than one child undertaking secondary or tertiary studies. I rise only briefly to say that we listened carefully to that appeal. We are aware that that is why this debate has been deferred until today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague Mr Andrews, the shadow Minister for schools and training, who is responsible for matters concerning student allowances, has had careful discussions with my coalition colleagues. We remain opposed to Senator Sowada's disallowance motion because the disallowance affects all Austudy students, not just those who are members of a family with a number of students. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make three brief points. The Government has responded to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. It has also responded to the Chapman report. In the case of Austudy, a sibling concession in terms of adjusted family income is already in place. For a dependent student over the age of 16 in receipt of Austudy, the adjusted family income is $3,700 more than it would be if there were only one Austudy student in a family. In the case of students under 16 years old, for the first sibling the allowance is an additional $1,200 in terms of the adjusted family income and $2,500 for siblings beyond that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Harradine referred to cases where four students in a family are receiving Austudy. There is already a concession in relation to an adjustment to family income which seeks to take that into account. In so far as there is any shortfall in the benefit to such families, the Government ought to take into account what has been said in this debate and, in due course, bring back to the Senate any regulation that would be fairer to families with a number of children receiving Austudy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am aware also of the answers that have been given to Senator Harradine with regard to questions he asked at recent estimates hearings relating to Austudy and its effect upon families with a number of students receiving Austudy. Senator Harradine wanted to know the effect of combining tax and Austudy withdrawal rates on such families. There are very sharp cut-offs, and there is a counterproductive impact upon families with many children. These matters also ought to be considered by the Government. I repeat on behalf of the coalition that we do not support Senator Sowada's disallowance motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;in reply&mdash;I thank honourable senators for their contribution. I particularly thank Senator Teague and the Opposition for giving us the time to discuss this issue. I thank them for having the courtesy to listen to our arguments and I hope that they did find them in some way persuasive. Likewise, I thank the Government, particularly the Minister for Schools, Vocational Education and Training, Mr Free, for taking the time to meet with Senator Harradine and me. I am still very disappointed that the Opposition will not be supporting this disallowance motion. I believe that the arguments we have put are persuasive. The regulation clearly affects thousands and thousands of students currently in secondary school.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will briefly respond to some of the arguments that have been put to us in this debate. The report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training and the Chapman report have been referred to. I make the point that the House of Representatives report&mdash;the Price report&mdash;did suggest that small amounts of Austudy would not affect the capacity of a family to actually send their child to school. This may well be the case in the broader sense, although I wonder whether the House of Representatives committee absolutely understands the desperate need of so many families in Australia at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the inquiry into youth unemployment conducted by the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training we came across a lot of information and evidence which suggested that, whilst parents may still be struggling to send their children to school, the costs involved in that education are enormous. I made reference to this last week in the debate on this motion for disallowance. The cost involved in educating a child&mdash;for example, school excursions, uniforms, books and the cost of elective courses where there is a practical content&mdash;is in some cases beyond the reach of struggling families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer the Senate to page 152 of the Senate standing committee report, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Wanted: our future</EMPHASIS>, which indicated that privately funded programs are now run by the Smith Family and other organisations to actually assist families with these extra costs. The `Edu-cate' program essentially provides scholarships to young people to help meet the costs associated with their education. It is precisely these kinds of costs that smaller amounts of Austudy would seek to cover. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has also told us in briefings that those families who lose this particular Austudy payment will qualify for the basic family payment of $10.35. However, that is still a loss of some $9.65 per week to those families. Once again, that represents an enormous amount of money not coming into the family budget over a year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the Government that there must be better ways of doing this. Why a lump sum payment could not be considered is beyond me. It seems beyond the capacity of the bureaucrats and the Government to dream up a scheme that would make payment administratively more simple. I recall that one of the reasons why the Government put forward this particular restriction last year was to save on administrative costs. We accept, as I said last week, that there are certainly some savings to be made, but again, that was all too difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Is it possible for the Government, in conjunction with DEET, to devise a scheme whereby perhaps there could be a minimum of $1,000 per family as opposed to a minimum of $1,000 per child?  That is another measure that could be taken into account if we see some further amendments to Austudy regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard the argument that the Government has responded to the Chapman report. The Government has gone part of the way towards implementing some of the recommendations of the Chapman report&mdash;the ones that save it some money and the ones that make it look as though it has fiddled around the edges with some of the recommendations&mdash;but it has not fully implemented some of the recommendations, although issues such as the loans scheme and so forth very quickly found their way into the budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With those few words&mdash;without wanting to prolong the agony on this matter any further&mdash;I simply say that I am very disappointed that the Opposition has not seen fit to support us in this measure. Once again, the Government continues to implement measures in the Fightback package. We will be watching the Budget that will be tabled in August very closely to see how far this Government is prepared to continue to implement Fightback measures, especially in the areas of education, health and social welfare. In my view, we have not seen the end of this insidious piece of government policy making. I urge the Australian public likewise to be vigilant and ensure that it has not elected a conservative government by stealth. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The measures contained in the Insolvency (Tax Priorities) Legislation Amendment Bill were announced by way of a joint press release from the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and the then Attorney-General on 2 December 1992. I draw the Senate's attention to the fact that there has been a five-year gestation period between the introduction of the measures in this Bill and their recommendation by the Law Reform Commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill has had a curious introduction to the Parliament. Prior to these sittings it was listed for introduction in the autumn session and was then withdrawn at some stage, unbeknown to me. Then, last Wednesday, 19 May 1993, the Bill was introduced precipitately by Senator McMullan, with the apparent expectation that it could be debated the next day. In any event, we find ourselves debating it today, but one can only wonder at the motivation behind this sort of behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also concerned at the lack of opportunity given to outsiders to participate in a scrutiny debate of this Bill. This lack of opportunity is unfortunate, given representations from outside groups, including the Law Council of Australia, which believes that this Bill should not be introduced in its present form until the Law Council has had an opportunity to look at its various provisions. The insolvency practitioners group is of like mind. However, at the same time I must say that the Bill is properly motivated and its intention quite desirable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Bill contains major amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act and, consequent on these primary amendments, it also amends a number of other Acts, including the Corporations Law, the Bankruptcy Act 1966, the Crown Debts (Priority) Act 1981 and the Crimes (Taxation Offences) Act 1980. The background to this Bill is found in the priority accorded to the payment of certain of the debts to the commissioner over all other debts in the post-bankruptcy or insolvency division of assets. The only exceptions to this priority attach to the costs of a trustee in bankruptcy and fees properly incurred in the administration of the insolvent estate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sections 221P, 221YHJ, 221YHZD and 221YU of the Income Tax Assessment Act are the specific sections which accord the commissioner priority for the respective following debts: first, unremitted tax instalment deductions in respect of an employee's salary and wages; second, unremitted deductions of tax made in respect of the prescribed payments system; and, third, unremitted withholding tax in respect of a natural resource payment, a royalty payment, dividends or interest paid to a non-resident. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The priority has been the subject of criticism and much litigation over its period of existence. It has most often been criticised on the obvious ground that, after the tax office has satisfied its claims, there is little or nothing to pay to the former employees for their basic entitlements or to pay to unsecured creditors for their debts. The size of the debt to the ATO is often exacerbated by the ATO's slowness to act to recoup the money owed, such lack of urgency being a result of the tax office's guaranteed return through the existing priority. Obviously, as the tax office delays and the debt grows, the residual for others diminishes accordingly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the hardships created by priority, it does have a logical justification in that the unpaid amounts are not in truth the assets of the company but simply employees' taxes held by the company as the unpaid tax collector. The problem arises because, as an enterprise falls into financial difficulties, occasionally the company's management or directors&mdash;who apparently, like the rest of us, can resist anything except temptation&mdash;may use these deducted moneys as emergency working capital. That is the nub of the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it should be remembered that, while the priority is defensible as a matter of law, such reasoning is of little comfort to the employees. A second problem with the priority has arisen with the recently announced new insolvency procedure through voluntary administration. This procedure is designed to allow a company to trade out of financial difficulties under an administrator. Creditors, who must assent to the arrangement&mdash;which involves a moratorium on debts for all creditors&mdash;are unlikely to do so if the only probable beneficiary of this particular arrangement is the Australian Taxation Office. In the current environment there is a need to remove the priority of the tax office. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the provisions of the Bill. The clauses of this Bill basically fall into four parts: first, the abolition of the commissioner's priority in insolvency in respect of the four categories of unremitted amounts; secondly, the provision of a new method whereby the commissioner may recover any unremitted amounts by estimating the amount due, such estimate automatically creating a recoverable debt; thirdly, the extension of liability, beyond any that may exist under the insolvent trading provisions in the Corporations Law, for the unremitted amounts to company directors in certain circumstances; fourthly, consequent amendments to the Corporations Law and other legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now wish to deal with each of these four issues in turn. The first is the abolition of the commissioner's priority. This is achieved by a simple removal, from the four sections of the Income Tax Assessment Act that accord the priority, of the trustee's liability in insolvency for deductions made in respect of the four categories of payment after 30 June 1993. This removal is effected by the insertion of four new subsections&mdash;clauses 7, 9, 11 and 15 of the Bill. As priority is accorded to the particular debts outlined earlier for which the trustee is liable, the removal of this liability from the priority provisions correspondingly removes the priority, rendering these sections obsolete for deductions made after 30 June 1993. Priority will remain for amounts due and payable before 1 July 1993 while the trustee's ordinary liability to the tax office is preserved by an extension of section 215 to include the relevant unremitted amounts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Put simply, debts due to the commissioner as a result of failure to remit the deductions will be treated on the same basis as debts payable to other unsecured creditors upon the entity being placed into some form of insolvency administration, that is, by the rateable application of the insolvent estate's assets. However, this is assuming that the tax office is owed any of these debts when the company falls into insolvency. The new estimates procedure for recovery of unremitted amounts is intended to avoid this contingency as far as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second category is the new recovery procedure by estimation of unremitted amounts. We have absolutely no problem with the first category. The second category inserts a new division, division 8, part VI, of the Income Tax Assessment Act. The purpose of this new division, as stated in section 222AFA, is to enable the commissioner to make an estimate of the unremitted amounts. The estimate creates a separate liability to any that might otherwise exist and so provides a basis for recovery of the estimated amount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When then can the commissioner make an estimate? Is there any mandated basis for this estimate? The new section 222AGA(1) provides that the commissioner may make a reasonable estimate if he has reason to suspect that a liability under a remittance provision has not been discharged after the due date for such payment. It is further provided that the commissioner may&mdash;significantly, not shall&mdash;have regard to anything he thinks relevant in making that estimate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Aside from the requirement that the estimate be reasonable, the width of the discretion afforded to the commissioner is apparent. There is, for example, no requirement that the estimate be based on an extrapolation of what reasonably would be due, predicated upon past remittances of a particular taxpayer. Further, it would seem that the qualification that the estimate be reasonable is meaningless in that clause 19 of the Bill purports to exclude any decisions of the commissioner concerning estimates from judicial review under the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act. The only circumstances in which an estimate must be revoked or reduced is upon the person in receipt of the estimate notice providing a statutory declaration attesting to the amount of the liability. The liability to pay the amount of the estimate, which arises immediately upon the issuing of a notice, is created by section 222AHA(1), with 222AHA(2) providing that a liability to pay an estimate is separate and distinct from the liability to which the estimate relates. However, payment of one liability will correspondingly reduce the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the amount paid to discharge the estimate exceeds the unpaid amount of the actual liability, then the commissioner must either refund the excess, or apply to, against any other liabilities of that particular person. This last option may allow the commissioner to avoid having to seek to execute a judgment for a debt. If it is accepted that the issuance of an assessment creates a liability, then this provision is of even wider benefit to the commissioner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 222AHC provides for an affidavit, if it attests to certain things, by the defendant to constitute a defence to recovery of the estimate. An estimate will be provable in a bankruptcy or a winding-up. A penalty regime will operate if an estimate remains undischarged after seven days from the issuance of the notice. Penalties will be on the same terms as would apply to failure to pay the underlying liability. The commissioner is given a wide discretion to make an agreement for the discharge of liability by payment by instalments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third classification is penalties for directors of non-remitting companies. Here lie a number of problems. A further new division, division 9, is added to the Income Tax Assessment Act by the Bill to ensure either that the relevant payments are made or that the company concerned goes into liquidation or voluntary liquidation forthwith. This scheme is intended to prevent PAYE, et cetera, moneys being used as emergency working capital and is consonant with the observation that the commissioner's priority places no pressure on companies to remit taxes because it only operates once the company is placed in some form of insolvency administration. The idea is to prevent defalcations occurring or escalating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The scheme's purpose is achieved by making the directors personally liable under section 222AOC for the company's failure to pay if none of the three options for payment, voluntary administration or liquidation are taken up. It must be accepted that the imposition of these duties by section 222AOB is necessary to make the estimates procedure workable. However, section 222AOC provides that any person who is a director at any time during the period from which the liability to remit arose, that is, when the deduction was made, until the date when the payment is due, will be liable to pay to the commissioner an amount equal to the unpaid amount of the company's liability. That is quite preposterous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In other words, a director who is unable to convince the board to undertake one of the mandated options under section 222AOB(1) so as to comply with the tax office's demands and resigns from the board could still be liable for the whole of the amount of the unpaid tax should his fellow directors prove to be men of straw. This would be despite his having acted in good faith throughout. Even allowing for contributory or indemnity rights under section 222AOI, a liability proportionate to the number on the board is a misplaced penalty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The defences available to directors under this division are outlined in section 222A0J and are too vague to be adequate, in my opinion. In particular, it will be a defence if a director can show that he took all reasonable steps to ensure that deductions were remitted or that there were no such steps that the director could take. It is simply not clear whether this section extends to protect a director who has acted in good faith. Whether it is thought that the Federal Court would make this extension is irrelevant. Such a protection for directors who act properly must be an explicit one. Sections 222APB to 222API reiterate the above provisions relating to company directors for estimated liability penalties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth area of amendment is to the Corporations Law. The Corporations Law is amended to the extent necessary to coordinate the operation of the new voluntary administration procedure with the measures in this Bill. For this reason, clause 21 of the Bill introduces a new section 443BA, which extends an administrator's liability for debts incurred during the period the company is under administration to amounts of tax due under a remittance provision. Further, section 459E is amended to allow an estimate as the basis for a statutory demand. The commissioner will also be allowed to take advantage of the recently amended insolvent trading provisions by the inclusion of liabilities under a remittance provision as debts under section 588F. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So a wholly new section, section 588FGA, is added so as to make the directors personally liable to indemnify the commissioner should the court set aside a payment of a relevant amount because of the commissioner's constructive or actual knowledge of the insolvency of the person making the disposition. Other creditors who have dispositions made to them voided in a similar way do not have an extraordinary avenue of recourse against the directors personally. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no good reason why the commissioner should enjoy this special right of indemnity. The culpability which constructive or actual knowledge carries and which grounds the court's avoidance of the payment is the same for the commissioner as it is for any other preferred creditor. We have a great deal of concern about this provision. One can go to the court and get a judgment, yet it does not stand so far as the commissioner is concerned. This avoids the whole purpose and intent of the thrust of the Bill. It is internally inconsistent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three limbs to what this Bill seeks to achieve. Firstly, it seeks to ensure that employees' entitlements and the rights of unsecured creditors, which may otherwise have been lost, are protected, and that is a good measure. This is a change that is sustainable for the pragmatic reason that the Consolidated Revenue is better able to sustain a reduction of the proceeds from an insolvency administration than employees or unsecured creditors might be. The pain caused to employees who have been left with nothing after the collapse of their employer and to unsecured creditors who have had to write off huge losses because of the failure of a major debtor should not be underestimated. We also should not forget who is responsible for this economic trauma and that it has taken five years to bring about these changes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the abolition of the priority will remove what may have been a cause of the new voluntary administration scheme falling into a heap almost immediately upon its introduction. Thirdly, the Bill will provide, by way of a new estimates procedure, for a more effective way of collecting unremitted amounts held by entities on behalf of the commissioner as unpaid tax collectors and for a means to force company directors to confront insolvency problems before being tempted to use deducted amounts as emergency working capital. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Broadly, the coalition supports the thrust of this Bill and considers that a reasonable balance has been struck between protecting moneys which, after all, belong rightly to the revenue, and allowing for some equity to employees and creditors of the failed enterprises. But a number of problems with this Bill as it presently stands are very worrying. These are matters that I believe should be thoroughly examined by a properly constituted scrutiny of the Bill. This has been denied to this Parliament, even though it would enable people outside the Parliament to make a contribution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another oversight which is not addressed by the Bill or the explanatory memorandum is the duty of the Australian Taxation Office, under section 221Q, to credit an employee with an amount of tax equal to the amount deducted from the employee's salary or wages when the employer has made such deductions but has failed to issue a group certificate or deliver tax stamps in respect of the employee's salary or wages. The interaction of the new estimates procedure with section 221Q, which is an existing provision, has not been addressed. It is not clear whether the issue of an estimate will grant the benefit of the estimated amount due in tax to employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my opinion, it would be inexcusable if a Bill such as this, which effects major changes to income tax law and the Corporations Law, were allowed to be passed by this place without detailed and further consideration of its ramifications. There has not yet been any opportunity for wide and proper consultation with the members of the community who may be affected by this Bill. These people are expecting such an opportunity. If the Senate, because of an unfortunate agreement between the Labor Party and the Australian Democrats, agrees to this abortion of a procedure between a  quarter to one and 2 o'clock today, there will be no opportunity for that outside participation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that we will see many amendments to this Bill. It is poor legislation. The intention is right but, in typical Keating fashion, the Government is tagging on some very unsatisfactory features that the Law Council and professional bodies are very concerned about. When Bills are rushed through in the latter stages of the sittings, proper consideration is not given to the concerns of people outside the Parliament or to the proper parliamentary scrutiny process. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Insolvency (Tax Priorities) Legislation Amendment Bill 1993 proposes a major reform of the law and practice of the recovery by the Commissioner of Taxation of certain unremitted moneys and outstanding debts. The proposal was announced on 2 December last year by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and the then Attorney-General in a joint press release.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment section 221P of the Income Tax Assessment Act grants absolute priority to the tax commissioner over all other debts where an employer has failed to remit tax instalments or PPS deductions deducted from employee's wages, and a receiver or liquidator has been appointed. Where an employer pays wages to employees, deducts tax from their wages and does not remit the tax to the tax office, then that debt to the tax commissioner is granted priority against all other debts whether preferential, secured or unsecured. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The debt still has to be proven in the usual manner; however, once it is proven it assumes priority. The reason for this provision is quite straightforward. It is designed to ensure that group tax is paid or, in the official terminology, to protect the revenue. The Government has decided to formally remove the priority, but only in respect of amounts that should have been remitted before 30 June 1993. So the reform is prospective from the end of this financial year only. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason for the abolition is probably industrial in nature. We are aware that last year there were some vigorous complaints from various unions about the unfair nature of the priority. The major instances occur in the textiles industry and the building industry where subcontractors perform some work but do not get paid because the main contractor has collapsed. The subcontractors are creditors of the contractor and queue up with the other creditors, for example banks, to try to get paid. In this instance, if the contractor has not remitted its group tax or PPS deductions, then the tax commissioner obtains priority and often takes all the money. The net effect of that action is that subcontractors do a lot of work but do not get paid for it. This measure is fair to employees and other creditors and the Democrats support that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite the claims made by Mr George Gear in a recent press release, I think we also have to realise and acknowledge that the Government is not being all that generous in this measure. The existing law is quite narrowly drawn in the sense that it can apply only where the employer is in financial trouble. There have been a myriad of cases which actually define when the priority is applicable, and there have been many defeats for the commissioner. Careful business practice can often subvert the priority anyway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The President of the Insolvency Practitioners of Australia, Mr Michael Mount, was reported as supporting the abolition of the priority before the Government's announcement last December. Indeed, he is also reported as saying that this section has built more beach houses and holiday retreats for lawyers than any other tax law. With the repeal of the priority, it is important that other systems are put in place to ensure that the tax laws are complied with. Consequently, the Bill also proposes to quite radically overhaul the current recovery procedures. Recovery action is that administrative action to actually bring in the amounts which are owed to the tax commissioner. It must be remembered that establishing a liability does not actually ensure that the liability is met by the taxpayer. Very often taxpayers have to be pursued through the courts and this is often both slow and expensive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment, the commissioner is required to establish the precise amount of the unremitted moneys before he can take legal action to recover the amount. This means that there is always a delay between the date of non-remittance and the time of ascertainment of the amount before any recovery action can actually commence. The Bill attacks this problem by using the mechanism of allowing the commissioner to estimate the amount that should have been remitted and suing to recover that amount. This will occur only after the amounts should have been remitted, so it is not putting any additional onus on employers; it will simply ensure that the procedure for those who are in default works more quickly. One could argue that this will increase the efficiency and speed of the recovery processes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bill also proposes to increase the penalties applied to directors who do not remit the proper amounts of tax to the Tax Office. They will be personally liable for the amounts which are not remitted. The principle here is quite simple. At no time is the tax ever the property of the directors; it is the income of the worker and it is claimed by the government as a prepayment of an employee's tax liability for the year. If the directors do not fulfil the duty to remit the money to the Tax Office, basically they are committing theft. The same consideration applies to superannuation funds, which the committee has looked at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Watson has drawn our attention to the consternation that this penalty provision for directors is causing in some circles. I think he is suggesting that it cannot be sufficiently investigated in the hearing of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration which is proposed for today. It is true that it deserves sufficient time for consideration. The committee might even recommend some amendments. But there is one easy way for directors to avoid the problem, and that is to remit the taxation as they are supposed to. If they do not remit moneys that they have withheld as tax, they are committing a theft and theft involves penalties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of consequential amendments to other pieces of business legislation, such as the companies Act and the Bankruptcy Act, to accommodate the change. Senator Watson said that if the Democrats let this through it will be on our head, or something to that effect. I need to put on the record that I said to Senator Watson that probably the best way through is to excise the parts that he thinks are particularly troublesome and let these people who contacted him have a bit more time to look at the provision on penalties for directors, but in the meantime let us not hold up the rightful place of workers in the line of creditors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This new section was announced in December, yet it is before us on the second last day of this parliamentary sitting and adequate time probably has not been given to those who feel disadvantaged by it. Nevertheless, the Democrats will support it on the understanding we have been given that the Government can answer the concerns that some bodies have about the increased penalties as they apply to directors. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Insolvency (Tax Priorities) Legislation Amendment Bill is quite an important Bill which deals with issues that a number of honourable senators have been concerned about for some time. It has received public notoriety on occasions when individual men and women, employees of companies, in financial difficulties have not been able to gain access to their wage and condition entitlements because of the priority of the Commissioner of Taxation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the past three years I have had some cause to examine this in some detail. In the same way as everybody else, I started from the assumption that obviously the priority should be taken away and we should do something to protect the interests of those working men and women particularly, and subsequently of other creditors as well. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to pursue this matter because I had very severe reservations about it. I support it, but I started from the same presumption as did everybody else. My concern led me to feel that we had to proceed in a very careful fashion. The overwhelming majority of Australians running businesses are law-abiding and scrupulous citizens and, even though their companies were in difficulty, they complied with the tax laws and sent the money that had been deducted. But there were some who were either less scrupulous, or sometimes just less competent, and who failed to meet the requirements&mdash;they deducted the money and did not forward it to the Tax Office. Those people got a benefit at least in the short term. They were, in effect, financing their business with the taxpayer's money and getting a benefit over the overwhelming majority, the honest and scrupulous employers who were doing the right thing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had some reservations, and I had to be persuaded. My reluctance is not unique; a number of other people who looked at it came to the same view. I mention it to say that that is why it is not the straightforward measure people might first have envisaged, where we would simply take away the priority. There is a need to look at that in the proper context of the way in which these issues can be dealt with. I appreciate that in the consideration of the abolition of priority, the fundamental issue of the Bill, there is now agreement in this Senate. I was not seeking to reopen that question. I traversed it only to give a bit of background for discussion of the other matters in this legislation which are designed to make this provision effective without in any way undermining the other reasonable priorities of the tax and corporations legislation, and the way in which the consequences of these measures should be dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Watson raised some concerns about the legislation and the process. If I have the opportunity, I will respond to him on the process, but the substantial thing I want to deal with is the legislation itself. Let me deal with that and, if I have time at the end, I will deal with the process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first concern Senator Watson raised related to the new recovery procedure and the estimate, and the fact that the estimate is not reviewable under ADJR. My advice and understanding&mdash;and I am no longer involved in the day-to-day handling of this in the way I was previously&mdash;is that the person who is in receipt of an estimate has an opportunity to declare by statutory declaration what the actual deduction was, and the commissioner will accept the amount in the declaration as being the actual deduction. So the individual has that initial opportunity to determine the amount, and that will be accepted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given that absolute right, the case for ADJR review seems to me to fall over although I am, in the normal course of events, one who is a supporter of the administrative review processes&mdash;the Commonwealth's administrative law reforms of the last decade or so. That is the first thing I want to set down. It is possible to run all sorts of hares on this matter, but it seems to me that there is an opportunity for individuals adequately to protect their position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We then have a concern about the circumstance in which directors might be penalised. While an individual director may have a proper concern about process, that individual may be unable to convince other directors to act properly and, therefore, the decision would go against that one individual. This is a concern arising under proposed new division 9 where there are unremitted deductions. The liability could arise under subdivision B for the actual deduction, subdivision C for an estimate of the actual deduction or subdivision D for contravention of a payment agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am advised that each subdivision contains a provision which clarifies what defences are available to a director in  recovery proceedings. For example, in respect of liability for the actual deduction under subdivision B, proposed new section 222AOJ provides that it will be a defence if it can be proved that the person did not take part in the management of the company at any time when the person was a director and the directors were under an obligation to comply. The provisions would prevent the liability arising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, it will also be a defence if it can be proved that the person took all reasonable steps. In other words, that he or she did the right thing to ensure the directors complied with the provisions preventing the liability from arising. I am advised that these defences are in line with the defences available to directors under the corporations law. On the face of it, it seems reasonable that those defences should be available. That being the case, the position of directors&mdash;who, in the minority, may be seeking to persuade their co-directors to act properly&mdash;is protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Watson raised a concern about whether there should have been an amendment to section 221Q which allows the commissioner to apply an amount equal to the deductions made in satisfaction of any tax payable by the employee in the same manner as if a group certificate in respect of the deductions had been received. It seems logical&mdash;and it has been confirmed in discussions with the officers this morning&mdash;that the provisions in the Bill will not affect the operation of section 221Q. The credit currently allowed in section 221Q is employee specific; the estimate provisions are concerned with total deductions made and not remitted in respect of all employees. The current circumstance will prevail. </PARA>

Community understanding of some Bills has been enhanced by the opportunity to participate. I do not resist that point at all. Obviously Senator Watson knows that because we have had this discussion quite a few times on a number of pieces of legislation. However, there is a concern that the tax commissioner's rights might not be adequately protected in handling this matter if some of the amendments to the Corporations Act dealing with the definition of insolvent trading and related matters are not dealt with expeditiously and at the same time as these other changes.</PARA></TALK.START>

There have been a few other times when committees have made decisions that I have disagreed with, but that is not the point I am making today. The point I make is that delay has a cost, not to government in this instance&mdash;it is not a question of loss of revenue&mdash;but a cost to the rights of citizens, taxpayers and employees who will be, it is agreed, the beneficiaries of this legislation when it passes. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I suggest the following as a draft preliminary submission for the Law Council:-</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have had a very limited opportunity to consider the Insolvency (Tax Priorities) Legislation Amendment Bill 1993. We would welcome the opportunity to consider this Bill in detail as it contains a large number of novel concepts and several controversial proposals over and above (and possible inconsistent with) the Government's original public statement to the effect that Crown priorities were finally to be abolished after 30 June 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regrettably, we have not had time to embark upon a consideration of the provisions proposed in respect of the accelerated and more efficient collection of relevant remittances, although we observe in passing that the Taxation Commissioner's long-standing practice of equating tax instalment deductions etc with trust monies has still not been recognised in the legislation. In other words, the employers are still to be allowed to use monies notionally deducted from the wages of employees for a period of time until obliged to remit monies calculated by reference to the remuneration of employees etc to the Commissioner.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It seems that the Bill is inclined in many ways to treat tax instalment deductions etc as if they were traceable trust monies, when such a treatment effectively accords the Commissioner a significant advantage over ordinary unsecured creditors of an insolvent company or individual.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of additional concern is the fact that the recent amendments to the Corporation Law effected by the 1982 Corporate Law Reform Bill were exposed for a considerable period of time for public comment. The Law Council commented upon that Bill in considerable detail and the Insolvency Committee of the Business Law Section of the Council spent considerable time on the amendments introduced by that Bill in respect of insolvency matters.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Now, however, the Corporations Law is apparently to be further amended in significant aspects as a result of an initiative which seems to come from the Taxation Commissioner rather than from those responsible for the direction of Corporations Law in this country. This, in itself, should be a very good reason why further time should be afforded for public comment on the present Bill. There is no reason why the relevant provisions of the present Bill abolishing the Commissioner's priorities cannot proceed and come into operation on 1 July 1993, with all other provisions being held over for proper public input.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We have had time to consider only three particular examples of potential difficulties with the present Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed section 588FGA of the Corporations Law will oblige directors to indemnify the Commissioner of Taxation if certain payments by companies in respect of liabilities under the remittance provisions are set aside as preferences by a liquidator. The recently enacted provisions of the Corporations Law dealing with insolvent trading should be sufficient to protect the Commissioner and the fact that the Commissioner seeks the inclusion of an extra provision dealing only with amounts payable to him suggests that he is not really prepared to see the Government's announcement about the abolition of priorities brought into full and proper effect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It may be that the Corporations Law could include a definition such as that contained in the proposed section 588F, although the deeming of a liability to effect a remittance of tax instalment deductions etc to be a debt does not really seem necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although directors of insolvent companies seem not to be very popular these days, they nonetheless have rights and obligations which have been carefully addressed in the recent amendments to the Corporations Law. There seems to be a further, possible unwarranted incursion upon those rights by this particular proposed amendment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed section 443BA of the Corporations Law is of particular concern having regard to the great amount of careful debate that has accompanied the introduction to the Corporations Law of the novel provisions relating to "administration" of insolvent companies. This particular proposed amendment to the Corporations Law seems at the least, ill-considered! The proposed section threatens jobs! The proposed provision would render an administrator immediately personally liable for tax instalment deductions if he were to make payment of wages to employees on the day of his appointment. Surely, administrators will be encouraged by this proposed provision to terminate employment contracts for fear of personal liability to the Commissioner of Taxation!</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amendments to section 122(4) of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 are contemplated in the Bill but a complaint made by the Law Institute of Victoria many years ago in respect of the Crown Debts (Priority) Bill&mdash;which became the Crown Debts (Priority) Act 1981&mdash;has not been addressed. Sub-section 122(4)(b) deems a payment of tax to be made for valuable consideration (with which proposition one cannot quarrel); but it also deems a payment of tax to have been made "in the ordinary course of business". The existence of this latter deeming provision accords to the Commissioner of Taxation an unfair advantage over ordinary unsecured creditors.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We would also observe, although the opportunity to consider this particular concept has been woefully insufficient, that proposed section 222APE of the Income Tax Assessment Act affording as it does only 14 days grace to company directors, would appear to be draconian.</PARA>

<PARA>Very briefly, the principal purpose of bringing the motion on at this time is to ensure that there is continuity in the operations of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation. The committee has now been in place for more than three years and has performed outstanding work under the chairmanship of Senator Sherry. From this point on, I am sure it will continue to perform equally outstanding work under the direction of Senator Watson. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very important indeed that the community have a reference point on an issue as important as superannuation on both sides of the chamber. It is broadly the responsibility of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), but the industry itself does look, and has been looking, to the committee for guidance. Richard Gilbert has provided excellent secretarial services to that committee. I believe that the committee now has great stature in the community and that it will be a very important means of ensuring that a number of major outstanding issues are properly exposed and debated in a sensible and considered way, so that there are opportunities for the industry to have its points of view put in public and in private. </PARA>

Having served with him over the last several years, there is no doubt that he is one of the very few in this Parliament who have a very good understanding of the very complex issues attaching to superannuation. His expertise in the area of taxation goes back even further, and I think the combination is such that the superannuation and insurance industries will greatly welcome not only the continuation of the committee but also the presence of Senator Watson in particular. I am therefore delighted to be able to move the motion. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;They are also busy with committee work, as Senator Sherry says. We are here today to deal with the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment Bill 1993. The Great Barrier Reef is a great part of world environmental heritage and a very important asset for Australia. I am sure that those in the gallery will be interested to know that this Bill seeks to ensure that the marine park authority will gain an additional source of revenue to ensure that the management of that park benefits all those who go to the Great Barrier Reef and are able to enjoy the natural beauty and some of the artificial infrastructure built up around the park.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tourism potential of the Great Barrier Reef is of course well known. The increase in tourism numbers to that part of the world, to enjoy the Great Barrier Reef and the other natural beauties of northern Queensland, is well understood. We are told that tourism around the Great Barrier Reef itself is worth in the vicinity of $1.4 billion each and every year. It is rapidly expanding and we all expect it to expand even more rapidly with the opening up through deregulation of national and international air services and with increasing tourism infrastructure in that region. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These pressures make it much more important that these very fragile natural assets&mdash;both the wet tropics and the Great Barrier Reef region which is the subject of this Bill&mdash;be managed effectively. We need to ensure not only that this natural asset is protected but also that Australian citizens and people from other nations are able to enjoy this facility without damaging its very important natural beauty or the natural habitat. Speaking from the point of view of someone who has spent quite a lot of time sailing around the coastal waters of Australia, I guess that many people&mdash;particularly those who go to sea, whether in small boats or larger ships&mdash;would see the Great Barrier Reef not only as a natural asset but also as something to be avoided if they are travelling around in a ship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The general objective of this Bill is to raise a $1 per day per person charge. It is to be collected through the many tourist operators in this region. That money will go to the authority essentially for management purposes. The Opposition will be supporting this Bill, although we do have some reservations which were put by shadow Minister for the environment in the other place. Specifically, we do not want to see a diminution of the general funding that goes to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority&mdash;affectionately known as GBRMPA&mdash;because the research operations of the authority, as well as the management operations, are very important. As I have said, we have increasing pressure on the natural environment in the Great Barrier Reef region and therefore more money will need to go into its management. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although we support the user-pays principle, and the way that people who go to see the reef will be required to make a contribution to its management and ongoing research, we do not want to see the amount of funding which goes into the management of this park&mdash;be it through GBRMPA or other authorities&mdash;diluted. As pressure increases, the demand for research on management of the park and on how to balance the recreational needs with the environmental needs will also increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Opposition is also concerned to see that the charges are levied on people in a fair and equitable manner. We have some reservations about the fact that the charge is being collected only through tourist operators. However, we are cognisant of the fact that this is probably the most effective way of collecting these charges. Also, given our past experience with government imposed levies and charges, it would not be unreasonable to expect that this charge will creep up once it is introduced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure that all honourable senators and honourable members of this Parliament will be keen to ensure that increases through this new form of taxation or levy are kept under scrutiny. That is not to say that the charge should not go up in the future; there may be good reasons for it to be increased. However, as people representing the citizens of Australia, we need to keep a watch on that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have already mentioned the fact that recreational users who come onto the reef or into that region other than through tourist operators will not be subject to the charge. In that respect, the burden of the management of the park does not fall equitably on all of its users. But, of course, it would be hard to achieve the collection of the charge in any other way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At present the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority receives annually in the order of $14 million from the Federal Government, $3 million from the Queensland Government and a further $3 million from its own commercial operations. Having spoken to the people at the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority during a couple of visits to that region in my role as a member of the Senate Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts&mdash;of which I know that you, Mr Acting Deputy President, are a very active and diligent member&mdash;I am aware that that authority is under enormous stress to carry out its functions with the fiscal restraint which is being imposed on all Federal Government activities by its gross economic mismanagement. To the extent that this user-pays fee collection process which this Bill encompasses will help relieve that situation,</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats also support the passage of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (Environmental Management Charge&mdash;General) Bill 1993, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park (Environmental Management Charge&mdash;Excise) Bill 1993 and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment Bill 1993. We believe that these Bills will add significantly to the proper management of the tourist impact on the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. We note that the Great Barrier Reef has been made a World Heritage area. However, it is also an area in which a range of commercial activities continue to function extremely profitably.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important for people to understand that the declaration of an area as a World Heritage does not necessarily mean the curtailment of economic activities.  As Senator Campbell has just pointed out, when one looks at the $1 billion to $1.6 billion of income which comes from tourism on the Great Barrier Reef, one sees that the amount raised under this levy scheme of just over $1m is 0.1 per cent of the total revenue raised through tourism on the reef. It is a very small amount. One must also observe that the return on the investment is extremely large. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just wanted to make the point that here we have a World Heritage area which is being used in a commercial way, responsibly without serious damage. This charge will add to the reef's better management. For those who look at the declaration of other areas with certain circumspection because they are concerned that it might interfere with commercial activities, I invite them to look at the Great Barrier Reef and see that, in that case, not only is the commercial use of a World Heritage area consistent with that declaration but also that the commercialisation of those natural assets often leads to an extremely profitable venture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are in favour of the passage of these related Bills. We believe that the introduction of a charge on commercial operators is an example of ecologically sustainable development at work on the Great Barrier Reef. It is a mechanism by which the current users of the reef can be made to pick up some of the cost of damage and potential damage to the reef. This will ensure that the reef will be there for the enjoyment of further generations and also for the protection of the indigenous species. We must not forget that ecologically sustainable development does not mean only the protection of species and ecologies for the enjoyment of future generations of humans; it also means the protection and preservation in the long term for their own sake. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The park has been recognised internationally not only for its World Heritage values but also for the very successful balance of environmental and economic concerns which have been institutionalised in the management of the park. The establishment of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority back in 1976 allowed a single agency to research and manage the impacts of tourism, fishing, mariculture, agriculture, human settlements, coastal development and other activities in the marine park. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the charge will be administered by the marine park authority. Although the charge will be passed on to the consumer of the commercial service, the cost per person will essentially be insignificant. The charge will have no negative social equity effects. However, it will raise between $1.25 million and $1.5 million per year to be spent on research, education, information and better protection of the park. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I interpolate at this point that the Democrats are concerned that charges such as this should be levied in a socially equitable way and that the imposition of a charge should not be used as a mechanism by which progressively government is relieved of the responsibility of looking after the park. We would be very concerned that the charge not be progressively raised and the charge become a mechanism for revenue rather than a mechanism of addressing&mdash;</PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TF4">Senator COULTER</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is important to inject that note into these issues precisely for that reason&mdash;to express the concern we all have, because we have seen it in so many other ways in which quite modest charges have been introduced, and then it has progressively become a mechanism by which government is relieved of its important responsibilities. The charge is extremely small when compared with a total amount&mdash;as I have said, perhaps something of the order of $1 billion to $1.6 billion. So the charge represents something of the order of 0.1 per cent of the gross income from tourism on the reef. We are satisfied that the amount raised will significantly boost the revenue available to the authority.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also pleased to note that the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) stated in her second reading speech that the introduction of the charge will not lead to a modification of current arrangements for funding the authority through Budget appropriations&mdash;I stress that again&mdash;but is specifically aimed at offsetting the costs of increasing commercial use of the park. The charge is related to the number of passengers on commercial tourist boats using the park on a daily basis. The great majority of park visitors take advantage of commercial operators to view the park's attractions. A charge is certainly a rational way of spreading the costs as the revenue raised would increase or decrease according to the number of tourists visiting the park. Therefore, the charge is directly related to the impact of humans on the park. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The obvious omission, and this has been referred to by Senator Campbell, is the relatively small group of tourists who visit the reef on a private non-commercial basis on non-commercial boats. These people may have&mdash;and this is only a hypothetical situation&mdash;a greater impact on the reef because they are not exposed to the interpretive material in relation to the values of the park and the responsibilities of park users provided by the commercial operators or by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. These people can, in one way, be regarded as free-riders or, in another sense, as romantic travellers operating outside the strictures of regulation. However one views them, there is no way of denying that they will receive a benefit for which others will be obliged to pay when these charges come into operation. I am therefore in support of a proposal to introduce charges on boat owners who use their personal boats to view the park. All private boat owners would pay a fee to the marine park authority when they register their presence in the park. We believe that this would be relatively easy to capture in some suitable way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue I want to raise is recreational fishing within the park. Recreational fishing has a significant impact on the fisheries resource within the park. A survey undertaken in 1991 by Dr Tor Hundloe and Mr Russell Blamey of Griffith University estimated that in 1990 between 3.5 million and 4.3 million kilograms of fish were caught by recreational fishers on the reef, compared with an estimated commercial catch of 4 million kilograms. In other words, the recreational fishers caught the same weight of fish as their commercial counterparts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another significant finding of the survey was that the weight of fish&mdash;this is, the weight of the individual fish caught&mdash;had fallen by an estimated 40 per cent since similar estimations were made with respect to the 1980 catch. The survey also found that the average size of fish caught in reef waters off Mackay was 1.4 kilograms, a fall of 39 per cent from the average reported in a survey of 1980. In waters off Townsville, the average size had fallen by 19 per cent. Clearly, the increase in recreational fishing in the reef is having a significant impact on fish stocks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the Deputy Premier of Queensland, Mr Tom Burns, and the State Minister for Primary Industries, Mr Edmund Casey, have called an inquiry into recreational fishing in Queensland. I hope that this will lead to better management of recreational fishing along the entire Queensland coastline and within inland waters. I would urge the New South Wales and Victorian governments to undertake a similar inquiry, as recreational fishing is heaviest along the east coast of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senators would be aware that the management of fisheries under Commonwealth control is currently being reviewed by the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology. It is certainly true that the human impact on fish stocks throughout Australia, both inland and off the coasts, has been extremely damaging, and fisheries generally are not being managed in a sustainable way. In passing, I point out that increasing populations of humans, if they are going to enjoy access to fish, will further impact on the fish stocks of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that in tandem with the Queensland inquiry the Commonwealth is developing a national policy on recreational fishing. A draft discussion paper was released in December last year. The paper includes a number of revenue raising measures, such as direct contributions by the Commonwealth, the wholesale fishing gear levy and the introduction of State or Territory fees by way of licences, fees or tags on recreational fishers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats support, in principle, options to raise revenue to regulate recreational fishing, given its significant impact on the Australian fish stock. The bottom line in any recreational pursuit is that an activity must not threaten a species with extension or impede the recovery of a threatened species. However, the Democrats are mindful of the social implications of such measures, given that recreational fishing is such an important leisure activity. Any options will therefore be considered within a framework that integrates social and environmental interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, the Democrats fully support this legislation and will not be seeking any amendments to it. The charge will help to raise revenue for research and enhance management of human impact on the reef. It is not designed as an entry fee but simply as a levy on commercial operators so that they can contribute to the maintenance of a World Heritage area in which the World Heritage values of the reef must be protected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the other policy options discussed in this speech will be pursued with vigour by the relevant authorities in order to ensure that the reef is protected for the enjoyment and inspiration of all current and future generations and also, I stress, because of the intrinsic value of the reef, and the value of the species of flora and fauna which inhabit that reef. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is my privilege today to make a very brief contribution to this debate in support of the Great Barrier Reef legislation and in support of the very fine speech which my colleague Senator Campbell gave in introducing the Opposition's case. The legislation introduces a user-pays principle to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park and, together with the regulations that will be tabled subsequently, it will enable the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority to levy tourist operators on the basis of the number of tourists who use their facilities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anything to do with the Barrier Reef is of very great interest to all Australians, including to all parliamentarians. It is something that I take a very great interest in because the area of Queensland in which I operate in a parliamentary sense&mdash;from the Bundaberg region right through to the Torres Strait&mdash;encompasses the Barrier Reef. So I am particularly pleased to be able to make a contribution about a natural asset that is so vital to the people I principally represent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the Barrier Reef is one of the, if not the, greatest treasures and greatest tourist attractions in the world. It is obviously something that should be protected sensibly. However, at the same time we should not close it off to everybody except a few privileged people, as quite often happens in other areas of our natural environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to see that transit operators will be exempt from the Bill. This is specifically important to the people of Townsville and Magnetic Island, because ferries run between those two destinations as a conveyance of passengers other than tourists. I would object very greatly if that ferry service were to be included in this Bill because it would mean a quite substantial increase in the price of the tickets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the first time, tourist operators will be permitted to transfer their permits. This will mean that they will be able to sell their permits to other operators as they go along. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As my colleague Senator Campbell has said, we do not oppose the legislation. But I am very disappointed with the way this Government has gone about introducing this tax. It presented the tax to the industry as a fait accompli. There was not a great deal of consultation. People in the industry were told that they were going to have it and that they might as well try to sort out the best deal that they could for the industry, knowing it would be coming in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The then Queensland Environment and Heritage Minister, Mr Comben, was carpeted by the Labor Premier of Queensland when Mr Comben went along with the Commonwealth plan. Mr Goss called the proposal `half-baked', and then pledged to oppose it. I do not know where he is now. I suspect he is all over the place, as he usually is. At that stage, he did say that he would oppose it. As I said, the main reason why the industry accepted the tax was that it knew it was coming and the Government was willing to trade off some benefits for operators in relation to the permits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry is concerned that it is the thin edge of the wedge: $1 today, $5 tomorrow. That is something that this Parliament will have to look at very closely. In her second reading speech, the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Mrs Kelly) said that the regulations will specify that the charge will be only $1 per day per tourist. How this will be incorporated into regulations will be very interesting. It is something that we will watch very closely, as the tourist operators and many other people, including myself, have very real fears that this will not be so easy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tourist operators have asked me how the Government will incorporate that fee. A tourist may take a launch over to, say, Green Island; then, after arriving, stay in a hotel; buy some meals; play some water sports; take an underwater submarine, a submersible, and go out to a reef platform. Will the Government add this dollar on every occasion that the tourist buys a ticket for something? If not, how will the Government incorporate it? How will it work in that way? It is something that the Government will have some difficulty with. Certainly, the industry is very concerned about it, and I await with interest the regulations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we all know, the Barrier Reef has been a very popular destination with Japanese and American tourists and, increasingly, European tourists; also, a great number of backpackers in the north visit that destination. They are attracted to the north because of the Barrier Reef. I suppose I should declare an interest in speaking on this Bill. It involves the Barrier Reef and I have a very small interest in a backpacking establishment in North Queensland. I suppose by supporting this Bill I am assisting my business in some way. It is very important to ensure that that reef is available to tourists in all areas. Whilst the backpackers spend only about $10 a night on accommodation, they are quite lavish when it comes to spending money on reef trips and dives on the reef. So they are a very important asset. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the difficulties with the tourist industry at the moment is the huge number of taxes that are imposed upon it by the Federal Labor Government and the Queensland Labor Government. Some studies have been done which estimate that government taxes now amount to about 40 per cent of the total revenue in the tourism industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot understand why boats plying the barrier reef currently pay a fuel tax of 26c&mdash;and in some cases more&mdash;per litre. Madam Acting Deputy President, you will remember that the fuel tax was originally imposed to help build roads. Even though most of the revenue from the fuel tax is ripped off by this Government and used as general revenue, 7c or 8c of that tax supposedly goes towards the upkeep of roads. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tourist boat operators pay the fuel tax even though I have never, in my lifetime, seen any of those reef catamarans running down the main street of Townsville or Cairns or travelling the Bruce Highway. These operators still pay a fuel tax supposedly to assist in the upkeep of roads. I think it is iniquitous that tourist operators are required to pay that tax when they get nothing back for it. It was my hope that the amount these operators paid in fuel tax could be used for research and maintenance of the reef rather than a new tax being imposed. I note that in the fishing industry similar boats that ply the same waters do not pay a fuel tax, and yet these tourist operators do.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the reef tax, reef tourism operators are hit heavily by other taxes and charges: such as, sales tax, payroll tax, petrol tax, the training guarantee levy, a navigation levy, an oil pollution levy, registration and permit fees, and stamp duty. It has been suggested in some studies that government taxes and charges amount to 40 per cent of total revenue for tourist operators and this is before any of their expenses are paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have seen floated in the last couple of days the horrendous suggestion of a new $30 per head arrival tax. This tax will be on top of the $20 per head departure tax which has very recently been doubled by this Government. It is suggested that this new arrival tax of $30 per head would raise $147 million a year based on the figure of almost five million people arriving in Australia. This will be just another tax on tourism and something which could adversely affect the industry in Cairns and far North Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of tourist operators were caught out because they were agents for the Labor Party. There was the very notable incident where a so-called independent tourist seminar was organised and we found out that it was actually being operated and paid for by a staffer of a Labor Party Minister. That staffer was using a different name, although it sounded a bit like his own name. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a small group of tourism operators in the employ of ALP who, before the last election, tried to raise some fears about the impact of the GST on the tourism industry. I was quite convinced, and I think most sensible tourism operators were convinced, that  there  would  be  no  adverse  impact on the tourist industry because of benefits that would have flowed from the proposal. This small group of operators, egged on by the ALP, made a bit of noise and had a few headlines on this subject. They are not concerned now about all the other taxes being imposed on the tourism industry. I wonder why we do not now hear their voices in opposition to the reef tax and arrival tax when they were so vocal about this matter before the election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this $30 per head arrival tax were to be introduced it would be an enormous impost on the industry. It is something that could cripple the tourist industry, which is one of Australia's export earners. I note in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> that the Chief Executive of the Australian Tourism Industry Association, Mr O'Cleary, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the proposal were put up, the whole tourism industry would be up in arms . . . Such abhorrent suggestion doesn't bear thinking about.</PARA>
<PARA>I certainly hope the Government, in its desperate attempt to raise money from anywhere and everywhere, does not again target tourism to try to get out of the financial mess into which it has got itself. The pious comments made before the election about the effect of the GST on the tourism industry will be shown to be just more of the hypocrisy of the Labor Party if the Government even looks at getting money from an arrival tax on Australian tourists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support the legislation. I will certainly be joining other members of the Liberal and National parties in monitoring the situation and the regulations as they come through. We will do so to ensure that the tax which is being introduced now is not the thin end of the wedge; that it stops where it says it will; and that it is not used by this Government as a crutch to enable it to stop funding the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. Rather than the Government using Consolidated Revenue to fund what is a very important research and maintenance agency which protects one of Australia's greatest assets, funding in the future should be by way of an increase in the tax. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also will be supporting the passage of this package of legislation, which is designed to introduce a charge on certain users of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park to assist with research into the impacts of various activities on the reef system. I understand that this legislation is the end product of remarkable community cooperation by and consultation with all the different interest groups connected with the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. The concern for environmental management has led to agreement from all parties that charges will be paid by commercial operators on the basis of a dollar per day per person, which will raise approximately $1 million a year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The availability of these funds is likely to benefit research in at least two areas. Firstly, in the area of water quality it will be possible to look at the effect of both the residential and commercial run-off from the Queensland mainland. The second area is research into fishing effects, particularly bottom-trawling. There has been no comprehensive research to date in this respect. Senator Coulter mentioned the research that has been carried out on recreational fishing impacts. It is also important to carry out research into the impact of commercial fishing on fish stocks. As Senator Coulter pointed out, the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park is a good example of a World Heritage area being used responsibly for commercial activity. It is also now presenting a model of cooperation of interested parties for sensitive environmental management and research. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I take this opportunity to point to the need for similar schemes in other parts of Australia to assist with funding the very necessary research that is needed to ensure the continued protection of the resources that attract the many tourists in this country. The environmental impact of tourism was examined comprehensively in the report <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Australian environment and tourism</EMPHASIS> produced by the Senate Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts in September 1992. The introduction to that report stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Pressure on the environment from tourism is increasing. It is anticipated that the number of foreign tourists could treble by the year 2000; domestic tourism, currently about eighty per cent of the market, is expected to remain vigorous. There is a need to consider carefully the ways in which the Australian environment is under threat from tourism. Unless those threats can be identified, tourism could increase the damage to the very environment that is attractive to tourists, and on which the industry in large part depends. In other words, it will kill the goose that lays the golden egg.</PARA>
<PARA>It should be noted, however, that the health of our environment is of value not only to the tourism industry but also to industries such as fishing and agriculture, which rely on healthy ecosystems for their survival. Therefore, continued research into the environmental impact of human activity is essential if our industries are to be sustainable. So it is only right that those industries that benefit from Australia's beautiful and healthy environment should contribute to research into these issues. I trust that the Government will consider these issues as part of its plans to implement the recommendations of the final report on ecologically sustainable development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also take this opportunity to call on the Government to initiate a similar scheme in conjunction with the Western Australian Government to ensure the continued protection of the Ningaloo Reef Marine Park. This park, which is considered by many ecologists to be as important as the Great Barrier Reef, is unique in that it is so close to the coastline. While this provides tourists with the opportunity to walk or swim to the reef in some places, it also poses a threat to the very delicate ecosystem of the reef. All developments in the area need to be considered very carefully in that context. Therefore, the Federal Government's intervention through legislative protection, together with a funded research scheme similar to that being proposed today, is essential for its long-term protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was delighted to hear Senator Campbell's support for the responsible and sensitive environmental management of the Great Barrier Reef and hope he will maintain this stance to protect the Ningaloo Reef in our mutual home State. I commend all the parties who have supported and put together this proposal. I support the Bills currently before the Senate. </PARA>

Does the Government currently have some thought on how it will calculate the quantum and the way the tax will be collected? In particular, would the Minister comment upon the matter of how the Government will ensure that there is only $1 per day per tourist paid when, on a particular day, there is multiple use of the reef by a tourist. I will repeat my earlier example in case the Minister was not listening&mdash;and I am sure that would not be the case as I know she always listens to my speeches avidly. In the event that a tourist gets onto a launch, goes to an island, takes an underwater submersible, gets onto a reef platform, gets onto a float aircraft and then lands somewhere else, how will the Government ensure that there will be that charge of only $1 per tourist per day? How will the Government separate the different aspects of tourist activity?</PARA></TALK.START>

The tourist industry in North Queensland will be up in arms if this is an indication of what this Government is going to do. The Government has made solemn promises to the industry over the past 12 months and today we find that those promises will not be honoured. Tourists will pay more than a dollar per day.

It is the only industry in the recent bleak times that has done anything for employment in Far North Queensland and North Queensland.

I have just given Senator Macdonald that answer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Macdonald wants the precise details by commercial operator to commercial operator, or what might happen from tourist to tourist, knowing full well, as he said in his own speech, that to try to put a simple profile on any tourist in the Great Barrier Reef would be impossible. Some will spend all day snorkelling in the one square metre; others will be going up and down and visiting a number of different places, perhaps using more than one commercial operator.

If Senator Crowley cannot provide the detailed answers that are required of her as the Minister with carriage of this legislation, the committee stage should be postponed until such time as she can address what has been said and give that detailed information. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think the matter Senator Macdonald raised is quite properly dealt with in this committee stage. The Minister's second reading speech and the explanatory memorandum go into some detail as to the administration of how the charge will be raised. I am sure that all honourable senators, particularly Senator Coulter and Senator Chamarette, would be most interesting in knowing how this charge will be administered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problems that Senator Macdonald raised are absolutely central to whether this Bill achieves its objectives. If one is to set out to achieve a $1 per day per person levy, the way it is collected is absolutely pivotal to whether that levy can be applied to the purposes of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority and the very central purposes of the legislation. If it is collected in a convoluted, bureaucratic, administratively complex way, the money that could be given to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority to do its job under the specific purposes of this Bill will not be facilitated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is probably a range of ways that a dollar per person per day can be collected. Senator Macdonald is asking a very legitimate question in the committee stage consideration of the Bill. Because the Minister does not know the answer, because she has not been briefed on this matter correctly, she has become very defensive and indeed aggressive on this matter. Indeed, she has been making imputations as to whether Senator Macdonald has sensible motives in raising this matter. It is quite proper that he raises these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee deserves an answer on how the charge will be collected. We need to know whether a collection tin will be put next to the ramp on to the cruise ship or whether the fee will be collected through the fare structures. These are matters which would normally and quite properly be resolved through consultation between the industry, the authority and the Government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Macdonald contradicted what Senator Chamarette said in her motion. He said that the consultation which took place prior to this levy legislation being introduced was virtually non-existent. Senator Chamarette said that it was the conclusion of a long process of consultation with the local community and local industry; Senator Macdonald said it is not. We are now being told by the Minister that consultation is going on on how this levy will indeed be collected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I wish to make in this contribution to the committee stage consideration is that it is not fair just to fob the question off and say that it is not competent for the committee to question the Minister on this matter. It is not fair because this question is absolutely central to meeting the objectives of this Bill. If the right way of collecting this money is not implemented, to ensure that the levy is $1 per day per person&mdash;as I said, it is expensive to collect it bureaucratically and the administration of it is expensive&mdash;then the levy will not achieve its result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite proper and appropriate that the Minister give to the committee a specific answer as to how these quite legitimate concerns expressed by Senator Macdonald are being dealt with. His concerns are expressed, I am sure, on behalf of his concerned constituents in the far north of Queensland with whom I know from personal experience he has a tremendous and active relationship; I am sure all other honourable senators would recognise that. I think it is unfair of the Minister to reflect on the motives of Senator Macdonald because she has failed to be briefed as properly as she should have been prior to coming into the chamber and has had to waste the time of the committee by leaning over advisers boxes getting briefed on the run.</PARA>

Why would it? What the Minister has said today gives good grounds for it not to trust the Government. The Government is saying that the levy will be charged per operator, not per tourist. How is the Government going to manage the levy in the example I gave, where I go on five different operations on one day? How is the Government going to arrange it?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. The Auditor-General's report tabled in the Senate yesterday revealed financial obligations in excess of $125 billion by the Federal Government, further potential obligations of $44 billion and liquid assets of only $57 billion to meet the bill. Does the Minister agree with the Auditor-General that this massive financial burden can only be met through increased taxes, privatisation or reduced expenditure?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1317" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It needs to be appreciated that the Auditor-General's report acknowledges that the Commonwealth's financial position is fundamentally sound. Whatever improvements in accounting systems and so on that might be appropriate and were recommended in the report, there is absolutely nothing in the language of that report which would remotely justify the kind of bizarre and over-the-top reaction we have seen from the Opposition, and particularly from Mr Costello in his extraordinary reference to child abuse. If that is the quality of informed and mature comment we can expect from the new Opposition in relation to these matters, God help this country in the future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report focuses on the outstanding obligations of the Commonwealth, but what it ignores, in all but passing, is the Government's significant asset base and, more importantly, the Commonwealth Government's capacity to fund these obligations over time through its existing revenue base.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report notes that the face value of its debt at June 1992 was 11.8 per cent of GDP. This compares favourably with the prior 10-year average of 13.2 per cent. It is also worth making the point that the Commonwealth is extremely well placed with respect to its financial obligations when compared with other OECD governments. OECD statistics show that Australia's net general government debt in 1992 represented only 16 per cent of GDP, and that is less than half that of the average for the G7 countries and below that of all the major OECD countries except Japan.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should also be recognised that these obligations will not be required to be paid at any one particular point in time; rather, they will become due over a very long period and, in the case of superannuation, in excess of 50 years. Several of the recommendations, moreover, that are made in the report are absolutely in line with policy initiatives that have already been taken by the Government. In particular, the Government's decision in November 1992 that departments move to financial reporting on an accrual basis will provide the basis for comprehensive information to be reported to the Parliament and the public on the financial position of the Government.</PARA>

If that language was used in the report&mdash;and I cannot believe that it was in as stark and crude terms as that from people who are reasonably sophisticated in their approach to these matters&mdash;that is simply a misconstruction of the reality.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Does the Minister representing the Treasurer agree that the dependent spouse rebate is an important tax equity measure, especially beneficial to single income households? Will the Minister therefore give an assurance that the Government does not regard the promised cashed out payment of a rebate to be directed to a dependent spouse with children as a welfare measure and therefore vulnerable to reduction or even elimination, as if its payment were a social security benefit?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make it very clear that moving a measure from the revenue side of the Budget to the expenditure side does not make it more vulnerable in any way at all. The capacity to change it remains the same, for good or ill. In fact, it makes the benefit more apparent. It makes it more evident. It makes who the beneficiaries are intended to be more directly apparent. It makes the payment more overt. There is often a problem with hiding expenditures in the tax system. Tax expenditures are not so apparent and therefore not so protectable.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Tate is correct in saying that the dependent spouse rebate has important equity implications for single income households, but this enhancement of it, which we announced in the election, is just part of a further enhancement of child-care policy&mdash;this and others. It will redirect assistance by converting the tax rebate to a cash benefit paid directly to the spouse at home caring for children. It is, as the Prime Minister said, a recognition and an appreciation of the important role played by women who choose to stay at home while their children are growing up. It represents an enhancement of the Government's assistance in this area.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, it is an enhancement of this measure and makes it more apparent and makes the beneficiary more clearly stated and, I think, more appropriate. Any concern that may have been expressed to Senator Tate that placing it on the expenditure side will make it in some way more vulnerable is ill-founded. There is no cause for any concern on those grounds.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A fall in business investment was expected in the March quarter purely because of the strong December quarter result. Abstracting from the large one-off elements in the December quarter, the latest capital expenditure release does suggest that investment in plant and equipment has turned around and has grown in the last two quarters. So what Senator Short is trying to do with that question is extrapolate from a particular quarter's figures, which are not appropriate to draw the conclusions that he has drawn from them. We are very confident that the conditions have been established for a sustainable recovery, including major new investment expenditure, with the assistance, encouragement and incentive of the investment allowances that were an essential part of our campaign platform, and we fully expect that situation to be realised.</PARA></TALK.START>

I assume from that answer that Senator Evans is not aware that, taking the last 15 months as a whole, investment has been absolutely flat and that that followed a massive fall in private investment in the preceding 2 1/2 years.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I repeat, because I do not think Senator Short was listening very carefully, that although there was a large fall-off in the March quarter, 9.2 per cent under the just released capital expenditure survey measure, this did follow a very strong rise in the December quarter that was due unquestionably to large one-off factors. Overall we are very confident that there are signs that over the last two quarters investment in plant and equipment has begun to grow again after falling&mdash;it is readily acknowledged&mdash;for the previous 12 quarters, and that total business fixed investment may have bottomed. That is the assessment of the Treasury. I am not going to second guess that. I am certainly not going to make any judgments about what will or will not show up in the national accounts figures to which Senator Short refers.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The truth of the matter is, as I recall the figures, that given that forward estimates each year&mdash;the way in which they are constructed&mdash;do not necessarily fully reflect the nature of the going obligations we have in the aid budget, it would take in the order of $40 million new money in the Budget on top of forward estimates simply to stay where we are.  In real terms it will take something like a $70 million injection from the Budget to stay where we are in ODA to GNP ratio terms at 0.36. It will take something like another $111 million to $112 million worth of new aid money in the Budget to start making an impact on the 0.4 medium term target that we have set ourselves as a way station en route, hopefully, to finally achieving the 0.7 international target.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not know how many people have gout, but I am among them. If the question were about gout, this might have been a different answer. This is a pretty new drug and its manufacturer is now asking that the Government list the drug on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. While sumitriptan is certainly better than other treatments currently available for at least half our migraine sufferers, it is not so much better as to justify the extraordinary price that the manufacturer, Glaxo, is asking for it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Advice to the Government suggests that to approve this drug would mean adding about $240 million a year to the Government's pharmaceutical bill. Given that the Government spends in total about $1.4 million on other drugs, that is an increase of more than 15 per cent for only one drug. That would be more than we spend as a nation on medical research. It would be more than the total cost of hospital services in southern Sydney. It is an extraordinary amount.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As good as this drug may be, we all have to ask ourselves whether it is fair for taxpayers to fund that exorbitant price. The manufacturers are asking to charge a price of $41.45 for two tablets. My advice from the medical profession is that many sufferers require three to four tablets an episode&mdash;and that makes this a very expensive number.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that the claim is always that the price is set to do two things: to recover development costs&mdash;and I think we would have to concede that they are considerable, they probably amount to hundreds of millions of dollars&mdash;and also to give some kind of stimulus or incentive to discover new and better drugs in the future. The problem is that our calculations suggest that if Glaxo maintains the price it is asking the Government for&mdash;which is pretty similar to the world price it has set for this drug; a price it is trying to get all world governments to cop, particularly those in the OECD&mdash;the company will get between $15 and $20 billion a year, every single year. I  would say that that is some kind of stimulus. It is not the kind of stimulus that the Government would be prepared to pay.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While the company, naturally enough, claims that $240 million is grossly overestimating the cost to us, if one looks at the record for drug after drug, one sees that time after time the Government's estimates in this respect have been pretty accurate. If one looks at simvastatin, the cholesterol drug, and cyclosporin, one realises that our estimates have come in very close to cost. Those drugs are the most recent of the new, expensive drugs. I do not think $240 million is going to be far out. It is an awful lot of money. It is something that Australians are going to have to consider.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991-92, Glaxo received a subsidy of around $90 million from our scheme. We have to ask ourselves as a nation whether we are prepared to pay the exorbitant price that this multinational drug company is asking us for, or whether we stand on some sort of principle and say that perhaps there are better ways to spend a vast sum of money like that.</PARA>

One of the things that I, as someone who has a very serious interest in air safety, get very annoyed about&mdash;and I think rightly so&mdash;is when reports are made that are not accurate and when honourable senators, particularly, get up, as one did yesterday, and claim that there is a report around the place that shows that the situation is, in fact, near disastrous in terms of safety. This is not the case.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bishop should pay close attention to this. It has been reported that the airlines expressed concerns over the CAA's safety regulation division. They did. What was not reported&mdash;and I hope it is now reported; and I did tell the Senate about this yesterday&mdash;is that after these concerns were raised, and after the airlines met with the CAA to discuss these concerns, as a direct consequence of those meetings, the Australian Aviation Industry Association, which is the peak major airlines body in Australia, has six representatives on the working party that is now addressing the Terrell report.

The record shows that, having an inch-thick wad of documents, all of which automatically attracted privilege, dumped in the Senate yesterday, all I sought time to do was to examine them to see whether there were any matters of concern, particularly in the case of individuals who might have been named, that should not attract privilege. I did that. I read the papers, and I had no objection to what was contained in them.

The first warning by the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation in early 1991, following eight `near misses' at Sydney airport, said the airport was a `near collision waiting to happen'. The second warning, again by the bureau less than six months later, involved a call for a review of the simultaneous use of runways at Sydney airport. The third warning by the Aviation Safety Regulation Forum last August urged the Civil Aviation Authority to get back to its primary role of protecting air safety standards. I ask the Minister: firstly, why has it taken a fourth warning, with the tabling of the Terrell report by the Opposition yesterday, for him to take notice of the threats to public safety and finally chair a meeting on the issue; and, secondly, why has he been so unwilling to meet his ministerial responsibilities in yet another area?<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL"></EMPHASIS></PARA></TALK.START>

Those concerns are rightly and consistently made. The CAA is constantly reviewing its operations in cooperation with the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation. In fact, we currently have in this country an expert in air space management from Canada. This person has been brought to Australia by the CAA to look at its air space proposals. I would just reiterate&mdash;and I am pleased and give <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS> credit for actually putting this on the record in its introduction this morning&mdash;that the reason we are debating this at all is that the Terrell report, as I said yesterday, was in fact commissioned by the CAA board itself.

I wrote to the engineers last week before any of this happened&mdash;and I will give those opposite a copy of the letter&mdash;proposing, as a result of several weeks of meetings, that I would chair a round table meeting. One of the reasons I wanted that round table meeting was to have all of the parties in the same room at the same time.

Part of those redundancy payments includes two weeks' payment for each year of service and a waiving of the provisions of section 23(3)(b) of the DFRDB Act, which applies a financial penalty for retirement before an age-rank point is reached.

With the greatest respect to the Minister, the question was about equity, not about numbers retiring on a voluntary basis or otherwise. Some of the statements about a balanced Defence Force are demonstrably incorrect. Waiving section 23(3)(b) means that officers are the only people targeted; other ranks are not. Only those officers who are in the DFRDB scheme, not in the MSBS scheme, are targeted.

The point I was trying to make in response to Senator Tate, which I think goes to some of the concerns of Senator Harradine&mdash;I will try to be more explicit to deal with the manner in which Senator Harradine has expressed the question, although I do not think it raises any issues that Senator Tate did not raise&mdash;is that I know people are expressing concern that because this has moved from the revenue side of the Budget to the expenditure side it is more vulnerable, or is less likely to increase in accordance with inflation and have its value maintained. I do not think there is any evidence to sustain either of those arguments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The value of some things within the tax system have been indexed while some have not; some things on the expenditure side have been indexed while some have not.

What it does in this instance is target the payment more accurately and make the benefit more apparent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That was the point I was trying to make to Senator Tate, but I am happy to make it clear that there are, within the dependent spouse rebate and in the cash version of it which we will be introducing, very important equity implications. It is not merely a payment designed for welfare purposes. It has very important equity elements to it which must be a part of any consideration in future years of the level at which it is maintained. Nobody can give guarantees about what will be the real value of a tax deduction, a tax rebate or an expenditure in future years. There is no way that that effectively can be done. It requires decisions by Budgets and by the Parliament at the end of the day.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whichever side of the Budget equation one is on, nobody can guarantee how well the value of the benefit will be sustained, but it is not endangered in any way by the transfer.

Drugs are recommended for listing on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee on the basis of the conditions for which they have marketing approval. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee is an expert body of health professionals&mdash;comprising both men and women, I might say&mdash;who make technical, scientifically based recommendations about the listing of drugs. To impute that these experts discriminate against women implies improper practice on their part, and that is patently absurd.</PARA>

Drugs are listed on the basis of their proposed use, not on the basis of which particular sex uses them. Obviously, some drugs are used only by women and some only by men.

This will be effective from August of this year, when the next schedule of pharmaceutical benefits is released. The Government did not discriminate against women who need Zoladex. The drug was first listed for a condition that only men suffered from. Its use has since been extended to treat breast cancer, a condition that both women and men suffer from.

<PARA>I feel quite sorry for Senator Richardson because he obviously takes offence at a question that was factually correct. The drug is not listed on the pharmaceutical benefits scheme at the moment. He neglected to tell us that the Endometriosis Association has approached the Government for it to be listed on the PBS for women with endometriosis. Those women have to pay $400 for the use of that drug, whereas a man with prostatic cancer gets the drug for $15 under the PBS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister said that there were no drugs that he was aware of that were approved by the Therapeutic Goods Administration for use in Australia by both men and women, yet they have been approved for public subsidy for one and not the other. I would like to let the Minister know that there is a drug called Rocaltrol which is available for post-menopausal women who have osteoporosis with crush fractures of the vertebrae, which is not available for men with osteoporosis who have crush fractures of the vertebrae. A man would have to pay $100 for that drug and a woman would get it for $15. It is the reverse of the situation that I pointed out to him yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He might take offence at that, but it is obvious that his department has not fully informed him, or it is not aware that there is gender bias in the approval of drugs.

I suspect, because this material will go out in the media, there will be people informing me of other drugs that I am not aware of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was a very straightforward question. It is obvious that, in defence of the Minister's department and the material that it has given him, it is not aware of the problem. It is also interesting that in respect of the drug that I referred to yesterday an approach was made in May 1990 for that to be approved by the PBS and then the Baume committee report came forward and all those drugs were put on hold. But the Baume report was referring to all the drugs affecting male homosexuals; the AIDS people got all those drugs expedited and all the others were put on hold, but they are now coming through. </PARA>

I want to make it quite clear that the former ambassador to Chile had actually written to Senator Evans on 13 April and the former ambassador's solicitor had already written to the Minister on 11 March this year, and yet the Minister is saying that he was advised only a week or so ago. </PARA>

The affidavit from the person who was involved in making an annotation on a document which was subsequently deleted has put in his affidavit the following statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this context I should record that when the Ambassador at my request first completed OPG Form 4 "Purchase of House: Details required for evaluation", he wrote the word `Nil' against Q37: "List any repairs, renovations or additions with an estimate of costs and likely duration of work involved". When he answered this question on 16 January 1991, that was the correct answer because no additional work was then anticipated. The initial items totalling $US19,000 (over and above the price of the basic house costing $US140,300) were not extras or additions in the ordinary meaning of those terms. They were integral parts of the original house and neither I nor the Ambassador would have been associated with this proposal were that not the case. It was for that reason that I myself wrote `No' against Q37 (as I worked through the completed OPG Form 4), thus confirming what the Ambassador had written.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter involving the former Australian Ambassador to Chile, Mr Malcolm Dan, has been something of a long running saga. The department has taken disciplinary action against Mr Dan following three findings of misconduct in relation to his purchase of duty free motor vehicles in the course of his two most recent overseas postings as an ambassador in Buenos Aires and Santiago de Chile, and has laid an additional seven charges of misconduct against him. All seven charges relate to his conduct while Ambassador to Chile.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In February this year, Mr Dan withdrew his appeal to the Merit Protection Review Agency against the earlier findings of misconduct in relation to the first three charges; so those three findings therefore stand. In April this year Mr Dan also withdrew his appeal to the Federal Court on the jurisdictional question of the applicability of the Public Service Act to him while he was serving as an ambassador.

There is adequate and appropriate disciplinary machinery available. There is an opportunity for Mr Dan to go off sideways to the courts if he believes there are procedural defects.

That is an allegation that will have to be tested in an appropriate way: in the first instance, obviously, by internal investigation. If it is thought that internal investigation throws up something that is worthy of attention by the criminal process or criminal investigation process, then of course that is the path we will go down, as we always have in these matters when issues of this kind have arisen or questions of unauthorised leaks of confidential material and so on have been raised.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am really wondering whether it is true that the Minister's office is not interested in the taxation burden borne by women. If it is not&mdash;and I think we should rightfully expect it to be&mdash;then who is interested in the impact of the One Nation tax cuts on women in particular? If it is true, as the Government is asserting, that we can find $8 billion&mdash;and let us look at that with respect to women&mdash;could we not better spend $8 billion in a targeted way for women? For example, if we use the entire $8 billion, perhaps we could fund a large home child-care payment of, say, $100 a week which may be sufficient to fund and recognise the value of work done in the home, especially the work of child rearing, providing a real choice to parents as to whether they want to remain in the paid work force or provide care for their family. One could argue that this could have an effect on unemployment, because it would provide a real choice to some people who prefer not to work or who prefer to be able to stay at home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It really is hard to believe that the Office of the Status of Women would not have made some representation to the Minister or to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) on the impact of these tax cuts, because they impact on 60 per cent of Australian women. Those women are concentrated in the income group below $20,700. That is a fact of life in Australia. It is not a fact of life that we like for working women, but it is a fact. I call upon the Minister&mdash;if she has not already done so&mdash;to raise this issue with the Prime Minister and to inform the Senate of the outcome. </PARA>

<PARA>I listened with great interest to the answer given by Senator Faulkner regarding the making of a number of films&mdash;seven films in all&mdash;about the record of Australians in war. Because Senator Faulkner and I differ on quite a number of issues, I listened very carefully to the wording of his answer. From memory, there was not a word I would have changed. He mentioned that it was important to celebrate the courage and sacrifice of the men and women of this country who fought in a series of combats commencing with the First World War. I welcome the move to make these films. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, whereas I accept in principle the making of these films, I would be quite fascinated to see the scripts and to find out how they will be developed. There is a great division in the country as to how we view our past; it is one of the great cultural battles which is occurring in this nation.

I was interested to read a great book which recently came to my attention, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Australian Victories in France in 1918</EMPHASIS>, by General Sir John Monash. In that book General Monash mentioned, among other things, the great pushes that Australians made to help end the 1918 war. Battle reports were coming in from the famous battles in France on 8 and 9 August of that year. Senator McKiernan would be interested to know that General Monash said that a message, telegraphed as the Australians went forward, stated:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recently gave a lecture about the First World War to a number of students from a senior school in Victoria. They ran an interesting line with me; they asked why Australians are always fighting other people's wars. I was interested to reply because I had just read a book entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">ANZAC to Amiens: A shorter history of the Australian fighting services in the First World War</EMPHASIS> by C.E.W. Bean, the great war historian. The main point of discussion with these students was the First World War. Bean asked why Australians were involved in the First World War and what would have been the effect of a German victory. He says that if there had been a German victory, the first term in the peace treaty would have been the abolition of the British navy. For the Australian nation this would have meant either subservience to Germany or extinction at the hands of the Japanese. This is an interesting point, but a point that the students of this class had never been taught. </PARA>

Given my interest in Australian history, I will take particular interest in the development of these films, and I urge Senator Faulkner to make sure they give a true reflection of Australian history and not this black armband view of Australian history. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I asked the Minister whether the Government viewed the cashed-up version of the DSR as a tax equity measure or a welfare issue. In answer to Senator Tate, the Minister indicated that, irrespective of whether it was a tax issue or a welfare issue, changes could be made which could be detrimental or advantageous. That is true&mdash;that is not in question&mdash;but it is essential to know whether it is a tax equity measure or a welfare measure, because different guidelines apply when consideration is given to changes in those regimes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, if the DSR is to continue to be regarded, as it now is, as a tax equity measure, consideration needs to be given to other taxation issues if it is to be changed. If it is to be regarded as a welfare measure, certain targeting must necessarily be considered. It is a very fundamental question affecting hundreds of thousands of women in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to my supplementary question, the Minister said something like this: it is very convenient for an Independent senator to admit of only one possible interpretation, but that is never possible; it might be popular, but it is never accurate. I found that to be rather paternalistic. Those of us who were here in 1976 will recall that both the Government of the day and the Labor Opposition said that tax rebates for children, cashed-up in the family allowance payments, were to be regarded as a tax equity question. They were a matter of horizontal tax equity in which it was recognised that it was more costly for a family raising children&mdash;it paid more tax through consumption taxes, wholesale sales taxes and other retail taxes&mdash;than a family without children on the same level of income. That statement was made by both the Government and the Opposition. </PARA>

I ask honourable senators to take themselves back to 1976 and think what those families would have said if the Government had been honest at that stage and said, `We are going to cut out tax rebates for your children'.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Auditor-General's Report No. 36 of 1992-93 could not come down at a more opportune time. Honourable senators may remember that yesterday evening in this chamber, the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Mr Tickner, through Senator Evans, agreed to send the Auditor-General in to look at the workings of the Northern Land Council. I had previously been asking for the same sort of scrutiny in relation to the Strelley Aboriginal community pastoral stations in Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to outline to the Senate the main findings of the Auditor-General to show the sort of ongoing situation we have with the non-accountability of not only ATSIC but also communities into which Commonwealth funding has been going. In the report the Auditor-General found that ATSIC needed to give more adequate consideration to project costs and benefits of infrastructure projects for ATSI communities. In a number of infrastructure projects the ANAO found that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . other needs . . . were passed over, and some facilities constructed were not being fully used.</PARA>
<PARA>In many cases, such as with the Strelley situation, the facilities are not being used at all. The report also found that ATSIC and its regional councils did not document their reasons for allocation of funds to specific regions and to individual projects. Another finding in the report stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Maintenance requirements and costs were not considered when these projects were planned, risking unexpected costs or a deterioration of community infrastructure.</PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General also found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The respective responsibilities of Commonwealth, State/Territory and local Governments in the provision of community infrastructure to indigenous communities are unclear and ATSIC may be funding projects properly the responsibility of other levels of government.</PARA>
<PARA>This point really needs looking into. I have expressed concern about these situations time and time again. The Strelley situation has become well known during this past week but, as the Auditor-General pointed out, there are many other cases. The report also noted:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ATSIC lacks a management system to identify outstanding community infrastructure needs and monitor program performance.</PARA>
<PARA>This is not something new that has emerged from a report by the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to Auditor-General's report No. 7 of 1991-92, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Report on ministerial portfolios&mdash;budget sittings 1991</EMPHASIS>, which also expressed concerns on grants administration. We see the following passage on page 40:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The review of grants administration revealed numerous instances where there was failure to meet Commission rules and procedures for administration of housing and CDEP grants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Despite continuing non-compliance with grant conditions by some grantees, the Commission&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is ATSIC&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">continued to release grant funds and not take action to recover grant moneys as required by sub-section 20(1) and 20(2) of the ATSIC Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission advised that the matters advised by ANAO were significant and would be addressed.</PARA>
<PARA>Let us look at how ATSIC addressed it. I turn to page 110 of the 1991-92 annual report of ATSIC, which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Auditor-General noted in Report No. 7 that, `despite continuing non-compliance with grant conditions by some grantees, the Commission continued to release grant funds and not take action to recover grant moneys . . . </PARA>
<PARA>The ATSIC report states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commission subsequently noted that section 20 of the Act authorises the Commission to require repayment of part or all of a grant or loan where the Commission is satisfied that the recipient has failed to fulfil a term or condition of the grant or loan. It does not require the Commission to take recovery action. The decision on whether to take such action will depend on the nature and the significance of the non-compliance.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, even though ATSIC authorises the grant and can ask for the money back, it is not required to ensure that the money be returned. The Government has to look at this situation and come up with a better solution. We need legislation in front of this Parliament to sort out ATSIC's contradicting regulations. As I have shown, the Auditor-General has been pointing this out for a few years</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If legislation was put in place, actions such as Mr Tickner took yesterday with regard to investigating the Northern Land Council would not have been necessary.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would not have been necessary for me to be asking the Parliament to take action with regard to the Strelley group. In the past two years that group has had $1.7 million allocated to it, but the fact is that those stations have been abandoned during that time. I hope that the Minister will take the same action with the Strelley group that he has taken with the Northern Land Council. As I said, the Strelley group has taken some $1.7 million in the last two years and I do not know where it has finished up. However, since I asked that question in this place two days ago, my fax machine has run hot. Information has been coming in on that Strelley group going back to 1977 with a report from the pastoral inspector to the lands department and to the then Department of Aboriginal Affairs on the mismanagement of the stations. Since 1977 reports of mismanagement have been totally disregarded by the Aboriginal department. ATSIC is now responsible for managing the finances. It is time that the Government stopped shillyshallying on the issue of ATSIC's accountability. It should address all the problems that have been pointed out in the Auditor-General's report which has been presented today. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>The Auditor-General's report No. 37 is a report into a project audit on the review of financial systems applying in half a dozen or so government departments and agencies. By way of background, during 1991-92 the Australian National Audit Office undertook audits of five agencies which had installed over the past two years the same common proprietary, commercial, financial management system known as FINEST. The agencies covered in this audit were the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Securities Commission, the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, the Department of Health, Housing, Local Government and Community Services and the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The general conclusion of the Audit Office and the outcome of its audit into the five agencies was that generally the agencies were successfully utilising the FINEST software to support their financial operations and financial management. That was after looking into the purpose of the audits which was to examine the implementation and operation of the financial management system within the agencies to determine whether the financial management system was operated in such a way that the managers of the agencies could be assured that their accounting records were complete, accurate and valid, whether the system provided an adequate level of support for the management of the agencies' financial affairs, and whether the computer and support environment for the financial management system was effective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, the general conclusion was that the particular agencies that were audited were successfully utilising the FINEST software to support their financial operations and financial management. However, there were various deficiencies found in the agencies, the strength of which varied from one agency to another. I want to bring to the Senate's attention the one concerning the department for which I have shadow ministerial responsibility; namely, the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. The Audit Office considered that the department needed to take strong and immediate action to avoid future problems with the integrity of its financial systems. It was in relation to the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs that the Audit Office had the strongest comments of reservation as to how the whole thing was going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Audit Office found in relation to the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs that it had not implemented the new system with a satisfactory level of environmental and manual processing controls to ensure the integrity of the financial data process. Specifically, the Audit Office concluded that there was a risk of improper account processing due to users having excessive access to the system. The Audit Office found that the department had not established adequate practices and procedures regarding the processing of purchasing and claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These deficiencies have been brought to the attention of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and, according to the Audit Office, the department has generally accepted the recommendations for improvement of the system so far as it applies to that department. In its response to the Auditor-General's criticisms, the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs indicated that since the completion of the audit, which took place in 1991-92, many of the control weaknesses found have been addressed. Also, the department reported that it is currently undertaking a major review of its approach to accounts processing, which should further tighten up on concerns identified by the Audit Office. So says the Audit Office. That is encouraging. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> In commending the Audit Office for the review that it has done of these agencies, I point out that in relation to the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs there are obviously&mdash;and the department appears to accept this&mdash;numerous deficiencies in the administration of the department. I have expressed some concern in recent weeks about various operations of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and its implementation of the migration program, a program of considerable importance, significance and sensitivity. It is very important indeed that departments charged with the sensitive responsibilities that departments such as the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs have do operate at a high level of administrative efficiency, otherwise people lose confidence in the programs that they are administering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome the positive response by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to the Auditor-General's comments and criticisms, and I can assure the Senate that the coalition will certainly be watching the progress in this matter with considerable interest in view of its importance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">I would like to add to the comments of my colleague Senator Short in congratulating the Auditor-General on the work that he has undertaken and on his findings. I think it is significant that these five agencies have installed over the past two years the same commercial financial management system, known as FINEST, which is a software package that originally found its evolutions within the Australian public sector. Subsequently, some of the original supporters of that concept further developed that package in the commercial environment. It has been so successful that it is now a central feature of a number of departments and agencies.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that we acknowledge the work that has been done by the firm Management Solutions in developing this software package. It is now widely used within the public sector. I endorse these comments of the Auditor-General in his key findings:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">FINEST is generally being successfully utilised by the agencies to support the financial operations and financial management. . .</PARA>
<PARA>It is indeed a very successful system that provides useful management information in a timely fashion and appropriate accountability. I understand, from having inspected the operations of this firm, that it is continuously adding sophisticated layers to this software package. It speaks volumes for the public sector that it has used the services of these people, that it has sought to develop its expertise in this field and that it is big enough to use these systems very productively. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the Auditor-General said, the introduction of this software package has supported the agencies in catering for the devolution of financial management and administration over recent years. I think it is particularly important that most of the agencies have generally found that their financial systems have been strengthened as a result of the application of the software packages which have been developed here in Canberra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I noticed that there was a television report some time ago that showed that, despite the recession, this was one of the few firms in Canberra that was actually adding to its staff. It is a small, vigorous staff during a recessionary period. I think this spirit speaks volumes as to the creativity of the management, and I wish the firm well. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Chair's Tabling Speech</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Super Supervisory Levy</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, Honourable senators would recall that almost two years ago the Select Committee on Superannuation was established with terms of reference which were both complex and comprehensive.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In November last year the Committee received a further reference to inquire into and report on the provisions of Statutory Rule No. 283 of 1992 which raised the superannuation supervisory levy from $40 to $200 per $500 000 of assets in superannuation funds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The referral of the matter to the select committee was indeed a logical move on the part of the mover, Senator Alston. First the committee, in its initial report, Safeguarding Super, made a number of recommendations about the need for greater regulation of superannuation activities in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Arising out of that report and the Government's acceptance of most of the recommendations, was a need to devote substantial additional resources to the primary regulator of superannuation, the ISC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee and the Government also agreed that there should be a user-pays approach to the funding of the more interventionist ISC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consequently, the Government initiated Regulation 283 which increased the liability of superannuation funds in respect of the supervisory levy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee received 22 submissions on the levy and held a morning of public hearings at which the ISC, LIFA and ASFA gave evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The inquiry process, whilst being an excellent opportunity to gain information on how the levy is set, also provided the Committee with a unique opportunity to assess the steps the ISC had taken towards becoming the principal supervisor of superannuation in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this regard the Committee took a keen interest in the auditing program which the ISC proposes including those sectors of the industry which pose the greatest risk and other measures which it will need to take in becoming a proactive and, where needed, an interventionist agency responsible for securing over $155 billion of superannuation and approved deposit funds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The general impression which I gained from the hearing is that the ISC is effectively coping with the many challenges which it now faces. I would remind the Senate that that organisation is probably the fastest growing office in the bureaucracy and growth of that magnitude presents organisational and staffing difficulties which the ISC appears to be overcoming.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would now turn to the key recommendations which are contained in the report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first matter concerns the need for the ISC to consult more closely and widely with a range of industry groups when setting the levy. The Committee received a loud and clear message that  the consultation was more of an ex poste than an ex ante setting of the levy process and we were unanimous that in future all of the key groups should be involved in the consultative process before a levy is determined.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of the reasons for the rush of complaints following the determination of the levy (from memory the ISC received over 500 complaints after the announcement) was that for many funds it was a steep increase, in some cases approaching 400%.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee believes that a phasing-in or averaging should have occurred and that way a smoothing out of increases should be able to occur in future. This would provide a certainty in planning both in the industry and the ISC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee further believes that the formula which is used to set the levy should take account of a number of parameters which have been identified in the report. If the Government takes heed of these suggestions a more efficient and equitable levy regime will be established.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One of these parameters, perhaps the most important, is the need to avoid cross subsidisation between small and large funds. Based on the evidence provided to the Committee this does not appear to have occurred.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Small funds, that is, those with assets not exceeding $500 000, pay a levy of $200 per year and receive regulatory benefits which the Committee values at $211.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Large funds contended that the increase in the maximum from $10 000 to $14 000 was unjustified. They told the committee that a levy of $10 000 implied a supervisory effort of more than one person day per week for a large but straightforward fund and that this was clearly beyond the current supervisory effort in relation to these funds. I sympathise with this comment but add that it is very difficult to allocate precisely the benefit on a per fund basis of the regulatory regime.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As we have stated in the report the overall integrity and security of superannuation generally is the aim of the government in this facet of intervention. If this can be achieved and fund failure is avoided, then $10 000 per year for a fund with assets exceeding $25 000 0000 is a small price to pay (.04 of a percentage point in fact). The cost of overall regulation vis a vis total fund assets is in the vicinity of .002 of a percentage point.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee looks forward to the Government's response to this unanimous report and it is our hope that the ISC will take on board both the spirit and the letter of the recommendations which have been made.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In accordance with the resolution of re-appointment of the Select Committee on Superannuation on 19 May 1993, I rise to give the report for that committee. In making this report it is with a tinge of regret that I inform the Senate that this will be the last occasion on which I will address the Senate from the position of chair of the Select Committee on Superannuation. I say this because the select committee has been one of the highlights of my fairly brief political career. The committee has been a success for a number of reasons, and I will briefly elaborate on some of them.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first, and not necessarily the most important, is that retirement incomes policy is one of the real challenges facing all Australians. Be they age pensioners, retired superannuants, workers on award super, recipients of the SGC, low income earners, part-time employees or public sector employees, many individuals have a natural interest in the fate they will experience when they retire. Therefore, intense scrutiny is being applied to this social welfare policy area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is not alone in this regard. In the United Kingdom pensioners worry about whether another Maxwell will occur. In the United States it is the performance of individual 401K plans and for how long the Government will go on guaranteeing unfunded private sector defined benefits schemes which have granted benefits in lieu of pay rises in the knowledge that the Government would pay up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But in Australia, notwithstanding that there are some finetuning problems which the Committee will address in coming months, we do have in place the superstructure which will deliver self-provision and equity in retirement incomes policy. History will prove that the decisions of this Government in retirement incomes policy were correct. The record will also show the Select Committee on Superannuation was an important player in the launching of the Australian pensions flagship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This committee was given a mammoth task in reporting on no fewer than 17 terms of reference. I am pleased to announce that with the exception of the report on fees, charges and commissions, which will be presented to the President during the next fortnight, the task is complete on those 17 terms of reference. In addition, the committee will present an overview report which places the six earlier reports in a policy and procedural context. This report will make interesting reading and should prove to be of assistance to future committees faced with a task as broad as that which this committee was given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second ingredient for the committee's success was the synergy which was generated by the work of the six committee members during the 87 meetings that were convened. The spirit of cooperation and level of energy displayed by the committee, I believe, stands the committee system in good stead. The committee as a group used the procedures conferred on it by the Senate with the greatest possible effect. It is appropriate at this time that I seek leave to incorporate in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> the procedures agreed to by the committee at its most recent meeting. </PARA>

They include: Michael Game, the principal research officer, who has retired; Lyn Curran the principal research officer who has moved to another position; Alistair Sands, principal research officer; Gary Bauer, who has moved to another position; Rod Power, research officer; Rod Adams, research officer; Cath Drinkwater, executive assistant; and Heather Hibbitt and Michelle Hawey respectively as executive assistants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's reports and documents provide industry, government and consumers with an encyclopedia of superannuation in Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will take this opportunity to move on behalf of the coalition the amendment standing in my name. I understand that the Government has quite a number of amendments to move. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 40, page 19, line 25, omit "and is taken always to have had", substitute "from 1 July 1992".</PARA>
<PARA>The amendment seeks to take away a retrospective element to enable taxpayers to rely on the black letter of taxation law. So I am pleased that in this place we have chosen not to extend the effect of repealed section 55 to before 1 July 1992. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment has been drafted so as to achieve this aim in the least destructive fashion possible. It contains an express date so as to avoid any doubt about the extent of retrospectivity in clause 40 of this Bill. This is important for clarity, given the hive of legislative activity over section 55 this past year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In my speech during the second reading debate on 19 May I said that retrospective legislation is wrong in principle. Also, in practice, if the Liberal National party coalition amendment to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill 1993, which is now in the committee stage of the Senate, is not accepted, those taxpayers who had prepared and lodged returns based on the letter of the law as it stood at the time will be obliged to lodge amended returns and adjust the tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is one of the consequences of bad retrospective law. This illustrates why we should find that retrospective legislation is anti-ethical to good Government. Honest taxpayers who have, in good faith, predicated their behaviour and altered their material position on the basis of particular laws as they stood, may find this basis not only changed for the future, but also for the past. If we allow this sort of retrospective legislation to be passed, it will cause chaos which I am sure will be apparent to all honourable senators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It ill becomes this place to rectify its legislative failings by legislative action, particularly in the tax area where people have met their commitments according to good law passed by this Parliament&mdash;according to the black letter of the law as such. It sends a message to the Executive that poor drafting causes taxpayers of this country problems enough without them being compounded by retrospective legislation. The past is indeed another country. They do things differently there. But with retrospective legislation, the way those things are done keeps changing over and over, depending on the Government's move. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of the Liberal and National party coalition, I move:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 40, page 19, line 25, omit "and is taken always to have had", substitute "from 1 July 1992".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This provision will remove the abhorrent, retrospective element of this amendment Bill in relation to broadbanding. Although the Government may claim it was never intended, there are many taxpayers in this country who do not read press releases issued by treasurers and who do not have the opportunity to read explanatory memorandums. They would go to their solicitors who would have a copy of that legislation. On the basis of that legislation, they should be able to prepare their tax returns with certainty and not find that a subsequent parliament overturns those provisions, even though those particular provisions may not have been the original intention of the Government at the time the legislation was passed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a reflection not only on the Government but also perhaps on us as senators for not picking up these sorts of things. Nevertheless, taxpayers should be able to rely on that law as being good law at the time.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Watson for his contribution. Certainty before the law is a very important and vital issue, particularly for this Senate chamber. Although what we are dealing with is not of major significance, except to those who are involved, we should be standing by the principle of certainty before the law. Senator Watson referred to clause 40 which repeals section 55 to make it clear that rates of depreciation determined on an effect of life basis that correspond with a broadbanded rate cannot be increased to the next highest broadbanded rate. Had we left that section as it was, it would, as Senator Watson said, have required substituted or additional returns by the taxpayer. I assume that Senator Watson's amendment would ensure that it would take effect for this taxation year and onwards. The Minister may be able to explain why, when we are talking about retrospectivity and the operative date being 1 July 1992, that should not be 1993, if we are truly looking at the question of retrospectivity.</PARA></TALK.START>

Even those who disagree with the provision about how we should handle it do not argue about the original intention of the legislation. There is no doubt about the original intention. It may ultimately be that it will be upheld as meaning that, but it creates uncertainty and potential threat to the revenue. I cannot see how we can responsibly allow the revenue to be endangered for no useful purpose and contrary to the intention of the Parliament at the time the legislation was passed. That is why we are seeking to put in the words which Senator Watson is seeking to delete and why I certainly strongly oppose the amendment which he is proposing.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Under self-assessment, neither the Minister nor the Australian Taxation Office really would be aware of taxpayers who had lodged returns on the basis of the literal interpretation that they are entitled to take by virtue of the looseness of the terminology used in the legislation. It is important to stress that there is no dispute about the need to clarify this, but we are saying that it has to be operative from a reasonable date.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of the many changes and the repeal of section 55 provisions, we had to move them in such a way as to have the least disruptive effect. But people are entitled to rely on an exact interpretation as they see it. There was no vagueness about it. It may not have been the intent of this Parliament to have been so generous&mdash;true. Some taxpayers may have been somewhat surprised at the apparent generosity or at the extension. But, after all, broadbanding was about providing a more generous uplift to the next broadbanded classification. If they were on a particular broadbanded classification, they were not entitled to go up to the next one. That was the intent, but that is not how it was worded when this legislation was passed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All we are seeking to do is remove the retrospective element;  there will be no great loss of revenue because it will apply only in a fairly restricted period. After all, we passed the legislation only a few months ago, so millions of dollars will not be lost. There is no way that the Government or the Taxation Office could estimate at this stage how much money, if any, could have been lost. But I am told that when this matter was raised the other day, some taxpayers sought to take this literal interpretation. They will now be forced to go back, pay their accountants money and change all of their records. As a result of some sloppy drafting by the Government, those people will have to carry that expense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is about time we looked at our priorities. Who should be carrying the cost of these sorts of errors? Should it be the taxpayer or the commissioner in this case? We are saying that the commissioner has made his bed so must lie in it temporarily&mdash;certainly until we change it as from the proper operative date. That is all the argument is about. We are not disputing the need to clarify it for the future, but do not let us get into a habit of retrospectively changing legislation and putting taxpayers to unnecessary costs. </PARA>

We do not know, but it could be a lot because there could be quite big differences, as Senator Watson would know, in the depreciation rate and it could apply to some large items.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition will be supporting the new amendments just introduced by the Government. Both of these amendments I think display the usefulness of the committee system because both of these amendments had their evolution, perhaps, in the committee system&mdash;one just recently and the other some time back. Dealing with the sales tax amendment first, the need for this amendment is that certain taxpayers elect to pay tax on the containers at the time of the purchase.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be a change as a result of the amendments just introduced by the Minister whereby the Government is attempting to maintain the general principle that we tried to enunciate at the inquiry into the changes to streamline sales tax that the containers and the contents should be taxed at the same time and at the same rate. So attention was drawn to the need for symmetry in terms of timing and also the rate application.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pointed out during the committee stage that, unfortunately, the Government is not extending this to the fast food industry. So the general exemption that applies to food will not be extended to containers. I make the political point that on 1 January the rate was lifted from 10 to 20 per cent. We hope that next time the Government will give consideration to furthering this very good concept and principle of having the same rate attached to containers as to food, so that people who buy McDonald's or Kentucky Fried Chicken will not be in the position of paying no tax on the food but paying tax at the rate of 20 per cent on the containers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other amendment to the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993 makes changes to what is known as section 82AF(2)(a)(i) of the Income Tax Assessment Act. This is a provision that could have discriminated somewhat against a locally produced utility or panel van. I am pleased to say that the Australian motor vehicle industry has responded to the overseas competition in the light truck area. The purpose of this amendment will be to extend the investment allowance as well as the development allowance&mdash;and I commend the Government for extending it to the development allowance. Locally produced vehicles with the longer wheel base that will comply with the one-tonne categorisation will now come under this investment allowance and will qualify so that farmers and others who purchase these vehicles will not be disadvantaged, as they would have been without this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I support what the Australian Democrats have done in this regard. During the committee stage the Democrats, together with the Liberal Party, raised the fact that Australian produced vehicles would be disadvantaged, and the Government said that it needed time to consider it. I am pleased that that consideration has taken place and I am pleased with the manner in which the Government has made the changes. I must say that the changes are a little more generous than I had originally expected. I thank the Government for that, and I think jobs will be created in Australia as a result of this sensible move. It shows the need for wider participation, outside input and the continuation of the committee system of evaluation of Bills. </PARA>

<PARA JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">CLAUSE 15 OF THE BILL AND PROPOSED NEW PARAGRAPH 16(4)(HD)</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Q1:The paragraph only allows the divulging of information to the Secretary of the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs [DIEA] "for the purpose of assisting in locating persons who are unlawfully in Australia". Does this mean that only information concerning those who are unlawfully in Australia can be divulged?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A1:Yes. The purpose in proposing an information sharing arrangement between ATO and DIEA is to match data on illegal entrants or overstayers with ATO records to obtain the best available residential and workplace addresses of illegal entrants and in this way facilitate their location. The ATO will only divulge information relating to residential and workplace addresses.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Q2:Why doesn't the legislation limit the information to that of illegal entrants or overstayers?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A2:The legislation does not specifically limit the information to that pertaining to illegal entrants or overstayers as the terminology "persons unlawfully in Australia" covers the term "illegal entrants". The term "illegal entrants" currently includes, under section 14 of the Migration Act 1958, any non-citizen who enters or remains in Australia without authority or who overstays any authority. A new term "unlawful non-citizen" will be used from 1 November 1993 upon commencement of the Migration Reform Act 1992 to describe all non-citizens unlawfully in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Q3:Is it not a fact that the wording is so wide that the personal information of people other than the illegal entrant or overstayer could be supplied under the provision?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A3:See A1 and A2. The wording of the paragraph is confined to "persons who are unlawfully in Australia".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Q4:Will the Government amend the legislation to ensure that only information relating to the illegal entrant under investigation can be divulged?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A4:Based on A3, the need to amend the legislation is not warranted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Q5:The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs Media Release of 17 December 1992 specifically states "DILGEA will not have access to tax file numbers (TFNs) under these arrangements." Does the legislation ensure that the officers of DILGEA cannot have access to TFNs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Q6:Why doesn't the legislation specifically prohibit the provision of TFNs?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Q7:Will the Government amend the legislation to ensure that TFNs cannot be provided?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A5-7:There is no need to amend clause 15 of the Bill to specifically prohibit DIEA officers having access to TFNs. The reason being is that sections 8WA and 8WB of the Taxation Administration Act 1953 prohibit the recording, requesting, disclosure and use of a person's TFN in unauthorised circumstances. DIEA officers are not authorised to request, receive or use TFNs.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example, quotation of TFNs may be a precondition to receiving any Commonwealth income support payment. Such a payment would include payments by the Departments of Social Security; Veterans Affairs; Employment, Education and Training. Use of TFNs for that purpose are specifically authorised by sections 8WA and 8WB.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Q8:How does an illegal entrant to Australia obtain a TFN? Does the Tax Office check that the applicant is entitled to work in Australia? lf yes, what is the procedure? If not, why not?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A8:An illegal entrant applies for a TFN in the same way as other taxpayers using a TFN application/enquiry form. Subsection 202BA(2) of the Assessment Act provides that the Commissioner may refuse the application if he is not satisfied as to the applicants true identity. There is no legislative provision to allow the ATO to check whether the applicant is entitled to work in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Further, the Commissioner is unable to refuse to issue a TFN on grounds of nationality, residency or work status. Where an overseas passport is given as one of the proof of identity documents, the currency of the visa is checked. If the visa has expired, the passport is not accepted as a valid proof of identity document for TFN application purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Q9:Why doesn't clause 15 also allow the provision of information in respect of contravention of visa requirements?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A9:At this stage, the Government considers that a priority in establishing an information sharing arrangement between the ATO and DIEA is to permit information sharing for the purpose of identifying and locating persons unlawfully in Australia. Any proposal to extend the arrangement to include those persons working in breach of their visa conditions will be examined in the light of the experience with this arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">As explained in A8, overseas passports with expired visas are not accepted as valid proof of identity. The Tax Office does not take details of expired visas or of persons tendering such documents.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Q10:Is it the Government's intention to amend the law in the future so as to allow the provision of information to the Secretary of DILGEA concerning contravention of visa requirements?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A10:Not at this stage. See also A9 above.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Q11:Could the Minister please give an indicative statement of how this provision would be used in practice? That is, what information would be provided by DILGEA to the Tax Office, what would the Tax Office do with the information, what enquiries and procedures would the Tax Office then undertake, what information would then be provided to DILGEA by the Tax Office?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A11:The provision, enabling exchange of information between the Commissioner and DIEA, is expected to work in practice as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">DIEA information in respect of overstayers without an application or review pending (ie; those persons who have already breached the Immigration Act) will be supplied to the Tax Office; and</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The information to be returned by the Tax Office to DIEA will be limited to residential and employment addresses of those overstayers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As people can see from these answers, the question of access to tax file numbers is specifically dealt with at length. It will not be lawful for the Taxation Office to provide a person's tax file number under this provision. The answers specifically state that the information to be provided by the Taxation Office is limited to the residential and employment addresses of the overstayers. Considering that these people are already in breach of the law, we believe that this is not an unreasonable proposal. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will deal with the issues relating to privacy in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993, which is before the committee at the moment. This Bill enables the tax commissioner to divulge certain names and addresses to the Secretary to the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and this raises certain privacy questions. The Taxation Laws Amendment Bill 1993 that has been put aside for a few minutes while we attend to drafting provisions, had a not dissimilar provision in that it provided the furnishing of information by the Tax Office to the Criminal Justice Commission of Queensland.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal that the Liberal Party put forward was that the Government should introduce complementary legislation so that the privacy commissioner would audit such activities, possibly on a random basis, and be satisfied as to who got the information and how the information was used. Despite the tightness of the guidelines under section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act and section 3 of the Tax Administration Act, there is the niggling problem of privacy. The legislation would be more complete if, in the next parliamentary session, the Minister saw fit to introduce amendments to the privacy legislation. Many people in the community have concerns about the possibility of fishing operations by bodies which may have access to this information&mdash;and the list is growing over time&mdash;and I acknowledge these concerns and this interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the Government to please consider introducing, in the next parliamentary session, appropriate amendments to the privacy legislation to give adequate power and direction to the privacy commissioner. It is perhaps inherent within the generic application of his power to possibly do this auditing, but there is some doubt about it. I think we should be a little more specific in relation to tax issues, particularly relating to privacy. We should amend the privacy legislation to ensure that the privacy commissioner has the power and responsibility to see who uses the information and how it is used. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am opposed to section 15 of the legislation which proposes to amend section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act by allowing the Commissioner of Taxation to provide the immigration department with employment and residential address details of illegal immigrants. I am opposed to this amendment for at least two reasons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First and foremost is that it is a dreadful precedent. It has been the proud boast of the Taxation Office that it went about its business, and its business was the  collection of tax, and nothing would prevent its pursuit of the collection of tax. It has not been, so far as I know, able to disclose to other agencies information relating to taxpayers which it has for its particular purposes. I think that was well and truly understood by taxpayers, whether they were illegal or legal. It was understood by those illegal immigrants who were working who, at least in those circumstances, were paying their taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hasten to say that I have no truck with illegal immigrants. The activity of the immigration department in attempting to track down persons who are illegally outstaying their visas and are illegally in Australia is quite worth while. But that is not the point here. The point is that this legislation requires the Australian Taxation Office to provide this sort of information to the immigration department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reason that I am concerned is that this amendment could well result in some adverse consequences for the labour market, particularly so far as other workers are concerned. I referred to this in the second reading debate. I had hoped that the Government would provide some analysis to this chamber of the ultimate impact of this proposal, having regard to the questions that I raised during the second reading stage, but we have not been provided with any research by, for example, the Bureau of Labour Market Research into the possible impact of this provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe there is every reason to think that this measure will create a large pool of illegal immigrant labour, completely outside the protection of industrial award systems or any workplace agreements. At present, without fear of detection, such illegal immigrants can pay their taxes, obtain a tax file number, provide it to the employer and have pay-as-you-earn deductions made each week. That money goes into the coffers of the Australian Government. What will be the result of this measure in that respect? Has the Government considered the possibility that it will create a pool of illegal immigrant labour?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This pool of exploitable labour may well be used to undermine employment conditions for ordinary Australian workers, just as farm labour in American States such as California has operated to undercut employment conditions generally. I referred to this matter in my speech in the second reading debate. I do not want to labour that point or remind honourable senators about the history and the struggles of the trade union movement in California against this problem of illegal, non-taxpaying immigrants, but I feel that we are entitled to an explanation or an analysis from the Government as to whether it has considered these unintended consequences. There are other aspects, of course; for example, the health dangers in respect of illegal itinerant labour in the United States. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do feel that the Government should have referred this legislation for consideration by the Department of Industrial Relations or the Bureau of Labour Market Research, to give just a couple of examples, to see what possible effect and unintended consequence this proposal might have. But ultimately I am opposed to the proposition because I believe that it is just the thin end of the wedge whereby the Taxation Office can be used by other agencies and other government authorities to obtain personal information of taxpayers which otherwise they would not be able to obtain. </PARA>

They are matters that I am prepared to continue to look at. They are not within my direct area of responsibility now as I am no longer directly responsible for the Government's tax policy. But I will draw Senator Watson's request for consideration of further legislation to the attention of both the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) and the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear). I would be interested, as Senator Watson is, to know whether the Privacy Commissioner is concerned about these provisions and, if so, what response there is. So I will draw Senator Watson's concerns to the attention of those individuals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From time to time, and perhaps somewhat recently, Senator Harradine and I have had disagreements. Although I do not agree with the conclusions he has come to, the points which he made in the second part certainly raise a very important question which needs to be taken very seriously. I do not, on balance, share the conclusion. But, if an unintended consequence of this legislation were of the type which he described and of any significant size, it would be an unwelcome exacerbation of a problem we already have in Australia at the moment on a somewhat small scale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are all aware that already there are people working in Australia who are outside the tax and industrial relations systems of the country. There have been attempts to crack down on that type of thing. In my period as Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer I think the group of people who came to see me who received the least sympathy were, in effect&mdash;without, of course, disclosing any details&mdash;representatives of employers who had been raided because they were employing some of these people. That did not seem to evoke much concern with me or anybody else I could find. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So I take very seriously the point that Senator Harradine raises. It is something we would need to give attention to. But we also need to consider the consequences of not acting in this matter. I know Senator Harradine is not neglecting that. He is saying that on balance he thinks the risk is too great to take. I understand that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">From the Government's point of view, the standard arrangement for any proposal such as this to amend legislation&mdash;and I was not in the Cabinet at the time this decision was made&mdash;would be that it is distributed for coordination comment and sent to both the Department of Industrial Relations and the department of employment to see if they had concerns which would warrant not proceeding with legislation of this sort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, even if I knew, I could not bring here all the details of whatever concerns they may have raised. I am simply saying that the opportunity for those concerns to be raised is provided in the process. If the concerns were raised, the Cabinet obviously made a decision, on balance, to proceed. There would be a number of people, not least of whom was the then Minister for Industrial Relations, who would have been aware of the same sorts of issues as those which Senator Harradine raises and about which I am concerned because of his experiences with some of the issues that we are both aware of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not, in any way, minimise the significance of the issue; I just come down, on balance, on the other side. I do have some disagreement with Senator Harradine on the thin end of the wedge argument. I do not want to minimise the significance of any extension of the provisions of section 16 of the Act which enables people to receive information from the Taxation Office. But, in a very limited, careful way, over the years there has been a limited extension of the capacity of this information to be used in very tightly controlled ways for narrowly defined purposes, and this is consistent with that. Section 16 designates the individuals and the circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year some members of the Parliament argued that in a couple of examples we had not extended this provision far enough&mdash;I am not saying Senator Harradine did; I cannot remember how he voted. It is always a difficult issue to decide when there is pressure to pursue evident criminality and concerns about the mechanism. Of course, the tax Act is not the only place where that conflict arises. It arises in the area of phone tapping and all sorts of other issues, which I do not want to raise. We have to be very vigilant in ensuring that the balance does not go too far in terms of invasion of civil liberties of the citizen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the reasons that have been outlined by the Government, but perhaps more effectively or comprehensively outlined in response to the questions raised at the committee and by the Democrats, I think the balance of the argument is in favour of this limited extension. Therefore, although I understand Senator Harradine's concerns, I believe that we should proceed with the proposed section. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I turn to part 2 of the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) and refer to the extension of fringe benefits tax exemptions on child care. Quite clearly, I support the extension of the exemptions. As I mentioned in my speech at the second reading stage, the law regarding child care expenses and taxation is totally illogical. Child care paid for by a salary sacrifice arranged between the employee and the employer is a tax-free fringe benefit. To the extent that this Bill extends that, I support it. But an employee is not allowed a deduction for his or her child care expenses.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that the committee stage of this Bill is not the time to go into the full detail of the tax treatment of employee child care expenses. Nonetheless, there are anomalies in the fringe benefits tax legislation. This is the time to raise those anomalies, and I have raised them. I would like answers from the Minister in respect of some of these anomalies. The first anomaly to which I draw attention again is the definition of `child care facility' in section 136(1) of the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act. The definition excludes child care provided by an associate and excludes care at the place of residence of any of the children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apparently, it is okay provided the children are taken out of the home and cared for somewhere else. That is an anomaly. It is a very strange situation. It is not difficult either to see that this could create problems. For example, if the rules of the family day care scheme were altered to allow a day carer to care for the children of an employee in that employee's home, that would not be an exempt fringe benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know of one employee and employer. The employer is willing, because of the circumstances of the situation, to pay for a proportion of the payment required by a child carer. The wife of the employee is at home and clearly needs assistance. That assistance is now being provided by the employee having to take time off to go home during working hours. That employee is a very valued employee and the employer wants to rectify this situation by providing a payment for a day carer and it would be better in all of the circumstances for the children to be cared for in their own home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand, of course, the problems relating to the Government's guidelines on family day care schemes, and that is another issue that we will have to take up at some other stage. But if that issue were resolved, then the legislation that we are considering now would not exempt that payment from tax under the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There should be, in my view, an amendment to this legislation which would alleviate or eliminate that anomaly. I further believe there should be an amendment to the legislation to avoid any difficulty which might be caused by the former exclusion of children over six years of age. The removal of that restriction is consistent with the Government's objective of extending the exemption for child care to after school care for school children. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Another logical reform in this area would be to extend the exemption generally to any form of child care, whether formal or informal, and I ask the Minister whether the Government is considering such an arrangement. We should not presume to tie family child-care arrangements to any particular bureaucratic form and we are doing that here. The definition in the legislation with which we are dealing will discriminate against those employers who pay for child care for children in the home of the employee. I would like to hear what the Minister has to say about that and how the Government can justify such an anomalous situation. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The object of clause 8 of the Bill is to repeal section 78 of the Income Tax Assessment Act and substitute a `more readable version'. I do not believe that the provisions are any more readable. In fact, I feel that they are less so because they have no inherent logic. In terms of taxation theory, all gifts to charity ought to be deductible. Charities serve social and public purposes just as much as public spending programs do. If income is redistributed voluntarily within society, the demand on government programs is so much the less. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also note that section 78 is listed by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) as a tax expenditure or subsidy. That is nonsense. All section 78 does is allow deductibility to PAYE taxpayers for gifts to some selected charities. Taxpayers with income from property do not need section 78 to make tax effective gifts to charity. They can either gift property to charity, carrying the income with it, or pass the income from property through a trust to their favourite charity. Rather than being a tax expenditure, section 78 simply creates a level playing field between income from personal exertion and income from property with regard to its redistribution for charitable purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because the gift provisions as redrafted are so complex, we ought to consider a simple amendment to save taxpayers the trouble of reading them. We ought to consider replacing the proposed section 78(4) with a general deduction for charitable gifts, as in the United States of America. Section 78 should provide a level playing field for all charities and all taxpayers and not be subject to the whims of a particular government of a particular day amending a particular Act such as this. All gifts to charity should be equally deductible for all taxpayers. </PARA>

It is not very often that I disagree with Senator Harradine, but I think I am right in my interpretation that it is not for the child minding.

It was not rushed through the Senate's normal processes, but normally honourable senators feel they get a bit more time because the Bill has gone through the House of Representatives and had a few days there before it gets here. In terms of the proper management of the business, this was the correct place to introduce this Bill. In some ways it has improved the management of Senate business but it has caused a minor consequential problem.

<PARA>In order to make it absolutely clear, I point out that it is an amendment to Senator Watson's amendment. It would not otherwise make sense but it does not say that explicitly here, so I want to make it clear for the record, for the information of honourable senators and for interpretive purposes, that the word `substituted' is the word as it occurs in Senator Watson's amendment. All we are doing is changing the words that are inserted in place of those. We are agreed about the words being omitted; we are changing the words to be substituted. I think that this will meet my category one and category two issue&mdash;which those of us who were here for the rather arcane debate we had earlier will understand and the rest will follow if it causes them concern subsequently. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Government and the Australian Taxation Office for their support for the thrust of our amendment. The retrospective element will certainly be taken away. However, there will be no loss to the revenue as a result of the Government's amendment to our amendment. I think this is a perfectly good way of achieving the objective of taking away retrospectivity but making sure that taxpayers cannot take advantage of the position by amending their returns. I think the addition of the words `in respect of returns lodged before 1 May 1993 and for which the taxpayer has not subsequently sought any amendment of the assessment in this respect' adequately covers the case. I thank the Minister, and I think we have a better Bill as a result.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I apologise to the committee and to Senator Watson. I have slightly misled the committee and Senator Watson. Everybody who was involved knows that we approached this amendment in a bit of a rush. In my haste I have slightly misread the section which we are amending. The word `substituted' in the amendment which I have moved does not flow from Senator Watson's words; it flows from clause 40 on page 19 of the Bill. So it actually does read literally. I looked at what I thought was clause 40 on page 19, but I could not find the word `substituted'. In fact, the last word of line 26 on page 19 is `substituted'. The wording of the amendment as distributed is correct, but my previous explanation was not, and I apologise for that.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want some explanations regarding clauses 46 and 47. At the hearing of the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration last Friday, it might be recalled that I tabled some draft amendments relating to the capital gains proposals introduced into this Bill. The first of those amendments concerned the application date of the amendments to remove a number of potential anomalies in capital gains provisions to prevent double taxation. Of course, those amendments are most welcome. However, I have a problem in relation to clause 47 of the Bill which restricts the application of the amendments to assets `created after 25 June 1992'. This does have a very narrow application.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder whether that word `created' was fully intended or whether it was disposed of. Because the problem that I have is that if the Government is to insist on the word `created' the Government is effectively recognising that these changes are consequential upon the changes to the catch-all provisions in capital gains under section 160M(6) and (7). It would appear that it will have a very restrictive application in terms of eligible termination payments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is said in the application clause in this drafted form should have been said in the substantive provisions. This gives rise to some difficulties that taxpayers are likely to encounter. If we are to make changes which have such a fundamental restrictive nature they should be in the substantive provisions of the legislation rather than in just the application clauses. We recognise that it has a concessionary application but, if one reads sections 45 and 46 prior to 47, one will see that the application is so narrow that one will wonder why it was put in, quite frankly. It will not have much application at present; perhaps it will in the future. Perhaps this word `created' should be further examined in the light of my comments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clauses 52 to 56 propose a number of amendments to 160ZZO capital gains rollover rules for assets transferred within company groups. The amendments represent the Government's fifth attempt, I must say, at getting section 160ZZO right, and it is not right yet. The amendments are intended to overcome a number of anomalies under the current version of section 160ZZO. Naturally, the Opposition supports these in principle for that reason. But the problem I wish to submit now is that the amendments introduce a further anomaly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the new section 160ZZO(a) a deemed disposal will occur where an asset has been rolled over within a subgroup of companies and the subgroup leaves a wider group. Under the present rules, no deemed disposal would generally occur in this situation. If we look at the real world, perhaps this could be intended to cover a situation such as the Adelaide Steamship Co. Ltd where there is a rollover provision and where Woolworths will soon come out on its own. I think one could have the worst of all worlds where the rolled over asset could finish up in Woolworths and capital gains tax would still be paid, which would be quite ridiculous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this point I think the problem raises a number of complex technical issues, so it will not be easy. I have sought some assistance from Price Waterhouse in Melbourne and, as such, produced a redraft of section 160ZZO(a) that I believe could eliminate the problem. We tabled the proposed redraft of the section at the hearing of the finance and public administration committee last Friday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point of my contribution now, and I would like Senator McMullan to reiterate, is that he then advised me that the Government would not support the amendments&mdash;so we did not press them&mdash;but he gave an undertaking that the matter would be examined during the winter recess with a view to introducing further amendments to resolve the issue early in the Budget session. I think it is appropriate that we reintroduce them at this stage. While it is with some reluctance that I accept the Government's proposal, I am sure that the additional technical resources the Government can bring to bear on this problem, with its technical advisers and others, will be of some benefit. My reluctance in accepting the Government's proposal on this is that the Tax Office has had the problem for some time, perhaps dating back to some time in April&mdash;something like five weeks ago. Given that this afternoon we were able to execute expeditiously the amendments, the taxation office should perhaps have directed its mind to this issue a little earlier. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More fundamentally, I wish to draw to the attention of the Minister the fact that the amendments apply from 16 December 1992. Almost one year will have elapsed by the time the Government further considers this matter during the Budget session and introduces the legislation. Therefore, the amendments I tabled on Friday would not have had an adverse impact on taxpayers, but they would prevent the inappropriate application of the deemed disposable rules under section 160ZZOA as proposed by this Bill to subgroups of companies. I, therefore, seek an assurance from the Minister that any further amendments introduced during the Budget session to correct the anomaly of the subgroups will apply, preferably from 16 December 1992. I thank the Minister for his previous assurance and I hope he does not mind my seeking it again in this particular forum. </PARA>

I appreciate that national interests are involved, particularly in this case, but I feel we need to keep an eye on the way that we just spend $2 million or $3 million. In this instance we spent that money without any apparent expectation that it would ever be repaid. If it is foreign aid that we are giving and we make the decision openly as part of our foreign aid program, that is one thing. We can all look at it that way. I appreciate that this fund is set up for what one might call unusual types of investments where the national interests are involved, but I still think we have to be careful of the taxpayers' money that we spend.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have a fairly extensive brief on this matter which I read earlier this evening. I will give Senator Ferguson this information because it will obviously answer his question and it may give him more information than he asked for. I will give him all of the information I have before me.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In October 1992 the Minister for Finance agreed to make an act of grace payment of $3,904,531.30c to Queensland Alumina Ltd, commonly known as QAL. This amount represented the interest on customs duty paid under protest on imports of crude oil. The duty, amounting to $28 million, was refunded following resolutions of a related tariff classification issue in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The tariff classification dispute centred on whether imports of oil where topped crude duty free or fuel oil dutiable. QAL imported 14 shipments of oil from the United States between 1986 and 1988 and paid duty under protest of $28 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In July 1987, QAL agreed, at the request of the Australian Customs Service, to defer its AAT appeal pending the outcome of a related AAT case concerning Savage River Mines, which are located in Tasmania. Following an AAT decision in September of 1987, that imports by the Savage River Mines from the United States were not dutiable, the ACS appealed to the Federal Court, which accepted the ACS case, and referred the matter back to AAT for re-examination.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In February 1989 the AAT decided in favour of Savage River Mines and the company undertook action in the New South Wales Supreme Court to recover the duty paid plus interest. In October 1989 the Supreme Court directed the duty of $296,000 and interest of $196,000 be paid to Savage River Mines by ACS. ACS advised QAL on 17 March 1989 that refunds would be paid subject to evidence being produced that the QAL product was the same as that considered in the AAT. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following the Savage River Mines Supreme Court decisions, the ACS obtained refining history details of the oil imports by QAL, to assess whether the goods accorded with those in the Savage River Mines case. This was confirmed by mid-1990. It took some time for QAL to produce the evidence and the $28 million duty payment under protest was refunded in total by June 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ACS has recognised the opportunity for QAL to pursue separate legal action in a State Supreme Court for payments of refunds plus interest, so it therefore moved quickly, within 10 days, to pay the refunds once the evidence was produced. Supreme Court actions preclude claims for interest except as part of a judgment for payment of a principal sum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In response to representations by QAL in early 1990, ACS advised that there was no provision in the customs legislation to pay interest on the duty refunded. QAL subsequently appealed to the Ombudsman in September 1990. The Ombudsman recognised in February 1991 that an ex gratia payment should be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The then Minister for Finance, after considering a report from a committee comprising the Secretary of the Department of Finance, the Secretary of the Department Administrative Services and the Comptroller-General of Customs, decided in October of 1992 that an ex gratia payment of $3.9 million should be made to QAL for interest forgone. The amount of $3.9 million interest was assessed by the Ombudsman in June 1991 after considering claims by QAL and Customs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interest reflects the lower end of the interest range&mdash;12.5 per cent was the midpoint of 12 to 13 per cent, which is used consistently by the Queensland Supreme Court&mdash;and there was a shorter period of application, with interest paid only on the period from payment of duty under protest to 17 March 1989, the date ACS agreed to pay refunds. It should be noted that the rate of interest being applied by the New South Wales Supreme Court at the time was 19.5 to 21 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a separate development, Savage River Mines, also known as Dahlia Mining Co., appealed to the AAT concerning imports of oil from New Zealand in December 1987. In June 1991 the AAT accepted the ACS view that it was fuel oil and dutiable at $600,000. This was successfully appealed to the Federal Court, which held that the duty be refunded. In a subsequent related action in the New South Wales Supreme Court in August 1992, Dahlia Mining was awarded $454,000 interest on the duty paid. Notwithstanding those cases, the ACS moved in February 1989, following the initial AAT case, to put the tariff classification issue beyond doubt by amending the customs regulations. Since then, topped crude oil can be imported duty free only if it is used as refined feedstock. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have to make a correction on behalf of Senator Schacht: it has not been paid into court yet. Therefore, obviously the question Senator Macdonald asks cannot be answered. On behalf of Senator Schacht, I indicate, as Senator Macdonald is aware, that at Estimates Committee E on 11 May the committee was informed that $1 million had been paid into court in the course of litigation commenced by Skywest Aviation Pty Ltd v.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am informed by officers that it was paid in yesterday.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has now been determined that the money has not been paid into court as yet; rather, the administrative processes for the making of the payment are under way.

I think we can certainly indicate that as soon as that payment is made the department will inform Senator Macdonald. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The term `payment into court' does not require an actual disbursement by the Commonwealth; but, pending the completion of the case, the payment is in the form of a bond. As such, the Commonwealth is assuming a contingent liability, and the amount in question is being sought through the additional estimates process. The statement was based on erroneous advice to the Minister by agency officers owing to their understanding of the progress of the administrative aspect of the proceedings at the time. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In response to questions from Senator Sowada (see page E24 of Estimates Committee E Hansard of 11 May 1993), Professor Garnett has unintentionally given the Committee incorrect information. In relation to the fire which occurred on 13 November 1992 in ANSTO's plasma laboratory in a wing of Building 3, the answer was given that the fire was "a long way away" from Building 56. In answering this question, there was confusion between Building 56 and Building 53, another of the seventy-odd buildings on the ANSTO site. Building 53 is a long way away from the plasma laboratory. However Building 56 is, at its closest distance, approximately seven metres from the plasma laboratory in Building 3, across a roadway. The distance of the actinide suite in Building 56 from the fire, a question raised by Senator Sowada, is some fifty metres. The confusion between Building 56 and Building 53 is regretted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator Sowada's question was cast in the context of "adjacent areas" mentioned in the supplementary estimates as being affected by the fire. Building 56 was not one of these "adjacent areas" and was not in any way affected by or threatened by the fire. No radioactive material was involved or likely to have been involved in the fire and the health of ANSTO staff and nearby residents was at no stage put at risk by the fire.</PARA>

<PARA>As I said earlier, this confusion between building 56 and building 53 is certainly regretted. I find it amazing that Professor Garnett was able to sit in estimates and rabbit on about the fact that building 56 was miles away or, to paraphrase her, a long way away from building 3 where the fire occurred when, as I mentioned earlier, building 56 is mentioned no less than six times in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. It is an extremely regrettable error. Quite frankly, I am at a loss to understand how this misunderstanding could have taken place. I would have thought that Professor Garnett, as a senior official from ANSTO, would have had a very clear idea and understanding of the layout of the ANSTO site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The day after the estimates hearing, I went to my office and was handed a map of the ANSTO facility from which I discovered that, lo and behold, building 56 is literally just around the corner from the building in which the fire occurred. So I am very unhappy about this. I am very pleased that this error has been rectified. It is very unfortunate for ANSTO that it is seen to have misled the committee or at least given incorrect information to a line of questioning in Senate estimates. As I said earlier, ANSTO is the last government authority that can afford to do this. </PARA>

If answers are given to individual senators and they refer to answers given to others, I have asked that we be given copies of those answers. In the answer given to me on how the marine strategy for the Torres Strait would proceed, there is an amount of some $452,000 which was going to be spent enhancing `the role of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island communities in marine conservation'. It is indicated that an amount of $40,000 was spent. It was provided to the island coordinating council on 5 June 1992 and it has been acquitted as required. Funds were spent on:  consultants, travel, administration and data processing.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">May 1993</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last week, I informed the Senate the secretary of my department had asked Professor Dennis Pearce to review two reports being undertaken in the department in relation to the MDS tender process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Professor Pearce was asked to report by today. He has done so.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Professor Pearce was asked to address the following questions&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.Is the material prepared by the two Deputy Secretaries sufficiently well researched and considered to support the accounts provided by them of events relating to the MDS tender process?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.Why were the ministerial determinations of 1 October 1992 and 7 January 1993 inconsistent with the Government's policy intentions, and the reasons for the discrepancies between the ministerial determination and the invitation to tender?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.What was the extent and timing of advice to the minister on the "technical deficiencies"?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.Were the judgements made by the secretary and his officers in relation to the handling of the "technical deficiencies" issue in the perth court proceedings reasonable in the circumstances? was it reasonable for the department and the Minister to assume that the court order of 7 april enabled them to continue the tender process?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In line with my undertaking, I now propose to table three reports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They are a report by each of the deputy secretaries of the department of transport and communications on aspects of the MDS tender process and Professor Pearce's report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Professor Pearce has scrutinised and analysed the other two reports, in line with his terms of reference. The reports themselves include a range of attachments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, I am tabling further papers which are relevant to the MDS tender issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In tabling these reports, however, I wish to inform the senate I have received legal advice from the Attorney-General's Department.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Certain matters canvassed in these reports raise questions of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">sub judice</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will also table copies of advice from the attorney-general's department on this point.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reports have been prepared in the context of legal advice provided by senior counsel, Roger Gyles QC, and the Attorney-General's Department.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The advice was to the effect the invitation to tender which initiated the MDS tender process was invalid. That advice has already been tabled in the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The validity of the invitation to tender is now the subject of further proceedings in the Federal Court in Perth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That is, the proposition of law upon which each of these reports is based is now <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">sub judice</EMPHASIS>.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable senators will be aware of the usual practice of this chamber is that matters which are <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">sub judice</EMPHASIS> should not be debated in this place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have given consideration to whether or not it would be possible, in conformity with that practice, to table the reports with the excision of all <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">sub judice</EMPHASIS> material.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have concluded, however, that such limited tabling would not be in the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Excisions of this nature would render the reports difficult to read and potentially misleading.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This would not assist senators to come to grips with the facts of this matter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have concluded it is in the public interest that each of the reports be tabled in unexpurgated form.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But I take this opportunity to draw attention to the fact that each of these reports presumes the correctness of, and is built upon, assertions of law which are now before the Federal Court&mdash;that is, the question of whether or not the invitation to tender was valid in law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I hope that honourable senators, in debate on these reports, will be suitably guarded in their remarks in accordance with the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">sub judice</EMPHASIS> principle.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To meet the timing requested by the Senate I am tabling reports which include one completed only early this afternoon. I would hope that honourable senators themselves will read and weigh up the voluminous amount of material before them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In terms of my own knowledge and involvement, Professor Pearce's findings clearly refer to the period of the court order which was dated 7 April 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will be quite clear from cross-referencing paragraph 48 of Professor Pearce's report with paragraphs 23, 27 and 31 of Ms Goode's report; as well as from paragraphs 37 and 51 of Professor Pearce's report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The matter is set out clearly in paragraph 83 on page 22 of the report from Mr Hutchinson, Deputy Secretary, Communications.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It reads:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"At no stage was there any material put before the Minister that could have led him to question whether the process he was being asked to authorise was flawed or invalid. On the basis of the information provided and the advice and assurances given and within the usual practices of the department, the Minister was entitled to assume that he had been fully and properly advised, and that the course that he was being advised to adopt was sound and had been thoroughly validated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The following paragraph was also important in terms of certain comment which has been made in relation to the secretary of the department.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It reads:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The secretary had limited personal involvement in the process. It was quite appropriate in the circumstances for the secretary to believe that the one document that he was asked to approve formally had been subject to careful and rigorous senior level clearance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Hutchinson points out that there was no single reason for the problems that arose with the tender process but I will leave honourable senators to consider the reasons from their own reading of his report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do however wish to draw on one paragraph from the report by Professor Pearce which raises a central issue which has been the subject of considerable comment both inside and outside of this chamber.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It goes to questions surrounding the decision taken by the secretary and his officers not to put the validity of the invitation to tender into question before the Federal Court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Professor Pearce has pointed out that senior legal counsel did not wish to do so and advised that it was not essential to winning the case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Professor Pearce has concluded that despite this, the decision has proved to be a tactical error.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He then states:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"In retrospect, it is apparent that the possible odium of reliance upon its own error should have been risked by the department, in order to make certain that the tender process was brought to an end.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">That this was not done was a tactical error, but I do not consider that it was one that should attract any condemnation of the officers who made it.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">They were being advised of the likely outcome of the case by experienced and distinguished counsel.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">They were entitled to rely on their counsel for advice on how best to run the case.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I consider that the decisions taken by the secretary and his officers were reasonable in the circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">I do not believe that they were taken in order to avoid criticism or somehow to take advantage at a later time of the defect in the gazette notice. The department has not tried to conceal its worries about the `technical deficiencies' in the invitation to tender.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conclusion I would draw your attention again to the letter to me from the secretary of my department which I tabled yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the transmittal letter from the secretary of my department, Mr Evans informed me that Professor Pearce had made a number of suggestions for improving some aspects of the operation of the department in the course of his report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He has advised that all of these will be implemented.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Evans has already advised in his letter to me yesterday that some steps are already being taken to address problems identified in both the MDS and satellite pay tv tender processes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now wish to join Mr Evans in placing on record my appreciation for the work that has been undertaken by Professor Pearce to an extremely tight timetable to enable the parliament to have the benefit of the reports of his two inquiries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I also wish to note the comprehensive and frank reports compiled by the two senior officers of the department under very difficult circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I agree with Professor Pearce's analysis of these reports at page 5 and 6 of his report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In reference to Mr Hutchinson's report, Professor Pearce says at paragraph 18:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Mr Hutchinson's discussion of the procedures followed in the preparation of the MDS determinations and invitation to tender was, as he put it, a `warts and all' description.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"It certainly glosses nothing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In respect of Ms Goode's report, I can do no better than quote paragraph 20 from the report of Professor Pearce:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">it reads:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Ms Goode's chronology effectively summarises the events that followed the notice purporting to revoke the invitation to tender.</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"I do not consider that any additional supporting documents need to be annexed to that chronology to elucidate those events.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I now table the three reports and commend them to the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I also table the documents referred to in the reports, as well as documents created after the period covered by the reports, and coming within the terms of the Senate's resolution of 19 May 1993.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Mr Hutchinson</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Federal Court challenge to the proposed abrogation of the current MDS tender licence process</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to your letter of yesterday to Mr S. Skehill, Deputy Secretary raising several questions for advice in consequence of the orders made last Friday evening in the Federal Court proceedings (No. WAG 68 of 1993) brought by Australian Capital Equity Pty Ltd (`ACE') challenging the proposed abrogation of the current MDS tender licence process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In this letter I address the first issue raised in your letter. In view of the fact that the Federal Court has set down the central question of the validity of the tender process for expedited hearing, you seek my advice on the risks to the Commonwealth's substantive interests that might arise from the proposed tabling in the Parliament later this week of your report to the Secretary and of Professor Pearce's associated report. You note your concern to ensure that nothing is done that would breach <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">sub judice</EMPHASIS> rules or that would amount to a contempt of court.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will confine my advice to risks of a legal character in relation to your report. I have not been provided with a copy of Professor Pearce's report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Your report addresses, amongst other things, the question of whether the Invitation to Tender complies with the Minister's determination. This same issue arises for determination by the Federal Court in proceedings WAG 68 of 1993. The law with respect to publications having a capacity to interfere with the course of justice, in particular in civil proceedings, is less severe where there will be no jury involved in considering the issues. There will be no jury in the case to which I have referred. Notwithstanding this, there is English authority which would probably be followed in Australia to the effect that a newspaper article containing material in the nature of pre-judgment of a case is capable of constituting a contempt of Court:  see <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Attorney-General v. Times Newspapers </EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ltd (The Sunday Times Case) </EMPHASIS>[1974]AC 273. The privileges of Parliament and its status are such that the tabling of material within the Parliament would not be a contempt of Court. However, where material, which if published elsewhere than in Parliament, would constitute a contempt, is published in Parliament, a question arises as to the operation of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">sub judice</EMPHASIS> rule. This is elaborated below. Should your Minister wish not to publish within the Parliament material which, if published elsewhere, could give rise to a contempt, we could examine the material and indicate the deletions to be made to comply with that wish.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No proceedings in Parliament can be questioned in a court <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Parliamentary Privileges Act 1987 s.16). </EMPHASIS>Therefore the Minister is exposed to no risk of legal sanction by tabling any document in the Senate. (The Senate's procedures as set out in Standing Orders do not prohibit reference to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">sub judice</EMPHASIS> matters, though in practice the Senate does observe a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">sub judice</EMPHASIS> rule. However, on occasion it has debated matters which may have been <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">sub judice </EMPHASIS>where it was of the view that it was in the public interest to do so.)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only other risk of a legal character in tabling the report which I can foresee is the possible disclosure of confidential information which may be contained in it. To the extent that you were aware that the report did contain confidential information, the confidential information should be removed from any version of the report to be tabled, or only be tabled with the prior consent of the person or persons entitled to waive confidentiality in the information.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Henry Lawson wrote of `noble and heroic endeavour frowned down or callously neglected'. There is no greater example of this than the Government's treatment of rural families who depend on the wool industry for their livelihood. There is such determination to hang on in the face of such adversity; there is such weariness and disappointment; there is an abundant contempt and wilful deception shown in the Government's response.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of every parliament in the country have described the trauma facing rural Australia and called for action. Last November, when the RAS Bills were before the Senate, I explained the inadequacy of RAS to reach more than a minority of growers. Yet the Government was not moved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The media has introduced the plight of many rural families to city people through detailed coverage of what life is like battling drought, low commodity prices and the hangover of high interest rates. The Government moved a little. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Simon Crean, eventually returned from holiday to do a drought quickie tour. This resulted in a bandaid assistance package and the appointment of the Pied Piper of economic rationalists, Professor Garnaut, to weave a second dry spell over the future of the wool industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is six months since the RAS Bills were debated; the drought is six months older; the wool price has dropped another 40c; and poverty sits at many more rural tables. The Minister charged in on his white horse and distributed a limited largess, but the problems are greater now than ever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Rural Adjustment Scheme Advisory Council, after an overwhelming response to its deliberations, has made its report to the Minister, which he has refused to release. The Minister has seen with his own eyes the damage done by drought, low prices, falling asset values and high debt. He knows, he has seen, but he is not unduly moved, judging by his response. He must have a heart like the biblical pharaoh who would not release the Israelites from bondage. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have seen shoddy treatment of various groups in the community by the Government, but never have I seen such callous disregard and neglect of an enormous problem, and never have I seen such plain hustling when it comes to selling the Government's response. The Government's response to the wool industry is one of minimum comprehension of the problem, minimum effort to address it and maximum PR to camouflage it. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To those who accuse me of overreacting, to those who think the April wool package dotted all the i's and crossed the t's, let me make a number of points clear. Six months ago the Minister's office provided me with the following figures which, together with other documents, I seek leave to table. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YE4">Senator BOSWELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the time, there were 15,000 farmers receiving some RAS assistance. The Government estimated that by the end of the financial year 6,000 to 7,000 farmers would finish their contracts, but this would be offset by 3,000 to 4,000 new entrants. In line with that reasoning, the Government has confirmed this week that there are now 11,500 farmers on RAS. That is a drop of 3,500 people. That means that 7,000 farmers, as predicted, no longer receive RAS.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has happened to those farmers? Have they survived? How are they living now? The Government simply does not know. It does not have the information, and I tried unsuccessfully at the last two estimates hearings to find out. The Government does not know how many of these 7,000 farmers have left the rural sector, how many have managed to stay on without RAS, or how many reapplied to RAS and were knocked back because they were no longer viable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has no mechanism in place to determine what has happened to half of RAS's needy clientele and this is a huge black hole in the system. How can a government make effective policy without knowing the effects of this policy?  Last Friday the Minister's office informed my office that of the 11,500 farmers currently on RAS, approximately 6,300 are specialist wool producers. There are over 60,000 primary producers in Australia who grow some wool. Of these, ABARE classifies 18,000 as specialist wool producers who derive most of their income from the sale of wool and sheepmeat. They hold 48 per cent of the nation's flock. Hence, some 28 per cent of specialist woolgrowers are receiving some RAS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that the Government has been reaching less than one-third of specialist producers, owners of just under half of the nation's flock. This must be interpreted against several indicators of the industry's financial position. Ninety-one per cent of sheep industry farms made a loss in 1991-92. Average farm loss was $39,660. The wool price has fallen below 400c&mdash;it has recovered a bit over the last couple of weeks&mdash;which represents a cost to the grower of at least $2 for every kilo sold. Even sheep industry farms at full equity are forecast to make a loss. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Six months ago the average equity of properties in south-west Queensland was 58 per cent. Income distribution tables from ABARE highlight that very few are making a profit and very many are making a substantial loss. There are also very few in the intermediate range, which is where RAS is targeted. The RAS market is shrinking as it daily becomes impossible to be classified as viable, the prerequisite for RAS assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts are startling. In Queensland, 50 per cent of sheep farms are forecast to make a loss of more than $50,000 in 1992-93. This is based on an optimistic wool price of 503c a kilo. The current price is 452c a kilo. In New South Wales 9.9 per cent of sheep farms are forecast to make a profit; one per cent will make more than $50,000. In Victoria, 0.6 per cent of sheep farms will make more than $50,000. Gone are the images of Merc-driving graziers and Gold Coast holidays. The industry is in a state of collapse. The Government's response was to provide some RAS assistance, up to $30,000, to less than one-third of the specialist growers or guardians of 16 per cent of the nation's flock. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Assistance under RAS is refused on viability grounds. One can be too viable and not need RAS. Anecdotal evidence backed up by the ABARE estimates that close to 10 per cent of producers might make a profit&mdash;even if a small one&mdash;allows me to make a harsh assumption that the top 10 per cent would be ruled out of RAS eligibility for being too well off. We know that just under 30 per cent of woolgrowers are currently receiving RAS so they must have been deemed viable under RAS guidelines. That means the Government has deemed the remaining 60 per cent of producers are not wanting assistance or are unviable. It is acknowledged that there will be some farms that are debt free, some with little debt, but with wool prices at present levels and only nine per cent of woolgrowers making a profit, these farms are increasingly falling into the need area of RAS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us consider the new wool package and its `exceptional circumstances' funding. The Government estimates that a total of 5,790 woolgrowers will be eligible to share $39.6 million&mdash;an average assistance of $6,840 per grower which might cover the fuel bill for six months. This assistance is available for a maximum of 12 months and is topped up by the States to varying degrees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, 780 growers are expected to be eligible for `exceptional circumstances' drought provisions and share in an allocated $5 million at an average of $6,410. This assistance is available for a maximum of six months. It must be remembered that this is in addition to the normal RAS allocation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A very important point is that while there may be some new RAS entrants under the exceptional circumstances provision, industry suggests that it will be mainly existing RAS recipients who will benefit from the April wool package. The main reason for this is the similarity of eligibility guidelines and the difficulty in meeting viability  provisions. In last week's estimates committee hearing a RAS officer said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . you are running off the back of current arrangements with individual farmers. It will be a top-up in most cases.</PARA>
<PARA>Therefore, even after the much vaunted wool package, the Government will still be reaching an approximate one-third of the specialist wool industry. The wool package does not widen the net of RAS recipients; it simply offers a little more support to the minority that can prove viability according to their respective and restrictive guidelines. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the other two-thirds of the industry? A very small percentage, as I have identified, will have positive cash flows due to off-farm assets. Some may have no significant debt. This group is shrinking as these assets are used to finance their wool concerns through the prolonged price slump. As a result, more of this top group are filtering down into the RAS target area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Victoria at least expects many new RAS applicants from this group in the months to come. As conditions deteriorate, one-third of the industry that the Government is assisting is moving up the industry hierarchy. Previous RAS recipients from lower down the scale are increasingly unable to show long term viability and are falling off the RAS ledge. The Government's decision to leave 60 per cent of specialist wool producers without assistance means that 10,800 growers are left to struggle on as best they can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are very few options available. Wool costs $2 a kilogram more to produce than to sell. Women find work if close to a town where there is any work, while the men try to keep the property going and the stock alive. This income can, paradoxically, restrict eligibility for RAS. There are between 4,000 and 4,500 farmers or spouses who manage to meet the JSA assets criteria. There is no breakdown available on how many of these are woolgrowers. However, by taking JSA a farmer loses his eligibility for a re-establishment grant offered to those who have no choice but to leave the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government likes to talk about its farm household support assistance category as though it were an attractive, generous offer to poverty stricken farm families. Paid at the same rate as the JSA, it is nevertheless a commercial government loan, unless the farmer can sell his property within nine months. The last thing a farmer needs who wants to stay on the land but cannot get RAS, along with 60 per cent of his industry, is another loan. As a consequence, farm household support is not very popular. There are only 209 people receiving it at the moment. Producers are also scared that once they apply for FHS, the QIDC or similar State lending authorities will move to foreclose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is ironic that a farmer can be deemed unviable for a subsidy but eligible for a loan. Some will inevitably leave. It is surprising, however, considering the worsening conditions, to discover that the actual number of producers taking re-establishment grants to leave the rural sector&mdash;some 326 in the nine months to March 1993&mdash;is way down on the Government's estimate of 1,400 for the whole year. The average grant has been $32,906 and they cling on desperately and stubbornly. There are thousands of farmers who cannot meet the JSA asset criteria and who reject the farm household support option because it merely puts food on the table while they are selling up. It is this group that causes me the most concern. They must be making terrible personal sacrifices to feed and clothe themselves and keep their places going. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bush is where I believe the real heroes are. Half the specialist wool industry is living on nothing&mdash;a dream and a prayer. Shires cannot keep subsidising towns while their rates remain unpaid. Telephones, the lifeline for isolated families, are being cut off, along with power in a few instances. Vehicle registrations are lapsing. There is a limit to the leniency and charity of authorities, financial institutions and aid agencies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By ignoring 60 per cent of producers in his latest package, Mr Crean has effectively begun to remove people from the industry. In the city, they could get the dole and not have to pay it back or sell up their home and move a thousand miles away. In the bush, there is no equivalent welfare benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Non-government agencies such as St Vincent de Paul, the Salvation Army and Lifeline are attempting to fill the gap and put their resources into action, but they are spread very thinly. It is important to note that the reduced spending power of 60 per cent of the wool industry which is ignored by the Government is having a disastrous effect on rural towns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have outlined the minimal effort that the Government has put in to address the substantial problem. I can only think of two reasons for this totally inadequate response: firstly, the Government does not care; and, secondly, if the Government were to open its eyes to the enormity of the problems, it would find them too difficult to solve. The Government prefers a tunnel vision approach. As was so quaintly outlined by an officer in the estimates hearings:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The way the calculations have been made is that we have targeted a group of farmers, we have put some sort of numerical expression against that group, and we have used an average level of the expected rate at which they will draw assistance and that has been grossed up on an annual basis.</PARA>
<PARA>`Some sort of numerical expression' against a group of farmers is the Government's way of saying that it decided at the stroke of a pen what percentage of farmers it would help to stay in the industry. In this case, it is 30 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In doing so, the Minister has classified 60 per cent of the industry as not getting help. He is happy to leave 60 per cent of the great Australian wool industry to suffer alone through the worst ever price and seasonal conditions. He has executed a coup de grace by appointing Professor Garnaut to oversee the long-term issues. This leads to the assertion I made earlier about the use of maximum PR to camouflage the Government's poor response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister's whirlwind tour of drought-affected properties was a tremendous public relations feat. His wooing of Margaret Greer was in the best traditions of Labor politics and led the media to focus on her as being the voice of the bush. Once the wool package was released, Mrs Greer praised the Minister for listening and allocating funds to the problem. She said that he had given her the hope to stay and fight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know Mrs Greer's particular situation. I heard her speak at a meeting in Charleville where she expressed her concern and anguish on behalf of woolgrowers throughout Australia. She has become a media focus and has brought the plight of farmers into the homes of millions of Australians. She has to be congratulated on that. But if her property had been able to access RAS funds in the past, along with the 60 per cent of drought affected growers in Queensland, it is highly unlikely that she would now be able to access RAS funds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the Minister's visit, she mentioned his telling her that funds would be available for people in her situation. He could have been referring only to JSA or farm household support, which is a short-term loan to enable people just to put food on the table until their property is sold. A repayment contract is signed before the support is drawn down. Under present conditions, no woolgrower will take on such a loan unless he is prepared to leave. How else would a grower be in a position to repay the Government's generosity?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With little analysis of how individual woolgrowers would be assisted by this package, the Minister enjoyed an ill-fitting hero status, being painted as a saviour of the wool industry. Nothing could be further from the truth. He has sentenced 60 per cent of the industry to go it alone, and he has resisted the hard options at all times. The biggest cop-out of all was to hand over the reins to Professor Garnaut&mdash;the same man who advocated the removal of anti-dumping arrangements together with all tariffs and export assistance. His duplicity has extended to placing information in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Queensland Country Life</EMPHASIS>, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Land</EMPHASIS> and the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stock and Land</EMPHASIS> and giving alarmingly misleading information about benefits that rural people can apply for. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister is callously exploiting the situation for the maximum political mileage. Once again, as with the Margaret Greers of the industry, he is raising false hopes and whispering promises that can never be fulfilled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a very serious matter. I have tabled papers from the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Queensland Country Life</EMPHASIS> of 20 May 1993 and other papers. In a box headed `RAS: what it can mean to you' were two articles. One is headed `Special drought relief extended' and the other `Help in a crisis'. This information was given out by Mr Crean's department. The `Help in a crisis' article contains a list of special financial assistance available to people in crisis situations from the Department of Social Security. After some investigation, it becomes apparent that hardly any farmers could possibly qualify for such measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are three categories listed. The first is the special benefit. Senator Evans told me in the Senate on Tuesday that in general terms it is unlikely that farmers would easily come within the relevant criteria. There is no chance of any farmer successfully applying under this program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second category is a hardship provision which makes allowance for greater assets when combined with little income. However, this scheme is in the process of being wound up, and will be by November this year, and is being replaced with farm household support, which is quite different, being a loan. The 244 farmers and spouses currently under this program will be transferred to the household support scheme. I have a letter from the department saying that no new applicants for modified JSA will be accepted after 20 March 1993 and that, in the case of hardship provisions of JSA and NSA, there is a requirement that the farm be offered for sale. Hence, it is impossible to apply for this category of benefit. It is a straight-out mistruth to tell people that they can apply for a non-existent benefit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third category of benefit provides funds to community welfare agencies to help in crisis situations. It is not a means of regular support. Senator Evans admitted that he had no data on this, only anecdotal information. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is totally misleading to put this information in the State's leading rural newspapers and imply that the Government has all sorts of funding programs available for rural people when in fact none of these three benefits&mdash;one of which is obsolescent and one has never been an option for farmers&mdash;can be accessed in any significant capacity. It is a cruel hoax on struggling farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is advertising benefits which it cannot deliver. It is indicative of the Government's self-knowledge that it is offering rural Australia a very poor deal indeed. Why will the Minister not release the RASAC report? RASAC is a publicly funded body and should be accountable to the Parliament. Is it because of his reluctance to be accountable on his meagre response to the report?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why has the Government left 60 per cent of the wool industry without support or assistance? These 10,800 families are facing immediate and pressing needs&mdash;to stay on the land, to stay fed and to keep their children educated and clothed&mdash;and they are doing it without assistance. Why can the Government not see that the removal of drought from the natural disaster scheme is an act of which only God is capable? This relentless drought is certainly a disaster, not only for the woolgrowers but also for many other industries. It is compounded by the man-made disaster which is this Government's pitiful response. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government has sent a majority of Australian woolgrowers to the industry's Gallipoli. They have been left in the trenches with insufficient provisions and no sign of reinforcements. The general is a thousand miles away in Canberra and is happy to accept the high casualty rates. He makes a quick trip to the front, slaps the diggers on the back and promises that help is on the way. They initially believe him and cling to every last straw, but then slowly realise that the general has gone back to his desk, leaving them to fight alone against impossible odds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These people do not want to accept the farm household support because they do not want to leave their posts.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to speak on a matter which the WA branch of the Custom Brokers Council of Australia has raised with me relating to optional port lodgment legislation which has passed through this Parliament but which has not yet been brought into law. I will not read all of my speech tonight because the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Senator Bolkus), who is at the table, has agreed that I can incorporate it, but I would like to make a few brief comments.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter relates to the effect that this optional port lodgement will have in terms of the ease with which drugs come into Australia. I believe that is a very serious possibility. It is something to which both sides of the chamber should give very serious consideration. I have been approached and well briefed by Kelly Monte on behalf of the Western Australian branch of the Custom Brokers Council of Australia. Tomorrow every member of this chamber will receive a special report on the danger of increased drug traffic in their States. This is a very serious document. It contains an enormous amount of hard fact. It clearly points out the increased presence of drugs in Australia, particularly those drugs that have been intercepted as they have come across our shores. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report also highlights the fact that only a very small percentage of imports arriving into this country are inspected. I will give one example. A mail bag, which has a value placed on it by the sender, is not even inspected when it comes into this nation. This Senate needs to have another very careful look at the possible impact of this legislation. The Minister for Science and Small Business (Senator Schacht), who is the Minister responsible, has already been briefed by this organisation. I will read one page of this submission that all senators will receive tomorrow. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We ask you to make a personal representation to Senator Chris Schacht in the interests of your state and the Customs Brokers Council of Australia  (WA, SA, QLD and TAS), asking him not to introduce OPL and give an undertaking that he will not introduce it into the future.</PARA>
<PARA>I would agree that that seems to be a very demanding request. I think that after going through the submission and reading the speech that will be incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> tonight, every person in this chamber, in this Parliament and beyond will have a careful think about what is happening in this area. I will read out a couple of passages from this speech. The first one states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1971/72 the customs seized 162 kilograms of drugs. In 1991/92 they seized 5071 kilograms of drugs&mdash;an increase of 3130 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>The changes that have been passed in that legislation will make it even easier for the drugs to come across our shore. Another passage states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amphetamines seizures rose by almost 1000 percent in one year.</PARA>
<PARA>Part of this speech which has been prepared for me&mdash;I have read it very carefully and I approve of it&mdash;quotes from the Australian Federal Police annual report. That report in itself is instructive reading. I quote this particular passage as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The AFP's focus will remain the identification and pursuit by proactive investigation of major drug importation syndicates. Particular attention will be given to evidence which suggests increased smuggling and availability of cocaine.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last year the golden Triangle countries produced 3000 tonnes of opium. It is estimated that this was refined to about 200 to 250 tonnes of heroin, of the `No. 4' white powder which is preferred in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Federal police say that there is no shortage of heroin in source countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There appears to be no shortage of drugs in Australia so it is logical to assume that massive amounts of drugs are being brought into the country through normal import channels.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Federal police intelligence investigations in Western Australia, carried out over many months has identified a pattern engaged in large importations of heroin through ships. These investigations have already led to the arrest of two men and the seizure of 3.2 kilograms of heroin.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Police and customs both talk of highly efficient and well planned drug imports through crime syndicates in Italy, Japan and South America.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, one of the very important things that faces the Australian community today, particularly our young people who are under an enormous amount of social pressure, is the increased advent of drugs into the country. As senators, we have a responsibility to look very closely at the matter I have raised here tonight. I seek leave to incorporate my speech in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Drugs is a massive problem in Australia&mdash;it is one that is growing year by year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a problem which surpasses party political barriers, but if a particular party found an instant solution for the problem it would receive landslide support from the voting public.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Yet strange as it may seem a legislature such as this House has passed legislation which will support the growth of the drug industry in Australia and make it far easier to traffic drugs in Australia than to get picked up for drunk driving.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our state and Federal police forces see the horrific outcomes from the widespread use of drugs. They know that legislative and budget constraints makes their work much harder, but through loyalty towards both their minister and our system of Government they remain silent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Smaller states such as Western Australia, South Australia, Queensland and Tasmania along with the Northern Territory will suffer the most under this legislation&mdash;Optional Port Lodgement (a part of the Customs Act Amendment) which as yet has not been put into operation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Optional Port Lodgement means customs documentation can be lodged at any port in Australia. Currently it must be lodged at the port where goods enter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With this system Customs Brokers lodge documents and can detect irregularities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Major importers want OPL to allow them to lodge all documentation direct from their head office. Under OPL most documentation for Australia will be lodged in Sydney or Melbourne. Melbourne and Sydney have problems with current workloads. Far more work will mean far less checks on documentation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For example of 48,410 importers to Australia handled through the Sydney office customs target 120-a-year for compliance audit checks.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Twenty years ago there were 5000 customs officers, collecting $466 million in import duty and clearing 1.6 million passengers. Today there are still 5000 staff who collect $3.3 billion and clear 10 million passengers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1971/72 the customs seized 162 kilograms of drugs. In 1991/92 they seized 5071 kg of drugs&mdash;an increase of 3130 percent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently Customs Brokers around Australia provide an invaluable service to Customs Officers in the search for drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Customs Service has stated that not only have a number of reports of suspected unusual activities been made to customs, but a major drug find in WA was the result of information received from the industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Late last year Customs Brokers signed an agreement with customs to assist in the fight against illegal drug trafficking.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The campaign called Frontline engages Customs Brokers in a 32 point check on imports&mdash;all physical&mdash;which can detect drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the time of the introduction of the campaign, customs said drugs had a big community cost attached.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Costs of the trade (drugs) are borne by the whole community, they are reflected in the crime rate, insurance and health costs, absenteeism and that large part of the tax dollar which goes towards health and law enforcement," Customs documents stated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Only 1.5 percent or 150 containers out of every 10,000 are checked for drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any airbag entering Australia with a value under $50 (the value placed on it by the sender) does not even need documentation for customs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A look at Federal police drug seizures tells the complete story.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the 1990/91 financial year the Australian federal police seized a total of 1.7 million grams of drugs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One year later (the latest published figures) that increased to 5.1 million grams, an increase of more than 300 percent.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the most interesting aspect is not the massive increase, but the type of drugs seized.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amphetamines seizures rose by almost 1000 percent in one year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amount of cannabis dropped by a half although this was obtained from about 30 percent more seizures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the mostly `imported' cannabis resin increased by a massive 1100 percent to 4.5 million grams.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The latest Australian Federal Police report lists drugs as originating from: South America, Papua New Guinea, Holland, Singapore, Thailand, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Tonga, the United States, Fiji, the United Kingdom, Jamaica, the Middle East, Bali and Nepal to name a few.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The police talk of an importation and a drug distribution network based in Darwin for Heroin imports to Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They talk of a growing problem of the importation of the popular `New Guinea Gold'&mdash;a type of Cannabis which is exchanged in Australia for weapons&mdash;used by Guerilla forces against the elected government in New Guinea.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report details the innovative methods used to import drugs: They have been found in sandals, inside the frames of exercise bicycles, and inside olive containers, international mail, an engine block, sports field rollers, swallowed by mean and women, and in the soles of running shoes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I quote from the Australian Federal Police annual report:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The AFP's focus will remain the identification and pursuit by proactive investigation of major drug importation syndicates. Particular attention will be given to the evidence which suggests increased smuggling and availability of cocaine.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Last year the golden Triangle countries produced 3000 tonnes of opium. It is estimated that this was refined to about 200 to 250 tonnes of heroin, of the `No. 4' white powder which is preferred in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Federal police say that there is no shortage of heroin in source countries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There appears to be no shortage of drugs in Australia so it is logical to assume that massive amounts of drugs are being brought into the country through normal import channels.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Federal police intelligence investigations in Western Australia, carried out over many months has identified a pattern engaged in large importations of heroin through ships. These investigations have already led to the arrest of two men and the seizure of 3.2 kgs of heroin.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Police and customs both talk of highly efficient and well planned drug imports through crime syndicates in Italy, Japan and South America.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A likelihood of increased air traffic into Australia through Port Hedland and Broome this year already has Federal Police worried.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is severe pressure on Customs, Federal Police and State police.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Currently if someone wants the WA police to investigate a fraud complaint in Queensland&mdash;they have to pay police air fares to investigate&mdash;this gives some indication of the budget constraints on state police.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If this House puts unjustified pressure on enforcement agencies to save a few dollars for big business then this House is responsible for opening up drug trade in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We may just as well licence drug traffickers and get a few bob out of them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The second argument to the story is the Customs Brokers themselves.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will be another case of big job losses around Australia and with these job losses will go expertise on the Australian wharves which can never be regained.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Customs Brokers have had their businesses on hold for some time awaiting the outcome of electronic lodgement legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Ironically only last week the same legislation was before the United States congress.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over there Customs Brokers marched on Washington.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Customs Brokers in the United States are having the same problems with improved technology.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">American customs see the courier firms and international air bags becoming a major problem for the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The president of the American National Customs Brokers and Forwarders Association summed up the issue with this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The NCBFA believes you have to keep the importer at the heart of the System&mdash;and his broker inextricably linked to his interests and fully accountable for the honesty, accuracy and efficiency of the entry system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Drugs is an ever increasing problem facing Australia. It is an emotional issue and rightly so it is an attention grabber.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However there are many other ways that Customs Brokers provide community protection in the course of their everyday work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They ensure quarantine regulations are observed, they ensure that goods entering the country meet Australian standards, they are ever watchful for prohibited imports such as weapons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We as a Chamber must ensure that integrity remains with the importation of goods into Australia. That is why we are here. Optional Port Lodgement must be stopped at all costs.</PARA>
