<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="2F4">Senator BURNS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services. I ask the question because of my concern for the general health of the public and for the environment. Last week was Fire Awareness Week. As part of the week's activities, concerns were raised about the damaging effects on the ozone layer of halon gas, commonly found in yellow fire extinguishers, which are widespread in the community. There were calls for members of the community to hand in their yellow fire extinguishers. Can the minister tell me what the government is doing to facilitate this collection process?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1948" SPEAKER="McMullan Sen The Hon R.F." NAMEID="5I4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="ACT" MINISTERIAL="ARTS AND ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The use of halon gas is a significant environmental issue and there are community concerns about ozone. As I am sure all honourable senators are aware, halon, which is used very effectively in fire suppression systems, has proved to be extremely aggressive in ozone depletion. It is a big cause of concern with regard to our obligations under the Montreal protocol on substances that deplete the ozone layer. Therefore, there has been considerable pressure on governments around the world to act in some way to reduce the prevalence of halon.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important thing to note is that, in normal usage, halon is not dangerous or harmful to people, animals or plant life and the bulk storage of halon does not pose a threat to the community. This is not one of those issues where we will have a scare campaign about its storage but it does pose a significant threat to the ozone layer. Unless the extinguishers are properly maintained, they will leak. Some forms of halon are up to 16 times more damaging to the ozone layer than CFCs. So we are not talking about a minor issue. There are 5,000 tonnes of halon in current use in Australia: 70 per cent is held by the Commonwealth and state governments, 15 per cent by major corporations, and 15 per cent by small business and the community.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was very important that we set up an environmentally responsible process for handling this potentially very damaging substance on this scale. We have established a halon bank, which is being managed by the Centre for Environmental Management in my department. It commenced collections in May this year and depots have been established in each city.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am happy to say that we are at the vanguard of technological development in this area and the expectation is that the DAAS CEM halon bank will set new international standards for the management of this ozone depleting substance. As far as I am aware, it is the only functioning halon bank in the world. We are setting the standard here, as I think we should.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">DAAS CEM has been invited to participate in various international conferences by the US EPA, the United Nations environment program and Environment Canada with regard to these matters to evaluate the pacesetting technology that we are developing here. While this is not one of the issues that are at the forefront of the public mind because there does not seem to be any contention about it here in the Senate&mdash;I am sure everybody supports what is happening&mdash;it is nevertheless important to reiterate that we are doing these positive, groundbreaking things that are very important. I thank Senator Burns for his question.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. I am obliged to Senator Collins for the advice he gave us that questions touching on the Prime Minister's responsibilities should be directed to Senator Gareth Evans. Less than one month ago the Prime Minister solemnly released a document entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mabo&mdash;outline of proposed legislation on native title</EMPHASIS>, which stated that where there is or has been valid freehold or leasehold title, native title does not exist. How can this clear and unequivocal statement be reconciled with the Prime Minister's secret deal that will now allow native title to coexist with leasehold title?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1948" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This issue will be considered by cabinet this afternoon. Nobody should jump to any conclusions about what the outcome of those deliberations will be unless and until they have taken place. Whatever decisions are taken by cabinet about the question of extinguishment in relation to pastoral leases and the possibility of some coexistence of native title, to the extent that it is totally consistent with the continued enjoyment of the rights in question&mdash;issues which are the subject of live current debate&mdash;it needs to be understood that those decisions could only conceivably have application in relation to a tiny minority, if any, of the number of pastoral leases that have been issued in this country.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What those opposite need to understand, because it obviously has not got inside their heads, is that the government's legislation only covers leases which are invalid by virtue either of the prima facie operation of the Racial Discrimination Act, in the sense that it would amount to some denial of proper process&mdash;a denial of procedural justice&mdash;taking into account rights which might exist; or the application of some other law, conceivably a law relating to a breach of fiduciary duty unrelated to the Racial Discrimination Act. It is only leases in respect of which an affirmative native title can be established in relation to the land in question&mdash;and a very large number of hurdles have to be jumped over before one gets to that extent. It is only land where, once native title has been established, one can also establish some basis for invalidity on either of the bases I have suggested; it is only in that context that this legislation will have any bite or application at all.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is only leases which are invalid for any of the reasons I have mentioned that are actually validated by the legislation which has been the subject of so much discussion. It is only, conceivably, a tiny, tiny percentage, if any, of all the leases that have been granted that could possibly give rise to any question of doubt, or have any impact at all, whatever decision might be taken about the effect of such a validation in relation to the extinguishment of the native title over the land in question or what would be the effect of a coexistence if any native title were held to exist.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is about time those opposite got that into their heads, and it is about time some of the scaremongers in the community got that into their heads. This lot opposite is not interested in good public policy; this lot is not interested in good government; this lot is not interested in good legislation; and this lot is not interested in justice, morality and getting this issue right. What those opposite are interested in is the most vulgar form of scaremongering, and they ought to be ashamed of themselves.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A further example of the scaremongering I am talking about&mdash;and I am grateful to the good senator for reminding me&mdash;is the statement by the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory this morning that the government's native title legislation will rob Australians of their right to a day at the beach, for God's sake! The proposals that were set out in the original outline, in respect of which there has been no suggestion from anyone that there be a change, show how the rights of the public can coexist absolutely with any native rights that might exist as far as the coastline is concerned. There is quite explicit provision for governments to confirm any existing public access, including to beaches. It has been made perfectly clear already that this would not involve any extinguishment of native title.</PARA></TALK.START>

I refer the minister to the issues raised on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hinch</EMPHASIS> program concerning the provision of family day care to Chantelle Mustafa. Can the minister tell the Senate what action has been taken to provide Chantelle, who has Charge Association Syndrome, with family day care in her own home to enable her mother, Michelle, to return to work?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1950" SPEAKER="Crowley Sen The Hon R.A." NAMEID="ZF4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="FAMILY SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Denman for her question. I am pleased to tell the Senate that I recently rang Mrs Mustafa to tell her that special arrangements had been made to provide Chantelle Mustafa, her nine-month-old baby girl, with family day care in her own home. The case was first brought to my attention by the department and then raised further on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hinch</EMPHASIS> program. That program highlighted the nature of Chantelle Mustafa's disability.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mrs Mustafa sought access to family day care so that she could return to work next month. Because of her daughter's special needs, Mrs Mustafa has asked that family day care be provided in her own home rather than in the home of the family day care worker, which is the usual arrangement. The family day care guidelines do not allow for the provision of child care in the child's home. This means that such care would be ineligible for child care assistance or fee relief.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mrs Mustafa argued to me, to the department and on the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hinch</EMPHASIS> program that there are special circumstances which justify special care in the case of Chantelle. The Werribee council, the sponsor of family day care relevant to Mrs Mustafa, had indicated that it was willing to assist in providing family day care in Mrs Mustafa's home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Denman said, Chantelle Mustafa has Charge Association Syndrome. Essentially the principal concern is that she cannot be fed through the mouth and has to be fed through a stomach tube. She is unable to clear her throat or swallow, which makes her very vulnerable to respiratory infections. The low resistance to colds and flu and the likelihood of serious infection mean that she would be very much at risk if she had to leave her home and go to family day care provided in somebody else's home.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Within the department and under existing arrangements, I have discretion to make one-off determinations in special cases. After examining all the avenues available, I decided that we could make an exception in this case on behalf of Chantelle and her family.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Just wait a moment, Senator Newman; I am coming to that. Let me stress that this decision is not made because of Chantelle's disability. Many children in Australia with disabilities enjoy child care assistance under the ordinary provisions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our child care programs are designed to provide support for families and children with disabilities in the mainstream child care areas. That is assisted by the program's supplementary services to make sure that children with disabilities are eligible and able to be in mainstream services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision should not be regarded as a precedent but as a one-off. I have set very special conditions to make sure that this is a one-off case, particularly so that Mrs Mustafa and her daughter are not penalised unfairly because her case falls between the stools. Mrs Mustafa will have assistance for child care to enable her to return to work and assist her family.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some of the criteria are that a special contract should be drawn up outlining responsibility of all the parties concerned, insurance and the coverage of liability which, in these circumstances, is one of the most important areas. Secondly, we decided the decision should be reviewed after 12 months. If the little one has learnt to swallow or can manage differently, then she would be eligible to go to family day care in the ordinary circumstances. We have also allowed for her two-year-old child to be assisted with family day care at home for 12 months only. This is a very important decision that confirms this government's commitment to child care and its desire to meet the needs of families in a way that will assist them to return to work, to study or to train and not penalise them because of exceptional circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a special circumstance. I have made a one-off special arrangement for this particular case. I would hope that the Senate would be as pleased as Mrs Mustafa was to acknowledge the commitment of government in this area.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me say at the outset how warmly the Australian government applauds&mdash;and I am sure I am speaking in this respect for all members of both houses&mdash;the awarding of the 1993 Nobel Peace Prize jointly to the ANC President, Nelson Mandela, and the South African President, Frederik de Klerk, for their roles in dismantling apartheid and moving South Africa toward democracy. Both men have made an immense personal and political commitment to the restructuring of a new non-racial democratic South Africa and, in making the award, the international community has very properly honoured that commitment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The announcement of the Nobel Prize does come at a very difficult and sensitive time in South Africa. It should help give encouragement to those committed to negotiating a peaceful transition to democracy. Unhappily, that does not seem to extend to the full range of parties that have previously been involved in that process. The continuing boycott of the multi-party talks in South Africa by a coalition of right-wing parties, conservative black Bantustan governments and the Inkatha Freedom Party, led by Chief Buthelezi, does very seriously risk undermining the negotiations and delaying the transition to non-racial democracy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The continuing high levels of violence that are simultaneously occurring with this are a matter of the gravest concern for all of us. That situation is not being made any better at all by the continuing stalemate in the negotiations. It is clearly imperative that agreement be reached as soon as possible on the proposed interim constitution. Once that happens, the transitional arrangements approved in September by the South African parliament can be put in place and preparations can begin for the election scheduled to take place in April next year.

Will native title be able to extinguish pastoral leases? Considering the many hundreds of state statutes under which pastoral leases are guaranteed and granted, can the government guarantee that, if pastoral leases co-exist with native title, there will be no capacity for extensive litigation to test the relationship between native title and each of the hundreds of state statutes?

I refer him to Glen Milne's article in today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Financial Review</EMPHASIS> concerning Mabo and the on-again, off-again suspension of the Racial Discrimination Act. I ask the minister: did the official submission to cabinet on Mabo in July indicate that the bill being prepared by the Commonwealth would facilitate `validation of existing grants by putting this beyond challenge on RDA grounds'?  Regarding validation, the bill aims to give comprehensive certainty for past actions. Were those intentions confirmed by the Prime Minister in his August letter to all state premiers and in the Commonwealth's cabinet drafting instructions given to the states on 4 August? Do these documents indicate that, contrary to the line now being run by this government, it was in reality the government that proposed the suspension of part of the Racial Discrimination Act?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It has always been the government's intention to make absolutely clear that, notwithstanding the provisions of any applicable law, leases and other interests in land that have been granted should be regarded as having certainty, continuity&mdash;should be in fact validated to the extent of any possible invalidity. That has been the government's position all the way through. That remains the position. That is the position as I have spelt it out this morning. The question that we had to wrestle with was the possible impact in extreme marginal cases&mdash;let us frankly acknowledge&mdash;of the Racial Discrimination Act as possibly interpreted and applied by the courts in rendering invalid for reasons of procedural unfairness, not taking into account what should have been taken into account, namely the existence of the title. We had to take into account the possibility that racial discrimination provisions looked at at their absolute face value might in some very small number of cases have the effect of invalidating. That remains a concern, and that concern has to be addressed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has changed is the government's perception of what is necessary in order to reach that result. Originally it was thought, on the available legal advice, that what we had to do was basically override the Racial Discrimination Act, or suspend the Racial Discrimination Act, or read down the Racial Discrimination Act to the extent of its possible application in these cases. Further, and I believe better, advice has since been received that we do not have to do any of those things because there is already in the Racial Discrimination Act, section 8, a particular affirmative action provision, a special measures provision, which is capable of being applied to the whole content of legislation of the kind that we are presently contemplating in the Mabo situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, far from being something inconsistent with the basic thrust and purpose of the Racial Discrimination Act or any particular provision of it, what we are talking about now is making clear that this validation process will continue, will proceed, in exactly the way originally intended. But in the process, the Racial Discrimination Act does not have to be suspended or overridden or read down. The special measures provisions in the Racial Discrimination Act are capable on their face of applying to these situations because the whole point and thrust of the Mabo legislation is, of course, to introduce a very special measure for the protection of the Aboriginal people, certainly to balance it out against the rights of other Australians. But overwhelmingly, the character, the thrust, the shape, the content, the motivation of this legislation is to get it right for the first time in our history so far as Aboriginal people are concerned. That remains our intention and that will be the effect.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 9 October 1991, the government agreed to conditions of service applicable for all ADF personnel to be deployed to Cambodia. At that time, because of the uncertainty of what that would involve in Cambodia, two packages of conditions of service were put in place. The lesser package was to be implemented after the UN cease-fire took effect and when demobilisation and containment measures were, in fact, in place. As events unfolded and elections were held without the UN cease-fire provisions being achieved, it became apparent that the initial rationale to change the conditions of service would also have to change.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The date of the Cambodian elections was initially chosen, but there were a number of serious incidents which endangered our personnel around that particular time. The change to the lesser package was delayed to ensure that ADF personnel received the appropriate entitlements in terms of compensation and repatriation cover as well as financial recompense. With the cessation of the UN mandate and the installation of the new Cambodian government, the need for a review became evident. The review indicated that the most appropriate time for change was after the departure of the main body.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All personnel deployed to Cambodia were advised prior to deployment that the conditions of service package would change when the situation in Cambodia stabilised. The administration of the change in service conditions and the timing of the advice given to members were not as well managed as I would wish or as the government would have wished. Personnel in Cambodia were advised of the changes on 28 September 1993 and were advised that the changes were to take effect on 8 October this year. Because of the administrative time involved in changing pay arrangements and the fact that some personnel in Cambodia had been paid in advance, some overpayments did occur and I certainly have directed the ADF to examine ways to ameliorate the effects of the necessary repayments on ADF members and their families.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I acknowledge that a degree of hazard still exists for ADF members deployed in Cambodia. This recognition is demonstrated by the payment of a $40 daily deployment allowance, in addition to continued coverage under the Veterans' Entitlement Act, extra recreation leave, and zone rebates under the taxation act. The revised conditions of service package is considered fair and reasonable.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was just pausing for the commercial, Mr President. The task force is a key element of the government's fifth term transport reform agenda. The federal Labor government has initiated substantial reform of transport systems on land, sea and air over the last decade. The reform program has led to significant efficiency gains in each transport sector. The task force will build on this foundation. It will tap further into the needs of users and plan the way ahead for a truly integrated national transport system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The primary focus of the task force will be on the interstate movement of freight. It will assess the future pattern of transport demands and plan the infrastructure investment to meet those demands, including alternative sources, and it will focus on the broader economic costs and benefits of increased transport infrastructure investment. The task force will also look at all aspects of the relationship between the various transport sectors. A particular focus will be the efficiency and cost effectiveness of the interface between land transport and sea and air transport infrastructure.</PARA>

It will also have regard for the social and environmental impact of the transport system and the maintenance and enhancement of safety standards.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the task at hand, I am particularly pleased to inform the Senate of the appointment of three part-time members of the task force. They are: Mr Ian Webber, Chairman of Mayne Nickless; Mr Lance Hockridge, Group General Manager, BHP Transport; and Dr Derek Scrafton, Director-General of Transport in South Australia. All these people have a long involvement in the transport industry and public policy issues affecting transport. They will bring to their task strong practical experience and a keen appreciation of the importance of this sector to Australia's economic growth and prosperity. The task force will report to the government by March 1995 after consultation with a wide range of affected parties. In conclusion, I am encouraged by the positive response to the task force which has come from my state and federal counterparts, the federal opposition and, most importantly, the transport sector.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. I refer to the long running saga of the injustice concerning the Midford Paramount matter where the Joint Committee on Public Accounts made a unanimous and bipartisan recommendation that compensation be paid. Will the minister explain to the Senate why the interdepartmental committee established by the Prime Minister to set the level has failed to meet its September deadline to report? Is the minister aware that one of the parties was recently admitted to hospital as a consequence of the delay; that another has been in and out of hospital for months and was readmitted this morning; and that a third was forced last week to close down his business? Does there have to be bankruptcy and/or death before the minister and his government will act on this matter and compensation is paid after 10 months of waiting?</PARA></TALK.START>

It is expected that cabinet will be in a position to consider a joint submission from the Attorney-General and the Minister for Finance soon after the Prime Minister returns from CHOGM. It has been quite a complex exercise to assess the comprehensive and detailed claims that were received in this matter. The IDC was assisted on technical issues relating to valuation and income stream by consultants. The tax office, senior officers of the Customs Service, the Department of Industry, Technology and Regional Development, neither of which had prior involvement with matters relating to the prosecution or the subsequent JCPA inquiry, are also providing assistance. It ought to be appreciated under those circumstances that it was not possible to bring this to too speedy a conclusion, but every effort has been made to do just that. I remind Senator Bishop that she will not have nearly as much opportunity for fun like this when she gets into the House of Representatives; nonetheless, there it is.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do appreciate the continuing interest that Senator Beahan has in the welfare of the Northern Territory, particularly my home town of Darwin. I am pleased to advise the Senate that Qantas has announced a non-stop Tokyo-Darwin service to commence in March 1994, giving the Northern Territory direct access, for the first time, to the Japanese tourist trade. The introduction of a weekly Boeing 767-300 flight will make Darwin Qantas's second northern gateway from Japan following the highly successful introduction of direct services from Japan to Cairns. The Japanese market will have easy access not only to Darwin, but to Kakadu, Alice Springs and Ayers Rock&mdash;Uluru&mdash;three of Australia's major tourist destinations, following this decision.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Japan now provides more international tourists to Australia than any other country, this is an important announcement for the Northern Territory's tourism and hospitality industries. It will also provide the opportunity to expand existing Japanese markets by attracting those who are looking to new adventure holiday experiences in Australia's outback, as opposed to some of the more conventional coastal destinations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The decision will also build on encouraging signs already being shown in the growth of international passenger numbers through Darwin last year. These results showed an increase of almost 10 per cent to over 96,000 international visitors going through Darwin airport for the year ended 30 June 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This announcement is a further demonstration of the Commonwealth's strong aviation links with Japan which were further enhanced by the successful outcome of negotiations last year which provided for a 40 per cent increase in capacity between the two countries over the next two years. It is also a further sign of the development of international air services to Darwin, which has most recently seen the introduction of Ansett's international services to Indonesia.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. I refer the minister to his claim today that pastoral leases will be subject to a Mabo claim only if they are invalid. Does the minister accept that, if the Queensland Wik claim succeeds on the basis that there was a breach of fiduciary duty, there is not a pastoral lease in the country which would be safe from a Mabo claim? Accordingly, will the government do as it is asked by the Queensland government and legislate to protect against the Wik or any similar land grab claim?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="1960" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point about the proposed legislation, as was spelt out in the original outline&mdash;nothing is intended to be changed in this respect&mdash;is that it is not just a lease rendered invalid by the operation of the Racial Discrimination Act that needs attention by way of validation; it is a lease that is rendered invalid by the operation of the combination of native title with any other law. Of course, what we have in mind is the possibility of the law of fiduciary duty having some force and application in these circumstances, and it is that that has to be addressed if there is to be proper certainty. It is in that context that the outline was previously circulated and it is in that context that it will be circulated again, making clear that the validation exercise that is occurring is in relation to interests in land that are rendered invalid for any reason whatsoever.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the point that I tried to spell out before holds: it is inconceivable that there could be any wide-ranging exposure even to question marks so far as the overwhelming majority of leasehold interests are concerned. Not only does one have to establish the threshold question of whether there is native title at all in relation to the land in question&mdash;which is a completely separate issue and which obviously limits the issue in a very extensive way&mdash;but there also has to be some element of breach of procedural justice or breach of actual duty. It would be pretty hard to establish a breach of procedural justice or a breach of duty in a circumstance where, until 1992, nobody could have had any knowledge of the possible existence of native title. The view of many lawyers&mdash;and I am one of them&mdash;is that the whole exercise of possible invalidity of leases or interests in land by virtue of the application of the RDA or fiduciary duty law or anything else is really a bit of a will-o'-the-wisp because it is almost inconceivable, except in an extremely theoretical situation, and maybe not even then, that any land interest would be rendered invalid in this respect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So before everyone gets too excited about this issue I ask honourable senators to please understand and accept that they are only talking about something on the extreme margins of possible relevance when talking about these issues at all. It is not something that could have any conceivable application to the overwhelming number of interests in land that have been issued in this country.</PARA>

<PARA>The directors of the Midford Paramount company and the people associated with those directors in that business venture have been subject to the most outrageous and heinous injustice by the operations of a government agency and the bureaucracies that comprise it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It took two years for the Joint Committee of Public Accounts to conduct the inquiry, going through thousands of pages of evidence. It came down with a unanimous report, which stated that compensation should be paid. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) established an interdepartmental committee and said that under no circumstances was it to retry the issues; it was simply to determine how much was to be paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee became aware that there was resistance in the bureaucracy&mdash;the Department of Finance and the Australian Customs Service&mdash;to the setting of a precedent by the payment of compensation to give some justice to these people. Their behaviour has been reprehensible. The pressure that has been put on these individuals is far beyond anything that they should reasonably have been asked to endure. One person is a shadow of his former self. He has been in and out of hospital. He was re-admitted this morning, and his wife will not be far behind him. Another director was put into hospital some weeks ago when I raised this matter and asked that it be expedited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has taken action, yet 10 months after the report came down these people are still being made to suffer. I said weeks ago that one of the people concerned would have to close his business because the compensation issue was not resolved. He has now done that. He is only being maintained by help from his local church and, quite frankly, his health is only being maintained by prayer. </PARA>

It is that serious. I do not think it is reasonable for the government and the bureaucracy to think that their problems can be solved by either death and/or bankruptcy. They will have to wear that on their conscience if that is what transpires. I again ask the minister to reconsider his position and say that he will do everything in his power to make the announcement of that compensation this week so that the people who have been hospitalised and the people who are facing ruin can perhaps take some reassurance that justice in this matter will come about by at least next week. </PARA>

<PARA>The purpose of my question to Senator Gareth Evans was to highlight the change in the government's stance in relation to the coexistence of native title with pastoral leases. I referred to a document entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mabo&mdash;Outline of proposed legislation on native title</EMPHASIS>. That document stated that native title would not exist where there was a leasehold situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today in question time the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) clearly indicated that the government did not intend to extinguish native title rights on pastoral leases despite its earlier indications that only mining leases would coexist with native title. I bring to the attention of the Senate the fact that this vindicates the reason for my question and also vindicates the press reports of late which show that the Prime Minister has reneged on his prior stand. Senator Evans's attempts to downplay the change in stance by the Prime Minister were completely erroneous. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Native title claimants could make claims under common law on all of the thousands of pastoral leases issued before 1975 using a part of the High Court's judgment.</PARA>
<PARA>The Prime Minister said that today. I will address the situation in Western Australia for a moment. Pastoral leases account for some 38 per cent of the total area of Western Australia. If that is added to the almost 50 per cent that is crown land, there is not too much of Western Australia left. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Obviously, Senator Evans does not understand the situation under which pastoral leases are granted and renewed. It is very simple. A pastoral lease is not automatically renewed at the end of the lease. In some instances, they are closed up for a period and then they are renewed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The answer given by Senator Evans in the Senate today is absolutely and totally misleading with respect to the position which will exist. This adds to the uncertainty that exists around the Mabo decision and the impact that it will have on jobs, investment and a whole range of activities, particularly in Western Australia.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">He said yesterday that Mr Keating's 11th-hour change of heart meant "there is no point in any group talking or negotiating with the Government on any issue . . . they simply cannot be trusted".</PARA>
<PARA>The article then goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Farley said if public assurances from Mr Keating and six ministers "can't be believed then I don't think there is any way you can trust the Government".</PARA>
<PARA>The position of pastoralists is quite clear to me. Because of the expectations built up by the Prime Minister and because of the way he has handled this matter, we are going to see millions and millions of dollars being spent on court decisions and processes. As I said, that has been highlighted by today's comment of the Prime Minister that all leases entered into pre-1975 will be subject to common law. That will have a very detrimental impact on the economy of Australia, particularly that of Western Australia. </PARA>

The second point is that native title is totally different from any other form of title that Australians have ever had to deal with. That is why we get these extreme claims that native title cannot coexist with pastoral leases. It does coexist and it has coexisted since the middle of the 19th century. It was not called native title, but the British recognised the rights of indigenous people all those years ago. In 1993 we still have members of the opposition who do not even know that, with the reservations in Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory, native title is coexisting.</PARA></TALK.START>

Senator Gareth Evans has decided that it is not even worth worrying about&mdash;it is so minuscule that it will not worry the parliament.

There are hundreds of different types of leases. These are the sorts of things that the National Farmers Federation and the graziers want answers to. The government gave them the assurance that their leaseholds, their livelihoods, their property investments were going to be guaranteed.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel (Senator Faulkner) in response to a question asked by me today relating to the payment of an allowance to the ADF in Cambodia.</PARA>
<PARA>I have a different view to Senator Faulkner in relation to the danger that is involved in Cambodia. It is certainly at variance to the government's view in relation to the mine clearance forces we had in Namibia, where after the cease-fire the government continued to pay the allowances because of the danger involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been to Cambodia twice in the last 12 months. I do not pretend to be an authority on it, but I think that the situation in Cambodia for the ADF is probably as dangerous today as it was 12 months ago. Certainly, the danger is less from the Khmer Rouge, but banditry is now getting very much out of hand. Something like 180 vehicles have been stolen from the United Nations forces in the last few weeks. Daylight robbery at gunpoint is not an infrequent occurrence in the capital, Phnom Penh. I talked to one soldier who had had a bullet fired between his legs when he was being robbed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the newspapers today, it was reported that three bridges were blown up in Battambang. It probably was not done by the DK; it was probably done by the bandits. I noticed that one of the bridges had just had a hole blown in it. One of the techniques there is to blow up one lane of the bridge so the bandits can collect a toll illegally on the traffic through there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a good case to be made that the danger there is probably as much as it ever was. However, that is a decision for the government to make. My concern is the process by which the government withdrew the allowance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Bilney when dealing with this legislation spoke of the allowance being reduced from $65 to $60. In fact, it has come down to $40. When the legislation was before the Senate we were operating under a guillotine, thanks to those great custodians of democracy and free speech, the Australian Democrats, so the time for debate was limited. But if one goes back and reads the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, one finds that Senator Watson referred to the ADF in Cambodia and the allowances in relation to the amendment that went through to the income tax act. Later Senator Newman passed an amendment through the Senate which was quite specific and related to the allowances being paid to the ADF. It did require that they be tabled before the Senate and in the form of a disallowable instrument and thereby the Senate would have the opportunity of approving or disapproving those allowances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the answer from the minister today, that did not apply because the force was already in Cambodia when the legislation went through. I am at a loss to understand that because my reading of the debate, as recorded in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, is that it was quite specific in relation to the amendment that was going through to the Income Tax Assessment Act; it did relate to Cambodia. Therefore, I believe the government is bound to notify the parliament of the change in those allowances. It clearly has not done that. Alternatively, if the government has followed another pathway it is also bound, under the spirit of the legislation, to advise the Senate and the parliament how it arrived at that decision. That has not been done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree with Senator Faulkner that the whole thing was handled appallingly. I was in Cambodia at the time, in Phnom Penh, before the main contingent left several weeks ago. The effect on morale was really quite considerable. People were very disappointed at the way the government has handled this. Well they might be because what has happened now is that the troops in the rearguard of the Australian Defence Force in Cambodia&mdash;about 110 or 120 troops; most of them would be privates and in the lower ranks&mdash;have been denied a benefit that they understood they would get. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the saving for the government? Probably an increased payment of $25 or $35 a week, at most, for four or five weeks for 120 people&mdash;amounting to $20,000 in rough terms. This was a commitment that Australia performed extremely well in Cambodia. I have no hesitation in saying that without the Australian contingent and General Sanderson as head of the headquarters, the Cambodian UN operation would not have come to the successful operation that it did, but it probably cost Australia $30 million or $40 million. Why quibble over $20,000-odd and upset the ADF, which has done a marvellous job up there? It is just stupid. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) In replying to these reasonable requests, the GOSRV has, in the last few months, ordered stricter surveillance of the Patriarch's place of confinement and placed bans on all of his external communications. Whoever tries to contact, visit, help or offer gifts to him are stopped, threatened, interrogated, bodily searched (and in some cases strip searched), etc. The Patriarch's straightforward appeals have not only been ignored by the Hanoi leaders, but have also been vilified as `anti-state', `reactionary', `creating division amongst Buddhist community', etc. by the GOSRV's mass media and its nation-wide agencies, including its own VBC.</PARA>

In the last 12 months, hundreds of monks, nuns and lay persons have been arrested and/or tortured, harshly interrogated, searched, investigated and threatened. Amongst them are the Venerables Thich Nhat Lien, Thich Tri Luc and Thich Khong Tanh (Oct&mdash;Nov 1992), Thich Thien An (Oct. 1992, tortured to death few days after arrested), Thich Hai Tang, Thich Tri Tuu, Thich Hai Thinh and about 50 lay members (5/6/93), Thich Hanh Duc, 17 other monks and about one hundred of lay followers (9/7/93), etc.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(8) The GOSRV's violent attack and mass media campaign against Buddhists' appeal for Church independent have caused suffering to many thousands of people, resulting in increased instability for the whole country.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(10) The GOSRV's exclusively economic renovation has not, and can not, lead to democratisation or potentials which will allow long-overdue human rights to its citizens, such as freedom to select their own political aspirations, ways of expressions, religions, education, employment, place of resident, etc. The greater its economic strength, the more determined and confident the GOSRV is in its opposition to such a democratisation process and the worse its treatment of its citizens becomes. This causes ever greater social instability and a sense of total hopelessness for Vietnam's future, and more broadly, prevents the development of stability in the SE Asia region as a whole.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to put arrangements in place for the provision of general purpose assistance to the States, Northern Territory and the ACT in 1993-94, consistent with the decisions taken at the Premiers' Conference and Loan Council meeting on 5 July 1993. The bill will replace the State Grants (General Purposes) Act 1992 and its provisions closely follow those of that Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current estimate of general purpose funding for the States and the Northern Territory under the bill amounts to $14.7 billion, or about 13 per cent of estimated Commonwealth Budget outlays in 1993-94. As such, these payments constitute a major element of the Commonwealth's Budget. In combination with the Loan Council Allocations agreed at the Loan Council meeting, they also have a major bearing on the spending and borrowing of the public sector and in particular State Governments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the 1993 Premiers' Conference, the Commonwealth, States and Territories recognised that the economy is continuing to expand but the generally subdued growth of the international economy is hampering a more rapid domestic recovery.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While recognising that 1993-94 is not the year to cut dramatically into budget deficits, the National Fiscal Outlook report identified that significant structural repair of both Commonwealth and State budgets is needed in order to lift national savings over the medium term. Indeed the Government's medium term budgetary objective is to reduce the Commonwealth's deficit to around 1 per cent of GDP by 1996-97 and the States will need to adopt a medium term strategy of deficit restraint if the public sector is to make a significant contribution to savings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Most of the assistance to be provided under this bill is in the form of general revenue grants, which are currently estimated to be $14.4 billion in 1993-94. The level of financial assistance grants in 1993-94 has been set so as to fulfil the Commonwealth's three year real terms guarantee that was agreed at the 1990 Premiers' Conference.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The distribution of these grants is essentially determined by the Medicare adjusted relativities recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission in its 1993 Report including a further adjustment for the alternative treatment of stamp duty revenues from corporate reconstructions. The Northern Territory and the ACT will receive special revenue assistance funded from the pool of financial assistance  grants of $30 million and $20 million respectively in recognition of the adjustments they face in moving to State-like funding levels.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The use of the Commission's Medicare adjusted relativities reflects understanding reached with the States as part of the new Medicare Agreements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The health funding arrangements under the new Medicare Agreement took account of a number of health factors which were also addressed by the Commission's methodology. Therefore, to implement the new agreement without also amending the Commission methodology to exclude these factors would have involved a significant element of double counting. The impact of the new arrangements on the interstate distribution of Medicare funding was to increase significantly funding to the smaller States at the expense of New South Wales and Victoria. The adjustments to the Commission's methodology were expected to have the opposite effect&mdash;that is, to redistribute financial assistance grants from the smaller States to New South Wales and Victoria. New South Wales and Victoria were given guarantees that this redistribution of financial assistance grants would benefit them by $131 million and $112 million respectively. In the event, New South Wales  benefited from the new relativities, but by significantly less than expected while Victoria actually lost. At the same time, the smaller States and Northern Territory lost significantly less from the Medicare adjustment to the financial assistance grants distribution than was expected. Against this background, it was decided at the Premiers' Conference that the cost of the Medicare guarantee payments to NSW and Victoria would be shared between the Commonwealth and the States.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The contribution from the smaller States is achieved by funding payments totalling $216.6 million to New South Wales  ($72.5 million) and Victoria ($144.1 million) out of the financial assistance grants and hospital funding grants pool. These payments are funded by each State according to its share of the financial assistance grants and hospital funding grants pool. Consequently, funding the payments out of the pool costs New South Wales $62.8 million (29 per cent of $216.6 million) and Victoria $45.5 million (21 per cent of $216.6 million). The Commonwealth will make payments of these amounts to New South Wales  and Victoria totalling $108.3 million thus ensuring that the net benefit to New South Wales  and Victoria will be $72.5 million and $144.1 million respectively. The gross payments to New South Wales and Victoria are therefore $135 million and $190 million respectively.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In 1993-94 these arrangements ensure that the Commonwealth bears approximately half the cost of these guarantee payments and the smaller States the remainder. From 1994-95 until the end of the agreements, the Commonwealth share of the cost of these guarantees will be halved and the remainder borne by the smaller States.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the first time, State-like funding for the ACT will be incorporated into this Bill. In previous years the general revenue grants to the ACT have been funded directly by the  Commonwealth rather than through the financial assistance grants pool. State-like funding for the ACT will be incorporated into the financial assistance grants pool for 1993-94 and the size of the pool has been increased to reflect that change in funding. Special revenue assistance to the ACT of $20 million in 1993-94 will also be funded from the financial assistance grants pool and is included in this Bill. Other payments to the ACT including transitional allowances and special fiscal needs totalling $64 million as well as a further $20 million special revenue assistance will be paid directly by the Commonwealth under the Annual Appropriation Bills.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As noted earlier, the Northern Territory is to be provided with special revenue assistance in 1993-94 of $30 million. In general the relativities recommended by the Commission take account of the particular circumstances facing individual States and Territories. The high per capita relativity recommended for the Northern Territory recognises the higher costs it faces in providing government services to its population. In the medium term this level of funding should be sufficient to enable the Northern Territory to provide the same level of services to its population as enjoyed by people in other States. The purpose of the special revenue assistance is to allow the Northern Territory to adjust to this level of funding from the more generous levels provided in earlier years. It compares with special revenue assistance of around $40 million provided for this purpose in 1992/93 and similar assistance having been provided each year to the Northern Territory since its inclusion in the pool of general revenue assistance for the States.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consistent with arrangements in previous years, financial assistance grants and special revenue assistance will all be adjusted for the difference between the actual increase in the Consumer Price Index in the year to the March quarter 1994 and the forecast at the time of the Premiers' Conference, so that the real level of assistance agreed at the Premiers' Conference is maintained.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In accordance with its priorities and policies in the health education area, the Government decided that, from 1985, nurse education should be progressively transferred from hospitals to higher education institutions. This move has helped to provide a better educated and more flexible nursing work force and to increase the educational and employment opportunities in the nursing profession, particularly for women.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The transfer will be completed this year and from 1 January 1994 the Commonwealth will take over full responsibility for funding of nurse education. This bill gives legislative effect to the reduction in general purpose payments to the States reflecting this transfer in funding responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, from 1 January 1994, the Commonwealth will untie annual funding of $350 million of Commonwealth road  funding for arterial roads. In 1993-94, payment will be $175 million, distributed on the average of the arterial roads allocation for the three years to 1992 (inclusive). In 1995-96 and 1996-97, the aggregate level of funds will be indexed to the movements in financial assistance grants. In 1997-98 the funds will be absorbed into financial assistance grants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also provides for the payment of $330.3 million for capital grants to the States and Territories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill includes one additional feature to the Act it replaces. This bill includes a clause helping to protect the right of Higher Education institutions to decide the most appropriate range and level of services and amenities for their students.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Student organisations provide a wide range of services and amenities for their members, for example counselling, sport, health and careers services. These are funded mainly by a services and amenities fee collected from students by institutions on behalf of organisations representing the interest of students generally.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Western Australian State Parliament recently legislated to interfere with the rights of institutions in that State to make their own decisions about imposing or collecting these fees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill, in conjunction with the Higher Education Funding Act 1988, provides an avenue for the Commonwealth to make up any shortfall in revenue experienced by an institution as a result of such State actions and to recover this money from the States.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this bill is an integral part of the Commonwealth's financial relations with the State Governments and of the Budget.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">WOOL INTERNATIONAL BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are eight bills in this package of wool industry legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, these bills will provide the statutory framework for a much stronger, and commercially driven Australian wool industry. The wool industry's long term future will only be secured as the supplier of a high quality premier textile fibre to world markets if we fundamentally change the industry's structures to provide a more market-driven approach that is more closely attuned to the needs of its customers and end-users.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both the food and the natural fibre industries as presenting the most exciting development opportunities for this country, with the potential to substantially increase value adding, exports and the jobs that go with such developments. We already have in place a strategy for the development of the food industries, through the work of the agri-food council, and the legislation being introduced today will also provide the foundation for the wool industry to also grow and prosper.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In March 1993 the government made an election commitment that an independent review of the role of the wool industry structures would be commissioned. One of the first actions of the government following the election was to establish a review committee to achieve this.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The committee, comprising Professor Ross Garnaut, Mr Rodney Price and Mr Stephen Bennett brought an extensive background in wool industry, economics, trade, business, finance and marketing expertise to the review and presented a comprehensive blue-print for securing the future of the wool industry in August this year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Upon receiving the Wool Industry Review Committee's report, the minister initiated wide ranging consultations with all sectors of the industry and modified the committees recommendations to account for some legitimate industry concerns. The minister has, however, maintained the integrity of the committee's package in the legislation I am presenting today.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Wool International Bill 1993 establishes a new, strongly commercially oriented organisation called Wool International which will assume responsibility for discharging the $2.28 billion debt and disposing of the 3.9 million bale stockpile currently held by the Australian Wool Realisation Commission. It will also be responsible for the development for the industry of a range of forward selling, marketing and risk management mechanisms to provide a broader range of options for wool producers and others in the industry to market their product and manage risk.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Bill 1993 will establish a new Australian wool research and promotion organisation which will be responsible for generic wool promotion and wool research and development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Wool Legislation (Repeals and Consequential Provisions) Bill 1993 will repeal the three acts, the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Act 1991, the Australian Wool Corporation Act 1991, and the Australian Wool Industry Council Act 1991, on which the current wool industry arrangements are based. It amends the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989, to remove provisions relating to wool research and development which will now be encompassed within this new package of legislation. It also amends the Wool Tax (Administration) Act 1964, to require the provision of additional information concerning wool tax paid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The last five bills in the package each amend one of the five wool tax acts to reflect changes in setting wool tax rates necessary with the new industry structures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This legislation reflects an integrated package of measures. Essentially these provide a three pronged strategy for the wool industry designed to</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.establish industry bodies with a clear commercial focus;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">establish new mechanisms for marketing wool,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.expand international trade in wool and wool products through the establishment of an Australian trade and investment package;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This new approach gives a greater emphasis on building demand, promoting quality and reliability to our customers and providing new marketing tools to spread market risk and develop new markets, not only in the growing markets of Asia, but also in our more traditional European markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this package represents a watershed in the development of the Australian wool industry because it establishes the means for enabling the industry to take more direct control over its own destiny. As such it represents a critical step forward towards self-determination and independence for the future. It will see wool producers becoming key shareholders in their own wool marketing company&mdash;Wool International&mdash;supported by a professionally and commercially oriented generic promotion and research organisation, whose activities will be closely linked to those of Wool International to ensure complementarity and full exploitation of market opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the structures embodied in this package reflect on the one hand the commercial thrust the government sees for the industry in the future. On the other, the package reflects the government's continuing commitment to wool industry research and development and, through its maintenance of wool tax legislation, the funding of promotion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Wool International</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, perhaps the most exciting element of the government's proposed measures is the establishment of Wool International. Within it is embodied a mechanism for effectively reducing the wool stockpile to commercial levels; giving producers equity in any residual value, including all wool and non-wool assets, once the associated debt has been acquitted; and largely removing the government from much of its involvement in industry affairs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Wool International is established at the outset as a statutory authority with the intention that it be first corporatised, then privatised, by a target date of 1 July 1997. This is a departure from the recommendations of the wool industry review committee which were that Wool International be established as a 100 per cent government owned company until privatisation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The reason the government has decided on a three phase approach rather than two is because it received legal advice that it would be difficult to move directly to a government owned corporation. Relevant considerations included the extent of the debt that Wool International would have to initially take on and the practical difficulties of achieving corporatisation within a reasonable time frame.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However,  in framing the legislation for Wool International, particular care has been taken to reflect as far as possible the model for government business enterprises (or GBES) so as to ensure that the commerciality of such bodies is a feature of Wool International.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Wool International Bill provides at this stage only the framework for the second phase in Wool International's life, corporatisation. Legal advice on the complexity of these processes means that it is better to leave the detail relating to corporatisation and privatisation until closer to 1997. This represents in the government's view, the more responsible approach. At the same time, by providing the framework we are clearly signalling our broad intentions and our commitment to privatising Wool International.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Wool International's functions will include the development of alternative forward selling, marketing and risk management mechanisms to better enable industry participants to market their product, manage their cash flows and their risks.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the period leading up to privatisation, a key activity of Wool International will be to effectively manage and market the wool stockpile and to reduce the debt.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Fixed disposal schedule</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of the decisions taken in April this year by the government, the Australian Wool Realisation Commission is in a position where it is not required to sell any more wool during 1993-94 to meet its debt reduction schedule. It may however sell further wool if there is sufficient demand.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A central element of the marketing of the stockpile under Wool International will be the imposition of a fixed sales schedule. This is central to the development of forward selling mechanisms and the establishment of wool futures and other commercial risk management tools.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has decided, however, that the fixed schedule will not commence until 1 July 1994. Until that time, Wool International will be required to manage the stockpile in accordance with current policy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The minister has indicated previously that the process of stockpile disposal will be a transparent one. The legislation clearly sets out, for all in the industry, exactly how much wool must be sold in any month or quarter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Although the Wool Industry Review Committee recommended that Wool International be required to release 5 kt per month between 1 November 1993 to 30 June 1994 and then 33 kt per quarter from 1 July 1994 to 30 June 1997, the government has delayed the introduction of the fixed schedule to 1 July 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In deciding to delay the introduction of the fixed schedule to 1 July 1994, the government was concerned to honour its existing commitments regarding stockpile disposal, which apply until 1 July 1994, and to allow more time for the development of forward selling and risk management tools by Wool International. The introduction of a fixed schedule is central to the development of such tools and it is prudent to allow the additional time for this to occur.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">From July 1994 until December 1994, the fixed disposal rate is to be within a narrow range around 5 kt per month. In commercial terms, this translates into the range of 27,700 to 29,100 bales per month. The narrow range has been introduced purely for practical reasons. From 1 January 1995, the disposal rate is to be in the narrow range around 33 kt  per quarter, or 182,000 to 192,000 bales. These ranges represent around 5 per cent of each of the relevant target rates of 28,400 per month and 187,000 per quarter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Wool International will be required to make a public statement monthly and then quarterly on its compliance against the disposal schedule for that month or quarter. This is expected to be a very simple statement although Wool International will have the opportunity to report more fully to industry should it decide on commercial grounds that it should do so. Wool International will not be required to report in detail on its activities in relation to stockpile management. It is intended to be a commercially oriented body and its commercial activities will be treated accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Nonetheless, a confidential and regular reporting process will be required of Wool International by government on its disposal activities and its debt management activities generally while ever the government guarantee is in place. These reports will set out how the disposal schedule has been achieved in the relevant period and how revenue has been utilised. This will also provide government with an ongoing view of the body's debt profile and ensure its operations accord with its charter.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the period between now and July 1994, the government expects Wool International to make significant progress in setting up forward selling and risk management mechanisms for the industry. We appreciate that this will take time, however, the government believes that Wool International should be well advanced in this process by the time the fixed disposal schedule commences. During this period also, Wool International will be able to undertake other activities on a commercial basis. In this context, the government is well aware of the importance of market intelligence and reporting to the industry and, having yet to settle how industry can best undertake these activities in the future, a savings provision has been included in this bill to enable Wool International to continue to perform this Australian Wool Corporation function until 30 June 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Prior to privatisation, Wool International will primarily be a selling organisation. The government does not intend that it be a day-to-day trader in the market place. Neither is it to be a speculator. The minister will be issuing instructions to the board of Wool International that they develop Wool International's selling strategies specifically to meet its requirements under the fixed disposal schedule. The buy-in power would only be used in specific circumstances to meet the legislative requirements of the disposal schedule set out in the act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With regard to the non-wool assets of the industry, the new board of Wool International will have the power to dispose of these should they decide it commercially prudent to do so. On the same basis, such assets may well be retained so that on privatisation, a portfolio of non-wool assets complements the wool assets and the overall net worth of the organisation. In the interim, Wool International will be able to use the revenue stream from these non-wool assets for its commercial activities. This will potentially generate around $25 million per annum of seed capital for its developmental work. However the government expects that as Wool International develops its own revenues from its other commercial activities, the need to draw on these funds will be reduced. The government intends to review Wool International's use of the seed capital in two years time to determine the need for continued access to these funds. Wool International will be required to maintain and report to government on this funding separately.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government will continue to guarantee the borrowings but will include the hedging activities of Wool International as these are related directly to the financial management of the stockpile. This arrangement will be through a statutory guarantee. The guarantee will not apply to any activities outside the stockpile management.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Determination of equity in Wool International</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Producers' payment of the debt component of the wool tax from 1 July 1993 onwards  will give them their equity entitlement in Wool International on privatisation. However, provision will also be made for producers to increase their debt repayment contribution up to a maximum 10 per cent should they wish to acquire additional equity in Wool International.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To establish the equity rights of producers to shares in Wool International, it will be required to keep a register of wool-tax payers. The register will become the share register of Wool International on privatisation. The register will record the details needed to assign such rights, and in future, wool tax payments will need to be accompanied by information on the wool tax payer. Any unclaimed shares will be re-allocated proportionately to all eligible wool producers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On privatisation, shares will be issued to wool tax payers at zero value. Should they subsequently dispose of them they will be liable for capital gains tax. The rationale for this is that the initial tax payment is tax deductible. To allocate shares with an imputed market value would effectively confer on wool tax payers a double taxation benefit.   In respect of voluntary contributions up to 10 per cent of the sale value of wool, the expectation is that they would not be tax deductible and the value of the shares for capital gains tax purposes would be based on the value of the contributions made.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian wool research and promotion organisation</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I will also be shortly introducing the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Bill 1993. This bill will implement the merger of research and promotion that wool producers agreed to at their last AGM and will continue Australia's close involvement in the generic promotion of wool.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government recognises that there may at times be slightly grey areas where the activities of Wool International and AWRAP may impinge on each other. However, it will be relying on the commonsense and business acumen of the boards. The majority of membership of each board will overlap to ensure that, while they each have quite distinct roles to fulfil, there is a close linkage between the two functions. In resolving any potential areas of conflict over functions the government will be relying on the chairpersons to be guided by the underlying philosophy of the proposed new structures that as much as possible of the current functions of the wool corporation should be transferred to the private sector.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Board structures and appointment procedures</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The members of the boards of Wool International and AWRAP will be the key to the success of this package. It is important that the boards not be selected on the basis of representation but on the calibre of their expertise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The boards of AWRAP and Wool International will have a majority of common members. AWRAP will have 9 members while Wool International will have 11 members. Consistent with the wool industry review committee's recommendation there will be a commercial approach to the selection and appointment of the Wool International board and, because of the need for overlap in the boards and the need for appointments to be expertise-based, there will no longer be a selection committee process for AWRAP.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is intended that the minister will appoint members after wide consultation with the business community and with industry groups, including the wool council of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Staffing arrangements</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Staff in the AWC and the AWRC will, in the first instance, become the staff of either AWRAP or Wool International on the establishment of those bodies. This will allow for some staff to be transferred between the two bodies if necessary to ensure the continuation of particular activities. Staff transferred over to the new bodies will be transferred on no lesser terms and conditions than existed prior to the restructuring. Thereafter, staffing matters will be the responsibility of the incoming boards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Wool tax arrangements</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The wool tax rate for debt management purposes is set out in the Wool International Bill at 4.5 per cent and this rate will remain in place until privatisation. This will provide for Wool International to establish a net worth prior to privatisation. The rate cannot now be changed without amending the act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Wool tax rates for promotion and research and development will be 3.5 per cent and 0.5 per cent respectively and will apply for three year periods rather than the current single year. These rates will therefore apply for the period July 1994 to June 1997 unless changed by grower ballot during that period.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The maximum rate of wool tax will remain at 15 per cent to allow flexibility to increase the promotion and research and development components if the industry wishes to do so and thereby not constrain the ability of growers in establishing appropriate rates for promotion and R and D through grower ballot.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the process of making consequential amendments of an administrative nature to the wool tax acts, the government is tightening up on the collection process by requiring that all collectors of wool tax be registered in future. This will ensure that wool tax can only be paid on behalf of Australian wool producers by a registered collector. The change is an important one for the industry particularly in the area of future individual equity rights in Wool International. Such equity rights are to accrue in proportion to wool tax paid for debt management and the process for assigning such rights will need to be as tight as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian Wool Industry Council</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian Wool Industry Council was established to provide a forum for the provision of representative industry advice to the government. The need for such a body will be substantially diminished with the implementation of the proposed new arrangements. The new structures will provide the right communication linkages for the wool industry. Consistent with the wool industry committee's recommendation the Australian Wool Industry Council is therefore to be abolished.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this package of measures represents an exciting shift in wool industry arrangements and I am confident that it has within it the potential to revolutionise the way we regard our wool industry and the way it manages itself.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend this bill to honourable senators and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">AUSTRALIAN WOOL RESEARCH AND PROMOTION ORGANISATION BILL 1993</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill establishes the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation, AWRAP.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I have already outlined how this particular bill fits into the total package of legislation for the wool industry. AWRAP will play a critical part in improving the performance of the Australian wool industry by encouraging the maximum possible co-ordination of the generic promotion of wool and wool products with research and development activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has long held the view that R and D and promotion should be closely linked in order to get proper targeting of the R and D effort and promotion activity. This view is also supported by the wool industry at its last AGM and was subsequently endorsed by the wool industry review committee. The aim is to get a more commercially driven and consumer responsive approach to these activities and this legislation will give effect to this objective.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation makes it quite clear that AWRAP's role is to direct the generic promotion dollar to where it will be most effective, including promoting the use of wool and wool products in Australia and overseas through consumer advertising coupled with the provision of technical advisory services in those markets which require assistance to develop and expand their wool processing industry, using Australian wool.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As well, it will assess research and development needs in relation to the wool industry, and provide funding for this purpose, and will disseminate and encourage the adoption of the results. There is clearly a strong link between the R&amp;D and the promotion activities and the government is pleased to be able to respond to the industry's request that the two functions should be merged.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Generic promotion for AWRAP is envisaged as promotion in its broadest sense and encompassing such activities as consumer advertising, the provision of technical advice and assistance to wool processors, manufacturers and retailers to encourage wool and wool blend product processing and innovation to meet consumer needs, and supporting wool trade marks such as the Woolmark. Generic promotion will also encompass a range of international market development activities both of wool generally and Australian wool in particular where these latter activities are directly related to promotion and are directed to encouraging processors in developing markets to opt for Australian wool rather than other fibres.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summary, AWRAP's activities might be defined as those which promote the use of wool over other fibres but do not extend to direct marketing or sale of wool. Selling wool will be clearly the function of Wool International and other commercial suppliers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the role of AWRAP is clearly focused on generic promotion, there is a need for this activity to be closely integrated with the advertising and brand promotion of companies promoting wool products. In the past, wool promotion funding has depended heavily on funds provided by wool growers and the government. This needs to change and one of the principal goals of the new organisation will be to actively seek additional funding from commercial sources, principally wool processors and companies producing consumer wool products. The Minister has made commitments to the industry that wool promotion will be adequately funded and the new structures provide the opportunity for this to be secured from commercial sources. For example, discussions are continuing with the international wool textile organisation to assess its role in promotion funding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AWRAP will be able to continue its participation in, and fund international promotion activities of, bodies such as the International Wool Secretariat (IWS). The nature of, and level of funding for, such activities will be a matter for the AWRAP board but the expectation is that Australia will continue to play a major role in influencing the policies and strategies of bodies such as the IWS.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While the activities of the Wool Research and Development Corporation will be transferred to AWRAP, the government recognises the success of the operational arrangements of that corporation. Therefore, the sub-structure of advisory and technical committees is expected to be maintained in the short term, although in the longer term this will be a matter for the AWRAP board to determine.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government will continue its matching of the research effort, the funding of which will be separately accounted for as part of the accountability  arrangements  to  apply  to  the  new  organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is also aware that with the downturn in the wool industry and the reduced revenue base derived from the wool tax, it has been difficult to maintain the funding base for both R and D and promotion. In this context, the government is well aware of the difficulties faced by the research and development corporation in trying to accommodate the fluctuating revenue base whilst continuing to provide for ongoing research programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The creation of AWRAP will provide some relief in this respect. AWRAP will have borrowing powers which, should the AWRAP board choose, could be used as a short term smoothing mechanism to alleviate some of the impact of wool tax income  variability  on  suppliers  of  research  services.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has been encouraging  greater commercialisation and comprehensive uptake of new technology and innovation by wool producers and processors. Increased commercialisation of R and D will not only assist in supporting the competitiveness of wool in the world's fibre markets, it will also provide a means of generating additional income for research and development purposes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The promotion and research and development components of the wool tax will both be determined through a ballot of producers, which may be conducted either independently of AWRAP annual general meetings, or in conjunction with them. The timing will be a matter for the board of AWRAP to determine. Provision has been made for the AWRAP board to formally consult with the Wool Council of Australia regarding the appropriate rates of the promotion and research and development components of the wool tax to be put to a ballot of producers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Annual general meetings will be continued for AWRAP only, although Wool International will be able to hold such meetings if decided by its board. The AWRAP AGM will provide the opportunity for wool producers to question the board of the organisation about the performance of its functions and, in the ultimate, provides the sanction of a vote of no confidence in the board. However, no provision has been made to take general motions from the floor of the meeting. There is no sense in such a process unless the outcome was to be binding on the board and that could, on occasions, be in clear conflict with the board's responsibilities under the act for the day to day direction of the organisation. Similar arrangements to those currently in place for the determination of voting rights will apply. However, the information needed to determine voting entitlements will, in future, be drawn by AWRAP from the share register to be maintained by Wool International. Upon privatisation of Wool International the register of wool taxpayers will be passed to AWRAP.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AWRAP will be required to prepare both corporate and operational plans each year and is expected to widely consult with industry in doing so. The corporate plan will define principal goals, outline strategies and nominate performance indicators and must receive ministerial endorsement before coming into effect. The annual operational plan will detail the activities required to give effect to the matters set out in the corporate plan and must also be submitted to the minister.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, most of the proposed changes encompassed within the bills before the House can be implemented immediately.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are, however, two particular areas concerning the transfer of functions which have yet to be settled. These are quality assurance and shearer training.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AWRAP is expected to have a very focused and concentrated approach to generic promotion and not be distracted by a wide range of other activities. It will therefore be an immediate task of the new AWRAP board to drive the process that will ensure the earliest and successful divestment of functions, particularly  those  concerning  quality  management.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To ensure that the transition is effectively made, and that there is no break in continuity in the performance of those functions, the legislation includes savings provisions, the effect of which is to enable AWRAP to continue to perform this function until an orderly transfer can be achieved. The savings provision will apply for no longer than the period to 31 December 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is well aware of the importance of quality assurance to the future of the wool industry. Indeed it has been a strong advocate of the adoption by the industry of a quality management approach to marketing. It therefore has no intention of having the function taken from the Australian Wool Corporation without ensuring that there is a workable, effective arrangement in place for the function to be performed by other bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The intention is to progressively hand over those functions identified for transfer from AWRAP to other bodies which the government, in consultation with AWRAP, deems can effectively take up particular responsibilities. By this means we can ensure a smooth process of divestment from AWRAP, without dislocation of quality assurance and our customers' ability to be reassured about the quality of our product.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The various alternatives will be carefully examined over the coming months during the transfer process. Without being definitive, the divestment process might include a role for the Australian Wool Exchange and the Australian Wool Testing Authority.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It might also be possible given the extent of standards already developed, that an Australian standard could be developed for wool packs and that this be reflected in customs regulations replacing the current reference to the Wool Corporation's involvement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government is confident that the wool industry can, utilising the standards currently in place and developing new ones, bring an industry-wide response to building on and further developing Australia's already high global reputation for premium quality wool.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Wool quality is an industry wide challenge and there are already examples of innovative responses which demonstrate that different sectors are prepared to meet quality goals to better differentiate their product in the marketplace and so attract buyer premiums.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Wool broking companies are already encouraging producers to distinguish their product by meeting predetermined quality standards in the shearing shed and I am aware of the work being done on this by Dalgety and Elders for example. Systems for wool testing in Australia are already regarded as the world's best.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Shearer training has long been organised and funded by the Wool Corporation through the wool tax. The government is already working with the Wool Corporation and relevant training agencies to determine the most cost-effective approach for the future, given the particular nature of shearer training. There is the opportunity to bring shearer training into mainstream technical training approaches, such as through TAFES and to link it in an integrated way to quality assurance systems involving a better understanding of clip preparation for fine wools. The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy expects the industry to actively pursue these opportunities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, a savings provision has also been included to provide for the continuation of funding for exotic animal disease eradication program which is to run through until mid 1995.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conclusion Mr President, with the creation of AWRAP there is the opportunity to better coordinate and commercially focus wool promotion and the R and D effort. The wool industry is facing a period where industry funds for promotion and R&amp;D are at their lowest levels for some time. The more streamlined approach which AWRAP will bring to the industry will allow a better focus on achieving returns for the industry for the benefit of all participants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend this bill to honourable senators and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">     WOOL LEGISLATION (REPEALS AND           CONSEQUENTIAL PROVISIONS) BILL      1993</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this bill is to remove or amend existing wool legislation to allow for the introduction of new legislation to establish wool international and the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This bill repeals the Australian Wool Corporation Act 1991, the Australian Wool Industry Council Act 1991 and the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Act 1991 and sections of the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 relating to the Wool Research and Development Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The bill also provides for arrangements to cover the transitional period between the existing arrangements and the new arrangements, in particular to ensure that staff employed under the current structure retain their terms and conditions of employment,  and  benefits,  under  the  new  structure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I have indicated previously that a significant part of the move towards the wool industry commercialisation is the inclusion of a provision to give producers equity in wool international. The mechanism for establishing the entitlements of producers to shares in wool international on privatisation will require amendments to the Wool Tax Administration Act 1964. Wool brokers, dealers, exporters and manufacturers will be required within 6 months to provide details of tax payers to the tax commissioner who will be in turn required to pass these onto wool international covering the period from 1 July 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other minor amendments to the administration act which have been made provide for greater uniformity in penalties and registration of wool-tax collectors; and reduce the penalty for unpaid tax in line with reductions in tax related penalties in other Commonwealth legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend this bill to honourable senators and present the explanatory memorandum.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">WOOL TAX (Nos 1 to 5) AMENDMENT BILLS 1993</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of these bills is to amend the existing wool tax acts to reflect changes to the wool tax arrangements flowing from changes to the statutory arrangements for the wool industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the current arrangements, in determining the debt repayment component of the wool tax, the views of the Australian Wool Realisation Commission must be taken into account, together with any views expressed by the Wool Council of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly, in determining the wool tax rates to apply for promotion and research and development purposes, account must be taken of the recommendations of the annual general meetings of the Australian Wool Corporation and of the Wool Research and Development Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the new arrangements, the debt component of wool tax is a fixed rate of 4.5 per cent and is included in the Wool International Bill 1993. This will terminate when wool international is privatised. For promotion and research and development tax rates, provision has been made in the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation Bill 1993 that the wool tax rates will remain at their current level of 3.5 per cent and 0.5 per cent respectively unless a ballot of wool producers recommends a change.</PARA>

<PARA>The provisions in the bill concerning credit unions were referred to the committee on 28 September for report by today and the committee has met that timetable. Given that the bill will be debated perhaps later today or tomorrow, I will not take much of the Senate's time in referring to the report, but it is important that I give an overall summary of the committee's conclusions and recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have dealt in some detail with the various terms of reference that were given to us: the role played by credit unions in Australia; their structural operations and community services; the reasons for credit unions being granted a partial tax exemption in 1974; the effect of the taxation treatment proposed by the government on credit unions' capital formation and on their continued provision of financial and community services; the effect of the taxation treatment proposed by the government on asset concentration in both the credit union movement and the retail financial sector, and the implications of this effect upon consumer choice; whether the reasons for the differentiated tax treatment of credit unions and building societies are still valid; and the effects, if any, of the taxation treatment proposed by the government on housing cooperatives and mutual savings banks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee made some general conclusions and recommendations. The main issue of concern to those who provided submissions or oral evidence to the committee was whether the tax exemption should be removed. Senator McMullan told the committee that the decision was an on balance one and that there were arguments in both directions. The committee agreed with this and noted that the arguments have been extensively canvassed for more than a decade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's main argument was that the need to change the practice of the past 20 years arose because some credit unions had become sufficiently large providers of financial services as to create distorting effects in the financial system. This was identified as an emerging trend by the Campbell committee 10 years ago. That committee recommended either that the tax exemption be removed&mdash;its preferred option&mdash;or that, if the exemption were to be retained for social reasons, the membership of credit unions be closely and continuously monitored to ensure that the principle of mutuality was strictly applied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that the larger credit unions are significant providers of financial services in competition with other institutions and, in principle, should be treated like them. It is equally clear that the credit union movement provides social and community services which deserve support. The committee's view is that these two factors need not conflict. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The social and community services supplied by credit unions in most, if not all, cases would be deductible from the tax otherwise payable. Such expenditure would include donations to charitable organisations normally eligible for tax deductibility, sponsorships in the nature of advertising expenditure and, where there is a relatively uneconomic branch and staffing structure as part of a deliberate policy of providing community access and advice, legitimate business expenditure. The committee was told that building societies have supplied many of the same benefits without a section 23G exemption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present tax exemption benefits the majority of credit union members who are in secured, paid employment and is an inefficient way of delivering benefits to those members who are not. The committee believes it should be possible to maintain the benefits provided by the credit union movement while removing the distortion involved in the exemption from tax of income earned by the larger credit unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee raised the issue of treating small credit unions differently and canvassed the comment made by Senator McMullan in answer to that. Despite the arguments, it seemed to the committee that distinguishing between small institutions on the one hand, and medium and large institutions on the other, might be one way of improving the efficiency of delivery of the benefits currently said to result partly from the tax exemption. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee first considered there might be an appropriate discontinuity in the asset range of credit unions which would allow such a distinction to be made. If there had been, it would have been possible to set such an asset level below which the tax exemption would apply and which would be sufficiently low as to not distort decision making while removing all of the very small credit unions from the income tax system. However, figures supplied by the Australian Financial Institutions Commission indicated that there was no such discontinuity and this led the committee to consider an alternative based on a phased exemption from tax for the very small credit unions. Such an arrangement related to taxable income would avoid the problems inherent in a sharp cut-off point. It would be possible to exempt from tax those credit unions with taxable incomes of less than, say, $50,000. The exemption could be phased out so that the full effect of the normal corporate tax rate would apply to credit unions with taxable incomes of more than, say, $150,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If this proposal were adopted, the committee estimates that of the 320 or so credit unions, about 100&mdash;all of them very small&mdash;would be entitled to full or partial tax exemption. Extending this same approach to very small cooperative building societies would be unlikely to add significantly to the cost. In fact, only one or two building societies would fall into this category. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee believes that the differences between the larger and the very small credit unions in terms of their operations and objectives are sufficient to justify consideration of assistance to the latter through the tax system as a matter of social policy. It also believes that the scope for other measures to maintain the social benefits provided by the credit union movement and to remove the competitive disadvantages suffered by credit unions in some areas should be assessed. In particular, the effects of differences in the cost of prudential supervision of different types of entities should be considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The submission of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) stated that the tax exemption was not an appropriately targeted instrument in this case for achieving social or competition policy ends. While there is force in this argument, the submission is silent on what other arm of policy, if any, should be used. The committee believes that the transition period provided in the legislation allows time for such issues to be considered. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To conclude, I will read the committee's recommendations. Firstly:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">that the provisions of the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 1) 1993 concerning the taxation treatment of credit unions be agreed to but that, in view of the strong evidence of differences in the role and structure of the very small credit unions on the one hand and the larger institutions on the other, the Government give serious consideration to moving amendments so that such very small credit unions retain the benefit of a tax exemption and so that very small cooperative building societies are similarly treated;</PARA>
<PARA>Secondly:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">that such amendments exempt from tax those credit unions with taxable incomes of less than, say, $50,000, with the exemption phasing out so that the full effect of the normal corporate tax rate would apply to credit unions with taxable incomes of more than, say, $150,000;</PARA>
<PARA>Thirdly:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">that the Government, in consultation with representatives of financial institutions:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.prepare a statement on how the socially beneficial services currently provided by credit unions will be maintained and on how the competitive disadvantages currently faced by credit unions will be dealt with after the removal of the tax exemption;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.pay particular regard in the statement to means of removing possible inequities in the way in which the costs of prudential supervision of various types of financial institutions are met;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report just presented is the result of an inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration into the removal of the tax exempt status of credit unions. This has naturally raised considerable concern within the community. It clearly came as a considerable surprise to the credit union industry when the government removed, without warning, a tax concession which had existed for about 20 years. Despite the very tight timetable for this inquiry, 28 individuals and organisations thought it important enough to provide written submissions. The committee heard both sides of the argument at length from a range of witnesses at its public hearing on Friday, 8 October.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the deputy chairman of the committee, I would like to take this opportunity to thank Senator Coates, the chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, for his independent assessment of what was a politically charged issue. I believe the final outcome&mdash;a consensus report&mdash;was largely attributable to his independent assessment of the importance of the issues that were before the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two main issues have been raised since the government announced the removal of the tax concession for credit unions in the last budget. The first relates to whether the decision was appropriate or correct; the second concerns the way the government went about its removal. There are arguments both ways on the merits of the decision. Some credit unions have grown very large and are fully competitive with other financial institutions. The 18 largest credit unions now have asset levels exceeding $150 million. The largest has more than $370 million in assets. It seems illogical that credit unions of this size should continue to be subsidised by the Australian taxpayer through the non-payment of income tax. It would certainly be illogical to base any continuation of the subsidy on the needs of the smallest credit unions. Nevertheless, the government must continue to exempt the small credit unions when their role is significantly social in character and the lending process is but one area of their work in society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee heard very convincing evidence on the value of the social contribution made by the small community based, and often church based, credit unions. This contrast between the role and structure of the smaller and the larger credit unions led the committee to the alternative approach proposed in its report&mdash;that it seemed reasonable to exempt a certain amount of the income of credit unions from taxation. This would relieve the small institutions from any tax on their operations, which clearly are not primarily commercial. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the tax-free threshold applied to the whole credit union sector, it would provide some compensation for all credit unions for the higher cost of prudential supervision which they face when compared with banks. The government must recognise the changing part of the regulatory and taxation structure, even if there is a case for a change in isolation which might lead to some unintended consequences. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has recommend that the government consider a phasing out of the tax-free threshold and report back to the parliament on a means of removing the competitive disadvantage posed by differentials in prudential supervision costs. I would urge the government to consider the advantages of simply extending the tax-free threshold to all credit unions. The additional cost to revenue would be negligible and would completely avoid the distortion of a phasing out system. It should not have been necessary for the committee to recommend that the government go back and consult with the industry on better ways of achieving its ends. The problems have arisen in this case because of the government's approach to the issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Witnesses with strong connections to the labour movement told the committee how they were astonished about this change and how it had occurred without consultation. The credit unions&mdash;wrongly, as it turned out&mdash;had relied on the government's promise before the last election that there would be no new taxes. One witness told us:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we believed that we would at least have had the chance to put our case fully in the type of . . . consultative process that has been a consistent </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">hallmark of this government's activity over the last 10 years.</PARA>
<PARA>Unfortunately, that consultative process was not present on this occasion. We all accept the need for confidentiality of budget measures but the amount of revenue involved in this case is trivial. The issues are complex and there was no need to rush into legislation. The legislation does not even have any effect this financial year. The government should have consulted with credit unions on this proposal before committing itself to the details of that approach. Its own strong supporters expected that it would. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pay tribute to the evidence that was presented by a distinguished former member of the House of Representatives, Mr Vince Martin. He was a top executive within the Australian Taxation Office before taking his place in the House of Representatives. Mr Martin, a life member of the ALP, told us that he thought it would be political suicide for the government to persist in this cause. The ACTU and the Victorian and New South Wales trades hall councils have condemned it. I recommend that honourable senators and listeners read the evidence given by Mr Vince Martin where he detailed the history of the development of the credit union movement in Australia following the return of a number of distinguished servicemen after World War II. </PARA>

I have attended many hearings on a wide variety of issues. The evidence that was given to the committee by both sides&mdash;the building societies and the credit unions&mdash;was of an extremely high quality, and they addressed with vigour and hard facts the issues before the committee. I join Senator Coates and my colleague Senator Watson in commending those people who attended the committee hearing and gave evidence to the committee.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I would like to comment on a couple of matters which came before the committee. The first relates to why we had this particular hearing. It was clear from the evidence that was given to the committee that the credit unions did not expect a Labor government to impose this type of tax. Senator Watson pointed out that the representatives of the credit unions sought assurances from the coalition parties that no such tax would be imposed. When they heard the promises of Mr Keating, reiterated time and again during the election campaign, that there would be no new taxes, they naturally assumed that such a promise applied to them and they could rest safe in the comfort of knowing that no such levy would be imposed on credit unions. This is despite the fact that, as Senator McMullan said to the committee, this had been discussed for a long time and had been an issue. Senator McMullan was quite right to raise that. The credit unions took great comfort from the promise and commitment from Mr Keating that no further taxes would be imposed. Like so many others in the community, regrettably, they are paying the price for the broken promises of the Keating Labor government. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;And indeed wine. If Senator Coates had done that, he would not be sitting on that side of the chamber; he would be sitting on this side of the chamber. The reality is that his Prime Minister and senior ministers went around promising the Australian people that there would be no new taxes and no further increases in taxes. That was the impression that the Labor Party sought to create all through the election campaign.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One reason why the Keating government has no moral authority in this country is that the Australian people recognise that they were fooled. The credit unions and all those who use cars and public transport were fooled because of the new taxes. The wine industry was also fooled because it relied on the promises of Mr Keating. It has been a heavy lesson. Australians will never again trust the promises of Mr Keating, and correctly so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Keating has treated the Australian public with a cynicism which I do not believe we have seen before in this country. He won the election on the promise of no new taxes and then proceeded to apply a vast new range of taxes. It is no wonder that this government has no moral authority. The credit unions are paying the price that so many other people who are providing goods and services are paying in this country, because they believed Mr Keating's assurances. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A reading of the report's recommendations clearly shows just how flawed is this proposal to impose taxation on credit unions. The evidence before the committee shows that there are a great many unresolved and difficult issues. The committee brought down its report, pointing to the classic, major problem in relation to the small credit unions, which would have emerged had the government decided to consult with the people involved. The committee has addressed that issue and indicated to the government that amendments will have to be made to the legislation to remove the particular problems which relate to the small credit unions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter goes further than that because the recommendations show a number of other serious issues that have to be addressed. How do we maintain the socially beneficial services of the credit unions? In imposing this tax, are we putting the credit unions at a seriously competitive disadvantage compared with other financial institutions, such as building societies, banks, and so on?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has called on the government, before the 1994 budget, to examine these issues, take the time and decency to consult with the people who will be affected and to find out, after proper consideration, how these problems can be effectively addressed. The committee has identified that these are serious problems which the government clearly did not consider when it brought in the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recommendations suggest that the government, in consultation with the representatives of financial institutions, should pay particular regard to the ways of removing possible inequities so that the cost of prudential supervision for the various types of financial institutions is met. The committee received a great deal of evidence on that issue. Again, it is a difficult problem to resolve in the context of a hearing. Nonetheless, it is important that further study be given to it to see whether the problem can be resolved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee saw serious problems with the government's budget initiative of imposing this tax on credit unions. It has asked the government to go back and look at it again so that the problems which we heard in evidence before the committee can be appropriately considered out of the budget context and dealt with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think the inquiry was well conducted. I commend the people who gave evidence to the inquiry. They effectively drew to the attention of the committee some very real problems. In the time available, the committee was clearly unable to resolve those problems. But appropriately it has called on the government to look once again at this initiative so that the problems which should have been sorted out before the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) announced his budget do not recur. One Labor supporter described this budget as a defence of the indefensible; yet another described it as an act of bastardry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are real issues involved and the committee has pointed to them. My colleagues and I&mdash;and I hope, for a change, people on the Labor back benches&mdash;will look closely at these issues. After all, many Labor supporters are directly affected by this initiative. We know that if Mr Keating had kept his promises, we would not have this problem before this chamber today. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The credit unions, building societies, banks and, specifically, as Senate Watson said during his remarks, people like Vince Martin and some of the other people who have a strong stake and personal commitment to this issue put forward their cases exceptionally well. I say that quite genuinely, not only in relation to Vince Martin and some of the other witnesses, but also to the credit unions whose representatives put forward their position exceptionally well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One could sense the frustration in their evidence for the reason that Senator Kemp put forward. They had had no idea that the dark cloud of this tax was looming on the horizon. It was an absolute surprise to them when, on budget night, this new tax befell their industry. One can understand the anger and angst experienced by the credit unions during this period. I think it was a great credit to all their representatives that their evidence was put so sensibly and clearly and argued so well on Friday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleagues have covered most of the points that need to be made in relation to the report. However, the $50,000 income cut-off exemption that the committee is strongly recommending for small credit unions&mdash;I call them small; the report calls them very small&mdash;is, in my opinion and that of my colleagues, a minimalist approach. It needs to be seen as a starting point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Clearly, if the government accepts the strong recommendation of the committee, there need to be constructive and urgent consultations with the credit union industry, particularly the smaller credit unions, as to the most effective way of distinguishing in the tax system between small, medium and large credit unions. I urge the government and the Minister representing the Treasurer (Senator McMullan), who has carriage of the legislation through this place, to seek those consultations as a matter of urgency. I urge them to conduct the consultation and constructive dialogue which was clearly missing before the budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before the last federal election there was a great distinction between the approaches of the coalition and the government to matters of public policy. The coalition entered into one of the biggest dialogues and consultations in Australian political history over matters of tax policy. We discussed and debated quite publicly with just about every industry sector the approach we would take to taxation and how it would affect their industries. The government did not do any of that. The government had a secret agenda. It had a bottom-of-the-drawer tax policy which no-one knew about until budget night. Sitting in the Great Hall at the budget dinner, I was particularly horrified when I heard the Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, announce many of these tax measures. I know that thousands and thousands of citizens across Australia were equally shocked. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The petition that the credit unions put together on this issue&mdash;I think in excess of a quarter of million people have signed the petition opposing this measure&mdash;is an indication of the anger that many people are feeling towards the government on these unannounced bottom-of-the-drawer tax policies that were thrust upon them on budget night without any notice or consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat my call that, if the government accepts the unanimous recommendation of our committee that the tax exemption be continued and phased in for smaller credit unions, there be some constructive consultation over the coming weeks to determine the right cut-off levels for the exemption. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today the Senate has before it the Custom Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993 and the Excise Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993. The purpose of both of these bills is to increase either customs duty or excise duty payable on tobacco, tobacco products and certain petroleum products. The increases will occur in stages according to formulae specified in the bills. While both bills refer to deficit reduction, I wish to stress to the Senate that there is no deficit reduction in the current year to 30 June 1994.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many commentators have tried to blame the fragility of the value of the Australian dollar on the Senate's handling of the budget bills. A more correct assessment would be that the value of the Australian dollar is actually being affected by the lack of concern of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for the main economic worries of this country. Mr Keating appears to be preoccupied with non-mainstream economic issues such as the republic, the Australian flag and Mabo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of major concern to the coalition though is the effect of the increase in the fuel levy, as designated by these bills. On Friday, 30 September the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration heard from over a dozen different organisations that will bear the brunt of the regressive and poorly designed measures in the customs tariff and excise tariff deficit reduction bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its submission to the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration, Nabalco, the large aluminium producer in the Northern Territory, stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new Budget impost cannot help but emphasise the heightened sovereign risk of investing in mining and mineral processing in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Overseas investor perceptions about the stability of investing in Australia will be further eroded by almost a doubling of the excise. Indeed, one could hardly blame Nabalco if it were to review its recently announced decision to establish the regional headquarters of its parent company in Sydney. The government is always telling us how it wants companies to make their Asian regional headquarters in Australia. This government is going the right way about putting everybody off side with discriminatory taxes like this one on fuel oil. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite obvious that the consequences of the impact of the increase in the fuel levy had not been examined prior to the drafting of the legislation. Neither the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins) nor the Minister for Tourism and Minister for Resources (Mr Lee) knew about it until it was announced&mdash;still less were they or their departments consulted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nabalco, the aluminium producer at Gove in the Northern Territory, is a case in point. As a heavy user of fuel oil, and with no recourse to the use of natural gas, the levy will add $25 million to the cost of its operation. Recently over $100 million was spent in reducing product costs there by $10 per tonne. This increase will raise costs by $15 per tonne and will make competition in a recessionary environment much more difficult. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When members of the committee asked whether or not the witnesses had taken into account the savings to be gained through the company income tax cuts, the unanimous verdict was that the excise tax increases far outweighed any advantage from the company tax rates. For example, in the case of Nabalco, its 70 per cent owner, Swiss Aluminium Australia Ltd, earned $4 million in 1992. The lower tax rate will save $200,000, whereas the increased cost of fuel is $25 million. The increase in the fuel levy alone will wipe out the benefits to Nabalco of a decade of hard won micro-economic reform in an important value adding industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also put on record that during the committee hearings even the Minister for Science and Small Business, Senator Schacht, was surprised to find that about half the entire burden of the massive proposed increase in the fuel oil excise will fall on the single enterprise, the Nabalco joint venture. In fact, the minister referred to it as the `Nabalco tax'. This surprise is evidence of the small number of ministers who are dreaming up tax measures in the 1993 budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fuel oil hits Nabalco much harder than any of its Australian competitors, all of whom have access to natural gas. Nabalco does not have a gas supply alternative. In Nabalco's view, the fuel oil duty must constitute one of the most offensive transgressions ever of the principle of non-discriminatory treatment in taxation. In 1968 in the Gove agreement the Commonwealth undertook to `use its best endeavours' not to impose discriminatory taxation on the project. There is little sign of any such endeavours in the present budgetary scene. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am told that Nabalco has been trying to get in touch with government ministers ever since the budget was announced. To date there have been no replies, even though I am told that the Treasurer's office undertook to consult Nabalco further. Even Senator Collins has told this chamber more than once that the matter is under consideration. But there is no sign of any outcome of that consideration. We can conclude only that these ministers have lost heart and decided that it is all too hard for them. Similarly, we have no indication from the Australian Democrats about their position. All we hear from them is endless talk about leaded petrol. Do they care when a grossly discriminatory tax is imposed which puts a major question mark over an already uncertain investment climate in this country?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A minority report produced after the hearings by me and by my colleagues Senator Campbell and Senator Kemp showed that the bills have a number of flaws. The government, by a stroke of the pen, has imposed taxes that have completely offset the benefits of micro-economic reform in three areas&mdash;coastal shipping, road transport and industry productivity improvement measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measures impose large, unexpected and highly discriminatory cost increases in particular industries, often after management and unions within those industries have made progress in enterprise bargaining and reform to work practices based on previously understood cost levels. As a consequence, the government is now appropriating to itself most or all the benefits of hard won efficiency gains in some industries, thus reducing an incentive to reform in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is best shown not only by the already mentioned Nabalco reforms, but also by the reforms that the government has achieved in the area of Australian coastal shipping under the auspices of the Shipping Industry Reform Authority between 1989 and 1992. That program saw a reduction in average crewing levels on Australian ships from 27.9 to 20.5. That is a 26.5 per cent reduction in manning costs over three years, and I acknowledge that that is a notable achievement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the second and last stage of the reform program now under way, an agreement was reached with the maritime unions on 19 August 1993 to further reduce crewing levels to 19. This exceeds the target of 18.5 set by the government. This could save $270,000 per ship per annum and further reduce the cost of coastal shipping. But five days after this agreement with the unions, which was done under the auspices of the government, the budget increased the excise on marine fuel for ship propulsion. This equates to a total percentage increase of 92 per cent, an outrageous amount when compared with an increase of 18.8 per cent in excise on petroleum and automotive diesel fuels. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increase in marine fuel excise will increase the fuel bill for an average coastal ship by $360,000 per annum, amounting to $16.1 million per annum across the whole of the Australian coastal shipping fleet. It needs to be noted that ships on international voyages do not pay the excise. Within five days of overseeing an agreement to reduce manning costs under its own shipping reform program, the government has not only completely wiped out those reform savings but has also added to shipping costs. That saving of $270,000 per ship per annum as a result of crew reductions has been countered by an immediate tax impost of $360,000 per annum per ship. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The finance and public administration committee hearing with respect to these bills heard that what might appear to be small increases in the absolute level of the cost of fuel will, in reality, have a disproportionately large percentage effect on the cost structures of some of the firms and the industries. The committee heard that it will cause serious regressive and inequitable effects between individuals on different levels of income and between different regions of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result there is a high likelihood that the fuel increase levy will increase unemployment. The National Farmers Federation reported that the well-known Orani general equilibrium model of the Australian economy suggests a possible increase of 30,000 in the level of unemployment. In particular, there will be a heavy cost burden imposed on inputs to exports and import substituting industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The National Farmers Federation advises that, in agriculture, the budget's increases in excise will impose costs of more than $70 million and will reduce net farm income by four per cent. In industries which are heavily dependent on transport, such as the northern cattle industry, where transport costs comprise about 15 per cent of farm costs, the effect will be even more pronounced. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The NFF further advises that, at a broader level, increasing fuel taxes in the Australian economy, which is geographically large and comprises a relatively high proportion of fuel intensive activities, will have disproportionate effects on the recovery of growth and employment. What is clear is that many of the worst effects were not taken into account by the government in the preparation of its budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My home state of Tasmania, in particular, will be seriously affected by the increase in the fuel excise. Let me outline a few of the effects on the mineral processing industries. A number of companies will be affected: for example, Savage River Mines, Comalco Aluminium at Bell Bay, Tasmanian Electro Metallurgical Co. Pty Ltd and Pasminco Metals-EZ are all heavy users of fuel oil. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The possible early closure of the Savage River iron ore mine and the loss of 300 jobs has been mooted. Savage River Mines has stated that the full impact of the fuel excise increase in 12 months will bring forward the planned 1997 closure of its open-cut mine to as soon as next year and will cause an underground expansion which may have prolonged the mine for another 10 years to be abandoned. The fuel excise will add $600,000 to direct operating costs to August 1994 and a further $840,000 from August 1994. Senators from Tasmania who do not oppose this measure carry a very heavy burden of responsibility. I refer particularly to Senators Murphy, Coates, Denman, Devereux, Sherry and Bell. They all carry a heavy responsibility for the problems in Tasmania arising from this iniquitous and regressive tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Comalco, in its submission to the Senate inquiry, expressed concern that unpredictable taxation behaviour by state or federal governments may affect the viability of a redeveloped smelting operation. The misguided excise increase on fuel oil by the federal government has sent the wrong message to Comalco. All major Tasmanian mines and mineral processors are dependent on coastal shipping for the import of production inputs from the mainland and the export of final products. The industry is responsible for about 44 per cent of tonnages shipped through Tasmanian ports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another 33 per cent of Australian coastal shipping task is used for the shipment of petroleum products and crude oil where the excise on fuel used by tankers adds to the cost of production and the cost of fuel. The overall result to the population of Tasmania will be that the goods carried on these ships will have to bear the costs. Therefore, it is expected that the extra fuel bill will inevitably flow through to freight costs. We are told that the average grocery bill in Tasmania will rise by a minimum of $3 a week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally, the effect of the increased excise in marine fuel will reduce the competitiveness of Tasmanian industry in relation to both international and mainland producers, and thus further increase the loss of employment and the potential for new investment in Tasmania. Therefore, as the Tasmanian Chamber of Mines has submitted, along with the many other organisations who appeared before the committee, the fuel excise should not be increased on the grounds that it is patently unreasonable in itself. The increase is contrary to federal government policy of encouraging investment in value added export industries. Where is former Senator Button? We are missing him at present in terms of his call for value added industries. The increase will add severely to the international perception of sovereign risk associated with Australian investment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The message is more severe and stronger the further one gets from the capital cities, because it is the remote and decentralised areas that will be affected most by this fuel excise. Not only is shipping affected by the fuel levy, but also representatives from the Road Transport Forum told the committee how transport will be affected. The forum stated that this increase negates the efficiency gains made by Australian unions and business over the last few years as Australian industry tries to become more competitive on the world stage. The tax will gravely impact on Australia's economic, road safety, social and environmental record. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The forum condemned the federal government's action as increasing the cost of providing jobs for Australians. This tax is contrary to the statements made by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) in his budget speech on the need to make Australia more competitive and to remove what he said was the `tyranny</PARA>
<PARA>of distance'. In other words, we need to provide Australia with a cheap and efficient road transport system. It is only with a cheap and efficient non-urban road transport industry that regionally based industries and regional communities can afford to survive. With a cheap and efficient non-urban road transport industry, Australia can promote regional development. This is vital in developing decentralised value adding industries and, therefore, regional communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The application of this excise will increase diesel fuel costs for non-urban transport operations by $40 million for the balance of 1993-94 and by almost $90 million with the application of the full 5c per litre increase. It needs to be noted that every tonne of value added product from the farm to the finished product is moved by road. Every box of cereal, every litre of milk, every kilo of vegetables and every export product gets from the farm to the process factory, to the warehouse and to the retail outlet through the efforts of non-urban road transport operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Consequently, the coalition will be moving amendments with regard to the increase in the fuel levy. I will seek leave for two tables to be incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> which summarise our proposed amendments to be moved in the committee stage of the debate.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We could agree certainly with a few of the closing remarks made by Senator Watson in relation to developing alternative and newer industries, but we believe that what he has indicated is really looking in the wrong direction. As I will show during my speech on the Customs Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993 and the Excise Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993, the government has a rare opportunity available to it, through the excise which it will collect on fuel, which it should grasp with both hands. It has the opportunity to develop an alternative fuel industry in this country, to remove the lead from petrol altogether and place Australia, once and for all, on the basis of a sustainable fuel for automotive transport.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before I begin, let me observe that the fuel we are talking about is fossil fuel&mdash;fuel which, by its very nature, is non-renewable; fuel which was laid down many hundreds of millions of years ago as carbon in the atmosphere, removed from the atmosphere and secreted away in the form of coal and oil to give us the atmosphere that we enjoy today with a relatively higher oxygen content. We are, as everybody knows, progressively removing those fossil carbon deposits by burning them and putting them back in the atmosphere. Science tells us that this will have quite disastrous consequences for later generations in terms of the greenhouse effect, to say nothing of the effect on many other creatures, on our agricultural production, on the sea level and so on and so forth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has frequently paid lip-service to the idea of sustainability. The government has also indicated that it is committed to the notion of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 20 per cent compared with 1988 by the year 2005. We have seen very little activity in this area. In the transport areas, in particular, we have seen no action whatsoever on the part of government. With the excise included in these bills, the government has an opportunity not only to make that transition, but also to find the money to make that transition possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The principle of sustainability means that future generations should have the same options available to them in relation to access to energy that this generation has. Clearly, by using up fossil fuel we are running counter to that principle of sustainability. The concern over greenhouse means that as far as possible we should be attempting to maintain an atmosphere for future generations which is not dissimilar to the atmosphere that we enjoy today and which the other between four million and 30 million creatures on this planet have become well adapted to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The use of fossil fuel is also very polluting in other ways. The major source of air pollution in all our urban centres is the use of fossil fuel in private motor vehicles. In the case of Australia, which is not self-sufficient in its supply of fossil fuel for motor transport, we are importing $3.1 billion or more worth of petroleum each year. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To pick up Senator Panizza's interjection, if we can develop indigenous sources of fuel then of course we will be that much better off. As I will show, it is within our ability to provide those sources.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I have said so far relates specifically to the actual fuel content of the petroleum material which we use. In addition, for many decades Australia has added lead to its petroleum. As we now know, lead is a disastrous component of the atmosphere, with particular reference to the intellectual and mental development of young children. The National Health and Medical Research Council, in a recent report, indicated that children are likely to lose some two to five points of intelligence quotient for every 10 micrograms per decilitre of lead in blood and that children in inner urban areas frequently have such high levels of lead that their intellectual and mental development will be retarded as a direct consequence of the lead that we add to our fuel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Australia has by world standards extremely high levels of lead in its fuel, particularly in some of the country areas, but also in the urban areas. Compared with the US levels of lead of 0.026 grams per litre, Australia, with the minimum level of 0.3 grams per litre of lead, has well over 10 times the allowable level in the US, and yet that level of lead in the US is sufficient to provide the valve protection properties which have been discovered for lead. Ninety per cent of the urban air pollution with lead comes from the use of lead  in  petrol.  So  we  have  a  serious problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has tackled this problem by introducing a price differential between leaded and unleaded fuel, which initially will be 1c and which in August next year will go to 2c. We support that price differential, but we say to the government that in introducing that differential it has only done half the job. Some 55 per cent of all the petroleum used in Australia by private motor vehicle operators at present is leaded fuel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We know that there is a proportion of cars which requires a higher octane fuel. At this stage that proportion seems to be unknown. I am distressed by the inability of state motor vehicle registration authorities to provide figures as to the makes and models of cars which require a higher octane fuel. Given that fact, it is not possible to say how much of that 55 per cent of motor vehicles using leaded fuel at the moment require a fuel of higher octane and how many would be able to immediately switch to unleaded fuel. It is thought that perhaps some 25 per cent of vehicles in Australia would be of a make and model which would require a higher octane than the 92 octane unleaded fuel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The imposition of a 2c differential will be sufficient to cause&mdash;and all the evidence indicates that it is the case&mdash;those who are currently using leaded fuel but whose cars can equally use unleaded fuel to shift to unleaded fuel. That will substantially reduce the amount of lead in the atmosphere. But to leave the situation at that point is to do only half the job. Those people who are driving the older cars&mdash;because all cars post-1986 are mandated to use unleaded fuel&mdash;are most likely to be the people less able to upgrade to a newer car or a new car so that they can use unleaded fuel. They are likely to require the use of those vehicles and, with the government program as it is, the government is providing no light at the end of the tunnel, no solution to the problem of these people continuing to use leaded fuel, no solution to the continuing problem of air pollution in our cities, with the large amounts of lead in the atmosphere because of the high concentration of lead in Australian fuels. The government needs to do more than simply put 2c on leaded fuel. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats are seeking from the government a substantial boost to an indigenous fuel industry which will simultaneously solve the problem of lead in petrol and give us an indigenous source of fuel that will help to address the problem of fuel imports. This will provide us with another industry which, particularly in regional centres, will provide employment. It will provide farmers with another source of income, another source of sale of many products. It will establish new technology which will help Australia in many other ways. This is precisely the industry which other countries have developed, that is, the industry of using alcohol as a mixture in petroleum. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The so-called gasohol mix is in wide use in the States. Eight to nine per cent of all the fuel used in America is alcohol petroleum mixes. It is used extensively in many other countries. Brazil has gone all the way and has cars running entirely on alcohol. Alcohol by its very nature, used in an internal combustion engine, adds no greenhouse gas whatsoever to the atmosphere. The carbon dioxide which is taken up by  plants making the sugars is precisely the same carbon dioxide which is released when that fuel is burnt in an internal combustion engine. Ten per cent alcohol in petrol, which is the standard mix, adds three numbers of octane to the fuel. So 92 octane unleaded with 10 per cent alcohol added to it would be 95 octane petrol, which would be usable in not all but most of the cars on the road which currently use leaded fuel and which require that higher octane. </PARA>

The 10 per cent of alcohol which would be used in the fuel will add nothing at all to the greenhouse gas emissions. Once this industry is established and as production exceeds the demand to replace lead in fuel the product can replace petroleum in the rest of the fuel supply. Given that, one can progressively change our demand from petroleum fuel to ethanol fuel for transport. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remark in passing that ethanol has also been used in a mixture with diesel fuel. Several buses in this city are running on a mixture of 15 per cent alcohol in diesel, so-called diesohol. Buses are also running in Sydney on the same mix. Farm machinery and a whole fleet of trucks are running on the same mix. The vehicle which won the recent greenhouse trials was an unmodified heavy duty vehicle running on 15 per cent alcohol in diesel. It beat, by 25 per cent, the greenhouse emissions of a heavily modified heavy duty vehicle running on compressed natural gas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The use of ethanol also reduces emissions of other pollutants from internal combustion engines&mdash;carbon monoxide and nitrogen oxides&mdash;because the engine runs a great deal cooler. The same applies to diesel engines. As I said, it reduces our need for imported fuel, thus reducing our trade deficit, it increases our independence and, particularly in the farming area, it provides a large number of industries in regional centres which can be based on wastes from farming production. Therefore, it increases regional employment and generates new technology. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this particular point let me say, lest I be misunderstood, that I am not looking to a long-term fuel alcohol industry based on substituting production of grains and so on for alcohol production for the production of foods for human consumption. The technology which is currently being developed in Australia based on the use of cellulose materials for alcohol production is indeed a very exciting technology. It means that waste material such as straw, sawdust, paper and small thinnings from tree lots&mdash;a whole array of materials&mdash;can be fermented to alcohol for fuel. The cost of alcohol under such conditions would be very competitive with petrol, as it is at present. That greatly expands the availability of alcohol as a renewable indigenous fuel which in no way will compete with food production&mdash;in fact, in many cases it will actually complement it&mdash;and will provide farmers with an alternative source of income. </PARA>

Senator Coulter said the issue was how to reduce lead. I do not deny that that is an issue. I think we have, over a number of years, had varying degrees of effectiveness in addressing that issue. It is a real issue. But I think the real issues that we have before this chamber are: how can we create jobs in Australia; how can we make our industry more efficient; and how can we increase the household disposable incomes of Australian families? Those are the sorts of issues which are really before this chamber and which are intimately tied up with the customs and excise bills which we are debating, particularly with the increases in fuel taxes.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before any comment is made on the detail of the legislation before us, I think the chamber has to remind itself about the whole question of ethics, honesty and mandates in government. Mr Acting Deputy President, you would be aware, as indeed would every senator, that during the election campaign&mdash;this has been said before in this chamber today&mdash;the promise was that there would be no new taxes. You would be aware that for about 12 months, as the debate raged before and after the election, Mr Keating said that he could deliver all his tax cuts without putting up taxes. Just to take one example, Mr Keating said that the incidence of tax would not rise; he said, `What I'm promising is not to put up tax'. That is a very clear promise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there is any dispute about the policy of the Labor government leading up to the election and during the election campaign, I wonder whether any Labor senator could stand up in this chamber and say, `We would have won the election had we revealed that we were going to raise taxes across the broad range of the Australian economy&mdash;all wholesale sales taxes up, fuel taxes up, wine taxes up and credit unions will be taxed'. I suggest to Senator Loosley or Senator Carr, who may speak on this, that when they stand up&mdash;and we are being broadcast today&mdash;they should indicate to the Australian people, to the chamber and to the people in the gallery whether they believe that the election gave them a clear mandate to carry out these policies. </PARA>

But I wonder whether there has ever been an election where the moral authority of the government has been so compromised in such a short period after winning it. A lot of hassling and complaining has been heard from Labor ministers in this chamber and in the House of Representatives about the problems the Senate is causing. My view is that the Senate is attempting to at least mitigate the savage damage that this budget will cause to Australian industry and families.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But another important element to the debate is that this chamber has a mandate to keep governments honest. If the government wins an election having promised that it will not increase taxes, I think it is reasonable, when it introduces bills to massively raise taxes, that this chamber should look very carefully at such legislation. The bills before us will raise in the order of $1.4 billion. The excise increase on fuel is very big bickies. It is a very savage impost. </PARA>

Mr Gittins came to this conclusion by saying that the net indirect tax effect of the Fightback package by increasing indirect taxes after the removal of whole host of indirect taxes was $2 billion, whereas the taxes in the Keating budget will have the ultimate effect of raising indirect taxes by some $3 billion.

This is all from a government that promised that there would be no new taxes, to use Mr Keating's words.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it has become clear from the evidence that was given to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration that, when one looks across whole sectors of the Australian economy, the effect of these taxes on industry is quite dramatic. We heard evidence from the Road Transport Forum, the National Transport Federation, the Australian Automobile Association, the Australian Bus and Coach Association, the Australian National Maritime Association, the Mining Industry Council and the National Farmers Federation, to mention a few. They all came and showed the committee the effect that these taxes will have on their particular sectors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not surprising that when taxes are raised it increases the costs of doing business, it makes Australian industry less competitive with imports and makes it more difficult for Australian industry to export. All of that is, of course, entirely predictable. What I do not think was well understood when these taxes came in was just how savage the effect on particular sectors could be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, Mr Payne of the national maritime industry presented evidence to the committee which was really quite traumatic. The coastal shipping industry is a major transporter of goods, services and minerals around the coast of Australia. Quite rightly, because of the inefficiencies in this sector, there has been a major effort by the government to bring about cost reductions in the industry, well recognising that it is going to be very difficult for Australia to compete if our shipping sector is not efficient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">After a number of years of great effort, negotiations and what have you, the government very recently announced agreements with the unions to remove a further 2.46 berths from the average Australian ship. It may not seem enormously dramatic, but the cost savings of that particular agreement totalled $270,000 per annum per vessel. Translated into cost savings, that was quite a dramatic saving. But within days of the budget being announced, Mr Keating's new taxes&mdash;the hidden taxes, the secret agenda, the taxes in the bottom drawer, as Senator Campbell said&mdash;were pulled out. The excise on heavy fuel taxes would increase the average cost of running a vessel by $358,000 per annum. After all these negotiations with the unions, the industry saves $270,000, yet the following day the government whacks on massive increases in heavy fuel taxes so that, even after the savings, it costs $358,000 to run the same ship. So all of those micro reforms are all wiped out by this particular tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was no wonder that the mining industry made, I thought, a very important submission that highlighted to the committee the savage effect on that sector. It will cost more to ship iron ore from Western Australia to New South Wales steelworks, inflating the cost of steel on both domestic and international markets. Those that work in the great steelworks of Australia will find, again, the security of their jobs in that sector put at even more risk. Domestic steel products will be more expensive in many states&mdash;great for our exports! There will be an increase in the shipping costs to process manganese from the Northern Territory into ferromanganese at the BHP plant in north-eastern Tasmania. Again, great for that sector of the industry!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We saw the farming industry produce another series of statistics. The farming industry believes that the effect of these taxes on its sector will be quite dramatic and will raise very substantially the cost of farming. Mr Goucher from the National Farmers Federation pointed out to the committee that it would add to the operating cost of the farming sector by $50 million a year. This is at a time when the farming sector is struggling, when commodity prices are at an all-time low and when our wool producers are finding savage reductions in prices. What happens? The government whacks on another series of taxes which will have a further impact on the farming sector. We received submissions from the Australian Bus and Coach Association pointing out to us the savage effects these taxes will have on that sector. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the issues which came up during the hearings was that, because of the problems which were emerging, Senator Schacht, who was at the hearing, undertook to help arrange meetings for a variety of people who came before the committee so that they could present their particular problems to the Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, to see whether any particular measures could be taken to address these particular problems. I am sorry to hear what my colleague Senator Watson said. He mentioned that the representatives from Nabalco had not, I understand, been able to arrange a meeting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Members of the National Transport Federation indicated to the committee that the impact of the extra fuel taxes on running an average truck, a long haulier, would be in the order of an extra $5,000 a year&mdash;quite a dramatic cost to people running a small business, running a truck, trying to make a buck for their families and trying to build up their business. In the midst of these very difficult times, Mr Keating and his colleagues are going to slap on another tax costing these people another $5,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Gaynor presented strong evidence to the committee. He sought meetings with Senator Schacht. I have to report to the Senate that those meetings have not taken place. That is a great pity. Mr Gaynor also sought meetings with the Australian Democrats. Unfortunately he was not able to put to them the case of his particular sector. It is a pity that people who have very real concern about the future of their industry and future employment in their industry are not given a hearing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler has told us that we have to protect Australian jobs. We all agree with that. He wants to raise tariffs on Australian industry. Senator Kernot wants to rush this budget through so that we can have what she sees as greater security, again to help build confidence and employment in the Australian economy. In the past the Democrats have proposed a jobs levy to try to increase employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At a time when taxes on Australian industry have been raised to the extent that they have in this budget, I would have thought that the people who stand up in this chamber and talk so much about jobs&mdash;and I do not disparage that, because it is important that the Senate address its mind to jobs&mdash;would have been prepared to meet with the people who are employing people who are out there trying to make a quid. I hope that, as this debate continues, in the very near future the Australian Democrats will have a chance to meet with the Paul Gaynors of this world, as well as the National Transport Federation and other sectors of industry that wish to draw attention to their particular concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, one of the views that the National Transport Federation put to the committee was that, if there were an exemption granted to fuel excise used in long haul road transports, the cost would be in the order of $80 million. That is the federation's figure. That is, of course, a very similar figure to the cost of the extra tax that was raised on the wine industry. Whether the government or the Democrats would be prepared to support such an exemption, I do not know. Our policy is not to support any of these taxes, and we shall be voting against these taxes in this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that, where people have a very real case to put&mdash;the Greens and the Democrats&mdash;they will be given a fair hearing to put their particular views. All of us agree that there is a bipartisan policy on the need to increase employment in this country. It is so obvious, it beggars belief that it has to be restated in this chamber. If we put extra taxes on Australian industry, it will cost jobs. Every model that has ever been produced shows that. It is a great pity that the savage taxes that are encompassed in these bills&mdash;taxes amounting to over $1.4 billion&mdash;will, to a large extent, be paid by Australian industry. The cost of those taxes will feed through into all goods and services that Australian families purchase. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia has one of the highest per capita uses of petrol in the world but, unlike the United States and Canada, we are making no efforts to reduce this.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The transport component of the lead problem we currently face is a direct result of such inaction. Internationally there was a push for cars with engines that use unleaded fuel that led to legislation forbidding lead petrol engines in the United States in 1974. It was another 11 years before unleaded petrol was even available in Australia. There has been a similar push for strict standards of other emissions and overall fuel efficiency. By 1998 many states in the United States and the European Community will have in place emission standards up to 10 times stricter than ours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The major means of reducing emissions and greenhouse gases from the transport sector is clearly a shift away from car dependent urban design and towards cities in which services and frequent reliable public transport are readily available. By no accident, this was the finding of the government's own ecologically sustainable development transport working group. Not only is this the way to reduce environmental and public health damage; it is the means by which equity can be developed. Yet the government will cut funding for urban development and public transport from last year's $1,200 million to $200 million in 1996-97. This year state programs will be cut from $1.5 billion to $1 billion. Meanwhile, the government is trying to raise $1.3 billion in revenue from petrol and leaded petrol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I foreshadow an amendment which seeks to tie the government to some measure of real action on the environmental and equity issues. It seeks three things: firstly, to tie the government to measures in lead abatement, upon which it says it already has received industry agreement; secondly, to ensure that manufacturers who are producing vehicles using clean technology for other nations cannot dump older and dirtier vehicles on the Australian public; and, thirdly, to ensure that the government implements its own policies regarding the creation of better, cleaner, safer and fairer cities and to ensure that there is funding provided for this. </PARA>

I want to alert the Senate to the fact that the increases in fuel prices and bulk fuel prices which will come as a consequence of these measures, combined with the increase in wholesale sales taxes on long distance road transport, will have an incredibly regressive effect, particularly on areas in the far north of Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 5 December 1991, former Senator Peter Walsh asked former Senator Button a question in relation to the effect of the proposed goods and services tax on prices in remote areas. If I read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> correctly, I note that Senator O'Chee was interjecting quite a lot during the answer. Senator Walsh tried to draw the conclusion that the GST would have a regressive effect on freight charges. In fact, Senator Walsh had it wrong&mdash;the GST policy would have massively reduced the burden. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Later that month, on 19 December, I asked former Senator Button a question which was based on a leaked document dated 26 November 1991 from the caucus economic industrial relations committee. I asked specifically what that caucus committee had been advised in relation to the effects of the wholesale sales tax on road transport. In December 1991, in answer to Senator Walsh, Senator Button said that the impact of the WST, the wholesale sales tax, was about two per cent&mdash;in fact, it was 2.8 per cent. The Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics had provided to that back bench Labor Party committee, then chaired by Ric Charlesworth, an analysis which showed that the effect on a two-axle rigid truck was about two per cent, the effect on a large articulated truck was 3.8 per cent, and the effect on a triple road train was 4.5 per cent. </PARA>

Therefore, the effect of the wholesale sales tax increases is quite significant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not need to repeat the arguments that have already been quite succinctly put by the Road Transport Forum and circulated to honourable senators. The increase in wholesale sales tax will have a very deleterious effect on the purchasing power of people's wages in the north of Western Australia and other remote areas of Australia. When we put on top of it the fuel tax increases that are a part of the bills before us tonight, we have an even worse effect. I will speak later about the regressive nature of that increase as it affects not only people in metropolitan areas but also, increasingly, people who live in the far north. Whether this government knows it or not, there are a lot of low income earners who go to remote areas of Australia to try to progress their living standards, to get ahead and to earn bigger money. They live in low income circumstances and they have to pay these much higher prices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to draw to the Senate's attention a table I have prepared from a survey my office conducted on 18 August, the day after the budget.

For example, we looked at the town of Exmouth, in the north of Western Australia, which is where&mdash;as many honourable senators, and certainly Senator Chris Evans, who is from Western Australia, will know&mdash;the Harold E. Holt communications base was located. The price people in that town pay for leaded fuel at the moment is 86.5c a litre&mdash;some 16c a litre more than people would pay in the metropolitan area. After Labor's 7c a litre tax slug, the price will rise to 93.5c a litre&mdash;nearly $1 a litre. That is an enormous price for anyone to pay. There are many low income earners living in Exmouth and seeking work either in the fishing industry or at the communications centre. These low income earners have to pay this most regressive tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My constituents in Kalgoorlie are currently paying roughly 10c a litre more than we pay in the metropolitan area. They will be slugged an extra 7c a litre for leaded petrol. In Kalgoorlie the price will go up to something like 83c a litre. In Southern Cross, where Senator Panizza, the opposition deputy whip, comes from, the price will go up to 83c a litre. In Carnarvon, it will go up to 85c a litre; Kununurra, 81c a litre; Esperance, in the south of the state, just near where Senator Crane comes from, 78c a litre. By comparison, people in the metropolitan area get off relatively easily. At the moment, on average, we are paying roughly 70c a litre. The price will go up to 77c a litre. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This tax is a massive increase. It will not affect those of us who are on reliable salaries, be we public servants or politicians or other people on middle to high incomes; the people it will affect the most are those on low incomes who have to scrape together the money to put fuel in their cars just to go down to the local grocery store to buy their groceries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other effect will be on the transportation to remote areas of groceries, newspapers and all of the daily requirements of life. The price of all of those things will go up quite a lot. The Road Transport Forum has estimated that the increase will be between $2 and $3 a trolley load of groceries in the metropolitan area. This will be much higher in places such as Kununurra and Exmouth that are a long way from the metropolitan area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other effect that the increase will have on my state of Western Australia is in curtailing development in remote areas. There are enormous risks associated with developing new projects, be they mining projects, tourism projects or even pastoral or agriculture projects, a long way from the metropolitan area. Everything has to be put on a ship or a train, if a train is available&mdash;they are not available in most parts of northern Western Australia&mdash;or transported by heavy haulage on the roads. The cost of transport to those areas will be increased. Those people looking at developing new tourism facilities&mdash;and there are a number going on in northern Western Australia at the moment&mdash;who have not already been stopped by the uncertainty created by the High Court's Mabo ruling now face this extra hike associated with fuel increases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another good example in Western Australia is the expansion of agricultural activities in the Ord River scheme. This is something that the Western Australian Court government is keen to expand and another thing which will be made that much harder and that much less feasible if the price of taking goods and service to the region by transport is increased by this iniquitous tax hike. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a tax hike which, as Senator Kemp has already pointed out to the Senate this evening, was hidden from the Australian taxpayers. We did not hear Senator Chris Evans going around Western Australia, moving up through the north-west region, doorknocking and saying, `Elect us because we will put 7c a litre on your petrol price'. I was in the town of Newman the day after Senator Beahan was there because I found his business card stuck in a few doors that I knocked on; I did not hear any reports from the fine people of Newman that Senator Beahan had been knocking on their door saying, `We will increase your petrol price by 7c a litre'. The government did not do that because it knew the people did not want it. That is not what the people voted for. Senator Kemp has covered that and I will try to restrain myself from repeating the anger of those many Australians who feel totally betrayed by this government and its lack of honesty with the people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other important matter which Senator Kemp referred to was the effect that these taxes will have on employment generating economic growth. Australia's most important economic and social problem at the moment is that we have more than one million people either out of work or not working to their full capacity. Long term unemployment is an enormous problem which is having terrible effects not only on suicide rates and family breakdowns but also mostly on our economic capacity as a nation. We cannot have one million people out of work and at the same time have maximum economic growth occurring. This does have environmental consequences which I will refer to a little later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the crucial problems with this taxing measure is that it will adversely affect our international competitiveness. It will affect the input costs of our businesses, the input costs of waterfront and shipping and the input costs of everything that gets moved around Australia&mdash;every single transport and service. When this measure was announced I gave notice of a motion in this place calling it the hidden GST. It is a goods and services tax because it increases the cost of every single good and service in this nation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difference with this GST&mdash;Keating's GST; the hidden wholesale sales tax and tax on fuel&mdash;is that no-one gets any compensation for it. It increases the cost of consumer goods and groceries and so forth but, more importantly, in the long term, it increases the cost of everything we produce in this country and it makes things that much harder to sell competitively on the international market. We have heard from industry associations that all of the cost advantages we have got from the waterfront reform and shipping reform which Senator Collins has told us about month in and month out for years and years in this place have been wiped out by the stroke of one budget pen with these massive increases in the cost of transporting things around our shores. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we are trying to compete internationally. A small country like New Zealand just across the Tasman is performing very well in the micro-economic reform area. We have given ourselves another international competitive disadvantage over our cousins across the Tasman. New Zealand's shipping and its transport sector will be that much more competitive than Australia's. It is a nation which Australia hates being beaten by, be it in cricket, rugby, yachting or any other field of endeavour&mdash;probably even bobsledding, I say to the National Party Whip. We hate being beaten by the Kiwis when it comes to sport or any other field of endeavour. But when it comes to the reform of our economy, when it comes to increasing people's individual liberty, to increasing people's economic freedom, to increasing competition and choice, the Kiwis are beating us hands down. Week in and week out they are beating us on the waterfront, in shipping, in transport and in telecommunications. All of these areas are vital to our living standards, particularly those of low income earners and of so many young and middle aged Australians who have no hope of getting work at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a crucial aspect of increasing taxes on the productive sector and increasing taxes on business. If we keep doing this we keep diminishing the opportunities to export Australian products and services and to create more jobs. It is really perplexing that Mr Dawkins, Mr Keating and the Labor Party have gone down the path of increasing these taxes on the productive sector, on enterprise, on the very sector that has the ability to create the growth that will get rid of the unemployment problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last area I want to cover in this address is the environment. It was quickly covered by Senator Kemp. The important parallel was drawn between fixing environmental problems and creating economic growth. We cannot afford as a nation to give the environment proper protection if we do not have a strong and growing economy. There is no better proof of this than this sort of legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This morning I received a letter relating to the wine tax from Michael Wright, a constituent of mine, who is the proprietor of Voyager Estate, a winery in Western Australia. Mr Wright took the opportunity in that letter to raise a few other issues of national importance. I thank him for taking the trouble to do so. He drew to my attention the fact that in 1986, when unleaded fuel was introduced to the market in Australia, the average life of a car was something like five years. We have now increased the tax on leaded petrol as a further incentive for people to move to unleaded petrol&mdash;at least that is what the Treasurer would have us believe. Not even the Greens believe that line. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Wright continued to say in his letter that the idea was that if cars lasted, on average, five years, within a decade or so there would be very few cars using leaded petrol. Now with the state of the economy and the state of the sales tax system and the petrol taxes and the general anti-business, anti-expansion policies which this government seems to be pursuing, the average length of time that motor vehicles are on our roads has extended to nine years. We now have more lead petrol burning cars on the road than we should have. If we had a better economy with a better tax regime we would have more economically fuel efficient cars on the road. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Margetts in addressing her amendments said that the Greens did not want to see economically inefficient cars dumped on the Australian market. It was not that long ago that we had the debate about the imported Japanese cars. Most Australians will be put off by the concept of getting hand-me-down, second-hand vehicles from Japan. But the cars we were talking about in that debate last year were cars that had a far better fuel efficiency and a lower rate of greenhouse gas emission than many of the cars in Australia, particularly those cars that burn lead fuel. They were all unleaded vehicles with great fuel emission standards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When Mr Dawkins first announced this regime of unleaded and leaded fuel taxing in which there was a 10c slug on leaded petrol, his opening shot with the Greens and the Democrats was to reconsider the $12,000 import duty that was applied to imported Japanese cars. He said to the Greens, to the Democrats and to anyone else in Australia who wanted to listen that he would review whether or not he would let in all these Japanese cars. Only a year or so ago Senator Button was saying he would put on a $12,000 tax; if they still came in, he would double the tax. He would do anything to stop those Japanese cars from coming in. In the pressure of budget night when Mr Dawkins, the Treasurer, thought his budget might come unstuck, he let all those cars in again to achieve the environmental standards that the Greens are, I am sure, very genuinely concerned about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude by reiterating the point that if we want to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from motor vehicle fleets&mdash;there are a lot of other sources of greenhouse gas emissions&mdash;we need to have a strong and growing economy where average Australians can afford to go out and buy a new car that has a much higher standard in respect of emissions than the car they are driving at the moment. At present there are very few Australians who have the faith in the economy or the income to go and buy themselves a new car. It is a chicken and egg situation. But we do not encourage environmental standards to be increased by slugging the productive sector of the economy. I am opposed to these bills. I am opposed to the concept of taxing the productive sector in this manner. I look forward to joining my colleagues in voting these bills down when the question is put. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Customs Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993 and the Excise Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993 form part of what is arguably the worst budget that the Labor government has delivered. Senator Campbell highlighted most of the areas where this government is slugging the persons who use fuel. I suppose that saying that this is the worst budget that the Labor government has ever delivered is a rather bold statement. Given the wide selection of awful budgets and inappropriate legislation that has been the hallmark of the Keating ministry, I suppose that is really something.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet again we have a set of bills before us on which the minister and his department have not done their homework. If they had they would know how iniquitous, inappropriate and unnecessary these increases are. In speaking to the bills, I want to highlight the fuel tax increases because I regard them as the most iniquitous, inappropriate and unnecessary. They are iniquitous because they hurt most of those least able to afford them. In their original form, the fuel increases would have been especially unfair on those forced to drive older cars using leaded petrol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) is supposed to represent the people of Bankstown and Canterbury&mdash;and I suppose he gets there at least once before an election. A survey reported in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> showed that 62 per cent of all Canterbury motorists use leaded petrol while 43 per cent of motorists in Woollahra, Mr Keating's preferred neighbourhood, use leaded petrol. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sydney Morning Herald</EMPHASIS> is headed `ALP's petrol tax hits the true believers'. And well it does; it hits the people who can least afford to have another tax imposed on them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation is unfair and the government has been more than a little unfair and more than a little iniquitous in masking the intent of the legislation.

This is another example of anti-business legislation that will hurt the people who produce our export incomes. </PARA>

The government then claimed that the legislation was intended to protect the environment. Not even the environmental movement swallowed that line of argument. We on this side of the chamber and the environment movement know that this legislation and the other tax measures are all about an unbalanced budget, unfunded electoral promises and unfunded tax cuts. We all remember the election campaign, when so many promises were made by Mr Keating and those opposite.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is correct. Faced with the prospect of being caught out with its intent for these bills and faced with a revolt from its back bench, the government abandoned the environmental line and said, `Well, perhaps leaded fuel is not such a problem for now'. So the additional levy on leaded fuel was abandoned and the rates are now as we see them in this legislation. But that has not removed the inequity; it just means that everyone is unfairly hit equally. It is slugging the people who produce export income&mdash;the transport industry, farmers and mining companies; the list is endless.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration heard from 14 organisations a couple of weeks ago. Those 14 organisations and industry groups said the same thing&mdash;the legislation is unfair and their industries will be hit hard. There was overwhelming evidence that these increases are not only unfair but also positively regressive. A lot of people have already mentioned Nabalco and it is good that we make mention of it again. It is the largest inland consumer of fuel oil in Australia, using about 460,000 kilolitres a year for power generation and calcination. It suggested that this legislation will wipe $25 million from its joint venturers' pre-tax profits and will increase its fuel oil costs by 29 per cent. In the submission it made to the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration it claimed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Budget increases the duty on fuel oil by a staggering 96 per cent, writing off $25 million from our Joint Venturers' pre-tax profits.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say:</PARA>

<PARA>This is just another slug. I imagine that the Labor Party is just getting the next slug ready for the mining industry&mdash;that is, Mabo. That will slug it again. If it has not slugged it with fuel, the government will slug it with other legislation that it is introducing in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We wonder why a government wants to be so anti-business, so anti-export industries, so regressive and so unhelpful to the people who can produce the export income that gives all Australians their standard of living.

<PARA>The National Farmers Federation also appeared before the Senate standing committee. It too was scathing in its remarks about this tax. It is pretty scathing in the remarks it is making about Mabo as well. It knows that all the businesses out there trying to do something are being hit by this Labor Party government all the time. Given that this year farmers are suffering across all commodity groups and given that they are major users of fuel, it was generally thought that there would be some incentives in the budget for the farming communities. After all, when incomes for broadacre farmers are anticipated to be negative $18,000 or worse and wheat growers make on average a business profit of about $1,000 per farm, it is hard to see how a government imposing these extra taxes can be regarded by anyone as being fair dinkum. That is precisely what the Keating government is doing. The NFF said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Taxes on fuel are widely acknowledged to be highly regressive because fuel consumption rises only slightly with income.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At least 60% of fuel taxes are paid, in the first instance, by businesses. Introducing an increase in a tax that falls primarily on business is a direct contradiction of moves elsewhere by Government to reduce taxes on business.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I write to raise the strongest objections to your decision in the federal budget to dramatically increase fuel excise.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because more than 60% of excisable petroleum products are consumed by business and industry, the rises in excise rates will reduce international competitiveness and add to business costs. The effects will be most pronounced in agriculture and mining&mdash;Australia's major export industries.</PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly what I said a minute ago&mdash;the government is slugging the people who produce the export income that gives us our standard of living. Why does the government not think a little about it and acknowledge that the people who play the tune and give us the export income should be paid a little bit occasionally rather than being hit to leg every time they try to get their heads above water?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The transport industry is another industry that is struggling to make a profit. It is a major business user of fuel and so important to our export industries. It estimates that its fuel bills will increase by something like $6,000 per lorry per year. That is extra costs on our export income which means that we cannot compete with other countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New Zealand was mentioned earlier by Senator Campbell. Holy hell, New Zealand has outrun us. New Zealand is competing around the world and jumping tariff barriers like nobody's business because it is competitive. If we try to jump tariff walls around the world&mdash;if a country has a tariff barrier to stop us getting in&mdash;and we increase our costs again, it means that the high jump rail will be put up even higher. What is the government on about? Why is it being so anti-business?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These costs to the transport industry cannot be absorbed. They will have to be passed on. That is where we will see extra costs on a range of goods going to our export industries and extra costs going to our farms and our country towns and country cities. It astounds me that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Senator Sherry, is allowing his party to slug country people, especially, and exporters as hard as they are being slugged by this increase in the fuel excise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the fuel rises are inappropriate because they will blow out inflation and, despite all assurances given by the government ministers, it is obvious that that will happen. The excise increases are inappropriate because they put industries at risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The shipping industry has already been mentioned. After years of negotiation, it convinced the unions to agree to reduced manning levels on ships. That would have made Australian shipping a little more competitive, but the increases in fuel excises that are mooted in this budget will negate the whole cost saving of the manning level alleviation. So much for helping an industry! As I have said, this government is completely anti-business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These taxes are definitely unnecessary. They were foisted on us without being talked about during the election campaign. The coalition's Fightback package, which we talked about during the election campaign, would have done a job for business and made it competitive.

In 1983, petrol excise was 6.155c a litre. By August 1992, it had increased to 26.154c a litre. The total tax for fuel in 1982-83 was $970 million. Just think how good things were in those days. By 1992 there was a tax rip-off at the fuel bowser by this government&mdash;by Senator Sherry's and Senator West's government; they should hang their heads in shame. Fancy Senator West coming from a country area and allowing these taxes to increase the way they have. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was fortunate to be able to sit through the hearings of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration on this issue. We heard a similar story from the long haul road hauliers, the shipping industry, the short haul road hauliers, the mining industry and the farming industry. The costs that are being imposed through these increases will have a significant impact on their competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To begin with, I will deal with the impact on Western Australia. Western Australia is a state that is relatively small in population but large in size and production capacity. That state is now producing in excess of 25 per cent, going close to 30 per cent, of the total export income of this country. Within 10 to 12 years, that capacity is estimated to rise to 40 per cent, particularly if the government gets off its back and lets it get on with the job. Whatever analysis is applied to it, it is being severely disadvantaged. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will cite some figures showing the impact of this increase in the fuel excise on Western Australia. It must be remembered that the transport industry, in terms of its tasks and the geography of Australia, is a very heavily taxed industry at this time. Once the full 5c fuel excise increase is in place, it will create a two per cent rise in general freight costs across Western Australia. It will cost Western Australia something like an additional $175 million a year for transport services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The excise will increase the cost to farmers of grain cartage by another 25 cents per tonne. It will increase the production costs in the agricultural area by $560 million. As one works through these figures, one finds that the impact will be quite dramatic and very devastating. It must be remembered that this increase will take place against a background of the wool industry in particular going through very difficult times. It is estimated that the impact of these measures on each producer will run into several thousands of dollars.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I particularly want to deal with the wool industry. The Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Research Economics currently predicts that the losses in the wool industry this year will be in the order of $34,000 or $35,000 per property. This measure will add another couple of thousand dollars to those loses. It will certainly increase the number of individual operations that have difficulty in dealing with the current crisis in the wool industry and it will lead to further bankruptcies. The government has not really thought through the economic and social implications of this legislation on the Australian public and Australian industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation will also have a very significant impact on the mining industry. The mining industry in Western Australia is basically in remote areas. As I have already mentioned, the increase in the fuel excise will mean that the industry will be less competitive. For example, the Australia iron ore industry will be less able to compete with countries such as Brazil. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increased fuel excise will result in an impact on Westrail's fuel bill of something like $1.5 million. It is rather pleasing to see that a couple of Western Australian senators are on the other side of the chamber. I hope they take account of Western Australian industry when they are looking at the implications of this legislation. There comes a time when senators have to stand up in this place for their states and be counted. It will be rather interesting to see whether or not those Western Australian senators do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There will be an additional cost of $16 million to the Australian shipping industry. I will continue to deal with the impact of the increase in the fuel excise on our productive sector. Every month Australia consistently produces a current account deficit of somewhere between $1.3 billion and $2 billion. This measure will only exacerbate that problem. If adopted, this legislation will mean that it is going to be that much longer before Australia can start balancing its budget and balancing its books. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, there are other implications. This measure will mean that Australia will be less able to employ more people and address our serious unemployment problems. This is particularly disappointing for Western Australia because that state is showing some signs of coming out of the recession we had to have. It is showing some signs of increasing its productive capacity. This is certainly the case in the mining industry. In agriculture, farmers have responded to the rural crisis and lifted their overall effort in grain production. I am sure that Senator Panizza, a fellow Western Australian senator from the Southern Cross wheat belt, is well aware that these farmers have made a major effort to improve productivity. Yet they are being slugged again. I am certain that when grain growers do their sums for next year&mdash;and we should bear in mind that they are subject to the variability of world markets&mdash;and realise the damage that this legislation will do to them, some of the incentive to repeat their efforts to improve productivity will be destroyed very dramatically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In putting forward this legislation, the government is penalising those people who have made an effort over a significant number of years to tackle the problems associated with the management of the Australian economy. It is a pity that the government has not applied the same sort of toughness to reforming our industrial system and making it a lot more competitive than it currently is. I am not going to dwell on this now; we will deal with it at a later date. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to look at the impact of this legislation on the shipping industry; and I think this is one of the greatest tragedies of all. I know that some of my colleagues have already mentioned this subject but I would like to emphasise a couple of points. The government has, in effect, completely undermined and eroded the SIRA program. Senator Collins, for example, must feel very disillusioned about the performance of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), bearing in mind the effort that has gone into developing the SIRA program. I do not necessarily accept that everything that could have been done in terms of that program has been done to improve the competitiveness of our shipping industry. But it is worth noting that there has been a significant reduction in the manning levels, the operating costs and the like in order to make the Australian coastal shipping industry competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the week the budget was brought down an agreement was reached by the Shipping Industry Reform Authority and the maritime union. In effect, the agreement actually removed 111 berths from the Australian coastal shipping industry. That was a reform that had to happen. The agreement translates into 240 positions or thereabouts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fuel excise changes that the government has made&mdash;a 55 per cent increase in the excise by August 1994 and a further increase of 9.2 per cent or 10.4c per litre within 12 months&mdash;will have the effect, in cost terms, of putting some 146 berths back into the industry or creating 320 jobs. That is going to create a situation that is almost untenable for the shipping industry in Australia. The impact of this legislation will reverse the whole of the SIRA reform program. Instead of Australian having an internationally competitive shipping operation, we will have one that goes back to what can be termed the bad old days. Cost increases will mean that a lot of the tasks will not be transferred to shipping. Industries are not going to develop around the Australian coastline. This fuel excise increase is going to inhibit the development of the mining industry in certain areas, particularly Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many other points that could be made in this debate. In the time that I have left to speak, I want to touch on the situation in Western Australia with respect to road funding and the increase in fuel excises. It is worth reminding this chamber that the fuel excise was commenced for the purpose of raising funds to build new roads and maintain old ones. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1992-93 budget, Western Australia's share of road funding was $162 million. In the 1993-94 budget, it has been reduced to $99.4 million or, in round figures, just under $100 million. That is a reduction of some $63 million, yet we will have foisted upon our productive sector this enormous increase in fuel excise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures show that Western Australia's share of total Commonwealth grants, including those for local government roads, has decreased from 18 per cent prior to 1969 to 8.2 per cent in 1993-94. That rate of decline has been most pronounced over recent years, particularly from 1988-89 to 1993-94. Western Australia's share of the National Highway funds is only 7.1 per cent, yet Western Australia has 25 per cent of the total length of the National Highway. Once again, Western Australia is being severely disadvantaged with respect to road funding. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can go further with this. Western Australia has 25 per cent of the total length of the National Highway. It gets 7.1 per cent of road funding. Ten per cent of the vehicle kilometres travelled in Australia are in Western Australia. If we measure the 7.1 per cent against the 10 per cent, and not against the 25 per cent which I initially mentioned, once again we are significantly disadvantaged. Western Australia also has 9.5 per cent of the population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we analyse these figures and what the Commonwealth has done with respect to funding and the raising of revenue through the utilisation of the fuel excise, we find that Western Australia fares very badly on all accounts. It is the state which has the greatest potential to lift us out of our current crisis&mdash;that is, our recession, our current account problems and our national debt&mdash;yet we are being penalised as a state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have not touched on all the aspects that were raised with us at the committee hearings and elsewhere. I put it to the government that, as far as its policies on road transport, rail transport, shipping transport and, for that matter, any form of transport are concerned, it is time to have another look. The transport system is the lifeblood of this nation. It is the mechanism by which we move our goods and services around. Unlike most other countries, our population fits into a very small area of the nation. It is basically on the coastline and, as such, there are enormous distances to travel. We are unique in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as our transport is concerned, we still have the incredible situation&mdash;this is where I talk about exports&mdash;where it costs no more to cart a load of wheat on a ship to Europe, for example, than it does to take it down to Tasmania. We could go through a whole host of examples. But these bills do not deal with that aspect of transport. They deal with putting up costs for our miners, our farmers, our shipping industry and our everyday users of goods and services. One of the things about these bills that need to be borne in mind at end of the day is that those costs will be passed on to the final consumer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the hearings, evidence was given to us&mdash;this is where the secret GST comes into it&mdash;that the average cost of a carton of groceries, as a result of these additional charges on the transport industry, would amount to close to $3 per trolley. The Australian public needs to be well aware of the impact that these secret taxes which are put in place have on everyday living&mdash;whether it be for groceries, fuel to run motor cars or whatever. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end of the day, the tragedy of it all is that it means that we will have a number of industries in this country, particularly agriculture, mining and those that are developing in terms of value adding, that will be significantly less competitive than they could have been, and that is no credit to the government. In fact, I would say shame on the government for not having analysed this a lot more carefully. When the committee asked what economic analysis had been done on the impact on the Australian economy, the answer was either virtually none or none. Because of that, I say shame on the government for having put this extra impost at a time when we needed assistance to become competitive. </PARA>

Obviously, that should be multiplied by about seven and the true figure, as I calculate it, would be between $160,000 to $180,000.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard since budget day about how the fuel oil excise will impact on the transport industry, particularly on rail, road and shipping.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to the compounding effect that the fuel excise will have on the costs of living throughout remote and rural Australia, in the Northern Territory there is an impost on fuel oils that will impact on the generation of electricity in one of Australia's leading export industries, the Nabalco alumina and bauxite production in Arnhem Land. Without any warning whatsoever, these bills will stick an impost of $25 million on the operation of one particular mine.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, Labor is building a wall of silence around this legislation and, I would argue in particular from the Northern Territory's point of view, around the operations of Nabalco at Gove. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where has the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon) been on this legislation?  He has been totally absent from any of the debate. In fact, after I had issued some press releases last week, he was trapped by an ABC interviewer and asked a question about the implications of the legislation. This was his reply on ABC Radio on 11 October:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I met with Nabalco in Canberra with Bob Collins last week. We're sympathetic to their position and we've had discussions. I had a discussion in fact last week with the Treasurer about it but I am hopeful we'll be able to do something.</PARA>
<PARA>Hopeful but totally neutered; not one result has yet emerged from the government. Where has the support been from Senator Collins? Nearly four weeks ago in this chamber, Senator Collins was asked a question about the impact of this legislation and he said that the government has had it under consideration. Well, so damn what! Four weeks later it is still under consideration and members of the government are not even game to come in here and talk about it, let alone propose some administrative or technical amendments of any nature to the legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My side, the Liberal and National parties, have foreshadowed some amendments which Senator Watson has already spoken about; the Australian Democrats have foreshadowed some amendments; the Greens have foreshadowed some amendments; and Senator Harradine has been speaking about the impact of this legislation on Tasmania. It seems that everyone else, except the Labor Party, has taken a very keen interest. I am disgusted that so far as I am aware the Labor Leader of the Opposition in the Northern Territory, Mr Brian Ede, has not said a damn thing about the legislation. I am not aware that the member for Nhulunbuy, Mr Sid Stirling, has said a damn thing. Of course, we all know that the shadow minister for mines and energy, Mr Maurice Rioli, has been preoccupied and certainly has not said anything in the past few days. So much for the recommendations of the past few years of the Prime Minister's country task force. It makes a mockery of the new regional task force that has been created when the impact of this legislation does nothing more than prove that Labor is all talk and no action. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When this legislation hit the parliament, on the initiative of the Liberal and National parties the bills were subjected to an inquiry by the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. That Senate inquiry came back with a majority report&mdash;the Labor Party had the numbers&mdash;which gave a one sentence summary of what the committee had done and a one sentence recommendation that the legislation should be agreed to without amendment. Thankfully, my colleagues&mdash;Senator Campbell, Senator Kemp and Senator Watson&mdash;put down a very detailed and comprehensive minority report which fully summarised the impact and the flaws of this legislation. But still there was no response whatsoever&mdash;nothing was said about how it will increase the cost of living of people throughout Australia who are affected by all of the transport industries or in any other way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This evening I want to confine my remarks to looking specifically at how this legislation will impact on the operations of Nabalco in the Northern Territory. The budget increased duty on fuel oil from 5.512c per litre to around 10.828c per litre next August, a staggering rise of 96 per cent. This is a higher Commonwealth rate of tax than is imposed on diesel, petrol, cigarettes, spirits or beer and about nine times the rate that was proposed on wine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1992-93, one project&mdash;the one I am speaking about, Nabalco's bauxite and alumina refinery at Gove&mdash;paid over 60 per cent of its revenue collected from inland fuel oil sales. Unlike many other industries and companies, Nabalco has no opportunity to pass on the $25 million increased cost to its customers, because Nabalco exports all of its products on competitive world markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nabalco is one of six alumina refineries in Australia, all adding value to our mineral raw materials by processing and upgrading the raw material, bauxite. But all Nabalco's Australian competitors have access to competitively priced natural gas, which is not taxed. Nabalco's pre-budget fuel oil tax burden of around $25 million was a substantial handicap in a competitive market. Dr Terry Gardner, General Manager of Nabalco, in giving evidence to the Senate inquiry on 1 October, said that the new tax burden of around $50 million `just doubles that disadvantage'. It has always been a principle of tax policy to ensure taxpayers are treated fairly and without discrimination. Nabalco stated in its submission to the inquiry that `it is a challenge to think of any more offensive transgression' of this important tax principle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1968 Nabalco signed an agreement with the Commonwealth to regulate the operations on the Gove Peninsula. Clause 12 of the Gove agreement provides, inter alia:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">12(1) The Commonwealth will use its best endeavours to ensure that no Act or Ordinance is passed that will impose . . . discriminatory taxes, discriminatory rates or discriminatory charges of any nature whatsoever on or in respect of the titles, property or other assets, products, materials or services used . . . in the conduct of business incidental to the company's business under this agreement.</PARA>
<PARA>This is not simply a matter of tax principles, but a matter on which there is a specific Commonwealth undertaking not to do exactly what it has now done. The tax on Nabalco is not only discriminatory but the government's political handling of it has been arrogant and brutal. When Senator Schacht listened to the Nabalco evidence in the Senate committee he was obviously visibly shocked, and he had the decency to admit:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I suppose you could always say that any individual company that is paying, in revenue terms, about half of one tax obviously has a reasonable case to say, irrespective of what association it is in, that this may be the Nabalco tax rather than anyone else's tax. I am sympathetic to that point of view, so I will refer that particular case to the Treasurer.</PARA>
<PARA>It seems that Mr Snowdon, Senator Collins, Senator Schacht and everyone else refers it to the Treasurer but nothing gets done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the issue of sovereign risk that this poses to Australia? The truly damaging repercussions for Australia of the $25 million Nabalco tax hike relate to sovereign risk. If the tax and its consequences were deliberate, the government would be giving notice of a preparedness to level highly discriminatory taxes on any project with no option but to pay up or shut down. We need to look very carefully at all of those issues and the implications that arise from this whole area for investors as to how this might affect other projects. Nabalco, Savage River and Mount Keith are all major processing projects. This is the sharpest signal that is being delivered to the mining industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again back to my friend&mdash;or perhaps he is not my friend on this issue&mdash;Senator Collins. He stood out a lot more than like a sore toe on the issue of Coronation Hill. He went so far as to castigate the cabinet and to rudely describe the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in various ABC programs. That was Coronation Hill. Where is he now on Nabalco?  He is nowhere to be seen, and certainly to be hidden. The significance of the fuel tax increase for future project investment may take a little more time to be fully appreciated, but the government would be deluding itself if it harboured any hope that failure to correct the mistake would go unnoticed by investors. This legislation will lead to higher sovereign risk, revealed in an increased reluctance to invest and higher rates of return required by investors. It will lead to the unavoidable consequences of lower investment, lower growth and fewer jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What else will it lead to?  This is an outcome that will not be confined to the resources sector. It is one that Australia simply cannot afford. In the area of incentives for investment and efficiency improvement this legislation makes a mockery&mdash;as Senator Watson said earlier this evening&mdash;of a whole range of policies that the government has supposedly put in place. Doctor Gardner of Nabalco told the Senate committee how Nabalco had invested $120 million in its operations at Gove since 1991&mdash;I remind honourable senators that that is only two years ago&mdash;in order to reduce the cost per tonne of alumina produced. That investment program succeeded in achieving cost reductions amounting to $10 per tonne, and then the 1993 budget comes along, hitting the project with a tax that raises costs by $15 per tonne. As Dr Gardner said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">That just eliminated that investment, that hard work, and then some&mdash;it just wiped it away.</PARA>
<PARA>The experience of coastal shipping companies in shipping reform is exactly the same. Where have the unions been throughout this debate?  I would have thought that the unions, with their attachment to a project as important as Nabalco, would have been talking out on this issue. It makes a mockery of their policies, of union investment in the whole of Australia. And it does not end there. Whose money is behind the participants in the Nabalco joint venture at Gove, for instance?  The answer is very simple&mdash;two well-known Australian institutions, CSR and AMP, as well as Alusuisse. The Labor Government encourages employees and directs enterprises to invest in superannuation schemes that, in turn, invest in companies like CSR only to find that CSR's investments are able to be raided without warning and value appropriated by this Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the assets of AMP policyholders that have been raided by the discriminatory fuel tax in exactly the same way?  How many Australian AMP policyholders must now be waking up to the real motives of this government? The new National Investment Council would be well advised to have a look at this Nabalco tax because compiling a believable strategy to promote investment will be an impossible task unless the heightened level of sovereign risk, the risk of appropriation of asset value by government, is demonstrably reduced. Interestingly, Treasury papers state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One specific issue for which the Council has been given responsibility is to advise the Government on strategies to facilitate the establishment of regional headquarters in Australia while maintaining the integrity of the tax system.</PARA>
<PARA>I kid you not. Would honourable senators be surprised to learn that one of the big international companies singled out by the government for encouragement to set up its Asian headquarters in Australia&mdash;and in the very process of doing so, I believe&mdash;is Alusuisse, the 70 per cent joint venture partner of the Gove project?  The fuel oil tax is understandably at the forefront of their minds when government officials talk about the integrity of the tax system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What about the Treasury's new committee, the Wran committee, to look at northern Australia's export potential?  This legislation makes a mockery of what that committee has to do. I can assure you, Madam Acting Deputy President, that I will be making a submission to Mr Wran and his committee pointing out what this idiotic, stupid legislation has done. The budget increase in fuel oil tax flies in the face of sound economic logic and in the advice of the government's own economic advisers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Industries Assistance Commission reported on a directly relevant reference as recently as 1 November 1986. In that report, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Certain Petroleum Products&mdash;Taxation Measures</EMPHASIS>, important recommendations included:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The revenue which petroleum taxes are expected to generate is too high. They are distorting production and consumption decisions, thus reducing Australia's economic efficiency. The Commission's judgment is that, in the long run, a sound case can be made for all intermediate use of petroleum products to be exempted from revenue raising taxation.</PARA>
<PARA>We have these sorts of distortions. Arguments against imposing petroleum product taxes on intermediate users noted by the IAC are that they penalise petroleum intensive industries like Nabalco, distort the import mix of industry, encouraging, for example, the inefficient use of natural gas, impact disproportionately in communities in remote areas&mdash;which also bear all of the high transport costs that are going to be further compounded by this damned legislation&mdash;and impact severely on industries like Nabalco competing on world markets. This damages Australia's export competitiveness and trade performance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Inexplicably, the government has taken this budget decision at a time when it has the Industries Assistance Commission working on another reference on petroleum. Would it not have been more responsible to await the commission's latest findings before barging in blindly with a huge increase in a form of tax that the IAC only seven years ago recommended should be abolished?  I am naturally angry at the government. I am angry that this evening not one Labor Party senator has had the courage, the guts, to come in here and argue a case for the government. The committee that was chaired by Senator Coates put in an insulting report&mdash;one paragraph and a one-sentence recommendation&mdash;and did not in any way even seek to put down some issues that compounded it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, I am annoyed, insulted and disgusted that Senator Collins, representing remote and rural Australia, appears to be hiding in a hole on this particular issue. Mr Snowdon, a member in the House of Representatives, said, `We might be doing something' last week. But the government did nothing this week and he has nothing to colour it with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How could the government fail to appreciate the implications of this particular legislation?  It should not be arguing what the unintended consequences are. They will stand out as the effects on the Northern Territory and the rest of remote Australia. They will stand out in Aboriginal communities right throughout Australia where the cost of living, which impacts straight back into the government's budget, will be felt. The power generation itself not only affects the mine at Gove but also affects every family and every person in that part of Australia. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that in the draft amendments that the Greens have circulated they, too, have mentioned the effect that these taxes will have on rural and regional Australia. In fact, they have taken note of the effect that this fuel tax increase will have on sea and rail freight. Being a Tasmanian, this is the area that concerns me most, along with all the other concerns that have been expressed by my colleagues from around Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the rural area is concerned, it seems to me that every week another disaster comes along. If farmers have not been fighting off drought, they have been facing floods in a lot of areas of Australia. When the farmers who are lucky enough to have had a good season get through that, they are faced with another disaster. For example, Senator Brownhill's son had the best wheat crop and the best crop of faber beans he has ever had, until half past five this afternoon when a hail storm wiped them out. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is when we ask ourselves, `Why do people stay on the land?  Why do they remain farmers?' It is the way they have been brought up; it is the challenge, the life they are used to. I guess the most upsetting thing is the continual taxing of their lifelines by governments that do not seem to care about what they are trying to do. These people are not only producing the food we eat but also producing huge amounts of export income per head of population even now with depressed prices, droughts, floods and everything else that goes with them. Yet it is these people that this government sets out to tax, one way or the other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as my own state of Tasmania is concerned, the content of these two bills spells disaster for not only the producers in Tasmania but also the men and women in the street and their families. The petrol excise increases contained in the budget will cost Tasmania $61 million. This equates to an additional $129 per head for every man, woman and child in the state&mdash;that is just one particular increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a regressive tax.

Even the man in the street could understand the flow-on effect that that would have through the whole community because of the savings in freight and how, particularly in my state and, I guess, in Western Australia where they rely on a lot of road freight, the reductions in excise on fuel would flow through to everything that the country people rely on; they would become automatically cheaper. That was a wonderful offset for the proposed GST. Yet here we have this other government measure increasing excise on fuel with no offsets whatsoever&mdash;not one. So the people in rural and regional Australia and isolated areas such as Tasmania and Western Australia will have to suffer because they rely on freight to a greater extent than the more urban populations of Melbourne and Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of our geographic disadvantage in Tasmania, we have some of the highest consumer prices in the country. These are continually being pointed out by the Minister for Justice, the honourable Duncan Kerr, in his price watch committee. But the major reason why our prices are higher in Tasmania is that of the freight component. I think even Senator Coates would have to admit that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note, too, that because of that particular concern, just last week a bipartisan delegation came to Canberra from Tasmania to push the case for Bass Strait to be recognised as a national highway. I think the delegation was going to call it Highway 1. I was contacted by Leanne Martin from Devonport who was heading up that delegation, which included representatives from all sides of politics. In fact, she wrote the letter to me from Silvia Smith's office, so I just wonder how Silvia Smith will explain to her constituents in Bass the increase in the prices of goods and fuel. How will she explain to those battlers in the community, who live in her electorate and drive old model cars because they cannot afford to buy more modern cars that use unleaded fuel, the increase in fuel tax and that, therefore, more dollars will go out of their pockets into the tax collection agency at the petrol pump every week?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder whether Senator Devereux, for instance, will cross the floor and support the Greens after having said what he said about the Green parties in Tasmania and what he has not said about the Labor Party there. It was quite fascinating to see a neighbour of mine who has been, I must admit, concerned about environmental issues, criticise his own party in his own state in supporting Christine Milne. I presume there is a lot of frustration there and that probably comes from the fact that he has to talk to his constituents and tell them that there is not much he can do about this increase in fuel prices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been estimated that the increase in fuel excise will increase the cost of the contents of every grocery trolley that young mothers in Tasmania have to push every week by about $3. The cost of other goods, particularly the heavy items that are freighted into Tasmania, will rise by a greater degree. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Tasmania has the peculiar situation, too, that wholesale sales taxes that are also imposed on us have been increased because most of the goods are sourced out of Victoria or New South Wales. There is a fair amount of freight component in those wholesale prices. The freight will go up because of the increase in excise and the wholesale sales tax, by definition, will also rise, so Tasmania will be hit with a double whammy. This comes on top of increases in tobacco taxes that will cost Tasmania $7.5 million or $16 a head, if one happens to be a smoker. As I said earlier, the increases in wholesale sales taxes which have gone through this place will cost Tasmania $35.7 million or $75 a head. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reductions in income tax, which have been promised but have yet to be delivered, will return a paltry $72.5 million to the states. So the net result is that Tasmania will be $31.7 million worse off. Every man, woman and child in Tasmania is going to be $67 per head poorer. For the average family, with two children, that equates to about $268 a year. That does not take into account the flow-through effect of all these freight increases. It is obvious that an island state like Tasmania, which has a heavy reliance on coastal shipping, is really going to suffer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think Senator Watson mentioned earlier that these budget measures will increase the excise on low quality petroleum used by coastal shipping from 5.441c per litre to 10.441c per litre by this time next year. This is going to raise industry costs by something like $16 million per year. The National Maritime Association calculates that this will raise the average cost for a coastal vessel by a staggering $358,387 a year. So it is no surprise that my colleagues have been pointing out that, even though Senator Collins has been coming in here week after week and month after month espousing the advantages of the waterfront reforms, the industry will be wiped out in one fell swoop if this tax comes into effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Just recently&mdash;I think it will come on 29 November this year&mdash;the Tasmanian government purchased a new vessel for our interstate tourism trade and freight between Victoria and Tasmania.

I understand that the interest in this particular vessel is so high that 8,000 calls about the ship, bookings and inquiries, have been received in half a day.

This means that the operating cost will rise by $2,401 per voyage. I do not know where the $1 comes from, but that is the estimation I have been given. That is a massive $743,310 per annum. </PARA>

As Senator Sherry would know, there has been a lot of controversy about the fact that the ship was originally ordered by the previous Labor government and is supported by the present government.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It might be easy to say, `Well, just pass it on', but the tourism industry is so competitive at the moment. Why should shipping be slugged when its competitors, the airlines, are exempt from tax across Bass Strait? It goes to the old argument from when the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sea Cat</EMPHASIS> was on line. Why did the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Sea Cat</EMPHASIS> have to pay excise on fuel when the aircraft flying across the Strait did not? It is an unfair advantage that shipping has to face right from the beginning, when any advantage it could have would have been good. But it seems the government is not particularly interested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note with some delight that the Green amendments exempt fuel for sea freight.

I just hope that freight equalisation does not become a political football. It has worked and served Tasmania very well. It is something that I do not think should be tinkered with. I would go along with its being increased; I do not think most people would. But there is a danger of course. Once it has been used as a bargaining chip, further down the track it could be pulled out by any government. This is one of the success stories over many years now. Freight equalisation has helped somewhat to alleviate the problems our industries face. </PARA>

Only last week when I was down there we flew over and noticed the 40-mile pipeline that the mine uses to pump its iron ore pellets from the west coast. It has always been a reasonably marginal operation and this particular increase in excise looks like it might have sounded the death knell.

Already I note that the vegetable growers, whom we rely on so much for our primary income, are talking about bringing fertiliser in from the mainland. There again it is freighted in. There again it is going to be at an increased cost and, therefore, it reduces the small profits they might be getting. </PARA>

I think we now know the Democrats' position, but certainly those workers at EZ would have liked to have known what Senator Bell and the Democrats contribution was to be.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The excise increases initiated in the Customs Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993 and the Excise Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993, particularly those on leaded and diesel fuel, will devastate rural and isolated Australians, especially the less well off in our community. These taxes will detrimentally affect the standard of living of not just those who use motor vehicles but indeed of all Australians. The price increase at the bowser as a result of these taxes will not just rip money from the pockets of drivers who pull in to fill up; it will be an additional cost for millions of Australians who depend on transport for their own livelihood, who depend on it for services and supply of goods and for their very survival.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The leaded fuel excise increase alone is expected to raise for this government over $1,200 million in revenue each year by 1996&mdash;$1,200 million extra in just three years. This is monstrous and will cripple already embattled ordinary Australians as well as those struggling in industry. Taxpayers just cannot go on digging into their pockets and paying hand over fist for more government hatchet jobs at balancing the books. Yet the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) continues to come up with unbelievable ways of screwing additional revenue out of people, and these fuel taxes are just one more example of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Generally, Australians hang on to their cars; they are not prone to trading in a car on a new model every year or so. Those who drive cars manufactured in the 1970s and early 1980s have to use leaded fuel. We hang on to our cars even longer now because of what this Labor government has done to our economy; and we hang on to them because we cannot see this bludgeoning budget making any improvements to our economic future. There is precious little confidence in our economy, and there is even less confidence among struggling families and businesses who are unable to afford basic requirements, let alone a new car, because of the parlous state of our economic conditions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Added to this is the ever present prospect of unemployment which looms large over the heads of many family breadwinners. That is reason enough to put off any purchase of a major household necessity, let alone an expensive new pollution-free family car. Consequently, the discriminatory and unfair excise on leaded fuel will most affect those unable to afford the purchase price of a new car&mdash;which is not insubstantial these days. It will affect those Australians who live in the country, many of whom are not in a position to go out and buy the latest model of anything, let alone a new $30,000 family car. They have no choice with fuel. Because they cannot afford a new vehicle, they must buy leaded petrol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the Labor government slugs those who are least able to pay, all because it pretends to have turned `pollution friendly' and wants to tax pollution. With more than half the cars on our roads nearly a decade old, the government has found itself a veritable gold mine with this proposed excise increase. The excise itself, because it will mean people paying more for their fuel, will ensure that it takes even longer to save to purchase a newer, more fuel efficient, less polluting vehicle. This fact gives the lie to any claim that this is an environmental measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the government has become very good at lies, or at least at making lies appear to be the truth. The real truth is that this measure is nothing more than a revenue milch cow. This rise is directly counter-productive to reducing lead pollution in the air as it puts new cars even further beyond the reach of ordinary Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have only recently presented to the Senate more than 16,300 signatures on a petition which calls for the excise on leaded fuel to be reversed&mdash;and there are thousands more protests still coming into my office. In other words, 16,300 drivers in South Australia have voted with their pens and refuse to be bullied by this Treasurer into paying yet more for their fuel. The Treasurer, and indeed this government, cannot dismiss these signatures which call for this key, regressive, revenue earning measure to be thrown out. Indeed, one sees from the Senate records that any petition which has 16,000 or more signatures ranks amongst the most supported petitions in recent years in the Senate. Any petitions presented to this Senate containing 5,000 or more signatures are very big petitions, and most of those take a year or more to collect. The 16,000-plus signatures on this petition were collected in just a few weeks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Voters have every right to reject this tax when no legal authority to levy it actually exists. The situation as it currently stands has the budget announcing an increase in petrol taxes on both imported and locally refined petroleum products. Unfortunately, though the relevant clauses state the proposals are to be effective from the day after budget night, 18 August, the clauses are not binding until the relevant bills have actually passed into law. Hence, there is no legal status to the commencement date of this tax until the legislation of which it forms a part is properly enacted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the morning after the budget drivers were greeted with prices at the bowser 3c a litre more than they were when the petrol station closed the night before. Also from that time, the oil companies commenced payment of an extra 3c a litre for shipments of petrol made on or after 18 August. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hence, what we have is a demand for taxes without the appropriate authority to do so&mdash;taxes which Australian voters are already paying and have been paying for nine weeks. This is a disgrace. It is bad enough that additional taxes are introduced when times are tough, but to do so immediately without any assurance that the required legislation will pass through the parliament is sublimely arrogant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Vehicle owners already pay more than 12 per cent of total government receipts, and for the privilege drivers are slugged mercilessly for using some of the most poorly maintained roads in existence. The creation of a price differential between leaded and unleaded petrol by this government is nothing more than a money grabbing exercise under the thin veneer of environmental friendliness. Australia has seen seven years of unleaded petrol in passenger vehicles, but it still has not become the principal fuel, since new car sales dropped to a 20-year low in 1987, the year after the government's change towards unleaded petrol. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">More than 50 per cent of Australia's cars are at least nine years old compared with only 35 per cent a decade ago. Leaded petrol will remain at least 20 per cent of petrol purchased until the year 2,000. The prospect of paying a few dollars extra to run a car each week will not force a rush on new car yards. Drivers who are hard pressed to keep their heads above water now, will not feel inclined to give up their lead-using cars easily given the changeover cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead of raising the price of leaded petrol, the government, if it were at all serious about its own commitment to greenness and environmental friendliness, should have dropped the price of all fuel, and of unleaded fuel by even more. It would thereby make it easier for consumers, first, to save more money so they could switch to new cleaner cars; and, second, it would make it more attractive to use cleaner, unleaded fuel by offering realistic tax inducements rather than tax penalties. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">New, less polluting, environmentally friendly, high technology, unleaded fuel motor vehicles are well beyond the price range of the average Australian in these tough recessionary times. It is no wonder that we are keeping older cars on the road. What hope does the average Australian family have these days if it has to fork out the equivalent of a reasonable house deposit&mdash;between $25,000 and $30,000&mdash;to pay for a family sedan? It is criminal. To boot, this Labor government, the so-called friend of low income earners and battlers, turns around in the budget and hikes up the price of leaded fuel at the bowser for all and sundry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only way in which we are going to get drivers into more environmentally friendly, less polluting vehicles is to make the price of those vehicles lower&mdash;to produce cheaper motor vehicles. Indeed, that is what this country desperately needs: cheaper new cars. Apart from belatedly and slowly reducing tariffs on motor vehicles, this government has done nothing to achieve this goal. It has done nothing to free up the industrial relations structures and restrictive work practices in this country to ensure that motor vehicle manufacturers can become more productive and more efficient. It has done nothing to lift the tax burden off business by removing wholesale sales taxes, payroll taxes and the myriad other taxes that impact on business and on the costs of production and, therefore, the ultimate cost of motor vehicles. The government simply goes on its merry way, taxing more but doing nothing of real benefit to business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are going to really pursue the goal of having less polluting vehicles on the road, it is essential that we have cheaper motor vehicles. It is not just from motorists that we have had a cry of foul about the fuel tax increases in this budget; the road transport industry has also come out in strong condemnation of these tax hikes. It has no choice except to pass them directly on to consumers and customers or else to cut even further existing operating costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Diesel fuel is being bumped up by 5c a litre. On top of that, an increase in wholesale sales tax of two per cent will affect the transport industry. In industry language, that represents a 19 per cent increase on the existing diesel rate of 26.73c a litre and a 10 per cent increase on the typical sales tax rate of 20 per cent in wholesale sales tax. With the recession having bitten hard into the road transport industry, and with the fiercely competitive nature of that industry, margins are right down to the wire in any case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The road transport industry already pays double the amount of indirect taxes of any other industry group. For each dollar spent on road transport, one-third goes in taxes and charges. For the Treasurer to claim that such fuel tax charges would have no impact on jobs in the trucking industry is quite ludicrous. What he seems to have forgotten is that the transport and storage sector in this country contributes five per cent of our gross domestic product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A total of 385,000 people are employed directly in the transport industry. Road transport dominates total transport in this country. This sector alone contributes 2.4 per cent of Australia's gross domestic product. It moves 75 per cent of all freight nationally, the vast proportion of which cannot be transferred to rail or other transport methods due to the nature of the freight and operations. That figure represents about 990 million tonnes of freight. This sector directly employs well over 177,000 people, which is about 49 per cent of transport employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the Road Transport Forum, based on the estimated operating cost increase of $6,400 per long haul vehicle and an average wage of $40,000 per annum for operators, one in six jobs throughout this sector alone will be lost as a consequence of this tax increase. Given our current levels of unemployment, that is a very significant figure and one which I would have thought the government would have taken into account. The Treasurer appears to have conveniently forgotten about it&mdash;or else he is totally unaware of that impact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Thousands of individuals whose families depend on the small road transport business end of the industry will have to bear these unfair costs. Small transport companies make up the bulk of the industry. Approximate cost increases of $372 a week will be offset against possible government payments of only $8 a week. How can the government claim that this is a budget that will build jobs? It is a monstrous ruse and an enormous trick on the Australian population. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed diesel and sales tax increases will result in an average 2.6 per cent increase in short haul operating costs and a 3.3 per cent increase in long haul operating costs. Some sectors will be asked to withstand increases of up to five per cent, which they will clearly be unable to do. Profits will be all but wiped out. Overall, the impact of these taxes on vehicle operating costs represents a total industry operating cost increase of $275 million a year. Whichever way we look at the equation, it is crystal clear that the diesel and sales tax increases proposed by the government cannot be absorbed by the road transport industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we look at the Bureau of Industry Economics performance indicators on road transport from 1992, it is obvious that, in terms of tonnes per kilometre hauled, the major customer industries to road transport are the agricultural industry and the mining and building industries. Agriculture is predominantly export oriented, as well as domestic in nature, as is the mining sector. Neither can afford to sustain further tax increases handed down to them by the road transport industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cold hard facts of day are that if costs are passed on by the transport industry, which it will have to do to survive, all consumers will pay an additional $2 to $3 for an ordinary sized shopping trolley of goods from the supermarket. Those living and working in rural, isolated and regional areas of Australia will suffer as industries are forced to the wall, relocate or close down. If industries relocate from regional areas to major cities because of the burden of these costs, pollution, congestion and the deterioration of the urban environment will increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Companies which do not relocate or close down, which instead elect to cut operating costs, will do so by reducing the repair and maintenance of their vehicles as well as by reducing employment.

<PARA>The Treasurer's moves to increase indirect taxes and charges which affect the productivity of industry do absolutely nothing to instil confidence in his claims. Australia is one of the largest countries in the world. Compared with the United States and Canada, it is much more sparsely settled. It is, therefore, arrant nonsense to compare our fuel prices with those of smaller European countries. Indeed, we should be aiming for lower fuel prices than either America or Canada. Unless the government initiates this, its claim to commitment to international competitiveness will be shown to be mere lip-service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia should be seeking to have the cheapest road, rail and shipping transport costs, rather than imposing extra taxes on business inputs. Without the burden of taxes, the Australian transport industry would be the world leader in efficiency. But with the taxes and charges levied by this government, road transport efficiency in Australia has been relegated to a position well behind that of our major trading competitors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In short, the scheduled diesel excise increases and wholesale sales tax increases will impact on rail and road safety, as well as social, economic and environmental concerns within our community.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What industry and thousands of voters collectively say is that they have no faith in this government to deliver economic prosperity. The Liberal and National parties stand firmly in support of that stance. Perhaps the height of this government's hypocrisy&mdash;and it is ironic&mdash;was when it so distorted the issues at the last federal election. Above all, it was the cost of fuel that would have been reduced so significantly under the Fightback package offered by the coalition, with a 24c per litre reduction in the price of fuel for business purposes and a 19c per litre reduction in the price of fuel for private use. This government promised no tax increases at the last election and it told lies about the coalition's proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet at the first opportunity, we see the government heading in exactly the opposite direction to that in which we would have been heading under a coalition government.

It is a lesson that I hope the voters of South Australia will be mindful of in the state election due in the next few months. When they are told similar lies by the state Labor government about what might happen under a Liberal government, they need to remember what happened under a Labor government immediately the election was out of the way. </PARA>

The tobacco farmers, as Senator McGauran says, protest about these increases because they are affected by them, and that is a reasonable position from their point of view. In saying that, Senator McGauran brings out the difficulty in this whole argument.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Sherry's suggestion is right: it seems to be the coalition's new policy. I will illustrate the point that Senator Sherry, as usual, so ably makes. These two bills, one dealing with excise and the other dealing with customs, appear before us as separate bills because that is the constitutional requirement. We have had a series of bills which deal with the accounts of this country in a particular way. As each bill comes up for debate, protests are made. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McGauran made the shrewd observation that the tobacco farmers are protesting. Perhaps we should not tax tobacco because it will affect the tobacco farmers; we should not tax fuel because that will affect a range of people; when the wine tax came in, we must not tax the wine growers; when there is an increase in sales tax, that should not be allowed because we should not increase sales tax. The argument from those on the other side is not that the fuel taxes are the problem; the argument is that any tax is a problem.</PARA></TALK.START>

It would not convince me; it does not convince this side, but it might reasonably convince people generally. But when the objection to the fuel tax is joined with an objection to any tax that is put up by the government, the problem arises as to whether or not the opposition has any real conviction in opposing this particular tax when it simply is one of a whole series of taxes that it has opposed.</PARA></TALK.START>

I think Senator West was noting that down.

If the opposition is going to cut those areas, let us hear about it. If it is not going to cut those areas, where will the taxes come from? One of the answers is, `We don't have to worry about that because this is an exercise in punishment'. In the coalition's view, this government lied at the last election.

We will also hear about how badly people are affected by an increase in fuel taxes. I am sure anybody who has to pay an increase in tax, or tax at all, is affected. That is the reality of living in a society such as ours. If, on the other hand, there is a way through that can be properly put by the other side that maintains the overall strategy of this government&mdash;and, I understand, the overall strategy of the opposition&mdash;to reduce the deficit and at the same time keep us in the sorts of public services we all need, let us hear about how the opposition will do it and let us hear it with some particularity. </PARA>

It is mainly coming from the roads, through fuel. Australia runs on fuel. It runs on nothing else, and 80 or 90 per cent is diesel fuel. That is what it runs on. The government is throwing its net around, trying to gain more revenue, rather than attacking spending. It wants to get the money from the people who keep Australia going. That is the problem. It goes into transport and transport goes into everything else. Everything in Australia, one way or another, is concerned with transport. We cannot get away from that.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not need to underline the fact that the road transport industry is vital to Australia's economic performance and therefore to community wellbeing. The federal government itself recognised this when it conducted an inquiry which led to the setting up of the National Road Transport Commission to rationalise transport in Australia and bring down costs. After all, the transport sector in Australia contributes about five per cent of GDP and employs 385,000 people directly. Then, of course, there is the flow-on effect. The road transport component alone contributes 2.4 per cent of GDP.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at the effect of these cost increases. When one increases the costs of road transport, there are two things that the industry can do. First, it can pass the costs on to the consumer. That is what will happen because the industry cannot absorb any more. We have already been told how the cost of an average shopping basket will increase by about $3 when these excise increases are passed on. Secondly, if the industry cannot pass it on, then it has to absorb it and cut costs somewhere else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian road transport operates on a profit margin of about two per cent. That means for the operator a rise in costs of about 2 1/2 per cent. The government will wipe out any sort of profit operators may make. Having arrived at that situation, what do the operators do next? I am still in the transport game and so I know what they will do. In order not to eat into their margins, they have to cut costs further, make their vehicles and their tyres last a bit longer and service vehicles a bit less frequently. In other words, operators have to start cutting the costs of their plant. The plant then gets run down and is nowhere near as efficient. One of the worst things is that the plant may not be as safe on the road as it should be. If operators buy less new plant and equipment, it affects manufacturers and distributors all the way down the line. However, the government does not believe all this will happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give the Senate a rough breakdown of the impact of these increases on road transport operating costs. For example, the fuel taxes and levies will rise two per cent in the short haul urban operations and more than three per cent in the long haul operations.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Menzies government put it on. It was an admirable thing to do because it was used to maintain and bituminise roads around Australia, but any fuel used off-road was rebated. That system remained from 1957 until this Labor government came to power. When this Labor government came to power it decided to have some of it itself. So instead of the 7c that should be going on roads, this government is spending less than 6c. Twenty-six cents minus five or six leaves you with 20c in your pocket.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Now the government has imposed an administration fee. It claims that those who pay for the diesel fuel used in  off-road operations are able to claim it back under the legislation. This government is giving us back our own money and calling it an aid to industry. It has brought in an administration charge to administer our money that it has had the use of, interest free, for months on end. And I can tell honourable senators from my experience that it is a minimum of two months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government has fallen flat on its face. Senator McMullan thinks he knows as much about taxation as Senator Watson does. He failed to pick up the fact that this administration fee would be tax deductible as a measure for ongoing business. It is a deductible item against one's income. The fee will raise $4.4 million from farmers and $5.5 million from the mining industry&mdash;a total of $9.9 million. How much of that is the government really going to get? It just shows how this government rushes in to see where it can get the extra dollar without doing its homework. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the committee stage of this debate I am going to ask Senator McMullan exactly what the final result of that $9.9 million is, allowing for the fact that it is tax deductible&mdash;and it is tax deductible; I have had enough expert opinion from chartered accountants around the place that it is. So the government might in the final analysis still have fallen on its face. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government stands condemned for bringing in such an administration charge on the basis of one per cent. Some farmers and other operators may lodge claims for $3,000, $4,000 or $5,000. I suppose they are fairly tedious claims to process in an office. But when a mining company lodges a claim that is worth $1 million, and there are plenty of mining companies that use more than $1 million worth of diesel fuel a week, a clerk only has to yea or nay for that one invoice&mdash;one does not even send an invoice thanks to former Senator Button's last amendment; I will give him that&mdash;and an administration fee of $10,000 is charged. That is totally ridiculous. If the government wants such a system it should at least charge people what it costs. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">No matter what pious protestations we get to the contrary, that was the understanding of the Australian people. It is no good Labor members of parliament, Labor senators, Labor ministers getting up and saying, `We did not say we would not have any tax increases. We said there would be no new taxes'. That was dishonest. The understanding of the people of Australia was that there would be no tax hikes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Who from the Labor side of parliament said during the election campaign that they would increase taxes on the price of fuel, that they would increase wholesale sales taxes and so on?  These tax increases are at a time of the worst unemployment since the great depression and, I might say regrettably, with not a glimmer of light at the end of the tunnel that will make our import replacement and export businesses that much more competitive.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Great efforts have been made in recent years by industries to contain and reduce their costs to remain competitive. What they cannot control, however, are costs such as government imposts which introduce a major element of uncertainty into investment decisions, be they for expansion or new development. It raises again that matter of sovereign risk. The mining industry is the only major industry in Australia today which has saved the economy from total collapse. It is in the main export oriented and has the greatest potential for value added, something that I personally have been promoting for some 20-odd years. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Now let us move to Nabalco. Nabalco mines bauxite at Gove and goes to the trouble of using fuel oil to convert that raw material bauxite into alumina. In the process it requires substantial quantities of fuel oil. In fact, it has been pointed out by Nabalco that it uses over 60 per cent of total inland consumption and around 45 per cent of total fuel oil subject to duty in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That company is going to the next stage of value adding&mdash;it is converting bauxite into alumina. Yet what does this fuel oil price increase do to Nabalco? It increases its costs by $25 million a year. If that is not an encouragement for that company to say, `Why do we bother? Why not just move the bauxite across to Indonesia or somewhere else and convert it to alumina?', what is? Bear in mind that what Nabalco does is bring in the fuel oil directly by ship from a source of supply overseas. It hardly touches the coast of Australia without it being used to convert bauxite into alumina, in the value added process, and then Nabalco goes into the export business&mdash;another export industry hit by this impost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The remarks made by Nabalco are interesting. One point that is very important is sovereign risk. When one invests in a major project, it is important that the rules that are laid down for that major project are not changed because massive amounts of capital have to be invested. This heightens the sovereign risk of investing in mining and minerals processing in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question is often asked: why does Nabalco not use natural gas? The Northern Territory government did propose that Nabalco should use natural gas, but on all the offers made it was less competitive. Even if it was competitive today, because of all the other associated problems that did not exist in those days, it would probably be impossible because that pipeline would run through a lot of Aboriginal lands, heritage areas and so on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that I think is important to recognise is that companies like Nabalco&mdash;and what I am saying is not limited to Nabalco; it covers anyone in the export industry whether they be wool producers, suppliers of coal to the export markets, or suppliers of anything in the export market&mdash;cannot increase the price because of government imposts. They must go along with world market prices. Everyone is aware of the fact that commodity prices are depressed. No-one is forecasting any massive increases. Even if anyone were, when these out of field imposts proposed by the government come in, they make life more difficult for those involved in the export industry. The fuel excise cannot be passed on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that I think is worth drawing attention to is the fact that it is common knowledge today that there will be no more aluminium smelters in Australia. For a country that is so rich in energy, that is an absolute disgrace. The only increase we are seeing is the expansion of QAL at Gladstone. That is simply an extension of the pipelines. But it has been made very clear to me by all the people involved in smelting&mdash;there are not that many, but those who are&mdash;that any future smelter will happen overseas. </PARA>

For many years I have often questioned why a country like Australia&mdash;an island continent; one of the great trading nations&mdash;has never been able to have a decent merchant navy. It was always because our work conditions did not match those of the rest of the world and the manning levels on ships were too high. In fact, it is not so many years ago that when the Japanese, Koreans and other people were bringing in ships&mdash;not the rust bucket type ships&mdash;with crews of 19 and 20, the level on Australian ships was 45 and 46. They have got that level down and they get torpedoed by the government that is supposed to represent them. How do those opposite think the Seamen's Union feels now?

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another item I would like to cover is the price of gas. One might ask, `What has the price of gas got to do with the fuel price increase?'. It is another unintended consequence of this dishonest tax because many of the people who made arrangements for the supply of natural gas had the price determined tied to the price of fuel oil, which included excises. This is the case, I understand, in Western Australia and it is certainly the case at Queensland Alumina in Gladstone. Just for interest, I would like to refer to a submission made by Queensland Alumina. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following commissioning in 1957 QAL's refinery was the lowest cost producer in the world.</PARA>
<PARA>That is why it went there. That is why in the future the only way we will get industry in Australia is if those parameters come back in as they did in 1957. The submission further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This fact undoubtedly contributed to three major increases in plant capacity during the late 60's and early 70's. QAL's Gladstone refinery is now the largest alumina refinery in the world producing approximately 9% of world requirements.</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Throughout the 1980's, however, with the advent of newer competing plants with modern technology QAL slipped significantly in world competitiveness. A concerted effort by all members of the workforce over the past six years has resulted in an improvement in competitiveness. . .</PARA>
<PARA>Mr Acting Deputy President, because of the fuel price hikes in the 1970s, do you know what QAL did? It switched to gas. Do you know what its gas agreement was? It was tied to the price of fuel oil, including excises. So yet again we have a major industry with another nail in its coffin because of an impost by a government which does not give a damn about import replacement, does not give a damn about exports and obviously does not give a damn about employment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are seeing with, for example, Nabalco is pressure to sell bauxite on its own and not go into the value adding that this country so desperately needs and which this coalition offered in its Fightback program. That is what it was all about. We are berated by this government for opposing these tax increases, which we and the rest of Australia know is the height of utter responsibility; that is, if the government has any heart and it is worried about the million people out of work. Why is the government now destroying the very industries that can generate real jobs? The damage being done by this government is such that I regret to say it will take years to recover. </PARA>

My major concern is to put into context these proposals with regard to the general investment climate here in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While our major problems in Australia are unemployment, the lack of true economic growth, and rises in incomes, the government's budget really does nothing to address these major concerns for the longer term and does nothing to encourage investment in this country. In fact, quite the contrary. The government's budget encourages higher costs to business and these additional levies on oil and fuels are good examples of that. As a consequence, it makes Australia less attractive for investment and hence the chances of us getting higher growth in employment and lower unemployment are receding into the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To put this into context, I want to talk about the investment climate here in Australia. I think there are two major matters which have yet to really sink into the consciousness of the Australian community. Those two matters are, firstly, globalisation and, secondly, the huge growth of the East Asian economies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to globalisation, I am really talking about the fact that, in all of our markets, we in Australia are now part of the world economy and can no longer look at ourselves in isolation. Since the freeing up of the exchange rate and the freeing up of our finance markets over 10 years ago, all businesses in Australia, regardless of whatever protection they have had in the past, are being forced to be internationally competitive&mdash;some slowly, some quickly. This is also having effects on governments with government businesses also being forced to be internationally competitive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The implications for the Australian economy are that we all have to be efficient and we have to look to being internationally competitive with industries outside Australia and to servicing the world market. It is from that context that investments in Australia or any other part of the world will derive. In other words, if Australia is attractive for investment, if we are the lowest cost producer and provide good service, then investment will take place, be it from Australian or overseas dollars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other critical factor that has not sunk into the Australian consciousness is, I believe, the huge size and growth of the East Asian market. East Asia contains 1.7 billion people. It has had a GDP growth of over six to seven per cent a year in the last five to 10 years and the expectations for the rest of this decade are that its growth will be at least six to seven per cent a year, which means a per capita growth in real terms of four to five per cent a year. To put that into context for us here in Australia, we are talking about an annual growth to the north of us of two Australian economies per year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have no choice here in Australia but to face outwardly to the world and to face up to being competitive with East Asia. Mind you, the government does not like us making comparisons with East Asia, particularly on tax regimes, and insists on comparing us with the OECD. But what are the OECD countries doing? They are working hard to contain their budget deficits, they are endeavouring to encourage savings and they are also endeavouring to deregulate their labour markets. What are we doing? We are heading in exactly the opposite direction, swimming against the tide, yet we want to attract investment dollars to encourage growth and reduce unemployment here. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are we doing? On the labour side, the government has obviously given in in relation to genuine enterprise agreements and given in to the ACTU. Currently, it is threatening to give in on secondary boycotts&mdash;again, contrary to what is happening in the rest of the world. It is the reverse direction and it is going to guarantee double digit unemployment in Australia for quite a few years to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What are we doing about savings? Savings in Australia continue to fall. In the last quarter, the June quarter, national savings fell by 1.2 per cent of GDP. That is about $1.2 billion. It was the largest fall in savings in this economy since 1974. Over the whole of the last financial year, national savings fell by $3.2 billion. As the Fitzgerald report aptly pointed out, the main culprit has been the federal government.

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="2046" SPEAKER="Schacht Sen The Hon C.C." NAMEID="4J4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator Schacht</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) While CSIRO's overall appropriation budget has been slowly increasing in recent years, the budgets of some Divisions such as Entomology have remained fairly constant. The decisions on the overall funding for all Divisions within CSIRO are made by the CSIRO Board and the Institute Directors, and the Divisions review the priority of each of their research programs, reducing or ceasing lower priority programs to allow higher priority work to be increased or commenced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through such a process the Division of Entomology has decided to reduce its work in temperate horticulture by June 1993. This program will then be terminated if adequate alternative funding has not been found. Financial support is being sought from external sources.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Most of the work on pheromones has been funded from appropriation funds and the results passed on to the various interested parties without cost. Although the level of funding contributed by the horticulture industry for R&amp;D has increased recently, the industry contribution is still quite low compared with that of other rural industries. For these reasons, the Division ranked this program as a lower priority than many other programs. However, it now seems likely that sufficient funding will be obtained externally to continue the most important aspects of the work.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The figure of thirty-five referred to the total number of people in the Division for whom there may not be sufficient funds. To date, sixteen redundancies have been announced. Within the area of temperate horticulture, staff numbers have been reduced by five through an early retirement, a secondment and three transfers. Five people remain.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) A reduction in pesticide use is desirable for public health and for the environment and may become essential for certain export commodities due to decisions of Governments in importing countries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) The Division of Entomology's pheromone group is the only one in the country with the collective expertise and equipment to carry out most facets of research into insect pheromones&mdash;from basic research into pheromones to the field testing of pheromone products for pest control.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) Pheromones have the potential to reduce the use of pesticides. They can be used to monitor pest infestations so that pesticides are only applied when the insects are actually present, rather than on a speculative basis. They can also be used to directly control pests, especially moths and beetles, by disrupting the mating of these insects.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A good example of the latter is the control of Oriental Fruit Moth in peach orchards, where a product developed from work done in the Division of Entomology has already achieved significant market penetration in Australia and is now on sale in the USA and Europe. This product completely substituted for pesticides and in some areas pheromone control has eliminated the insect pest altogether. Currently, trials are in progress using similar technology, to control Codling Moth in apples and pears where the industry has set itself a target of reducing use of pesticides by 50% by the year 1996.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(7) The Government encourages the establishment of research priorities and consequent reductions in lower priority areas allow higher priority work to be continued or increased. An important input in determination of priorities is the willingness of industry to collaborate in research.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) I am advised that nationally, the numbers of applications for and approvals of legal aid have been affected by the tightening of the eligibility criteria by a number of Commissions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Legal aid commissions are independent statutory bodies established under State and Territory legislation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Legal Aid Commission of NSW introduced new policies severely restricting civil law matters from 1 January 1993. Under these policies applications in respect of environmental matters are not eligible for a grant of aid. The Commission is reviewing these policies with the aim of reinstating aid for civil matters where possible. Further it should be noted that the Commission also administers funding for the Public Interest Advocacy Centre which provides assistance in public interest cases which would extend to toxic chemical cases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Legal Aid Commission of Queensland amended its guidelines on 20 July 1993 to rule out the provision of assistance in civil cases where there is a power to award costs. Since that time, however, the Commission has taken on the administration of a scheme utilising funds provided by the Public Trustee of Queensland to fund cases of this type on an outlays only basis, i.e. to cover the costs of solicitors outlays in providing assistance.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the 1991-92 and 1992-93 financial years the Commonwealth has fulfilled its funding responsibility under its agreements with the States and Territories for the provision of legal aid. In addition it has provided additional funding in areas of non criminal law outside of the base funding provisions of the agreements to meet the impact of its initiatives on legal aid commissions. An example of this is the funding provided by the Commonwealth for the legal aid aspects of the Child Support Scheme. $5.7m was provided to legal aid commissions for this in 1992-93. The Commonwealth has also provided an increase of $7.4m (in 1991-92 dollars) in its contribution to commissions for the period 1991-92 to 1993-94, in response to an increased demand for legal services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) I am advised that the question of whether litigation expenses of a corporation are allowable as business expense tax deductions depends on whether they have the character of losses or outgoings necessarily incurred in carrying on the corporation's business for the purpose of gaining or producing assessable income.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under Section 47(2) of its Legal Aid Act the NSW Legal Aid Commission is given indemnity from paying costs in excess of $12,000 awarded against its clients. The inclusion of such a provision in the act allows the Commission to provide aid without the risk of incurring a major award of costs against it by the courts, and is therefore a further factor in ensuring that a greater number of legal aid cases are funded.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) The Commonwealth has in place schemes which provide grants of financial assistance for litigants for the conduct of cases in courts and tribunals where ordinary legal aid is not available and where the circumstances constitute special cases of Commonwealth interest envisaged by relevant legislation and guidelines.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statement quoted by Senator Chamarette was taken from an address on the commercial benefits of Australian development cooperation which Mr Flood delivered to the National Trade and Investment Forum in July 1993. Taken in its original context the statement refers to the commercial benefits which have been estimated to accrue to Australia, not from the aid program as a whole, but from development cooperation with China over the last decade.  The relevant paragraph reads as follows:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our [AIDAB's] study of the commercial benefits resulting from development cooperation with China over the period 1980-81 to 1991-92 found that $285 million in AIDAB funding generated $838 million in actual or anticipated business.  In other words, for every dollar of aid funding involved, three dollars worth of returns to Australia have either been achieved or are expected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The returns to Australia from the program as a whole are, of course, much harder to estimate.   We know that on most recent estimates around 87 per cent of the aid budget is spent in Australia.  While this figure does not take into account flow-on effects, it at least represents the lower bound of the program's commercial benefits.  More generally, the economic development of the countries in our region, to which our development cooperation has contributed, has underpinned the large growth in trade between these countries and Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The primary objective of the Australian development cooperation program is to promote the economic and social advancement of people in developing countries through an appropriate mix of measures to promote economic development and alleviate immediate suffering.  The resources transferred to developing countries through the development cooperation program directly achieve this by meeting fundamental infrastructure, training, commodity and technical assistance needs.  At the same time, given  that in most cases the goods and services required for aid activities must be sourced from industrialised countries, and given the current economic environment, the Government would be remiss if it did not seek to secure a fair share of the returns from such activities for Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While it has long been accepted that the aid program has a legitimate role to play in promoting Australia's commercial interests, commercial benefits are not sought where they would compromise aid quality.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) Any regulation of the importation of Tasmanian Pacific oysters into New South Wales (NSW) is primarily a State responsibility and I am unaware of any Commonwealth restrictions. I understand that live Pacific oysters can be imported into NSW for human consumption only. Bonamiosis is a disease caused by the protozoan Bonamia which affects only the native flat oyster, sometimes causing mortality. There is no scientific evidence that Bonamia can be spread on the shell or in the shell liquor of the Pacific oyster. As the Pacific oyster is not affected by the disease, there should be no effect on the trade of Tasmanian Pacific oysters into NSW.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Because there is always some concern that bonamia organisms might be carried by other oysters, I am advised that live oysters can only be imported into NSW for human consumption, and must be processed at approved sites from where effluent enters the sewers resulting in the destruction of the bonamia organism. Therefore, the viability of the NSW oyster industry should not be affected.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) On the available evidence, I believe that there is a negligible chance only that the NSW oyster industry will be adversely affected by bonamiosis derived from imported Tasmanian Pacific oysters.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Regulation for the interstate movement of oysters is controlled by State and Territory governments. All governments are aware of the possibility that the movement of oysters, particularly for breeding/growing out, is capable of spreading disease and pest species. I am advised that appropriate controls, commensurate with the risks involved, are being taken by these governments.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Bonamiosis affects only flat oysters; the disease is present in many countries and, I am advised, is not a disease of human health significance. In February 1992, Australia reported the presence of the disease to the Office Internationale des Epizooties which, in turn, advised all member countries. I understand that, to date, no concerns have been raised with the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. The impact on Australian exports of oysters should, therefore, be minimal.</PARA>

The Nuclear Science and Technology Agreement has no administrative arrangements either as part of it or proposed to be part of it.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1&amp;2) A three year moratorium declared by the Federal Government in December 1989 requested State and Territory Governments to enact appropriate regulations prohibiting the irradiation of food and the sale of irradiated food in Australia.

This ensures the maintenance of the moratorium, beyond the initial three years, until the National Food Authority recommends a standard on food irradiation to the National Food Standards Council (a body comprised of the Health Ministers of all States and Territories, and of the Commonwealth).

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service (AQIS) is not conducting any sampling under its Imported Food Inspection Program to ensure food has not been irradiated.

AGAL's advice is that analytical techniques suitable for routine detection of irradiation of food do not exist, although there are techniques involving thermoluminescence, electron spin resonance and gas chromatography which show promise. AGAL is not currently undertaking research aimed at developing reliable methodology for detection of irradiated food but is keeping abreast of the results of other studies on the topic.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Australian Market Basket Survey (AMBS) arrived at different results than the Western Australian study but the two studies used different methodologies. Both the AMBS and the WA study found that the instances of detecting residues in human milk and the level of residues in human milk are decreasing.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AMBS examines whole human breast milk, in keeping with its policy to analyse food `as consumed'. In comparison, the Western Australian study analysed the fat of human milk. Surveys of pesticide residues in the fat of human milk consistently result in higher pesticide levels than those using whole human milk. In a low fat substance such as human milk, fat soluble pesticides are highly concentrated in the small amount of fat. This results in very high levels of pesticide in the fat of what is, in total, a low residue food. As the WA study used the level of fat in human milk as the basis of its analysis, it introduces another source of error into the estimation of intake, that is the average level of fat in human milk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The WA study acknowledges that this is a very variable level, varying with the age of the baby, the time of the feed and within the feed.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further point of difference between the two studies was that the AMBS analysed composite human milk samples whereby the milk of a number of mothers is collected by methods that do not interfere with the running of a busy maternity ward. Only small amounts of milk were collected from each mother. In the WA study individual mothers volunteered to join the study. These mothers would be required to provide milk not only for their babies but also for the research, therefore they would be more likely than the AMBS mothers to be in negative energy balance and to be using up their fat reserves. This therefore results in a higher amount of pesticides in their milk.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The WA study includes a value equal to half the limit of detection for all `not detected' results, which will inflate the estimates of the Hexachlorobenzene, Heptachlor, and Chlordane intakes.

The seamen had previously been assisted by the International Transport Workers Federation (ITWF) in Australia to secure back pay and repatriation costs from their Greek shipping agent. Qantas was unaware of the controversy surrounding the Burmese seamen and was under the impression that the Singaporean authorities had approved access. This was the full extent of Qantas involvement: Qantas had no role in the detention of the seamen at Changi airport from 3-7 June, or in their repatriation to Burma on 7 June.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) No provisions of Australian legislation have been breached by Qantas.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During the visit to Canberra on 6 August by an official Burmese delegation, I expressed Australia's concern at suggestions that Burmese officials had played a role in the disappearance of the seamen. The Australian Ambassador in Rangoon conveyed this concern to the Burmese Minister of Transport and officials of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on 2 September. The main concern of the Australian Government has, of course, been for the welfare of the semen themselves. The incident at Changi airport is essentially a matter for the Singaporean and Burmese authorities: I note that the Singapore Government has found sufficient evidence of improper conduct by the Burmese Embassy in Singapore to lodge a protest with that Embassy about its conduct with regard to the seamen.</PARA>

The Group agreed that the risk of direct Commonwealth involvement would be to duplicate or detract from the work done by the UN Secretary-General and his emissaries.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) No decision has been taken by the Government and no recommendations have at this stage been put before Ministers concerning any change in Australia's contribution of 20 civilian police to the UN Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The Government will review Australia's participation in UNFICYP before the end of the current mandate period in December 1993, in the light of a review of UNFICYP by the UN Security Council, also scheduled for December 1993. The nature of this review will be routine, although all options concerning the Australian contribution to UNFICYP will be considered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The annual cost to the Australian Federal Police for the contribution of 20 civilian police officers to UNFICYP is A$1.75 million. Until 15 June 1993, UNFICYP as a whole was funded by voluntary contributions from governments. Australia had for some time contributed a sum of US$100,000 each calendar year towards the overall costs of the force in addition to the cost of providing the civilian police contingent. For budgetary reasons, the Australian Government reduced its most recent voluntary contribution to US$100,000 for the 18 month period from 1 January 1992 to 15 June 1993. Since 16  June 1993, UNFICYP has been placed under the same funding arrangements as apply to most other UN peace keeping operations, ie mandatory assessments are levied on all UN member states for a proportion of the total, for those costs which are not otherwise met by voluntary contributions. Under these new funding arrangements, Australia's assessed contributions are likely to be, according to the latest estimate by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, about US$256,000 annually.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) No. The Government of Cyprus, however, advised the UN Secretary-General in a letter dated 15 April 1993 that it will make an annual voluntary contribution equal to one third of the annual cost of UNFICYP.</PARA>

While the Australian Government is concerned that the continued presence of UNFICYP should not provide conditions for the parties to the dispute to avoid serious engagement in a negotiated settlement, we believe UNFICYP continues to play an important role in preventing an outbreak of violence on the buffer zone and maintaining the de facto ceasefire.</PARA>
