<TITLE>Medicare Benefits for Optometric Examinations</TITLE>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully shows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1.Optometry has been covered by Medicare since its inception in 1975, and currently provides eye care to over 2.4 million people each year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.Removal of optometric benefits from Medicare will increase Government expenditure on eye care, as people will instead obtain their care from a more expensive source.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.The cost to the public of eye care will increase, both through the removal of benefits for optometric consultations and the shift to ophthalmologists who generally charge well over the scheduled fee.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.The visual welfare of the community will suffer as people are discouraged from seeking eye care. Many eye diseases, such as glaucoma, do not produce symptoms until they are in an advanced stage. Any discouragement from seeking regular eye care will increase suffering from these diseases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5.The removal of benefits for optometric examinations will disadvantage children, as undetected visual disorders will adversely affect their development and school performance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6.Access to eye care will be reduced, particularly in rural areas, as part-time and visiting optometric practices will no longer be economically viable, and alternate care is not available.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We therefore request that the Parliament take steps to ensure that Medicare continues to be a universal health insurance system and that all eye examinations by optometrists are covered.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of the 10,000-odd community minded persons who are Local Government elected Councillors and Aldermen within Australia, some are paid full time salaries and wages, some are paid nothing at all. The majority though do receive allowances in the form of meeting allowances paid monthly. These meeting allowances range between about $3,000 annually and $20,000 annually with the vast majority in the $5,000 to $10,000 range.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There have been rulings from the Tax Office that in relation to the Superannuation Guarantee Act, Councillors are deemed to be employees and their monthly allowances are deemed to be salary and wages.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This will mean that even for those Councillors receiving a meeting allowance which amounts to just a small annual sum, the Superannuation Guarantee Levy will have to be paid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The effect of this though, is that where the meeting allowance received by the elected Councillor is more than 10% of his annual income, then the attachment of the Levy to those allowances precludes the recipient from claiming in his or her tax return the $3,000 tax deduction and 75% of any amounts over that figure in private  superannuation over.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So for a very minor reward from the compulsory superannuation, recipients will be deprived the opportunity of claiming tax deductions on their contributions to their own superannuation savings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is grossly unfair and will mean that many hardworking community conscious citizens will give up their role on Local Councils simply because they cannot afford the financial burden of being prevented from obtaining the tax deduction everyone else gets when contributing to their own superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Labor Party directly promised that it would move amendments to overcome this anomaly but nowhere in the Governments forward legislation program is the legislation mentioned.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It's just another in a long series of broken promises from this Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To correct the broken promises and to do what the Government undertook to do, I have introduced a Private Senators Bill and I seek the support of all sections of the Parliament in supporting this Bill to remove this anomalous provision for Local Government members and to keep the Government accountable for it's promises.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, it gives me great pleasure to reintroduce this Private Members Bill which was previously introduced by Senator Janet Powell in May of this year. I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate Senator Powell for the enormous amount of work that she and her staff put into the preparation of this very important Bill. I would also like to thank her for the invitation to pursue this Bill now that she is, unfortunately, no longer a member of this parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is very appropriate that this Second Reading speech should take place on the first day of Spring. In her famous book,"Silent Spring", Rachel Carson alerted the world to the dangers of toxic chemicals and warned against their proliferation. This Bill has taken up that challenge and proposes a system that allows the general public access to information about the use, storage, handling, transportation, recycling and manufacture of toxic chemicals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Janet Powell neatly summarised the aims of the Bill in her Second Reading Speech on 19 May 1993. She stated:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">"This Bill will not only provide for a National inventory of All toxic chemicals currently in use in Australia, but also the information relating to the health and environmental effects of toxic chemical use, reports from industry of toxic chemical releases, the production and disposal of toxic chemicals, reports on the emergency procedures that are in place and reports on methods of reducing the use of toxic chemicals. The most important and fundamental object of this legislation however, is that all of this information is to be made freely available to the community through the Registrar.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is worth noting at this point that a legislative approach to information on toxic chemicals is not new. In the United States, for example, the concept that the community has a right to know about the hazards of toxic chemicals has had widespread acceptance since the early 1980's. This community concern was given legislative form in 1986 with the passing of the Federal "Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act" which gave the public access to information about the uses and emissions of toxic chemicals. Similar legislation, such as the well known Proposition 65 in California, has been passed in various States in the United States.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This legislative approach has proved valuable to many communities in the United States in protecting the health and well-being of their families. In an article entitled "What you don't know can hurt you. . . and what you can do about it!", Deborah Sheiman points to the fact that the 1986 Emergency Planning and Community Right to Know Act ". . . has become a powerful tool to community groups concerned about their environments. The law has stimulated a virtual revolution in industry attitudes towards toxic chemical releases. Many companies have voluntarily committed themselves to sharp cutbacks and, ultimately, elimination of hazardous pollutants. Armed with the right-to-know incentive, citizens are publicly demanding cleanup commitments from local industries, thus illustrating the essence of grass-roots environmentalism.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These signs of hope in the United States are in marked contrast to the despair of many communities in Australia who are battling to obtain information about the toxic chemicals that prevail in their region. In my home State of Western Australia, for example, the citizens of Welshpool in suburban Perth have been fighting for many years to find out what waste is being burnt at a commercial incinerator in Felspar Road. It is now becoming apparent that the very toxic substance PCB was being burnt in that incinerator for a number of years without proper controls, without the permission of the State Government authorities and obviously without the knowledge of the local community.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In another example, a businessman is taking action against Bunnings after he discovered seven 200 litre drums of sodium nitrate that also contained arsenic, on a property he had bought to establish a marron farm. Ironically, the drums were dumped on the site by Bunnings after advice from the W.A. Health Department. The businessman was never advised about the drums when he bought the property and was only informed of their existence by neighbours. Soil and water samples have confirmed that arsenic and chromium have leached into the surrounding area and the farm is now useless for marron breeding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Lorinna, in Northern Tasmania, a local community has been fighting the Tasmanian Forestry Commission for many years about the use of a chemical known as Atrazine for weed suppression in plantation areas. Their difficulty has been in obtaining information about the toxicity of the chemical and the recommended levels that have been set by international agencies such as the World Health Organisation. The information was finally obtained by my office with the assistance of researchers in the Parliamentary Library and assisted in determining that the level of Atrazine in the  streams which provide the local community with drinking water was in excess of World Health Organisation recommended levels.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Coode Island disaster was referred to by Janet Powell in her Second Reading speech and I commend fellow Senators to obtain a copy of her speech and read the appropriate sections. It is appropriate in this context, however, to refer to the final report of the Independent Coode Island Review Panel of March 1992 which recommended the enactment of Community Right to Know legislation ". . . to assist public understanding of hazardous materials and the production processes." That recommendation should be followed at both State and Federal level.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The work of Naomi Segal and the Western Australian group "Householders for Safe Pesticide Use" should also be mentioned. Naomi and her group work tirelessly in the community fighting to obtain information about the use, storage and disposal of toxic chemicals. Their work would be substantially eased if legislation such as this were passed. Rather than battling against bureaucratic inertia and claims commercial confidentiality, the information they seek would be available from a central registry authority and they could then concentrate their efforts in promoting a safer environment for all communities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Legislation should not be considered to be an extension of F.O.I. It goes further by establishing the doctrine that toxic chemicals information affects the whole community and as such the community has the right to obtain such data. It will no longer be the privilege of those whose vested interest it is to keep this information out of the public gaze.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As such the Bill has a strong connection with the Whistleblowers Protection Bill 1993 which I intend to formally introduce in the Senate on the 1st October. In many ways the two Bills are complementary. The Community Right to Know legislation will force corporations to place on the public record all information relating to the manufacture, use, storage and disposal of toxic chemicals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is extremely appropriate to be introducing this legislation today when this matter is coming under scrutiny at an environmental law conference in Hobart over the next three days. Professor Gunningham, the director of the Australian Centre for Environmental Law at ANU commented this morning that legislation of this type is very important because there is a clear need for a regulatory framework in addition to industry codes of practice.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Whistleblowers Protection Bill will provide protection to those people who are forced to "blow the whistle" on companies and individuals who fail to act responsibly. Both of these Bill address the need for greater accountability through by providing for greater disclosure in the public interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As Senator Powell pointed out in her second reading speech, the major elements of the Bill include;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1) The establishment of a Registrar, who collects information, as contained in the Objects of the Act, from the chemical industry and makes that information available to the public upon request. This will be done through the creation of an on-line data base, available at local libraries, a 008 phone number or through application to the Registrar's office. Studies both in Australia and overseas have shown that the chemical industry is unwilling to respond directly to community requests for information. Through the establishment of an independent Registrar these barriers will be taken away.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2) Provision of information about emergency procedures, health and environment effects and reports on releases of toxic chemicals for public perusal and comment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clearly the environment would benefit greatly from the introduction of this Legislation. As a result of the publicly accessible data base and telephone hotline, the public would be able to discover hitherto secret information about toxic releases from chemical facilities. Facilities would report toxic releases to air, water and land. Already in the United States since the introduction of the Emergency Planning and <EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Community Right to Know</EMPHASIS> Act in 1986,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3) Public involvement throughout the process of implementing and developing the framework provided for in this Legislation. For example, the Registrar will, in consultation with industry and community bodies, develop codes of practice regarding the safe production and use of toxic chemicals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Obviously industry self-regulation, although attempting to have the community's interests at heart, does not have the required commitment to work openly with the public. This Legislation would make the chemical industry more accountable to the community. Through the provisions in the Bill the public can find out what chemicals a business is using.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Legislation would guarantee public access to chemical information for use in emergency response, pollution prevention and/or control and local community information or action groups. The information would also be useful for land use planning, insurance, property transfer or any other public purpose.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I trust that this Bill will be given serious consideration by all Honourable Senators and may I finish with the words of Janet Powell who stated that, "this Bill represents an important step forward in the protection of the health and safety of Australians and the environment in which we live.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main purpose of this Bill, the second of these two associated Bills, is to amend the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987 to set the amount of the charge payable under the previous Bill and to specify when the charge is to be paid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill provides that the annual charge payable for ASO safeguards activities by each uranium producer is $500,000, or a lesser amount if the regulations so provide.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, I said in my earlier remarks that the uranium companies would pay no more than is reasonable, having regard to the nature and costs of the relevant activities undertaken by ASO. This will be achieved by ensuring that the regulations annually specify an amount, less than the upper limit in the Bill, which represents the reasonable costs of the relevant activities undertaken by the ASO in that year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the Government's clear intention that the uranium companies will be fully consulted each year on the planned program of ASO activities and costs and the charge proposed, before the final charge is set in the regulations. In other words, company officials will sit down each year with the Director of Safeguards and other relevant officials and seek to agree on the level of ASO activity in relation to the companies' operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Naturally, the Government must retain the ultimate responsibility to determine the annual charge to ensure that the safeguards and physical protection programs fully meet all requirements and obligations, so that the uranium mining companies may keep operating. However, the views of the companies will be fully considered each year, and the Government will itself continue to pay for ASO activities which benefit the Government and the Australian community generally.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ASO's program of activities for 1993-94 is of course not determined at this stage, so the charge for 1993-94 cannot yet be specified. We have, however, arrived at an indicative charge based on ASO's 1992-93 program. On this basis, we estimate an annual charge of about $340,000 for each of the uranium companies. For its part, the Government would contribute annually about $250,000 in connection with ANSTO operations and a further $460,000 for wider community benefits.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The maximum charge specified in the Bill&mdash;of $500,000 for each uranium producer&mdash;has been set to ensure that the legislation will not require frequent amendment. I emphasise, however, that it does not represent in any sense the charge that will in fact be payable by the companies unless and until their reasonable shares of ASO costs should approach this amount.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Finally, Mr President, the intended sanction in the event of failure to pay the charge provided in the Bill is revocation of the permit to possess the relevant nuclear material. Revocation is possible if permit conditions are not complied with, and all relevant permits will require the payment of the charge from the date of commencement.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The critical importance of the matter is that the constitutionality of the bill is very much under question. I have already tabled in this place two opinions from learned counsel to the effect that the bill is unconstitutional. The Senate is therefore being asked to deal with a piece of prospective legislation, the constitutional validity of which is very much in doubt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday, the Senate&mdash;I might say very sensibly&mdash;resolved to send the issue as a whole to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs for inquiry and report, and it will report in a fortnight. But the committee does not have the power the Senate has to require the tabling of essential documents. It seems to us that, in order that the committee can properly complete its function, it should have before it not only the opinion the minister tabled yesterday but the preliminary opinion upon which the considered opinion of yesterday was based. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We understand that the government instructed the draftsmen to draft this bill in a way that would make it particularly difficult for the Senate to oppose the government's increases in tax and new taxes. It did that by asking the draftsmen to link with those taxes the so-called benefits in the bill&mdash;the benefits in relation to Medicare and the taxation reductions, although they are just half of the reductions the government promised at the last election. Nevertheless, to link together tax increases with other matters was to make it more difficult for this Senate to oppose those particular taxes. So the drafting instructions to that effect are of great interest to the Senate and, I would have thought, to the standing committee because it can get to the motive of the government in putting the bill in this most unusual&mdash;some have suggested to me unprecedented&mdash;form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As we understand it, the next step in that process was, not surprisingly, that the draftsmen were uncomfortable and wanted a legal opinion from within the government before they were prepared to draft in that way. We are told that that opinion was obtained. That is presumably the preliminary opinion referred to by Mr Rose in his considered opinion that we received yesterday, and I am sure that the Senate would be vitally interested to see exactly what Mr Rose said on that occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter is of major consequence. I think perhaps the Greens and the Australian Democrats are not totally cognisant of the consequences of this bill, if it becomes law, then failing before the High Court next year. The advice of counsel in the opinions I have put to the Senate is that the whole act would then collapse. The benefits of the changes under Medicare would disappear; the tax reductions that are included in the piece of legislation would disappear; the credit unions would be thrown into turmoil because they are now to be taxed under this bill and that taxation imposition would be lost; the increases in wholesale sales tax would disappear and there would be the incredibly complex legal issue as to what right there would be for recovery of tax; and the wine tax would go, with consequences as to whether the recovery of that sales tax could be made. Everyone in the community would be wondering whether they should have kept receipts for their taxes. The whole position would be one of turmoil. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At least the government, I would have thought, would recognise that it has a responsibility to prepare its legislation in a form where this is least likely to occur. It has not met that responsibility. In order to achieve its grubby political objective, it has put this bill in a form where it is very much in doubt constitutionally. This Senate, before it proceeds with the matter further, has the right to have on the table what legal advices the government got to justify that course of action and the drafting instructions so that we can see transparently exactly what the government's motive was and the risk to which it was prepared to put the economy of Australia to achieve its political agenda. That is all this motion seeks to do. That is why it is urgent; it has to be returned tomorrow. I urge the Senate to support the suspension and then the substantive motion. </PARA>

The government will fully facilitate the committee's consideration of this particular substantive issue. We have already tabled yesterday the very detailed 13-page opinion by the Chief General Counsel, Dennis Rose, explaining the constitutional foundations on which we relied throughout the drafting process and on which we rely now. </PARA>

There is no issue here about malfeasance, possible misbehaviour by public servants, or some other question of public interest possibly being involved such as might conceivably justify an exploratory examination of the process by which these bills came to light. I do not want to concede any ground in a particular case that might arise in the future but, obviously, different considerations arise about the production of documentation if that kind of public interest issue is involved. There is none of that kind here. </PARA>

I am a strong advocate of freedom of information, a strong advocate of transparency in government, a strong advocate of open processes. I was in opposition; I am in government. I put my money where my mouth was and I introduced major changes to the freedom of information legislation when I was Attorney-General. Those opposite do not have to argue with me about these principles. But there is a limit to the extent to which this kind of material can be constantly, routinely exposed. There are obvious and accepted limits so far as matters that are potentially the subject of court proceedings are concerned. There are well established limits so far as privacy of a personal kind is concerned, commercial confidentiality and impact on international relations. There are limits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There ought also to be limits so far as the government's preparation of legislation is concerned. The government must have the capacity to have frank exchanges with its legal advisers&mdash;Attorney-General's, the Chief General Counsel and the Solicitor-General. It must have the capacity to have exchanges of views, both orally and in writing, backwards and forwards, while legislation is being crafted and particular options are explored, in some cases being pursued and in other cases being ruled out. </PARA>

It is not something which contributes in any way to rational government process. That is a point that has been frankly acknowledged by those on the other side when they were in government; it ought to be frankly acknowledged now. There are limits.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is a critically important motion and it would be entirely regrettable if the Australian Democrats or any other party in the Senate did not appreciate the fundamental significance of what the government is maintaining. A very important concession by Senator Gareth Evans this morning is that the government deliberately set out to lump together a whole range of taxes and tax increases with the One Nation tax cuts. That is precisely what was in mind when the founding fathers put in the prohibitions about tacking and tried to ensure that each taxation measure was dealt with separately.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans's admission today is a very stark revelation of our concerns. All that we have been provided with to date is essentially one in-house, after-the-event opinion. One understands that we are in the game of politics. Therefore, it is very much in the government's interest to have someone come along and validate its actions. It is an entirely different matter to explore what it had in mind originally when it engaged in this tacking, or indeed tacky, exercise to try to frustrate the express terms of the constitution. That is why it is critically important that we have some outside, independent advice.

Those documents become very relevant indeed. We do not have an opinion from the Attorney-General at this stage and, unless and until we have that, the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs will not be in a position to make an intelligent judgment about the constitutionality of the bills.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is entirely regrettable that Senator Evans has had to resort to all the red herrings which he has.

After all, the matter to be decided is whether this bill is a bill imposing taxation or is not a bill imposing taxation.

I do accept, though, that there might be occasions when public policy considerations demand that drafting instructions and other confidential legal advice are not published at large.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That leads to the next point. Private member's bills that come to this parliament are also developed on the basis of drafting instructions. Members of parliament always assert the right for those drafting instructions to remain confidential to ensure that all those deliberations can be as broad based and as wide ranging as possible. For months before the election those opposite refused to show their legislation. Not only that, they also refused to show the drafting instructions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This Senate has been humiliated on a number of occasions&mdash;indeed, this parliament has&mdash;because we have not paid enough attention to the detail of the laws that we pass. I remind honourable senators of the recent High Court case involving the interpretation of certain capital gains provisions and what is known as 160 M6 and M7.

Today for the first time we heard from him some admission that all is not quite well in the state of Denmark. Quite obviously, I acknowledge that he was not party to this original scheme. That is not surprising, because it is well known in the community that the Treasurer does not get on well with his Treasury officers and advisers.

<PARA>This motion would require the government to table the legal opinions it received in relation to the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill, together with drafting instructions and other related matters. I canvassed the reasons for that, outlining the importance of the issue, in the debate we just had on the suspension of standing orders and I do not want to repeat what I said. I want to pick up the apparent motive that the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Gareth Evans) put to us, I think for the first time, as to why the government had linked the tax increases and tax impositions in this bill to the so-called attractive aspects. I do so by reminding the Senate of the constitutional provisions and the reasons that they exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 53 of the constitution contains one of the very few restraints that exist upon the Senate; it basically states that we are limited in relation to bills imposing taxation. We cannot amend bills imposing taxation. The balance to that was section 55 which provided that, if the Senate was going to accept that very limiting restraint, it could not be abused. Firstly, in the case of a bill imposing taxation, the government could not put before the Senate any other matter linked to the same bill. In other words, it could not tack on other matters. Secondly, it had to put before the Senate each bill imposing taxation separately. That was the balance. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not think my colleague Senator Watson likes my paraphrasing; I thought I had done a reasonable job. He wants me to quote specifically from section 55 of the constitution which states:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Laws imposing taxation shall deal only with the imposition of the taxation, and any provision therein dealing with any other matter shall be of no effect.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the first protection of the rights of the Senate. The second protection contained in section 55 is:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Laws imposing taxation, except laws imposing duties of customs or of excise, shall deal with one subject of taxation only. . .</PARA>
<PARA>So the two protections are in there for the benefit of the Senate because, under section 53 of the constitution, the Senate has conceded the power to amend bills imposing taxation. Normally there is no problem in that regard. The government brings to the Senate these bills imposing taxation separately. It does not attempt to tack on other matters. Under section 53 of the constitution, the Senate can then vote for or against the tax bill, and there is no difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But in this instance, as Senator Gareth Evans said to the Senate a few moments ago, the government deliberately sought to link the issues together because it wanted the Australian people, in his terms, to see the taxation package as just that&mdash;a package. The new taxes, the extended taxes, the benefits to Medicare and the reductions of tax were all to be linked together. That was the motive of the government, as Senator Gareth Evans just said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In doing so the government has obstructed our capacity to deal with those new impositions of taxes in a way that would appear, on the face of this matter, to be unconstitutional. The government is restricting our capacity by virtue of the restraints that are accepted in section 53 of the constitution, and it cannot do that. So far in this place we have put down two opinions. Further opinions will be put before the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs that will make clear that that is an abusive process. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has sought to abuse the process of the Senate in a way which restricts our capacity to deal with these impositions of taxation. It cannot get away with that. It should not get away with it because the Democrats and the Greens and, no doubt, Senator Harradine will in due course recognise it is an abusive process and will say to the government: `Do what is right. Take the bill back, redraft it in a form that is constitutional'. That is not difficult. The government simply has to take back the bill and split up these various tax bills, as was intended by the constitution. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am told that will probably require 11 separate bills as there are 11 separate impositions of tax contained within this one bill. But that is the government's obligation. The Senate can then address each of those taxes separately, as the constitution requires us to do. That is the error in the government's ways and we regret that it is not recognising the danger of putting an unconstitutional bill before the Senate. As it will not recognise that, it will not accept it; as it wants to push on with this, notwithstanding the constitutional risks, for its own political imperatives, it is important that the Senate ensures that it is in the best informed position for the forthcoming debate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We will be better informed if we have the drafting instructions which, I am quite confident, will make clear to the Senate and to the Australian people that this is an abusive process and that the draftsmen were seriously worried about what they were being told to do by the government to do for its political objectives. We will know that when we have those drafting instructions on the table. We will be particularly interested to see what the Solicitor-General said at that time, not what the Solicitor-General said in the opinion dated the 30th of this month which Senator Gareth Evans tabled yesterday. We want to know what advice was given to the government at that time in relation to the abusive process that it was seeking to bring into this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side of the chamber believe strongly that, in these circumstances, we have a right to see those documents. In normal everyday circumstances we do not. We do not seek the internal opinions of the government. We do not seek drafting instructions. But this matter is unprecedented. It is of critical importance to Australia because if this bill fails before the High Court the results will be calamitous to industry. There will be an enormous mess. That is why the Senate must demand that it is in the best informed position when the time comes to vote on these bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are in the best informed position, the government will have no alternative but to take the bill away, draft it correctly and bring back a series of bills imposing taxation, as it should have done in the first instance. That is why,  particularly at this last moment, I urge the Australian Democrats and the Greens, who have a very major responsibility in this regard, to join with us and make the government show us and the Australian people the full picture. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also spoke on the procedural motion addressing, no doubt improperly, some substantial issues at the same time. I do not want to repeat that particular ground, and I will keep my remarks as short as Senator Hill did.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me address several of the issues that have already arisen in the debate. I make the point yet again that the matter in issue here is the constitutionality of the product; that is, the actual bill that is now before the parliament. It simply does not help our understanding of the constitutionality of the bill as it is now before us by poking and fiddling away at the various process issues that were involved in producing that product. What matters is whether in the result we got it right or wrong when we proceeded as we did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have already said, we are very much prepared to help the committee with that by tabling the detailed opinion of Mr Rose, which sets out the basis on which we put this together, and we will cooperate further with witnesses in proper discussion across the table in the committee. I have no doubt that at the end of the day we will be able to persuade the Senate that there is no problem in all of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although we are unwilling, for the larger reasons of principle that I spelt out, to open up this whole Pandora's box of drafting instructions and other internal memos and things that have flown backwards and forwards in this, as in other drafting exercises, I say to the Senate quite frankly that, on the information that I have been given, there is absolutely nothing in terms of any documentation which may already exist which is inconsistent with the terms of the Rose opinion. In other words, the issues of legal principle that we are talking about here are pretty well understood in the Office of Parliamentary Counsel and in the Attorney-General's department. There is no great argument about the bottom line&mdash;about what can constitutionally be yoked to or linked with other things. I am told that there is no disagreement in any of this material with the bottom lines that are now formally set out in the Rose opinion that is already before you. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not in a position to verify the statement I have just made because we are not willing to provide the documentation. But, for what it is worth, I want to indicate that it is not a matter of the government having anything to hide or wanting to hide anything in this instance; it is a matter of being very firm about the precedent that there are matters that governments must be entitled to keep within house while policy is being developed and while appropriate legal strategies to implement policy are being developed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, there is no secret about the motive. It was for demonstration and presentation purposes to make clear that there was a connection between the amendments increasing tax rates and removing exemptions, rebates and deductions on the one hand, and amendments reducing tax liability on the other hand. The fiscally responsible approach that we adopted demanded that. We have absolutely nothing to hide in that respect. It is very clear. It is implicit, and I think explicit, in what has been said by a number of people. I have certainly been explicit about it today. So there is no great triumph to be gained from the committee process by extracting anything to confirm that because that is very clear. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question is: what are the consequences of our being wrong? This is something for the committee to ponder, but let me say a word or two about that. So far as the Senate is concerned, much has been made by the opposition about the dangers and democratic parliamentary problems associated with so-called tacking; that is, having multiple revenue measures run together. I say two things about that. First, if one adopted an absolutely strict and literal reading of the kind that Senator Hill seems to want of section 55 of the constitution, one really would have no subject matter dealing in any way with the imposition of taxation sitting alongside any other subject matter. We would have many more multiple packages of bills than has been the practice in the past. It has often been the case that a number of different revenue measures that have dealt in one way or another with the imposition of taxation have been put together. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only unique thing about this particular package is that we have a number of matters dealing with the imposition of taxation, increasing tax rates, removing exemptions and so on which are linked at the same time with some amendments reducing tax liability. That is probably unique, and that is why this issue has come to public attention in the way that it has. Please do not get carried away by the notion that in the past every single kind of taxing measure has been dealt with in its own piece of legislation, enabling a debate on the policy issues about that particular taxing measure. That has not been the case in the past, as all sorts of things have been linked together, and nor will it be the case in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, there is no inhibition that follows from this in terms of the actual powers of the Senate. Of course, there is a difference technically between a capacity to amend a bill, which we do not have if it is a bill imposing tax, and a capacity simply to make requests of the House of Representatives if it is a bill dealing with taxation. There is a technical distinction, but it is a distinction without a difference in practice, as we all know. The Senate can make just as much a nuisance of itself to the government of the day by making a request and insisting upon that request as it can by insisting upon an amendment. So for all practical purposes, however much we might huff and puff&mdash;and I think Senator Watson and Senator Hill ought to acknowledge that&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know. I am just being kind to Senator Hill's colleague by explaining what the issues are. At the end of the day what matters is not that; rather it is the status of the parent act as amended. As long as the parent act as amended by one clause of this particular amending bill is itself an act or a law dealing only with the imposition of taxation or only with one subject, then there is absolutely no problem.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, I do not acknowledge that. I think it is squarely an issue here, and Mr Rose has made that clear. Senator Harradine was contemplating an amendment&mdash;I do not know whether he will move it&mdash;in which he was seeking to draw a distinction between the policy issues, at least relating to taxation policy, that might be involved in this documentation which apparently he regards as possibly genuinely immune from scrutiny and other sorts of issues.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having thought about the matter, I do not honestly think that is a distinction that can be accepted in this particular context. What matters is the government's capacity not only to debate internally in a preparatory way the substantive policy issues that are involved, but also to debate with its legal advisers the technical issues that are concerned in this kind of legislation. I am sure the opposition, in its quieter and more constructive moments, contemplating the possibility of ever being back in government, would have the horrors at the prospect of every layer of internal debate backwards and forwards being exposed to possibly conceivably politically motivated scrutiny at the end of the day. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also spoke during the earlier debate on the motion to suspend standing orders and I do not propose to rehearse the substantial and substantive arguments that go to the legal question. This will be dealt with by the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, and quite properly so. We believe that the issues involved are weighty. It is now on the table that the government did try to make it more difficult for this house to amend this legislation. Senator Evans is shaking his head, but I believe that is quite clear. The question is whether, in the attempt to do so, the government has acted in contravention of the important constitutional provisions on this issue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear that this legislation, to the extent that it does impose taxation, shall deal with one subject only. I hope that the government will save a lot of this chamber's time and allow the process to proceed expeditiously by taking the proper action and splitting the bill. That is what the government should do. It is quite clear that the government itself is now considering amendments to the legislation. It will be a lot easier for all parties concerned if that process can be undertaken properly and without time-wasting arguments about whether the government did or did not act with constitutional propriety. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, the Australian Democrats do not propose to support the motion as it stands. It seems to us that paragraph (b), the one that asks the government to provide drafting instructions, is the offending one. Tabling the drafting instructions is not going to add very much to the substance of the debate either in this chamber or in the committee. It will add to the government's embarrassment, but I wonder whether this chamber should buy that embarrassment of the government at the expense of several hours of time-wasting debate. The Australian Democrats, therefore, believe that paragraph (b), which refers to the drafting instructions, should be excised from Senator Hill's motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On behalf of the Australian Democrats I call on the government to accede to the motion after it is amended. If paragraph (b) is removed, the material that remains and which the government will have to table is the opinions provided by the Solicitor-General, the Attorney-General's Department or the Office of Parliamentary Counsel concerning the drafting and validity of the taxation bill and the question relating to whether the kinds of provisions contained in the taxation bill, if enacted, may lawfully be combined in a single bill. I believe that the government is obliged to provide that information to the chamber and to the committee. If the Senate votes in favour of the amendment, the Australian Democrats will then vote in favour of the amended motion of Senator Hill's calling on the government to table those documents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our concerns were primarily with the drafting instructions and the precedent which that would set for future instances. Indeed, the minister has advised us that this is his prime concern; that his concern is not so much with what is contained in these materials apart from the drafting instructions. I venture to say that this is really not a great issue, apart from the embarrassment to the government, because the motivation of the government is very clearly on the table for all to see. So we would be wasting the Senate's time and the committee's time to press for this issue, which seems to give the government so much heartache. However, I cannot see how the government can legitimately refuse to table the opinions it has received on the validity and the drafting of this legislation. I move:</PARA>

That is an issue crucial to the running of any democratic society. I believe that we need to be as fully informed as possible so as to come to a conclusion as to the validity of this measure that has been presented to the House of Representatives, namely, the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993 because ultimately that in one form or another will come to this chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Evans, says in his speech that really there is not much difference&mdash;that whilst under the constitution we cannot amend a tax bill, we can make requests to the House of Representatives. He maintains that there is not much difference because the Senate can make life very difficult for the government if it chooses to dig its toes in. But the essential difference is this&mdash;and the minister knows it, of course: where we have a bill which has certain taxation benefits and which also imposes certain taxation burdens, and where we lump those into one measure, it then becomes extremely difficult for members of parliament to analyse those measures on their merits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not necessarily talking about only the taxation burdens. Some people&mdash;and I have heard the Democrats talk about this publicly&mdash;may wish to reject certain of the income tax benefit measures that are in this legislation. So it is important for the review role of this chamber to have all of the information possible available to us in respect of this legal question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have had distributed an amendment which qualifies paragraph (b)&mdash;I would like Senator Spindler and Senator Chamarette to follow this part of the debate. I had this amendment drafted when I thought paragraph (b) was going to be part of this motion. I have listened carefully to what Senator Spindler says and, understanding the circumstances surrounding this chamber, I am inclined to support it. But in so doing, I do not suggest that that should be taken as a precedent. There will be the need on some occasion in respect of some bill for a return to order for the Office of Parliamentary Counsel to provide to the Senate for tabling documents relating to drafting instructions. That is very important in some areas&mdash;to enable us to get a better hold on the meanings behind legislation. </PARA>

My draft amendment, which has been circulated, is predicated on the basis that (b) may still be in the motion. If Senator Spindler's amendment is supported then (b) will not be in the motion and there will be no need for my amendment. </PARA>

The practical inefficacy of torture is not, I suppose, the most weighty objection to that mode of examination, nor probably would the purpose of the mere disclosure of truth have been otherwise than advanced by a refusal on the part of the Lord Chancellor in 1815 to act against the solicitor, who, in the cause between Lord Cholmondeley and Lord Clinton&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In this debate I wish to address firstly some remarks made by Senator Gareth Evans and then some remarks made by my good friend Senator Cooney. Senator Evans gave one of his rarer calm performances in this place. I do not know whether he is overtired or simply wishes to address this matter calmly. Nonetheless, I suppose we were grateful for that.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans told the chamber that the information we are seeking and that we want to have provided will not help us. He says, `Trust me, I've seen all this material and you don't need it. You, the parliament, do not need it'. It does not surprise me that that kind of view would be put forward by a minister from this government. This is the executive that believes that question time is a grace and favour donation from it to parliament. Members of the executive do not seem to have ever read a book that would tell them that parliament's job is to keep a check on the executive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There seems to be a complete blank in the minds of members of this executive. Of course, this is not the case with all the members of the backbench on the Labor side. But at least there has been a continual pattern on the part of members of this government of refusing to accept that parliament, whether it is this chamber or the House of Representatives, should have any real role in scrutinising the executive. They have put forward the view that parliament can see what the executive wants it to see and nothing else; in which case you, Mr Deputy President, I and everybody else in this place are wasting people's money. The school children in the gallery may as well go back to school if parliament does not properly have the job of keeping a check on the executive. The executive has to be forthcoming. It has to enable parliament to do its job by giving it the information that it needs. That is the debate we are having today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This chamber is asking for some information. We will see whether the Greens and the Independent are prepared to join with us and agree with us that parliament, in order to do its job properly in this respect, does need this extra information. It is cold comfort to hear a member of the executive say, `Trust me, you don't need it'. Why would we bother with parliament if we just let executives say to everybody, `No worries, we're spending your money properly. You can go home, Senator Spindler. We can all go home'? This whole place could be set some other task if we wanted to trust the executive. Of course, the March election showed us that this is an executive we cannot trust. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an executive that no-one up in the gallery can trust; an executive that, through its party mechanism, went to the people and said that it was not going to increase tax; an executive that said a whole variety of things about my party's policies, and within days of being elected was planning to go back on promise after promise. So, if anything, the daily headlines in the newspapers, the daily discussions on talkback radio, the articles we read about budgets mark 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5&mdash;I do not know whether we are up to 6 yet, or whether we will even get a budget; perhaps we should all go away and come back in December and the government can have another go&mdash;all the negotiations towards that budget, show us that this is not a government we can trust. It has tried to cobble together some changes from what it promised during the election campaign, and it is having trouble putting a package of those changes together. That is my first point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all very well for Senator Gareth Evans, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, the leader of the executive in the Senate, to come in here and say, `Trust me, you don't need it'. He is wrong to say that, on two counts. Firstly, it is up to us to decide what we need from the executive. It is up to members of the backbench to decide; they are part of parliament. So it is not his decision. Secondly, even if it were his decision and he said `Trust me', while he is a member of this executive which behaves in the fashion that it does&mdash;totally untrustworthy&mdash;I would not trust them. So I strike his remarks out on both of those grounds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague Senator Cooney is the chairman of the committee that will be dealing with this matter. I am deputy chairman of that committee and I say that we need this material. I note that Senator Cooney in his remarks, as best I understood them, was not prepared to say that the committee would not benefit from this material. He was not prepared to make that assumption, which does him credit. </PARA>
<PARA>But what he did say I have some disagreement with. He dragged out the old retrospectivity thing, which sends people rushing into corners saying, `We cannot do this; it is retrospective.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This parliament passes retrospective legislation week after week, regularly, but no-one complains because it is retrospectively in favour of someone, so we do not worry. There is other retrospective legislation that we do not worry about for other reasons&mdash;for example, it might be in the national interest. Senator Cooney will well remember a recent case involving some Chinese guns that someone had imported. The executive said, `Oops, there is a mistake in this legislation'. It was passed 20 years ago, and this person who was importing the guns had imported them within the law. Normally we would say, `Retrospective legislation is a bad thing; this poor guy has followed the law and he will have a dramatic loss if we do not allow him to import these guns.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is the reason we do not like retrospective legislation. One should be able to do things according to what one thinks the law is. Senator Cooney is now saying, `You should be able to get advice and rely on it being confidential because that is what you agreed on at the time. You should not have to go back retrospectively and change it'. As he knows, this parliament went back and changed the law in that case because it was decided that it was in the national interest that these guns should not be imported and distributed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Retrospectivity in itself is not something we never want; we might want it if it is in someone's favour; we might want it if it is in the national interest; and we certainly might want it if it is in the parliament's interest. In that respect, Senator Cooney and some other colleagues here might remember a pretty famous case when some person popped the question to the ABC at an estimates committee: `What is Geraldine Doogue's salary?'. What was the response from the ABC, which is funded by the taxpayer and therefore the taxpayer is entitled to know what the ABC does with its money? The ABC said, `We cannot tell you Geraldine Doogue's salary; the world will fall apart'. And what was the reason? Commercial-in-confidence. The ABC said, `We cannot go back on that now. You cannot make us go back and say to the people we did this deal with over Geraldine Doogue's salary that we are going to expose it publicly'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fallacy of the argument raised by the ABC was that every Tom, Dick and Harry, every government department that wanted to, could buy pencils with a contract of commercial-in-confidence, the defence forces could buy whatever they damned well liked and put `commercial-in-confidence' on it. What did we say? Do not be ridiculous. The overriding principle is that parliament has an interest in this matter and that overrides any past deal one might have made. Why do we say that? Because if parliament does not exert its right to review what the executive wants to do, we may as well all go home. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The executive will always kick and scream and wail and say that the world will fall down if it gives over some information to the parliament of the people. It will always try to protect itself, and every time it tries to protect itself in that way by saying that it is in confidence or it is retrospective&mdash;it will always drag up some reason&mdash;parliament has a job to say, `We do not care whether it is retrospective and we do not care whether it is in confidence. The overriding principle is that the parliament, this chamber and the other, is entitled to ask for what it wants from the executive'. There are some exceptions to that, but this is not one of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are at a dramatic stage in Australia's political history. We have had a dramatic winding down of the economy under this government, but we are now in a situation where we have a government that many would say was elected on false pretences. It now wants to impose a range of taxes that a lot of Australians do not want, that a lot of Australians thought they were voting against. A lot of Australians voted for people down in the other chamber&mdash;properly called the lower house&mdash;thinking that their member was going to protect them from tax increases. Having been duped, they are at least entitled to see that both of these houses, and in particular this one, do their jobs in reviewing the executive. We cannot do that job unless the information is provided, and no amount of wailing, kicking and screaming and pretence of confidentiality and convention should stop anybody in this chamber supporting this chamber's right to get all the information at hand and judge for ourselves whether this information is helpful to us or not. That is what we should be doing today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last but not least, I come back to what Senator Gareth Evans said. This was his `Trust me, trust me' line: `I'm from the government that said we weren't going to put up taxes and now we want to'. I did not hear enunciated in his argument how the country was going to fall apart if this information was provided. There was no argument as to what the risk was to the nation or to the parliament. I understand quite clearly what the risk is to the executive: it might get caught out. Its lack of credibility will be shown bare faced to the world. So it has something to hide. What he should have done&mdash;and perhaps some other speaker would like to&mdash;was not just to tell us, `Trust me, trust me; we do not need this information', but to tell us what is the harm in letting parliament do its job. How will the country fall apart if those of us who are paid to do a job actually do it?</PARA>

It is natural that the government has concerns regarding these two points of retrospectivity and precedent, and I think those concerns are valid and legitimate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also think it is natural that the government has a concern that the use of this particular request may be for political point scoring. It would be a great shame if this debate fell into using the information gained or the desire to have that information before the parliament as a way of political point scoring. However, I do not think it will be used in that way. I do not believe that is a legitimate or valid use of either the information that is gained or the request. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the higher principle of openness to scrutiny and the opportunity to facilitate consideration of the matters that are being referred to a committee come in at this point. Several concessions have been made to the concerns that have been expressed by the government regarding its unwillingness to present all the papers. I believe Senator Spindler's amendment is a very sensible move towards that, as was Senator Harradine's amendment, but I understand Senator Harradine has withdrawn his and therefore I support the amendment put forward by Senator Spindler. In the light of the fact that there have been these concessions made to the government's concerns, I think the principle that this is operating under openness to scrutiny, a willingness to facilitate the matters that will be raised in the committee considering the constitutionality of the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993, is the one we should be looking at at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this does not set a precedent.

I urge the government to cooperate with the request as a way of demonstrating its cooperation with the reference to the committee so that the matter can be dealt with expeditiously and fairly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Evans has today been very comprehensively exposed by the Australian Democrats and they really ought to be commended for appreciating the double standard that the government would otherwise seek to impose on this chamber. If the government were consistent, it would not have provided Dennis Rose's opinion at all. It would simply have said, `We take the view that you can test it in due course. You can go off to the High Court if you want to; you can explore it through the Senate committee. Do your best because as far as we are concerned we are above all that'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead, it very selectively provided an opinion which is hedged with qualifications and which does not bear a proper date in order to be able to determine when these opinions were formed&mdash;and it is critical to know whether they were before or after the event. What we are left with is transparently a damage control exercise.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, we did not accept his view then. What we have seen is the government forced to respond because otherwise an overwhelmingly one-sided case would be presented and, very selectively, the government trots out an opinion which is heavily qualified. But once it does that, it really does not have a leg to stand on in explaining why it is that it then does not go further and provide other opinions from the Solicitor-General, the Attorney-General's Department or, indeed, other and earlier opinions of the Chief General Counsel. That is what I think Senator Spindler is getting at&mdash;that it is proper and appropriate for the parliament to be able to take account of all of the formal opinions that have been tendered on this very important matter.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst we still maintain that drafting instructions are highly relevant, I must say of the extraordinary concession and admission made today by Senator Evans that I hesitate to say that he knows not what he has done. If ever there was an admission that the government's very intention was to do what the constitution patently says should not be done&mdash;that is, to lump together a series of taxation bills so that it is very hard to unravel them, to pick out the goodies and leave the nasties&mdash;we have had this damning admission today from Senator Evans that that is precisely what the government had in mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Evans said that the government had brought them together for policy purposes&mdash;meaning political purposes&mdash;to demonstrate their interconnectedness. That is precisely what tacking is all about. This is clearly a very tacky exercise on the part of the government. In those circumstances, I think we probably would not learn much more from the drafting instructions because we have had them tabled orally in the Senate today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Against that background, I think we would simply say that the position adopted by the Democrats is one that is satisfactory in all the circumstances. It will enable a lot more light to be thrown on not only the true motivation but also the real constitutional legality of these very important measures. We will be supporting the Democrats accordingly. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The issue being debated is really the constitutional legality of the budget package as presented by this Labor government. I rise with some diffidence in arguing with Senator Gareth Evans on the constitutional issues of the government's handling of its budget and associated bills because I have had a long association with him in this place on such matters and he is somewhat of an authority.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I have some feeling of the predicament he now finds himself in. Like Mr Crean and Mr Willis, Senator Evans was obviously not present when the strategy of the lumping together of the various benefit and taxing bills was decided upon. In that circumstance, he now finds he has to defend the indefensible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government obtained an opinion from Dennis Rose but, as my colleague Senator Alston says, that opinion is filled with qualifications. Throughout we see, `I shall assume for present purposes' and again at paragraph 24, `I shall assume that the approach in Air Caledonie'. The issue I wish to draw to the attention of the Senate is that very often when the Tax Office finds itself in a difficult predicament in relation to a legislative interpretation or a decision handed down by the court, it comes back and says, `The circumstances are not identical to those of most other taxpayers' and for that reason the Tax Commissioner will not necessarily accept the precedent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the citation of the Air Caledonie International case of the High Court, I remind the Senate that it was essentially about the collection of a fee by an airline operating in-flight. That was concerned with so-called section 34A of the Migration Act 1958 which purported to exact, so far as it related to passengers who were Australian citizens, a tax. That section was a law imposing taxation under section 55 of the constitution. The point at issue was essentially a Migration Act matter in relation to the application of a regulation so far as section 34A of that act was concerned. In coming back to the relevance and the qualifications of the advice of the Chief General Counsel, I would like to quote paragraph 22 of it. Mr Rose says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(The result is, with respect, somewhat curious since it is contrary to the wording of the first paragraph of section 55 which requires that, if an Act contains such a combination, it is the provisions <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">other</EMPHASIS> than those "imposing" or "dealing with the imposition of" taxation that "shall be of no effect".</PARA>
<PARA>It goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision also seems curious in view of the fact that the acknowledged purpose of section 55 is to protect the Senate . . .</PARA>
<PARA>Again, when talking about other relevant cases, such as the Australian Tape Manufacturers case, he talks about the `possible alternative approach'. So throughout, this opinion is subject to qualification and assumption and I would like to submit to the Senate that, as such, Mr Rose was given the very difficult job of protecting the government from the embarrassing predicament that it has got into. I think a very careful reading of that opinion will testify to that effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, I think it is necessary that we get the underlying documents&mdash;the instructions that were given to the drafting officers and requested by my colleague Senator Hill&mdash;to enable this committee to have the fullest possible information available to make sure, as I said earlier, that the legislation prima facie is constitutionally valid before we proceed to consider it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak briefly to this motion. When we started this debate, there were no amendments circulating. We have now had two amendments circulated and one withdrawn, and we have Senator Spindler's amendment which is to delete paragraph (b) of Senator Hill's motion. The argument put by Senator Spindler and supported by Senator Chamarette&mdash;and, now, by the opposition&mdash;is that this should remove the government's biggest concern about the confidentiality of drafting, in which area the government has every right to maintain its confidentiality.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I make relates to paragraph (a), which reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . any opinions provided by the Solicitor-General, the Attorney-General's Department or the Office of Parliamentary Counsel concerning either:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">(i) the drafting and validity of the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993; or</PARA>

<PARA>My view on that&mdash;and I think it is a very reasonable proposition to put&mdash;is that if the Solicitor-General, the  Attorney-General's Department and the Office of Parliamentary Counsel are doing their job properly, as one would want good public servants to do, one would expect them to provide a range of advice and options. That is what good public policy should be about, what good public servants and a public service is about. If they believe that in future they may have that advice retrospectively tabled in parliament, they will therefore feel constrained about the advice they provide as good officers of the Public Service. One would require them to provide that advice. Ministers will be very cautious about what they ask their public servants to provide to them. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It may turn out that information which the public servants thought was confidential could be tabled in parliament. This is germane to the development of public policy. Those opposite are establishing a precedent and issuing a warning to public servants. That warning is, `Be careful what you say to your minister, the advice you give in confidence, because it could be tabled in parliament. If the parliament does not like that advice or queries it, you can be brought before the bar of the Senate and questioned about it'. That is a possibility.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we started this debate after the suspension of standing orders, either the motion would have been carried in its entirety or it would have been defeated. I think the Democrats, the Greens and Senator Harradine quickly floated amendments in an attempt to see whether a compromise was possible between the government and the opposition. I suppose if one is the third, fourth and fifth force in the Senate as a minority party, one's role may be to see whether such a compromise or consensus is possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the fundamental issue is still there before us. The issue is how are we to conduct decent public policy as ministers and as a government when we want communications between ministers and public servants to be ridgy-didge about the range of information available. How can we do that when we  know full well there now is a precedent by which public servants can end up before the bar of the Senate or before a committee and be subject to severe penalties?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know people believe that the Solicitor-General has a particular role and that that advice should be generally available. But when we refer to the Attorney-General's Department, we are talking about a department which is administered by a minister. That minister takes responsibility for that department and for the good, the bad and the ugly that department puts up. I think that those opposite are putting pressure on public servants about the way in which they carry out their functions and duties as public servants who are responsible to a minister. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point is that they may not have done so. But the precedent that is being established by those opposite is a warning to a public servant at any level in the Attorney-General's Department that if one puts a note at the side of a document, it can now be tabled in the parliament as the result of some opinion. A public servant sees as part of his or her public function within the Public Service Act the provision of advice. I think that we as ministers want public servants to provide us with a range of advice and the arguments for and against.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When talking about parliamentary responsibility, let us remember that, in this chamber and the lower house, the person who has to take the heat is the minister. That is what one gets elected to do, and that is what elections every three years are about. In the end, the minister must stand and be judged according to his or her comments and arguments. In the end, it will be the public who will decide whether they agree with the minister by electing him or not at the next election. That is the fundamental issue of sovereignty of the parliament. Ministers have to take responsibility for what is given to them, how they portray it and how they use it in the public policy debate. I think that has been lost sight of in this motion. I think that is a warning the parliament ought to be aware of. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can think of other examples. For example, let us envisage that at some stage in the future the government had an absolute majority in the Senate. Let us assume that an individual senator went and sought advice from the Clerk of the Senate about amendments he or she may choose to move in the chamber itself. What would happen if a government used its numbers, whoever the government may be, to have that confidential information from the clerk to that individual senator tabled for debate in the Senate? I think that would be an outrage. But it is advice that a member of parliament, a member of the Senate, is using in this forum as part of argument. That is the area which those opposite are opening up to precedent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That may be an exaggerated example, but I would ask those opposite to be very careful about affecting the confidential relationship between any senator and the advice that they get. I favour the senator, whether they be a minister or a backbencher, standing and arguing his or her case and being judged accordingly in this chamber. The public will make up its mind. I think that if we seek to put pressure on public servants, we will affect the level of advice. I have no doubt that if this becomes a trend in the future, ministers and senior public servants will make sure that they do not have advice in writing but get it verbally. That may well affect good government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So although the minor parties here have tried to put an amendment as a compromise, I still think it does not address the fundamental issue about the confidentiality of policy making and the right of public servants to provide open and decent information to their minister, without their fearing that at a later stage it will be tabled in this place. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this Bill and the associated Bill is to impose a charge on commercial uranium producers in Australia to recover some of the costs of the Australian Safeguards Office (ASO) in undertaking nuclear safeguards and physical protection activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's decision to consider cost recovery for these activities was included in the 1992-93 Budget papers.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this cost recovery proposal rests on two fundamental principles. First, those who derive benefit from an activity should pay for it, so long as the amount recovered is reasonable having regard to the nature and costs of the activity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Second, those who pay should have a genuine opportunity to examine and be consulted on the necessity, quality and cost of the activities they are paying for. This is required not only on equity grounds, but also because it imposes a discipline (in addition to that of normal parliamentary scrutiny) on the provider of the activities&mdash;in this case the ASO&mdash;to deliver them as effectively and efficiently as possible.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ASO cost recovery arrangements to which the Bills would give effect, will be fully consistent with these principles. In particular, the Government accepts that a substantial proportion of the activities of the ASO provides benefits to Government and to the Australian community generally. The costs of ASO activities not specifically directed at or relevant to industry will continue to be met by the Government, which will remain the largest contributor to ASO resources.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Other countries charge their industries for nuclear safeguards and related activities, including the United States, Canada and Sweden.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Moreover, cost recovery for undertaking regulatory and other activities, based on the same general principles I have outlined, applies quite widely across Australian industry. In the Primary Industries and Energy portfolio, Mr President, it currently applies to activities undertaken by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service and the Australian Fisheries Management Authority, as well as to many of the projects of the  Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics, the Australian Geological Survey Organisation and the Bureau of Resource Sciences. Activities of  the National Residue Survey and the registration of agricultural and veterinary chemicals are also subject to cost recovery arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Before commenting on this particular Bill I will say a little about the ASO and its activities. Established by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation (Safeguards) Act 1987, the Director of Safeguards and the ASO manage domestic and international nuclear safeguards and physical protection programs in accordance with our stringent nuclear safeguards policies and requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">ASO has a key role in ensuring that uranium produced in and exported from Australia is used only for peaceful purposes and is not diverted into non-peaceful programs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In short, a significant proportion of ASO's program exists, and the associated costs are incurred, because of the need to safeguard our uranium industry. These are the costs the Government has decided to recover. I shall return to this point when commenting on the associated Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This first Bill provides in its substantive clause (Clause 3) for a charge to be imposed on the companies which produce and export uranium in commercial quantities. Both Bills commence on 1 November 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In recognition that it is reasonable for a producer to have generated a cash flow before being liable for the charge, we have provided that no charge is payable until some uranium has been exported from the relevant processing facility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the uranium industry has been going through a difficult period in recent years. Prices have been low and, at the Ranger plant in the Northern Territory, production has fallen and some workers have been retrenched. Happily, prices have increased quite significantly in the last few months. Although the industry is by no means fully recovered at this stage, I am pleased to note recent comments by senior officials of Ranger's parent company, Energy Resources of Australia, that the market has strengthened recently, utilities are showing an interest in talking about future demand, and ERA has a number of new contracts under negotiation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I also note that Western Mining Corporation intends to increase uranium production from its Olympic Dam mine at Roxby Downs in South Australia as part of a mine production expansion program in the near future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our decision to charge the companies for nuclear safeguards has not been made without regard to industry conditions. We estimate that the two current uranium producers, both of which have remained profitable despite the industry problems, will each pay only about $340,000 annually at the present level of ASO activity, representing about 20 cents per kilogram of uranium produced. This is less than one half of one percent of the present value of uranium production.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All in all, the Government believes these cost recovery measures&mdash;fully justifiable in terms of the principles I have  outlined&mdash;are not unreasonable as regards the impact on the uranium industry. Furthermore, the arrangements for determining the annual charge payable by the companies, which I shall describe shortly in discussing the associated Bill, will give them a genuine opportunity to influence through consultation the actual amount they would pay each year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to honourable senators and present the explanatory memorandum for it and the associated Bill.</PARA>

<PARA>I wish to explain the reasons why I put this motion before the Senate. I point out to the Senate that this referral to a committee is simply and purely for accountability purposes. I am not looking at a wholesale inquiry into how much this parliament or this government should spend on ATSIC. At this stage I am not interested in whether they are spending too much or too little. I simply want accountability to make sure that the $1.3 billion or thereabouts that is spent gets to exactly where it does the best on the ground; that is, for the welfare of Aborigines. I stress to everyone&mdash;Senator Coates, the chairman of the committee, Senator Harradine, the Greens and the Democrats&mdash;that I am interested in accountability and nothing else. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This first came to my mind some time back. I have been asking questions at estimates about the actions and accountability of ATSIC for about five years and I am afraid that I have not been getting any answers. For the third year in a row, the Auditor-General&mdash;in volume 3 of Audit report No. 1, relating to the 1993-94 budget&mdash;raised significant concerns over non-compliance by ATSIC with the basic standards of accountability demanded of all other government departments and instrumentalities. The Auditor-General said that the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission's annual report was tabled in parliament on 5 May 1993&mdash;that is, the 1991-92 financial statement. The report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The audits . . . were qualified because of inadequate control over Community Development Employment Projects' participant schedules and resulting payments of $207m during the year.</PARA>
<PARA>On the community development employment projects, the Auditor-General said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Consistent with the audit reports on the financial statements of the Commission for the periods ended 30 June 1990 and 30 June 1991, the audit for the period ended 30 June 1992 again&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I stress, again&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">disclosed inadequate control over CDEP participant schedules and resulting payments. In particular, the audit revealed numerous instances where communities had not forwarded participant schedules to the Commission, lack of evidence of checking of participant schedules and numerous instances where payments were not based on participant schedules.</PARA>
<PARA>That is what the Auditor-General said. He had a lot more to say which I cannot go through in the short time that I have at my disposal at present. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In his latest report, on which the ink is hardly dry, the Auditor-General identifies a need for ATSIC to write off at least $4 million in loans to trading bodies because the outstanding money cannot be recovered; significant control breakdowns in the management of salary payments; and serious problems with community development projects, including lack of evidence of checking of participation schedules. I could go on and on about what the Auditor-General said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the very latest of the Auditor-General's concerns&mdash;for three years he has been reporting to this parliament his concerns about the use of public funds. But other very serious concerns have been raised by Aboriginal communities that support the thrust of my motion. When I first gave notice of this motion, I did so on the basis of the Auditor-General's report. Since then, my office staff and I have been approached, and I have read newspaper articles about people and organisations within ATSIC that want this inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These matters should be referred to a Senate standing committee for examination now. It is no good being told by the government, the minister and others to go back to estimates committees. It has been running that line for five years and&mdash;</PARA>

I did not get around to speaking to her on the phone&mdash;I probably would not be able to get hold of her&mdash;but she has made her feelings public. I agree with her 100 per cent in light of the fact that what she said lines up exactly with the concerns that have been expressed about ATSIC by the Auditor-General.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must also say that we in this chamber cannot expect the government to take any action whatsoever to help create the greater level of accountability for public funds by ATSIC that the Auditor-General would like to see. I would like to point out that, having reported his concerns to the parliament, the Auditor-General has done everything expected of him. It is now up to this parliament to take note of his comments on ATSIC's use of public money and to act accordingly. For three years, ATSIC found plenty of ways out of being held accountable because of the particular form of words in the act. Amendments to the ATSIC act, as proposed by the government, are a totally inadequate response to the concern raised by the Auditor-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some time back I asked various questions on notice regarding the report of the Auditor-General. Unfortunately, the reply from the minister and ATSIC was inadequate. My questions sought from the minister details of how much money was involved in ATSIC's decision not to recover funds, even though it was authorised to do so when grant conditions were not met. ATSIC's answer was that it did not keep consolidated records of all breaches. The commission then sought to trivialise the matter by referring to late progress reports. My time is somewhat limited today, so I will not go through this point by point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People have written to me or have rung my office to support me in this situation. Don McLeod has probably done more than anyone else since the 1950s to organise better conditions for Aborigines on stations and in other places in Western Australia.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You are quite right in criticising the ATSIC and the way they handle their funds.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been urged by journalists in Perth to do something. Senator Collins rolls his eyes when I say that. I remind him that some journalists are authentic. They try to make sure that there is accountability in the use of public money. I do not write off everything they say; I do take notice of some of them. These journalists have investigated and published details of doubtful projects undertaken in the name of Aborigines. One case reported by channel 10 in Perth showed that, of the more than $1 million that was allocated to building something like four prefabricated houses, half was siphoned off to so-called consultants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These so-called consultants would not have been Aborigines. They would have been part of that white industry that exists simply to siphon money off Aborigines so that it does not get to the right place. I am urged by a journalist from a state other than Western Australia to push for a full inquiry into ATSIC. The journalist detailed instances of ATSIC employees ensuring that when contracts are let they go exclusively to friends. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think these ATSIC employees were black people; they would have been white people. So these contracts went exclusively to friends within ATSIC. This journalist used the word `corruption' to describe the nature of the kind of offence which is now being investigated with the view to an expose being published. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I received on Friday information that one ATSIC officer paid more than $1,000 out of ATSIC funds for artworks. There was no receipt to account for the sum drawn to pay for the artwork purchased. The Auditor-General has tracked and reported on this kind of basic breach of accountability. It is not Aborigines who are committing the offences; it is people from the white industry that is built around the Aborigines to siphon money off. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also urged by a correspondent to specifically investigate the waste of ALS, the Aboriginal Legal Service, money. I have a letter which indicates that there was a waste of funds on a barrister who was in court for six hours a day for four days to represent a client whose case is yet to be heard. The cost of a barrister for four days of non-productive time is a waste. I will leave it to someone in the legal fraternity to cost out what that fee would be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have a letter to back that up. I would seek leave to incorporate this letter in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, but I will not because I do not want to disclose the name of a woman who was bashed in Queanbeyan. She took action against her husband. She won the action and then the husband appealed. That is why that QC is sitting around for six hours a day for four days. That is a total of 24 hours and that is then multiplied by whatever a QC charges. If it were not for the fact that I would be disclosing the name of the woman, I would ask to have that letter tabled. I raised my deepest concerns and those of the Auditor-General about the operation and accountability of ATSIC in the Senate on 26 May 1993 before I moved this motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 17 May 1993, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> claimed that caretakers on Pilbara pastoral leases confirmed that they were not manned by any of the Aborigines drawing CDEP moneys for community development, infrastructure and health. It mentioned the release of $1.7 million for 1991-92, and yet these people had not been in possession of the place. State Electricity Commission employees go out to maintain the power plant on an abandoned station, even though that power plant has not been run to produce lights for Aborigines for two years. Someone is siphoning off money; again, it is not the Aborigines who are doing that&mdash;the white community is hauling money out of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ATSIC act says that the commission may require payment of money not accounted for, but this wording leaves a huge discretionary power for non-accountable decisions involving grant money drawn directly from taxpayer funds. ATSIC admitted in an article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> on 18 May that it was finally and belatedly cutting off funds to the Strelley pastoral group and, of course, the Strelley group is tied up with Don McLeod, who I have mentioned. I have been criticising him for five years, but he has sent me a letter of support. How much more evidence does the Senate want that we need an inquiry into the accountability of ATSIC?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A newspaper article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> on 27 May points out that it is the Auditor-General's view that ATSIC may well be funding projects that are more properly the responsibility of other levels of government. An inquiry into the guidelines could stop this unnecessary duplication. An ATSIC officer was sacked for offering $100,000 to an unnamed Aboriginal organisation&mdash;this is an example of the lack of administrative control and accountability. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Quoting recent National Health and Medical Research Council statistics that show Aboriginal death rates four to five times higher than the national average and maternal death rates three to five times higher, Ms O'Shane said it was time ATSIC and the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs, Mr Tickner, were called to account.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. At the ACTU congress yesterday the Prime Minister told that dedicated band of true believers to keep the faith. Can the minister explain how Mr Keating could possibly ask those in the Labor movement, or anyone else in Australia for that matter, to keep the faith when Treasury's PRISMOD analysis shows that, as a result of the latest Kernot-Dawkins proposals, the groups worse off, on average, would be some sole parents, pensioners and low income couples, while the lion's share of the benefits will go to households with incomes in the top 20 per cent?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The PRISMOD analysis shows, in my understanding of it, that the overwhelming result of the budget package as it has now emerged is to leave the vast majority of Australian households, on average, considerably better off. In terms of the impact on particular households, the change in average real household disposable income ranges between a decrease of 0.05 per cent up to an increase of 1.6 per cent for the lowest quintile of unemployment benefit and sickness benefit households. That is the distribution we are talking about. The decrease, to the extent that it is there, for some households, for some income categories, is 0.05 per cent. The increases, by contrast, are very much larger.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation more generally is that 90 per cent of full time wage and salary earner household types are better off. The average outcomes here range between a small loss of less than 0.2 per cent of household real disposable income to gains of over one per cent in real household disposable income. While the actual dollar gains and losses for individual households within each cell will vary, the averages again range between a loss of under 65c a week to a gain of around $20 a week. That is the balance, the distribution, of the impact of this budget. There are particular distributional cells within the total picture that, at the extreme margin, are slightly worse off, but the orders of magnitude here are measurable in cents rather than dollars and they certainly do not lead, as I understand it, to the conclusion that Senator Alston seeks to draw.</PARA>

If these proposals are so good, why were they not included in the budget in the first place; what possible justification is there for pretending in that seriously flawed PRISMOD analysis that all Australians use unleaded petrol; and is it not a fact that even this totally recast budget is still a viciously regressive document?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The point of this particular budget, as has been made clear over and over again by Treasurer Dawkins, is that the overall benefits that we must deliver to the Australian community are sustained economic growth in a low inflation, low interest rate environment plus, of course, a continuing environment of micro-economic reform and industry reform and a continuing environment of assistance to exporters. It is by doing that that we will generate the job growth in this country that will redound to the benefit of the overwhelming majority of Australians. That is why the budget was constructed as it is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overwhelmingly, the budget's focus is on medium term fiscal responsibility, and that is in spectacular contrast to the medium term and short term and longer term fiscal irresponsibility of the opposition which would accumulate deficits of $1,400 million this year and $3,000 million by 1996-97, without any redeeming attempt that it told us about to make up for that through other forms of revenue or outlay arrangements.

I draw the minister's attention to the trade figures in the July balance of payments statistics released on Monday which show an improvement in Australia's export performance for that month.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RF4">Senator COOK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator McKiernan for his continuing interest in issues related to trade. A moment ago Senator Gareth Evans said that one of the features of the budget was to provide assistance to exporters. That is true; it is a key facet of the budget and one that we will hear much more about in the next few weeks. It is the government's intention to further strengthen and give support to Australian exporters, encourage others who do not export now to get into the export business, and help the economy grow by hooking onto the massive demand for goods and services in the near north of Australia in the Asia-Pacific region.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The balance of payments figures that came out on Monday confirm an underlying trend in the Australian economy. They are good figures from an export point of view. They show that the export performance of this country continues to improve. Seasonally adjusted for July, our overall exports for that month rose by seven per cent and our imports rose by one per cent, exports thus vastly outstripping imports.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If one looks at particular categories, one will see that exports of transport equipment for the month of July increased by 33 per cent and that exports of manufactured goods increased by 9 per cent. As I said, these figures confirm the trend in export growth for the year 1992-93. Exports of machinery increased by 25 per cent compared with the previous year; exports of transport equipment went up 22 per cent compared with the previous year; and exports of manufactured goods went up 14 per cent in 1992-93 compared with 1991-92.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The trend in balance of payments returns for the last four months are interesting. They show three significant factors. Exports have been going up month by month and, importantly, the amount of the increase has been accelerating month by month.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Imports have been growing month by month but the figures are decelerating; that is, going down at a greater rate. That is a very important and worthwhile outcome for the Australian economy. It is one that clearly does not suit the opposition because there is still an unreasonable level of interjection.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These figures have been returned, importantly, in the face of subdued international economic demand. The global economy's strength has been soft; the prices and demand levels in areas of mineral commodities have been quite soft. Despite low demand in areas of traditional excellence in export performance, Australia's overall export performance has increased, which does vindicate our strategy about hooking ourselves more into the Asian growth area and integrating the Australian economy within this region. This also shows that, when domestic demand picks up at a much faster rate than it currently is, it will not squeeze out the export component; exports will continue to rise.</PARA>

Why did the Prime Minister have the gall to tell the ACTU yesterday that there would be a significant increase in jobs this year when the latest Treasury figures show that unemployment will remain at about the same level as it is today and even then only because some 50,000 people will have given up looking for work?

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My recollection of the figure in the budget, which I have just had confirmed by my colleague Senator McMullan, is that the expected number of new jobs added to the Australian economy this year will be 100,000. That is a situation which does represent a significant advance on the situation that we have been confronting over the last two or three years. There are grounds for confidence, there are grounds for optimism, about the longer term trends. Of course we are confronting a continuing serious unemployment situation, but the important thing is that new jobs are starting to be created. If the level of growth in the economy accelerates to the point that we are all hoping and anticipating will be the case, then we will start to get some really significant net impact on the total jobless figure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we all know, and we have known for some time, that unless that overall growth figure gets up to the order of magnitude of around four per cent it is not going to be possible to make very significant inroads into the unemployment figure. But the important thing is that new jobs are being created, new people coming into the work force are getting into the job market now. There is an element, an environment, of much more confidence around the place at the moment in terms of very high levels of profitability in industry, a very high level of appreciation of export opportunity, more and more businesses are finding export opportunities and more and more of those export opportunities are in the high employment, value added manufacturing area. There is a stack of grounds for confidence, unless you happen to be a congenital doomsayer of the kind that congenitally exist opposite. There are plenty of grounds for optimism that we will meet these targets that we are now talking about.</PARA>

I would point out that although we have reduced tariffs, we did not follow the tariff policy of the coalition at the last election which was basically zero everywhere. We are selective and careful in our gradual reduction of tariffs. Senator Spindler ought to realise that there is a significant difference between our tariff policies and the policy of the opposition which involves zero tariffs.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Murphy is right: the TIS has been operating for 20 years. It has been operating more and more successfully over that time. He is also right that it is the only such service in the world. It has developed from a very small organisation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators may be able to remember when some 20 years ago three Turkish-born women who needed urgent medical attention could not get it because of language difficulties. As a consequence, tragically, they died. At that time, in February 1973, the Whitlam government set up the telephone interpreter service. The purpose then was to help migrants to overcome language and cultural barriers and to improve their access to a whole range of education and welfare services. It very quickly took off as a great success.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think in the first six months there were some 18,000 inquiries of the service. Since then it has developed from a two-city, eight-staff, 20-language service to now being national, having some 2,000 professional contractors, and being able to operate in 100 different languages. It is also operating in country areas, including through the use of 008 numbers. It has both on-site interpreters and telephone interpreters, operates around the clock, and is now both a translation and interpreting service. It has also expanded its activities from the mere crisis role that it used to have to now accommodating everyday needs.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The usage figures for 1992-93 are an illustrative reflection of its success. Some 290,000 telephone inquiries were made in 1992-93 and there were some 76,000 on-site acts of assistance performed by the translating and interpreting service. It is not used solely by those of a non-English speaking background. Some half of the clients of the TIS are now of an English speaking background, either public utilities or private sector operators such as medicos and legal professionals.

As the minister responsible for the MFP, I find the remarks of Mr Kennan, which I read in the newspaper yesterday and followed up today, quite reasonable. He made it quite clear that, until the new board was appointed towards the end of last year and operating early this year, and his appointment, the operation of the MFP was not as focused as it possibly could have been.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am now asked: do I agree with what he said? The answer to that question is, yes, I do agree with what Mr Ferris has said. There are two things that ought to said here. Mr Ferris is one of the few Australians in this country who knows a great deal about trade opportunities for Australia and how we are seen overseas. As head of Austrade he travels widely around the world and in our major trading markets, deals with complex issues and is across the detail of trade negotiations at both macro and micro level.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Ferris is, if you like, a true reporter of Australia's image abroad. It seems to me that what he is saying in his reported remarks is that our image can be refurbished&mdash;that Australia can be seen as its own country and framing its own destiny as a republic, rather than as a constitutional monarchy. That will help Australia's export image because in markets in which we deal we will be seen to be genuinely part of Asia and part of the region.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also think that his views are valuable from another point of view. In my own travels on trade issues for Australia, one of the matters of great interest in the republican debate in this country from overseas is: what does this mean? Certainly within Asia, the area of our boom markets, the republican debate is interpreted as being a debate about not only our constitutional arrangements but also our presence as part of this region.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The matter which Senator Childs raises relates to quite a complex situation because there is a range of elements in terms of benefits and disadvantages relatively between businesses operating within the department of administrative services and the private sector. On balance, the evidence suggests that DAAS businesses do not have an unfair advantage in competing with the private sector. In fact, the evidence suggests that collectively DAAS groups operate under cost structures that leave them neither better nor worse off than their private sector competitors.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The process of commercialisation which the government started in 1987 has meant that well over $700 million in potential revenue previously controlled by the DAAS operations has been opened up to competition. In the budget we announced a review of the direction of commercialisation within the department. This will allow the commercialisation strategy to achieve its full potential in benefits to taxpayers and to the economy in general.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Right now, fully commercial DAAS businesses operate under arrangements consistent with those prevailing in the private sector&mdash;for example, the accrual accounting requirements, the business regulations under legislation such as the Trade Practices Act, and the accountability framework consistent with the corporations law. While most DAAS businesses do not pay most taxes&mdash;this will be reviewed in the lead up to 1995&mdash;payments are set aside in lieu of Commonwealth and state indirect taxes and charges for non-Commonwealth work. Of course, some taxes are paid&mdash;for example, customs duty and fringe benefits tax.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most robust independent analysis of the relative position between businesses operating within the department of administrative services and their private sector competitors is that done by Ernst and Young. Ernst and Young concluded that the net effect for DAAS is that, across the board, DAAS businesses are disadvantaged by some two to three per cent of sales revenue when compared with their private sector competitors.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said in my opening response to Senator Childs's question, a range of complex factors is involved and discussion of it is never assisted by simplistic assertions which we have had from time to time from, for example, the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory in his enthusiasm to have the government sack 160 of his constituents. There are pluses and minuses involved. There are advantages and disadvantages that come with operating within the public sector. More than slogans and prejudice are needed to analyse it. I have to say that all too often in the past we have had from the competitors and from some political observers nothing more than slogans and prejudice.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The important thing is that those who seek to analyse and comment on this matter and participate in debate base their decisions on an assessment of the public interest&mdash;that is, the public as taxpayers getting a return on their investment in these businesses and getting an efficient service from these businesses. The public are the ultimate consumers of the services provided. On that basis, I think we can establish a basis for businesses operating within the department of administrative services to continue to be viable businesses competing fairly with the private sector and open to competition from the private sector which benefits enormously from that. It, therefore, has to accept the corollary that, if it gets the enormous benefits of competing for this work, it will have to accept that competition will apply.</PARA>

Can the minister further confirm that the CES recently flew a Melbourne woman to the Gold Coast for an interview as a receptionist and a South Australian man to Queensland for a job as a storeman? Given Queensland's high level of unemployment and the skills of the jobs involved, how can the CES justify this outrageous expenditure which completely ignores the claims of the local unemployed? Recognising the obvious inefficiencies in the present scheme, will the government give a commitment to examine the relocation priorities of the CES or are Australia's taxpayers to be expected to continue to fund this working holiday scheme?</PARA></TALK.START>

I sought to take that question away and give him a further response, which I now do. Senator Alston's question did not provide sufficient detail to allow for a full analysis of the impact of the budget decisions for the individual case that he raised. For example, the marital status of the person concerned, the income earned by a spouse, if any, and the number and age of dependants would all, of course, have an impact on how any one individual would fare out of the budget.</PARA></TALK.START>

These measures are the latest of many which the government has taken since coming to power in 1983 to improve the position of low income Australians. The most comprehensive distributional analysis of the budget measures was announced in the Treasurer's press release of 31 August. That analysis does show, as I said in question time today, that the vast majority of household types and income groups will make small average gains as a result of the budget measures.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Limited resources are available to extend SBS television to all areas which have expressed interest in receiving it. Therefore, extensions must be considered on a phased basis.

It is now available to over 85 per cent of the Australian population. Extensions for Darwin, the Spencer Gulf, Cairns and Townsville are due to commence in December this year and north-eastern Tasmania in April 1994. Further extensions to SBS television have not been approved by the government. The government will give further consideration to this matter prior to the 1994-95 budget.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson), in response to a question without notice asked by Senator Patterson this day, relating to proposals to treat unrealised capital gains and losses on listed securities as income under the Social Security and Veterans' Entitlements Acts.</PARA>
<PARA>The government's handling of the pensioner shares issue is deplorable and nothing short of an absolute disgrace. Month after month the government has told us and the pensioner community that it will not change its mind on this harsh and inequitable income test, and time and time again it has told pensioners that the measure is fair and equitable. Less than a month before the commencement date, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), as part of a massive budget backdown, unprecedented in Australia's history, announced that the government will review the implementation of this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is tough luck for all those pensioners and veterans who have already sold their valuable share portfolios. If any honourable senators on the other side of the chamber have read the letters that they have received from pensioners, they would know that many of them have accumulated those shares by saving over a long period; some have inherited small shareholdings from their husbands, which they had as a result of their work; some of them have inherited small shareholdings from their families. Some of them have now been forced to sell them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no indication of when this review will be undertaken. There has been no announcement about whether any decision will be made prior to 23 September, which is the start-up date. That is only three weeks away and pensioners have to make a decision. After Tuesday, we will not be sitting again until 27 September. So, when we come back after this sitting period, the event will have come and gone. Pensioners need to know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What do the thousands of pensioners and veterans who have to decide whether or not to sell up their shares do now? Do they wait and hope? Do they sell up and lose portfolios which they have built up over a long period? What on earth are they supposed to do? In a press release of a couple of days ago, the Prime Minister made this half-baked comment:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Following this evening's Caucus discussion, it has also been decided to review implementation issues associated with the 1992/93 Budget decision to assess capital gains and losses on shares for pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA>We know that when the Prime Minister was Treasurer he used to try to legislate by press release, and he is trying to do it again now. But pensioners know that that is not law&mdash;l-a-w. Even if it is l-a-w, it can be changed. This law ought to be changed; it ought to be repealed. The government ought to tell pensioners now what it is going to do about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are told that the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security (Mr Sciacca) met with the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) this morning. The gossip we have heard around the corridors is that the shares issue is going to the wall. The public, particularly the pensioners who are affected, ought to know today what is going on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A committee was set up by the Australian Democrats and the coalition to look at this. Two hundred submissions and over 2,000 letters were received. Mr President, if you were able to read those letters, you would find that there were stories which told of great hardship and great concern. In fact, I have had two indications of people who have even contemplated suicide because of the implications that this will have for their finances. The letters almost unanimously call on the uncharitable measure to be repealed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Hundreds of people turned up at the hearings in the freezing cold in Melbourne to watch the committee proceedings, to give their support and to show their concern. The interest in this inquiry has been virtually unprecedented, but the attitude of the government to this official inquiry has been contemptuous from day one. It has disregarded the concern of pensioners. Numbers of people have been ringing up my office and many of my colleagues' offices saying that they voted for Labor last time but that they had been hoodwinked and they would never vote for it again. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This morning the Chairman of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs, Senator West, moved to postpone the presentation of the committee's report. It has been finished. The staff have worked day and night to produce the information. But Senator West moved to postpone the presentation of the committee's report to a later hour this day&mdash;not until after question time, but to a later hour this day. Why? So the government's part of the report can match what the government is going to do. Senator West does not seem to know what is happening over on the other side. If she puts out a report and it does not agree with what the government is going to do, she will have egg on her face. So this report is being delayed. The government wants to prevent the Senate from being able to take note of this important report because we would have been able to speak on it. The government also wants to ensure, as I said before, that the committee report mirrors the government's decision in terms of what is happening down the way. But we know that it has no idea what is happening down the way. The ministers do not know what is happening and we are about to get budget mark 3. I am sure three-quarters of the people on the other side do not know. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This attitude is absolutely contemptuous. It shows that the government senators on this committee are quite content to ignore totally all the submissions, letters and oral evidence presented to the inquiry. They do not care if the pensioners are forced to the sell their shares needlessly, nor do they care that many older Australians have been worried sick for months about this measure. They have rung my office and they have come into my office expressing their concern. They tell us that they do not know what to do and they ask whether this measure will be repealed. We cannot tell them. The Prime Minister issues a press release and then does not get on and do something about repealing it in these last couple of days of sitting before the measure comes into place. The concern is that this committee has been railroaded. The committee report ought to be here and on the table. We on this side of the chamber want to know when the government will make its decision. I ask, on behalf of pensioners: when will that decision be made?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the motion of Senator Patterson to take note of the answer. This particular answer is consistent with the confusion that has been part of this sorry story. It gives a clue to the desperation that we see from the government in trying to deal with this, because it cannot be dealt with in a consistent way following the arguments that the government has put up for this measure.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Right from the beginning this particular issue could have been questioned on equity grounds, and I did question it. It just was not fair. Right from the beginning it could have been questioned on administration grounds, and I did question it. How on earth could it be administered? By whom would it be administered? Where would it be administered? So many older citizens who know better than this government, who have a lot more commonsense, could see that it could not possibly be administered in a fair way, as it had been proposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It could have been questioned on commonsense grounds and consistency. If some of our citizens were to be treated in this way, why not all PAYE taxpayers? Why not all shareholders? Why not treat the capital gains that other people benefit from in the same way? Why is not the capital appreciation of all properties being treated this way? As a matter of fact, I questioned this matter on the grounds of it not being good English. To define capital gains as income is to defy the English language. It just is not so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These arguments have all been well rehearsed. They have all been heard by the committee and the government.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This legislation will come into effect after 12 months of enormous insecurity for pensioners. During that time, the evidence that I have gathered at the public hearings on this matter has indicated to me that it has been extremely difficult for pensioners to obtain information on this issue. Not only that, but during the past few months a 50 per cent cap on the maximum increase in shareholdings has been announced which is not in the legislation and which has further confused pensioners.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government's rationale for adopting this measure is that savings of approximately $60m per annum will be effected. This is debatable, as one would think that a quarterly assessment of all pensioner shareholdings would be more than eaten up in additional salaries. Long-term, it will mean that pensioners will sell their shares and ultimately return to a full pension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The insecurity of pensioners on this issue has been especially marked by the moving accounts of those people who devote most of their pension money to paying for accommodation in nursing homes. If the level of their pension is affected by this measure it will mean that their accommodation in those nursing homes could be precarious. Not only that, but we encountered many carers who have given up a full-time income and a full-time career to look after aging or dependent relatives. They have a carer's pension but in the event of this measure taking place their income will be very insecure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to mention the position of many women in the 55-plus age bracket who, because of their position in history, have not had access to superannuation. They are dependent on money that they have inherited or money that they have put together and they have bought shares to try to bolster their pension income. If this measure goes through, they will be deprived of even that small comfort. Many of them have inherited shares from their husbands or other relatives, as Senator Patterson mentioned, and again this will be placed in jeopardy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned, the savings to the government are debatable, as many pensioners indicated that they would sell their shares because of the complexity and worry of dealing with this situation, and revert to a full pension. Not only that, but the cost of hospital and other associated health care will ultimately be higher to the government as part pensioners cut out private health insurance and, with quarterly assessments, the entrance and departure of pensioners to and from fringe benefits and the associated administrative costs may be a factor that has not been added into departmental costs. It may also encourage the hoarding of pharmaceuticals, a practice that the government is trying to overcome by spending appreciable sums on this now.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These proposals encourage pensioners to dispose of productive assets to maximise their pension entitlements. This is highly undesirable when national savings are at a record low. As we had pointed out to us earlier in the year, the Fitzgerald report detailed how it is absolutely essential to raise the level of national savings. The government's argument that the proposal would result in a more equitable treatment of pensioner investments is fundamentally flawed. Listed securities are treated more harshly than real estate, art, antiques and non-listed securities, all of which are non-assessable under this legislation. But once pensioner money is in them, it then becomes difficult for the pensioners to realise them for income purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not appropriate&mdash;I agree with Senator Bell on this&mdash;that assessment be made of the same or part of the same amount under both assets and income test. The use of the word `income', and the insistence that a gain is a capital income gain, concerns investors in shares and in those investments treated in a similar manner. In addition, some witnesses pointed out that they have already paid income tax on the money that they used to buy their shares. They do accept that the dividends should be taxed but they objected that another form of taxation of unrealised gains was now being assessed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the above reasons, it is quite amazing that the government seems to consider that there are large numbers of millionaire pensioners. On the contrary, the attendances of 250-plus at each of the public hearings I attended, the 2,000 letters that members of the committee received and the 200 submissions that were made to the committee indicated to me that this group are the members of the forgotten group of Australians whom the government is hitting hardest in its budget proposals.<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

From 23 September, when unrealised capital gains on shares will be treated as income under the pensioners income test, many pensioners' security will ride the roller-coaster of the Australian Stock Exchange. Their entitlements will become a lottery. The government apparently cannot see the stress it is putting the elderly under. Presently, share dividends received by a pensioner are included in the pensioner's income for income test purposes, and any unrealised growth is assessed under the assets test.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very unfair to treat unrealised capital growth as income. The very nature of unrealised capital growth is that no income is received.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This proposal is not equitable when it treats listed shares differently from unlisted shares and other investments. Desperately needed dollars in national savings and investments will suffer as these people divert their funds to less productive areas of the economy to escape the new measures.

If this government is indeed a caring government, why is it responsible for systematically destroying the hopes and futures of so many retired elderly pensioners in our society?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am referring to the iniquitous legislation proposed by this so-called caring government to treat unrealised capital gains and losses on listed securities as income.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first obvious flaw in the legislation is its inequity. Under the current proposal Australian pensioners will be placed in a unique category of income assessment&mdash;assessment that is not applied to any other member of society, rich or poor. Or is this just the first sign of future taxes on realised income for all Australians?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government must be prepared to listen to its people. These people in their thousands want to know: why should the Department of Social Security take into account unrealised gains on shares and investment when the tax office does not?  Why should the government penalise those pensioners who invest in this nation's future by investing in Australian companies? Would the government prefer pensioners to take their money offshore?  Or would the government rather pensioners hide their money under their mattresses? They are certainly not sleeping well these days, so why not put it to good use. The Senate will recall that Malcolm Fraser was laughed at years ago when he suggested the safest place to keep our money was under the bed.

This will come on top of the government's legislation to reduce pensions based on unrealised gains in share values. An embattled pensioner will be driven into a lower standard of living via reduced pensions and expensive petrol, and the journey will be made in a vehicle that is losing value faster than this government can save face. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am a senator who has taken a great interest in this decision of the government to reduce the value of the social security and veterans' pension as a result of a rise in the stock market value of shares. Recently, the government commissioned a report on national savings by Dr Vince FitzGerald for the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins). He pointed out very clearly that Australia's national savings, now at 16 per cent of GDP in 1991-92, was at its lowest level in two generations. Apart from national emergencies, the two world wars and the Great Depression, it is at the lowest level of savings this century.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this government has done in this legislation in victimising the pensioners who happen to own some shares is discourage the level of saving in this country even further. Dr FitzGerald in his report makes a very significant comment in relation to the importance of national household savings. I suggest that government senators read this closely. Therefore, I call for the tabling and presentation of this document by the committee at the first available opportunity, since this is relevant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government recently sold some of its shares in the Commonwealth Bank through a public float. It encouraged thousands of Australians to become shareholders for the first time. Shares in the Commonwealth Bank was a safe, secure shareholding. Those people who were lured into that investment to provide and to save have now been quite disillusioned as a result of this decision by the government. What it really means is that the value of those shares has increased as a result of good management but, according to the legislation brought before this place, from 1 September&mdash;unless a decision has been made to the contrary&mdash;pensions will reduce as a result of the increase in that share value. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those pensioners do not receive any cash flow, so what are they forced to do? They are forced to sell some of those shares that they purchased in the Commonwealth Bank. How else are they to maintain their standard of living? How else are they going to buy their vegetables and their groceries? They do not have the cash resource. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the Senate should have taken action long before now. Some time ago, I think going back to 1978, similar provisions were brought in to reduce the value of the pension where there was an increase in the value of friendly society bonds and investment bonds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is: why just public company shares? Why not private shares, trusts, antiques, property and all the other sorts of issues? I think it is appalling that the Department of Social Security has encouraged the government to go on this divergent course. Why should those people who are less able to defend themselves, namely, the elderly and those with special disadvantages, be treated in this way? The government already has two determinants for determining the level of pension: an assets test and an income test. Now it is bringing in an unrealised capital gains or growth tax. This is just the thin end of the wedge, I believe, for the introduction of a wealth tax. A wealth tax is currently being imposed through this mechanism on that section of the community that can least afford it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind the Senate that the superannuation guarantee charge must not be the only vehicle for saving in this country, and we are tending to move down this path. I wonder whether it will be a vehicle for saving. If the government had lifted the level of taxes on the SGC charge, as it had wished, the charge would have had to go up even higher, which would make it even less defensible. I call upon the government to ensure that this report is brought down expeditiously. We have to have a speedy, satisfactory and honourable solution to a problem that is affecting up to 80,000 Australian people. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr Deputy President, the National Health and Medical Research Council, as you know, was established in 1936. This report is its first annual strategic plan for this triennium; it goes under a triennial budget. There are two aspects of the report to which I wish to refer. The first is the ethics of resource allocation, and the National Health and Medical Research Council has a subcommittee which has this as part of its reporting requirement. The issue of the ethics of resource allocation is extremely important. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Courier-Mail</EMPHASIS> yesterday a full page article entitled `A national disgrace' referred to the health rationing that is occurring in my state, Queensland, particularly in relation to cardiac surgery and the use of angioplasty catheters. There is a heading `Heart attack while waiting'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that the National Health and Medical Research Council devote a considerable amount of its efforts to the resource allocation and rationing that is occurring in relation to Medicare in this country at the moment. We are witnessing and will continue to witness, under the Medicare agreements as they exist, continually diminishing resources devoted to trying to cut costs and distribute the cake around even more thinly to an ever increasing number of elderly people in our community. The largest growing sector in our community is people over the age of 60, and two-thirds of the health care dollar is spent on people over the age of 60. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second matter I wish to refer to in relation to the ethics committee is the challenge of the future. A book was published earlier this year called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Predicting the Future</EMPHASIS>. In the section relating to the changes that will occur in health care, it points out that the biggest challenge of the future is not technology, it is not the ageing of the population; it is the ethics of resource allocation. The ethics are in relation to genetic engineering. At this moment, the biggest advance that is occurring in health care is the identification of diseases related to genes. Already, some 170-odd genes have been identified that are responsible for particular diseases, for example, muscular dystrophy and the neuromuscular wasting diseases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have not reached the stage in this community, nor to my knowledge has this been approached by any body in this community, where serious consideration is being given to genetic engineering and the manipulation of genes in embryos to counteract the production of disease in the community. It comes down to the expense of doing this. Various articles have been written about designer babies in relation to the in-vitro fertilisation program, but we have to consider this issue. As I see it, it is the responsibility of the National Health and Medical Research Council to take this aboard in relation to its strategic plans in the future, as it was not mentioned in this first strategic plan. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the report.</PARA>
<PARA>This report discharges a reference given by the Senate on 11 November 1992. Metway Bank, whose dispute with the Queensland government was the central issue in the reference, took action in the Supreme Court of Queensland the day after the Senate reference, and it would not have been appropriate for the committee to have pursued the reference actively while the issue was before the court. We did, however, seek written submissions from interested parties and proceeded promptly to consideration of the reference after the court's decision was handed down on 20 May 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report sets out the background to the reference. Essentially, this is that the board of the former Metropolitan Permanent Building Society, MPBS, recommended to its members in 1987 that they agree to the conversion of the society to a bank. This was done in the knowledge that, if it converted to a bank, the society would have no claim to its contributions to a contingency fund established some years earlier to stabilise the building society industry in Queensland. A postal ballot of members approved the conversion, and it proved to be a commercially wise decision. The Metway Bank, which replaced MPBS, has been a very successful institution and has greatly increased its growth rate over that achieved as a building society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The dispute with the Queensland government arose in 1992, when national arrangements for the regulation of non-bank financial institutions were adopted which rendered the building society contingency fund obsolete. The Queensland government then decided to apply part of the fund to the cost of establishing the new supervisory arrangements and to refund the balance to the nine building societies still in operation. Metway Bank sought a share of the refund in recognition of past contributions by MPBS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the submissions to the committee clearly showed, there were competing policy imperatives in this case. It is important to note that they were overwhelmingly matters for state policy and not for this parliament to review. In the event, the Queensland government opted for a policy that would enhance competition in the provision of financial services. Metway has argued that this was at the expense of equity or of some moral right that the bank had to a share in the contingency fund. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee's report notes that this argument should not be overstated. The members of MPBS made a commercial decision which involved surrendering their interest in the contingency fund and benefited handsomely from that decision. It can be argued that their prior contributions to the contingency fund were in the nature of insurance premiums against instability in the building society industry and that they had benefited from the confidence and stability provided through the existence of the fund. In any case, the Queensland Court of Appeal decisively rejected Metway's arguments about equity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The detailed terms of the reference from the Senate link the dispute to the responsibilities of the federal parliament by relating it to effects on business confidence and to the adequacy of mechanisms for protection of the rights of shareholders and clients of financial institutions. The evidence presented to the committee in relation to these questions clearly indicates that there are no problems in these areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first term of reference concerns possible competitive distortions, effects on business confidence and effects on the financial system of the Queensland government's decision. The submissions from the Treasury and the Reserve Bank, which share administrative responsibility in this area, were unambiguous on this. The Queensland government's decision had no adverse effect on the financial system. The Reserve Bank told the committee:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We do not see any significant implications for the financial system in the dispute which seems to arise from a special set of circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee noted that during the period of the dispute, Queensland economic indicators were among the best of any of the state economies, which would hardly be compatible with any loss of business confidence in the state. For the Queensland government's decision to have an adverse effect, it would be necessary for adverse perceptions of the decision to be widely held. In fact, there are arguments for and against the decision and it is unlikely that perceptions of it would be generally adverse. The Queensland Association of Permanent Building Societies, representing more than one million members, strongly supported it. The clear finding of the court of appeal against Metway would also have weakened any adverse perceptions that do exist. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To the extent that the decision creates any competitive distortion, it is in the direction of stronger rather than weaker competition in the provision of financial services&mdash;something we should all support. In any case, this is an isolated incident depending on circumstances which cannot recur. It should therefore have no long-term or systemic implications. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second of the committee's terms of reference was the technical question of whether Metway Bank is the same entity as MPBS. This appears to have been rendered irrelevant by the decision of the Queensland Court of Appeal but, on the understanding that the committee's conclusion does not constitute a legal opinion, it is that Metway Bank is the same entity as MPBS. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third term of reference relates to the adequacy of existing mechanisms to protect the rights of clients and shareholders in non-bank financial institutions in circumstances where such institutions become banks. The provisions that applied when MPBS became Metway Bank required, among other things, the approval through a pre-paid postal ballot of 75 per cent of the society's members. This requirement has been transferred to the new national system for the supervision of non-bank financial institutions with the added proviso that at least 20 per cent of the members vote. It represents a powerful protection of the interests of clients and shareholders of these institutions. The Queensland government is accountable to its parliament and the parliament to the people for decisions like those taken in the Metway case. This also is a powerful protection. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee sees no need for stronger protections than those which already apply. I would urge any who doubt this conclusion to read the submissions to the committee's inquiry and the decisions of the Queensland Court of Appeal. </PARA>

This was resisted and we decided then to seek the wider feeling of the chamber. As my colleague Senator Parer and as Senator Kernot will confirm, the committee sought their views about whether, from the point of view of the coalition and the Australian Democrats, we should have a public hearing. The responses that we received to those requests were that indeed the coalition was keen&mdash;Senator Parer, as one of the initiators of this matter, was keen as was Senator Kernot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was a strong feeling amongst the coalition members of the committee that there should be a public hearing. This was disputed by the Labor members of the committee. We then went back and sought to better gauge the feeling of the chamber. It was very clear that the feeling of the chamber was that we should proceed, as we generally do with many of these references, to a public hearing. Having raised this matter again with the committee, Senator Coates then exercised a casting vote to prevent a public hearing occurring. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say to you, Mr Deputy President, that I regard this as a quite improper use of the casting vote, particularly in this case where we had sought the feeling of the chamber.

Flowing from a perfectly reasonable request and following proper procedures, the government attempted to muzzle the inquiry through Senator Coates.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing following the consideration of the Committee's Metway reference at our meeting this morning. As you know, I provided a draft report to all Committee members on 9 June. That draft canvassed all the relevant issues thoroughly and I had hoped that the committee would have settled the report today so that it could be tabled in the Senate as soon as any dissent could be prepared, preferably next week.</PARA>
<PARA>I interpose that there is a brief minority report on the question of a public hearing rather than on the substantive issues of the report. The letter continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I confirm that the Committee decided, however, to authorise you to inform certain senators and other relevant people that the Government majority is proposing that the Committee report to the Senate on the basis of the written submissions without also taking oral evidence. As the Committee did not decide to make any public statement, I believe your information must be provided only on a confidential basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no obligation on a committee to take oral evidence if the written submissions are sufficient. You and your colleagues agree with me on this point but do not accept my very strong contention that, in this particular case, a public hearing is unnecessary and highly inappropriate for the following reasons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Firstly, the written submissions provided all the information needed to reach conclusions on the terms of reference. Secondly, the matters which Metway would wish to raise at a public hearing are substantially questions of law and of state government policy. The legal questions have now been decided in the Supreme Court of Queensland. At the time the reference was moved, its proponents were hoping that the outcome of the dispute could be influenced by a Senate committee inquiry, but the Queensland Government and Parliament took irrevocable action immediately after the Court decision which has brought the matter to a conclusion.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Court determined, the matters in dispute were within the powers and responsibility of the Queensland Government and Parliament to resolve. To the extent that they raised issues which were relevant to the Australian Parliament, a hearing would add nothing to the authoritative written evidence from the Treasury and the Reserve Bank which is discussed in my draft report. It would be wrong for the Federal Parliament to involve itself in a dispute such as this, especially as it has now been settled within the state in question.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I acknowledge that Metway might wish to take every possible opportunity to publicise its complaint against the Queensland Government. However, I believe that to hold a hearing for this purpose would be a misuse of the Committee and would incur costs which could not be justified.

I put it to you, Mr Deputy President: is it not reasonable that we should take this particular approach? I think the issues are particularly important. The Liberal-National party members have believed from the beginning of this inquiry that the issues which flowed from the decision of the Queensland government to pay moneys collected from a major non-banking financial institution to its competitors, including a wholly owned one of the Queensland government, should be dealt with at public hearings. A lot of the people who put in submissions did so in the belief that they would be called to give oral evidence to amplify and support what they had already said. </PARA>

This is why we are calling for such an inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Queensland government, which we say has a central involvement, has declined to provide any information. So it is not possible for the committee, as such, to reach conclusions on important issues raised in the reference until it has heard oral evidence from the main party to the dispute and from others who have had first-hand knowledge about the facts and the issues. The fact that the Queensland government does not want to put in a submission or does not want to have anything to do with it does not really matter. I think that is all the more reason why this Senate should conduct a far-reaching wide inquiry to test the evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Barney Cooney could not disagree with the concept of Senate committees testing the evidence. He is a lawyer. The issues clearly are within the scope of the Senate committee, given the Commonwealth's constitutional jurisdiction over banking and its role in regulating both banking and non-bank financial institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even if the decision of the Queensland government in the Metway case were within its proper powers, the important thing is that that decision will have far wider implications, extending well beyond the borders of Queensland, which justify a Senate committee. The case involving the confiscation of moneys of depositors and shareholders, in this instance to the extent of $20 million, raises doubts about the propriety of governments in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The actions of the Queensland government raise serious questions about the adequacy of the mechanisms to maintain the rights of clients and shareholders in non-bank financial institutions.

The remarks I want to put on the record are specifically in relation to the holding of a public hearing. I agree with the chairman of the committee, Senator Coates, that not on all occasions are public hearings demanded whenever a matter is required to go before a Senate committee. There are some matters which do naturally lend themselves to dealing with evidence given in writing. However, I have to say&mdash;being relatively inexperienced in these matters&mdash;that where there is a broad community of people virtually demanding to give evidence orally and physically before a Senate committee, and where there is a matter such as this which is controversial, quite often it is impossible to judge the merits of arguments which are put in simply in report form or letter form.</PARA></TALK.START>

Those views were put back to the committee through the deputy chairman, Senator Watson, and they were very clearly to the effect that a public hearing should be held. To continue to say, `No, we shall not have a public hearing, we will go back to the Senate and will have a fight in the Senate chamber'&mdash;a fight we are now having this afternoon&mdash;is tantamount to a Senate committee snubbing its nose at the Senate and its view. </PARA>

Senator West will probably attest to my credentials because I refused to take evidence in the Standing Committee on the Environment, Recreation and the Arts hearing on sport in schools. I thought that sport in schools was purely a matter for state governments and for the schools. I refused to attend any of the hearings because I thought that it was not a matter in which the Commonwealth should have any role whatsoever.

He said that he was not in agreement with all matters going to a public hearing, which of course is a position that we take. Essentially he was saying that it is a matter for judgment.

At all times he has sought to involve members in proper discussions. In my experience, he has taken his responsibilities very seriously. He did not misuse his vote. On the question of the amendment, the motion was lost because it was a tied vote. He used his casting vote on whether or not the report should be tabled in this chamber. If he had not, there would be no report at all; no decision would have been made. </PARA>

Senator Coates wrote to all members of the committee and pointed out that there were a number of sound reasons for the decisions that had been taken in terms of the fact that the written submissions had provided all the necessary material. As Senator Campbell indicated, it is possible for that process to legitimately take place. In Senator Coates's view&mdash;which I accept&mdash;all the necessary material was before the committee: the matters of law had been determined by the courts in Queensland; the whole process had demonstrated that the use-by date for this inquiry had expired; and, finally, the Queensland government had taken actions because, essentially, this was a matter for the Queensland government to resolve. </PARA>

In the past, the government was able to steamroll things through this place. Well, let me let it know that it cannot do so any more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason this matter was referred to the committee, as has been clearly outlined by Senator Watson, is the implications of what happened. The fund that is referred to was established in 1985 to protect building society members following the collapse of the Queensland Permanent Building Society. All building societies made compulsory contributions. This included the then Metropolitan Permanent Building Society, which became Metway Bank on 30 June 1988, by which time the total contribution by the then Metway Bank was $17 million. The question arose: was it or was it not the same entity? Quite clearly, it was the same entity. I think this was also the conclusion reached by Senator Coates. There is no dispute about whether or not it was the same entity. The Queensland government then decided to snatch this money away, and, in the view of Metway and its shareholders, it was the equivalent of pilfering money which belonged to the shareholders of the bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Coates made great play about the court decision. All the court decision did was reaffirm, quite naturally, that governments can legislate to do what they like. That is exactly what the Queensland government did. There is no doubt whatsoever in my mind and in the minds of others that it was expected that the people who made written submissions, particularly those who were more closely affected by this outrageous decision by the Queensland government, would be given the opportunity to present evidence at a public hearing. I do not dispute the fact that in many cases written submissions themselves suffice. But the expectation was there that those people would be given the opportunity to enlarge on the written submission which they gave. </PARA>

Hence the party which gains the majority and forms government has an extraordinary capacity to influence and discipline its members. Its members are also keen in their own right to see their party maintain executive power. Consequently the Executive has, with rare exceptions, been able to impose its will on the House of Representatives.</PARA>
<PARA>The final sentence of that paragraph states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Executive has not always had such success in controlling the Senate.</PARA>
<PARA>We are looking at an example of that&mdash;and it might not be an unreasonable one&mdash;in the present situation in this place. The report goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The processes used by the Executive, the Party Room from which it is drawn, and the Parliamentary Committees of that Party, to prepare and refine legislation are of great importance to the fairness, efficiency and cost of the legal system. It is right and proper that those processes should, as far as practicable, be open to public scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA>I think the way this place works and the effect that has on legislation can be better understood if the party system is seen in the light that it casts. The committee went on to recommend that more support should be given by government&mdash;I use the word `government' in the sense of the executive and parliament&mdash;to the party system in parliament. I think that legislation would be much improved if the committees of the parties, as distinct from the parliament, could be given more support and more resources. Oftentimes the executive of any particular party has the ability to put legislation before the party room but the party room has insufficient resources to deal with that legislation as well as it might. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report also says that the parliamentary system&mdash;even though the executive has such a vital influence, and properly so, on our system&mdash;needs to be strengthened. There is a quote in the report from Mr Justice Brennan of the High Court of Australia&mdash;taken not from one of his judgments but from a speech he gave at the 1990 Blackburn memorial lecture&mdash;in which he dealt with that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A reading of the report will show that parliament would work better by being given more resources. I do not necessarily mean that money and personnel should be given simply to a particular party or parliamentary committee. I mean that the level of the ability of the personnel made available to the parties in parliamentary committees should be as high as possible. I hasten to add that I do not mean by that statement that the people who look after our committees and look after us in parliament are not of outstanding ability. All I am saying is that there should perhaps be more of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I go on to deal with the selection of judges which has been of some interest in recent times. The point to be made here is that the judges themselves have received some criticism, but it is the executive that appoints the judges. Paragraphs 128 and 129 of the report state:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is an unquestioned principle that judges should be independent. It is essential that those who go to court have confidence in the independence of their judges from governmental, political or other community pressures. In addition, it is essential that litigants see those who judge them or their cases as having acted impartially, fairly, courteously and competently.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is similarly an unquestioned principle that judges ought to be highly competent. These are matters for the Executive, which bears sole responsibility for the appointment of judges.</PARA>
<PARA>That is so. Under the Commonwealth constitution it is for the Governor-General in Council to appoint judges. In effect, that means that it is for the executive, and in particular the Attorney-General, to appoint judges. The committee believes that even though that is the process set down in the constitution, it would be consistent with that position for the process by which judges are appointed to be made more open than is presently the case. That is one of its recommendations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report deals with primary and subordinate legislation and makes points that have been made before. They have been made before because they are true. Legislation, whether from parliament or from some body that makes subordinate legislation, ought to be clear to the people who have to obey it. After all, if we are going to obey the law it is something of an advantage to know what the law says. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Also, legislation should be as succinct as possible and only made when it is needed. There is a tendency for parliamentarians to get up and either pass or propose legislation as a means of exhibiting the trade that we are in. I suppose everyone is subject to some problems with his trade. Lawyers like to go to court and doctors like to go to the operating theatre because that is what they do.

I say that not only because I do endorse them but because it will save me going through the litany of people who have served on this committee for extended or limited periods of time. Senator Cooney is right when he says that he hopes every member of parliament looks at this report. From other committees that I have served on, I know that when we have been involved in something and have put a considerable degree of work into it, ego can lead us to believe that everyone, if they had the time, would find the report fascinating. That is not the case here in that, while I do believe people will find the report fascinating, it is not because it is something that I have spent a large amount of time on&mdash;as Senator Cooney and others have&mdash;but because <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The Cost of Justice</EMPHASIS> second report has something to say about the involvement that every one of us has in increasing the cost of justice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all too easy for parliamentarians to take a free kick against the legal profession on radio and in the media. It is easy to have a crack at a lawyer. We could not find an easier ride into the media. If we ring them up and say we want to get stuck into the legal profession, we will be on radio for sure, because it is so easy to say, `People cannot afford to use the courts. It is all those lawyers. They all drive Mercedes; they all have big houses; they all overcharge; and they are all crooks'. Of course, that is simply not true. The legal profession does have a role to play in reducing the cost of, and increasing access to, justice. But sometimes it is very easy for us to neglect to look at the impact we have on increasing that cost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the table on page 18 of the second chapter of this report. We cannot judge the complexity of something simply by its length. In fact, I think when we put the Social Security Act into plain English it became longer, but it did become more comprehensible. So I do not say that size alone is an indicator of complexity and therefore cost. But it is of some interest to note that, in 1980, 177 acts were passed with a total of 1,860 pages. In 1991, we passed 216 acts&mdash;not a very big increase&mdash;but with a total of 6,905 pages. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What if there is a similar increase in delegated legislation? My colleague Senator Patterson would be interested in this as she has served for a long time on one of this chamber's delegated legislation committees. The 1,199 pages of delegated legislation in 1980 increased to 3,144 pages in 1991. This massive, exponential increase in legislation makes access to the law much more difficult for someone who does not have the capacity to go to the government bookshop and buy the relevant legislation and read it all themselves&mdash;the nightmare that that is, even for the legal profession. It does restrict their access. Those who do not have that capacity have to pay someone to do it. No-one expects the legal profession to be good Samaritans and do this work for nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We sit here saying, `This is very important; we need this amendment; we need this act of parliament' and then we just toss it on to the pile of complex legislation. We somehow imagine that it will be easy to put into practice, that it will be easy for people to operate with that legislation at a minimal cost. Every time we add to the pile, we add to the cost of implementing that legislation, to the cost of complying with it and therefore to the cost of and access to justice. We could do well to pay significant attention to this report if only to look at chapter 2. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Cooney paid significant attention in his very well considered speech to chapter 1. That is the chapter which I would recommend members and senators pay significant attention to. In short, it says this: the theory may be that parliament keeps a check on the executive, but the resources are such that the executive holds nearly all the cards in the deck. Someone may say, `So what? It has been like that for a long time'. We say that it is getting worse. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we actually believe in the parliamentary system, if we think parliament is meant to be here to keep a check on the executive, and if we realise that parliament is under-resourced, then we should not be embarrassed about saying that parliament needs more money and more resources to do its job properly. Surely that is what the system is about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When people elect you, Mr Acting Deputy President, me, and members of the Senate and House of Representatives, it is not just a contest to see who will become the executive and then, `All over red rover, everyone go home'. If that were the case, firstly, we would have a unicameral system and, secondly, the party that formed a majority would simply form an executive government. Everyone else could say, `Bad luck, you entered the contest but your team did not get enough players, so you are out'. We would not bother having an opposition; we would not bother having Greens and Democrats and Independents. We cannot bring ourselves to say that because we do not want that to be the case. We want there to be a healthy opposition and a range of parties keeping a check on the executive. If we believe that, then we have to resource it properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If senators and members care to reflect on the first chapter in this report, they will see what may look to some like pretty boring reading, but it goes right to the heart of what our task is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third chapter in this report deals with court funding. After all, we are responsible for that in the end. The judiciary wants its independence. It is entitled to it. That is the system we need. Nonetheless, it needs enough money. As the population rises, more people find themselves in a position where they need to go to the Family Court or the AAT and they should not have to wait weeks and weeks. The courts should not be jam-packed, lousy, tatty backroom offices, because that is what they are. That is where people go to get some adjudication as to whether the laws of this nation have been followed properly in their favour or otherwise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the nine years that I have been here, I have not heard&mdash;I say this to my own embarrassment because I could have raised it&mdash;a really shebang debate on court funding. Yet the courts are the administrators, if you like, of the system that we produce. We seem to dish them out a bit of money, give them a little bit of an increase here and there and think that we can leave it at that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Court fees and charges are dealt with and that is also worth looking at. By and large, a lot of court fees and charges cannot be put up without our approval, although a lot of those changes need to be made. They may be made by instruments that are tabled and perhaps not brought to our attention. An example has been raised&mdash;in the end, I think it got left in this report&mdash;of changes to the Family Court rules requiring pleadings to be reintroduced. That went through here without a whisper. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Family Court practitioners came to us and said, `This is massively increasing the costs for our clients. If we have to plead things properly, it means we've got to cover every option and that, of course, is something we have to charge for'. What do we find now? We find that the Chief Justice of the Family Court has announced that the Family Court will start to do something about that, if it has not already in practice. We all sit here and get paid to do our job, but it just slipped through and increased the cost of justice to people who needed courts for perhaps the most unsatisfactory of reasons; namely, that their marriage had broken down and they were no longer able to resolve the dispute between themselves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A very particular aspect of court fees and charges is worth mentioning and that is transcript charges.

These include the use of shares as a form of superannuation, whether women may be particularly disadvantaged if they cannot maintain some form of substitute superannuation and whether the income and assets tests need to be re-examined in order to ensure that equity is maintained. The committee would have liked to have examined some of these issues, but felt that time constraints prevented it from doing so in a sufficiently detailed manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has made four recommendations which it considers will address both short- and long-term factors. Rather than recommend a number of exemptions or short-term adjustments to the measure, the committee has agreed that there is a need to postpone the implementation of this measure. Consequently, the committee's first recommendation is that implementation be postponed until June 1994. This is followed by a recommendation that a review of the assets and income tests should be undertaken by both the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Department of Social Security in order to identify possible inconsistencies and inequities of these tests. As part of this recommendation it is suggested that those undertaking the review should consult with a wide range of groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has recommended that the findings of this review be reported in parliament in April 1994. A review of the administration of social security payments, including veterans' payments, has also been recommended. This recommendation has been made to take account of a number of concerns about efficiency and cost-effectiveness which were raised during the inquiry. The minority report varies in regard to the dates that are involved. One of the reasons for the majority report going for postponement till June 1994 was to fit in with financial year criteria. I think that is quite important when people are looking at budgetary items. </PARA>

When people are advised that something is a public meeting and it is a hearing of the committee it is a little difficult. But we did not have any grave problems with that. There is a very marked difference between a public hearing and a public meeting.

The report states that the committee does not believe that several important factors have been taken into consideration.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs has completed an eagerly awaited report on its inquiry into the government's planned treatment of unrealised gains on shares as income for social security and veterans' affairs which has been tabled here in the Senate today. It is important to recollect the circumstances that led to this Senate inquiry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last December, the government included this income test on listed securities as part of a package of social security bills that contained a number of significant benefits, including an across-the-board increase in age pensions. At that time we were in an invidious position. We supported that legislation. I stated in the Senate that the coalition would review the shares provision after the election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This promise was reiterated by the then shadow minister for social security during the election campaign. Obviously, we had hoped to be in government. No doubt many Australians who have found that they have been misled by the Labor government would now hope we were in government. But that was not to be the case. We kept that promise as best we could in opposition by, in the post-election period, looking to review that as best we could from this position. We decided to make moves to repeal this provision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the May sitting of parliament I introduced on behalf of the coalition a private member's bill seeking to repeal this provision. With the support of the Democrats, Senator Chamarette and Senator Harradine, this bill was passed by the Senate. However, when the shadow minister, Mr Ruddock, introduced a similar bill into the other place, the Keating government refused to support it. So it had two opportunities: one when our bill went down to the other chamber and again when Mr Ruddock introduced the issue into the other house. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was decided to seek to achieve our objective by amending government social security and veterans' affairs legislation. We tried another tack to give the government the opportunity to repeal this legislation. Again the coalition's amendments were passed in the Senate with the support of all the non-government senators. However, in the other place, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) responded by claiming that the opposition was `into revenge, obfuscation and just being villains'. That is what he called us. He calls us `unrepresentative swill'; now he says that we are obfuscating and are just being villains. He called the opposition `irresponsible, stupid people'. Let me tell him that the pensioners who came to those public meetings did not think that we were irresponsible, stupid people or that we were obfuscating or that we were villains. They actually saw us as heroes; they see Mr Keating as the arch villain and Mr Dawkins, I suppose, as the Artful Dodger. But that is what Mr Keating was telling the people. They did not believe in that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the light of this tirade, it is ironic that the Prime Minister was forced by a rampant and angry caucus to announce a review of this provision. I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall at that caucus meeting, as no doubt you would, Mr Acting Deputy President&mdash;and I acknowledge your position in the chair, Mr Acting Deputy President; I think it is the first time I have been able to speak when you have been in that position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have loved to have been a fly on the wall to hear what was said. Maybe I should have blocked my tender little ears, given what I have heard about some of the words that came out of that meeting. The Prime Minister was forced to announce a review of this provision, which he did in a press release. He believes that a press release equals legislation; it does not. We have seen him do that with all sorts of taxation issues in the past. He has issued a press release and said that from the day the press release came out it is law. That is how much he understands about the process of parliament. That is not law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pensioners are waiting desperately to find out what this government is going to do. They have to make a decision in the third week of September about whether to sell their shares or not. Many of them have already sold their shares. Some of them will be furious that they have been misled and that they have sold shares that they have held for years because of their belief as to what the government was about to do. As I said, the pensioners should never believe what is l-a-w because the government changes those sorts of things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the same caucus, bar a handful of senators, who voted against the amendments last May and who have now forced a review of this provision. In particular, one must wonder whether the honourable member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland), who labelled our amendments as an act of vengeance, was at the forefront of the caucus revolt. We will let his marginal seat of McEwen decide. It was a sad day when those people were cheated out of the representation of a tremendous member, Mrs Fran Bailey. The constituents were told so many untruths that, by a handful of votes, they voted in Mr Cleeland&mdash;a man who said that our amendments were an act of vengeance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the interests of ensuring that the shares issue is not some government diversion to remain at the forefront over the winter recess&mdash;which is the tactic it always uses; bring in some diversionary tactic to try to get people's attention away from the real issues&mdash;it was decided to withdraw the amendments and set up an inquiry instead. This was done with the support of the non-government senators. Today's report is as a result of that inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As has been said, the Senate inquiry received almost 200 submissions and more than 2,000 letters. Almost unanimously, they sought the repeal of this harsh and inequitable proposal. Many thousands of people have signed petitions that have been presented to the Senate in the last fortnight. During 1992-93, the Minister for Social Security (Mr Baldwin) must have received more correspondence about this issue than he has received on any other. It is reasonable to presume that he has received many more letters since 30 June. During the last two months, the talkback radio stations and letters to the editor columns have been inundated by people concerned about this initiative. I quote these figures and this information because they show the degree of angst that is required before this boneheaded Labor government gets out of its ivory tower, opens its ears and starts to listen to the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Even now we find that the Prime Minister has merely said that the government will review the implementation of this proposal. We have three sitting days left&mdash;2 1/2 in the Senate&mdash;before this is implemented. When will the government do something?  A very simple solution would be for the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) in the House of Representatives to bring on the private member's bill. It is there, it has been through the Senate, and no debate is necessary. The government could have this legislation through the House of Representatives tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Pensioners could then go to bed tonight knowing what their situation was. They could sleep for the first time for many nights. They have now almost become insomniacs through worrying about what is happening. Tonight, if our private member's bill went through, they could sleep. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Will the government have the gall to let a private member's bill go through down there? We have got the legislation which has been through the Senate with the support of the Democrats and the Independents. All the government has to do is pass the bill in the House of Representatives. We wonder whether it will do it. It is no good just telling the pensioners that the government is to review the implementation of this proposal. It is there on its doorstep and the government has to make a decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's announced review is also totally unacceptable to the thousands of pensioners who have to make a decision before 20 September. Are they to keep their share portfolios? Should they sell them? What are they to do? The government has to make a decision and has to make it now. As I said, the easiest way the government can implement that decision is to pass the private member's bill that is now sitting on the table in the House of Representatives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minority report by the opposition and Democrat senators on the committee recommends that there is only one respectable decision to be made, namely, to repeal this ill-considered legislation. It would be unfair to pensioners and veterans and would represent an undermining of the important work of the Senate committee not to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend the staff of the committee. I have attended a couple of those committee meetings and a hearing because I was concerned about the issue. I was one of the people responsible for bringing that issue before the committee. I have been impressed by the enormous effort that has gone into that committee by the staff. They have worked tirelessly to ensure that the views of pensioners were brought before the members of that committee. Again I say that the simple solution for the government is to take the private member's bill that is sitting on the table in the House of Representatives and put it through the House tonight to let every pensioner in Australia who is affected by this legislation sleep peacefully this evening.

They put in some very good information. Many of those people had actually written to the committee, as Senator Patterson just said. Over 2,000 letters were received by the committee, to say nothing of the letters that were received in senators' and members' offices, yet the Labor Party did not see it as a sufficiently serious issue to even attend the hearings of the committee in its proper numbers.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, I am delighted to note that you are the deputy chair of this committee. You have certainly played a significant part, with your colleagues Senator Lees, Senator Macdonald and Senator Troeth, in ensuring that a very clear position is put in the dissenting report. I can assure you that were I still a committee member this day, I would have signed this dissenting report as well. The committee did, as the report says, receive so much evidence from organisations with considerable experience in investment, in the stock market and in financial advising, as well as from pensioners themselves, yet this government still cannot make a decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What more does it need? So much evidence was put before us that this issue was bad, bad, bad even though it might have been law, law, law, yet the government still cannot change its mind. What more evidence does it need? How much longer is it going to dillydally and go on in this way?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Acting Deputy President, what your dissenting report said was quite right. There appeared to be an issue of policy and program administration costs which indicated a need not only for the postponement of implementation of the shares measure, but also for an adequate period of time for all these matters to be considered by a small group comprising experts in both financial and investment matters, and experts from community organisations with an overview of the range of pensioner needs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Community consultation is essential. I found it most distressing&mdash;I suppose that is the best way to put it&mdash;during the committee hearings to find out that so many of the organisations representing pensioner interests, and the pensioners themselves, had, in fact, only heard of this issue on the grapevine. There was no actual formal notification a long way in advance to warn people of what was happening. The grapevine had to work. That is another classic example of the maladministration of this administration&mdash;this Labor government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those pensioners now know that they are going to be constantly in this Labor government's sights. It is quite clear that they are in the government's sights. There is this issue and there is the issue of raising indirect taxes affecting pensioners. Where is the compensation for raising those indirect taxes? Where is the compensation for raising the cost of their fuel? Most pensioners do not drive around in the latest BMW. They drive around in cars that are fairly old and use leaded petrol. There is no reasonable compensation whatsoever for these pensioners contained within this budget, yet here we are with a situation where the government is totally ignoring the findings of a committee. The government can act, it should act and I wish it would get off its tail and do it pronto. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first major thing that concerns the Democrats about this issue is uncertainty&mdash;the fact that pensioners are not going to know what their pension is going to be and, once they have that reduction, how they are going to make it up. Are they going to have to sell their shares? What is it that the government expects them to do? Add to that the problems associated with actively discouraging Australians from investing in Australian companies, which is effectively what this legislation is doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surely we are sending quite the wrong message to those people planning their retirement now if we are looking at this third test on shares, yet we are not going to look at this test on any other form of unrealised capital gain. I simply draw the attention of the chamber again to page 11 of the dissenting report and stress that managed investments also need the attention of the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The habit of this government of continually chopping and changing, and shifting government policy in regard to pensioners, really does mean that pensioners do not know what they are doing, sometimes month by month and certainly year by year. How are pensioners, particularly those who are frail and disabled, expected to keep up with the latest financial advice without it costing them a considerable amount of money? Surely we should have no new means of tackling changes to the pension and no changes to the pension for those who are already on it, but we should look forward and make the changes for those who are coming on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude my remarks because I do believe we can now put this matter to rest by simply repealing this legislation. It is the easiest and simplest thing to do. We should repeal these measures and go back to the drawing board. Let us start again by looking at the assets and income tests. Let us invite to the table all of those organisations who came before us and ask them to put submissions in, and also ask the many individual pensioners who are now taking a great deal of interest in what this government does to put in submissions. We can then get a fair and equitable pension system that ensures that those people who need support can get it, and that people as they retire have some security and some reasonable expectation that they do not keep having to chop and change their financial arrangements, so that they can retire in peace. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. This is the first opportunity that I have had to congratulate you while you are in the chair. It will come probably as no surprise to honourable senators opposite that the government will not be accepting Senator Patterson's amendment. I will briefly address some of those reasons.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nowhere does the amendment say anything about the need we talked about in our report for a review of a number of these measures. I will just briefly deal with some of the reasons why we think there is a need for a review. One of the things that kept coming out very clearly during our hearings was the cost to people of financial advice. We were also told about where people get financial advice from; the sources that people use for financial advice. If people have small amounts, or even large amounts, of money to invest, it is prudent that they seek professional or competent advice as to how that money should be invested. To invest only in shares, we were told during the hearings, was not a particularly good and responsible form of investment. We were told that people who are retiring need to make sure that they have a cash flow; they need to make sure that they have money set aside for various emergencies that might arise; and that money needs to be invested in something that will give them capital growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were told by a number of groups that appeared before us that getting advice was a major cost to pensioners. I attempted to ask a broker what the fees and charges were on brokerage and was abruptly pulled up for doing so. I recall that during the superannuation committee inquiries we certainly had difficulty in initially obtaining information about the cost of investing&mdash;about fees, charges and commissions. That is a very important issue when we are looking at how pensioners invest. We need to look at the source of their information, the advice that they are given and the cost to them of that advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A woman came to me after the hearing in Adelaide and said, `Senator, your question about the cost was very, very relevant'. She was not a pensioner. She had sufficient income or sufficient capital to be able to invest wisely and well and she had taken professional financial advice. But she still felt that she was being discriminated against. She still felt there was a possibility that she was being ripped off&mdash;and that is the only way it can be described&mdash;in regard to the fees, charges and commissions that were being levelled against her. She certainly was not a lady who could be said to be a member of the Labor Party. She was a delightful lady. I have no idea what her politics are but I have to say that her concern about this issue was to me very evident, and it certainly is a concern which she has again voiced to me in writing. I have also mentioned the availability of advice. In rural areas advice may not be easily available to pensioners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment does not address the issue. The committee says in its report that we want these things to be addressed now&mdash;not at some later stage. This matter does not need to be referred back to the Senate committee. Such an inquiry needs to be carried out by somebody independent of politics. We do not want members of the lower house sending out press releases advertising falsely that we are having public meetings instead of public hearings. That is certainly what happened on this occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people were alleging that this measure would have a gigantic effect upon the stock market. I would have to say that this measure's effect upon the stock market is probably not terribly great. One of the problems for pensioners right now is that September 1992 was a low period in the stock market; in September 1993 the stock market is at its highest level ever. Whilst this issue has been debated and discussed by people in the pensioner groups for several months now, we have not seen any obvious effect upon the stock market which, as I said before, has risen quite markedly and is at the highest level ever. Because the stock market does have wide fluctuations, we have asked that the review look at this issue. We need to look at whether there is some way of smoothing out the highs and lows in the stock market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said that investing in the stock market is, in fact, a risky business. People only have to look at what happens in the stock market to see that. We heard some conflicting evidence. There was an allegation that, when the market was in a `bull', all the stocks were rising; when it was in a trough, all the stocks were falling. But we also heard conflicting evidence that that is not the case; that there could be a bullish stock market in which individual shares could fall in price. So that was not a particularly good guide for people to look at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is an issue that we have to take seriously. We have to look at all of these issues. Whilst our report is short, it certainly encapsulates very clearly what to us were the key issues. I am sure that we outlined that a number of other issues had arisen&mdash;issues such as an alternative to superannuation for women because they previously had not had ready access to superannuation. These questions have to be addressed and looked at, and that is what this report of our committee is asking the government to do. That is not what the amendment moved by Senator Patterson is asking us to do. So it is very important that people be very clear about what they are doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could get into some nasty slanging matches with Senator Knowles. She talked about the committee attendance. However, she completely overlooked the fact that something like seven Senate committees were listed for sitting on the sheet which was put out by the Department of the Senate for that period. Government senators do not sit just on one committee. For her to say that my colleagues had deserted me is, to put it mildly, a furphy. My colleagues had other matters and committees to attend to. Of course, Senator Tate, who had been a member of the committee, had resigned from the Senate at that stage. So there were three of us who possibly could have attended. It would be petty of me to draw attention to the fact that in Sydney only three senators attended for that day; so I will not say any more about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also need to remember that we are talking about 100,000 pensioners and DVA recipients who will be affected by this measure. We also need to remember that somewhere in the vicinity of 50 per cent of pensioners on the DSS recipient list have less than $10,000 worth of shares. So it is very important to remember and keep in perspective the number of pensioners we are talking about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Knowles and Senator Patterson have talked about the large number of letters coming through the offices of members of parliament. I have to say that I have not had very many letters in my office, even as the chair of the committee. One of the reasons for that is that I guess the areas I tend to move in, the areas I tend to service, do not include many of the 100,000 people who are actually shareholders. Therefore, this measure does not affect them. So I think it is very important that we keep these numbers in perspective. But that does not mean to say that I do not agree with what has been said here&mdash;that there are some issues and concerns that need to be reviewed when this issue is addressed by the government. Therefore, the government will not be accepting the opposition's amendment. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment expresses the sorts of sentiments that we believe should be expressed. This matter is of some considerable importance, as is indicated by the sorts of numbers that Senator Knowles was talking about. The hearings of the Standing Committee on Community Affairs were very well attended. Many thousands of letters were sent to members of parliament. I was an early recipient of a considerable number of those. The importance of that can be illustrated by the fact that just today Senator Lees was able to coordinate the presentation to this chamber of the signatures of some 7,000 petitioners. That is not the only pile of petitions that has been received. The 7,000 signatures coordinated by Senator Lees are only those which had been addressed to the Democrats. I know that other honourable senators have received and have presented some thousands of other signatures. The amount of attention that this matter has received through my office has been considerable, consistent and impressive. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The importance of this issue is well illustrated by the fact that when we returned to this chamber after the recent election the very first piece of legislation that passed through this place was the private member's bill of the opposition, supported by the Australian Democrats, seeking repeal of the legislation which sought to impose this measure on pensioners. In fact, in that particular sorry period when we returned after the election there was very little activity apart from that piece of legislation. That legislation was part of the constant pressure that I had guaranteed to initiate and continue to people who had expressed interest to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that stage I introduced some of the early petitions. To keep the issue in front of this place, we also had to suspend standing orders at one stage. We established the committee which is reporting today. We introduced private members' bills. As well as that parliamentary strategy, a number of other actions were undertaken. I was well aware of a considerable number of letters to the editor on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My interest in this subject was first raised in Tasmania by a constituent who was listening to what was called a community expo, conducted by one of the radio stations in Hobart. During the progress of that community expo, one of the people who was attending it walked past the radio station that was involved and asked a question of a pensioners union representative about this legislation which had gone through before Christmas. Nobody in this community expo affair was able to give a comprehensive answer. Somebody thought that the Democrats might have supported the government and got some sort of legislation through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reacted to that suggestion, thinking that that was highly suspicious and highly unlikely, and immediately checked with Senator Lees, whose portfolio responsibility this was, as to whether that information which had been presented was in fact accurate. Of course, she was able to tell me that, no, this had been passed through with the support at that time of the coalition. That immediately encouraged me to find out more. The more I found out, the more horrified I was. We have had a rehearsal of the problems that this proposal would create. Let us be clear about exactly what we are discussing here. </PARA>

The legislation itself had proposed that if the shares of those pensioners who were holding onto those assets increased in value&mdash;and it is described here as being unrealised capital gains; a paper profit is the way that we normally look at it&mdash;even if they were not sold, those people would be defined as having received additional income. What a strange way to think.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This concoction by some nameless bureaucrat that real people who did not get real money would have to have real cuts in their pension is offensive in the extreme. It means that a lot of the people who are our pensioners, our older citizens of Australia, would have less cash with which to manage their affairs. That that concoction was considered to be in some way fair is, I believe, offensive. Having learnt that that was what the matter was all about, I immediately made sure that I fulfilled the obligation to properly represent those people who were offended by this concoction. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report is a vindication of the opposition by the Democrats to this provision from day one. It is also a vindication of those people who opposed it&mdash;who contacted the media, who wrote letters to the editor, who contributed to the committee's findings, who attended the meetings, who made submissions and who spoke to the committee. They now are vindicated by the presentation of this report in this place today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The very first term of reference of this committee was to investigate whether the government's costings for this measure were valid. Chapter two of the report, which shows the list of committee findings, reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee does not believe that several important factors have been taken into consideration in the development of this measure. Failure to do so has undermined the validity of the costings.</PARA>
<PARA>We could go through and find further vindication of the opposition which this measure has had from day one, because that opposition has been based on common sense and on the wisdom that is readily observable in our older citizens of this country. Those people were virtually unanimous in their condemnation of this. In continuing that opposition, they have been vindicated by this report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also important to see that the report itself was not sanitised particularly well by the government. Even though the government produced a report which only it was able to endorse and which provoked a minority report from the Democrats and the coalition members of the committee, the report which we were left with had, in all honesty, to come down with a condemnation of the legislation as it had been proposed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I feel particularly pleased that that report is before us today because it vindicates that opposition. It is able to demonstrate to Australia that when legislation is passed in a strange manner and ends up revealing itself as offensive, if the citizens of this country oppose it and are able to express their opposition effectively, there is an opportunity to redress the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In speaking to the amendment proposed by Senator Patterson, I think some of the previous speakers' contributions merit careful consideration. While Senator Knowles spread far and wide in her speech, it is some of the reaction which was provoked from Senator West that needs to be addressed. I really cannot understand why it is that those matters which were not in the terms of reference of the committee but were discovered coincidently should suddenly become central to the argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Coincidentally, Senator West found that there were problems with the access to information about investment by older people. That may be so. As a matter of fact, I think it probably could be the case that there are problems of access to information for older investors. But I would postulate&mdash;and I think it is borne out by the information given to me by the many hundreds of people who have contacted me on this issue&mdash;that the people who were affected by this legislation were not active investors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The profile of these people is that they are not actively investing and punting on the stock exchange day by day, scouring the columns of the stock exchange reports. Many of them inherit the shares that they have in their possession; many buy them to pass on to their heirs and just wait on these investments. They are not actively pursuing stock market fluctuations. Many people acquire shares from previous employers of those sorts of organisations which pass on shares to their employees. Many buy shares to express an interest in the future of this nation. They are not punters on the stock exchange. They do not fit the mould of somebody who needs to go and find out information every day and pay 10 bucks for the advice. These are solid citizens who have acquired a few dollars and put them into shares in this way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To contradict the argument that was put by the chair of the committee, in fact some of the information presented to the committee revealed that very profile that I have described. Fifty per cent of pensioners on the DSS list have less than $10,000 worth of shares and they are not flopping around with that amount of money, wallowing in luxury. They are pensioner shareholders who, by definition, are not wallowing in luxury.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At this point perhaps an examination of Liberal philosophy is both timely and topical in view of recent comments in the press and in this chamber. Firstly, my involvement with the Liberal philosophy and the Liberal Party has been longstanding since my days at the University of Western Australia. It stems from a time I spent working in England as a student in the 1970s. At that time I encountered a `welfare state' which was going nowhere and not fulfilling its stated goal to serve the working men and women in that country. Such an experience caused me to contemplate a philosophy which would entail as much as possible freedom of the individual, equal opportunity for all and an economic policy which would complement those ideals and thereby make the system work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been criticism of this party stating that it has been overcome by `economic rationalism' at the expense of its philosophy.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The term `liberalism' has been the subject of popular misinterpretation over the years. The values and ideals of that philosophy have perhaps not been articulated as well as they might have been, but I do believe that in the last 10 years there has been both locally and overseas a re-examination of that philosophy. I believe that history will judge this party's policies in the recent federal election as wide-ranging and of such diversity as to encompass both economic and social policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To discount Liberal philosophy as mere `economic rationalism' is indeed short-sighted. Although an economic manifesto is essential, there is of course more to it than that and a brief analysis of the origins of the philosophy may convey to fellow senators the point I am making. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Liberalism is one of the oldest surviving political philosophies. As long ago as the 17th century, human beings turned their minds to a new order of things. England and Europe were witnessing great changes. In England, feudal encrustations obstructed the progress of mankind. During that period men such as John Locke, Edmund Burke, John Stuart Mill and Adam Smith subsequently began to question the role of government and citizens within society. Towards the end of the 17th century John Locke wrote that society and state were two different things. Locke stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The function of the state was to permit people to live in a society by protecting them in their property relationships and to keep them from killing, maiming or otherwise harming each other.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Beyond that, both individuals and state should be left alone to order things by mutual contract or by a principle of voluntary association.</PARA>
<PARA>Of course, up until that time human beings were not free to order their affairs as they wished. Thus it was that men such as Locke concentrated on the freedom of human beings within society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, Adam Smith in his work <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Wealth of Nations</EMPHASIS> concentrated on matters economic. Smith translated these new found ideals into the marketplace. For the first time people were talking about freeing up that marketplace from the feudal bonds which then existed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"> <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not too much to say that economics could not exist at all without the prior establishment of basic rights such as the rights to life, liberty and property. If one has a right to life, one must be at liberty to work and sustain oneself and one must have access to the means of production, specifically land and tools. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was the likes of Locke and Adam Smith who influenced Jefferson when he drafted the Declaration of Independence for America in 1776. The air was literally alive with new ideas; and so the stage was set for the continuing evolution of Liberal philosophy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Over the ensuing two centuries, America developed a system of democratic capitalism founded on a federal system. Meanwhile in England a Westminster system incorporating responsible government was adopted. The monarchy was reduced to only a titular head in that country. Both systems evolved from the philosophy of liberalism born in the 17th century. The break from the old world was complete and democracy as we now know it was on its way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Liberal philosophy has been developed on the basis that the role of government is to make as few laws as possible. John Locke said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There was no need for laws to any other end but only for the security of government and protection of people in their lives, estates and liberties.</PARA>
<PARA>This philosophy, Mr President, is one which supports a modern form of democratic capitalism. A recent American writer, Michael Novak, describes this as comprising three systems in one: firstly, an economy based on markets and incentives; secondly, a polity respectful of the rights of an individual to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness; and, thirdly, a pluralistic system of cultural institutions moved by liberty and justice for all. These are laudable ideals and ones which find themselves at ease with liberal philosophy. As you can see, the thrust of the philosophy is much broader than just economic rationalism. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is perhaps worthwhile at this point to compare the philosophy of democratic socialism to that of democratic capitalism. The democratic socialist gives higher priority to the distribution of wealth while the democratic capitalist ensures that, firstly, there is the production to produce the wealth. Of course, if there is not the wealth to distribute, socialism must fail. A brief analysis of developments in eastern Europe proves that this is so. It also demonstrates yet again that where there is no property right, where there is lack of liberty and where the individual is overpowered by the collective, the system will collapse. This is exactly what Locke and Adam Smith encountered in the 17th and 18th centuries, and we have seen it as recently as this decade in eastern Europe. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Modern Western governments have embraced a reasonably successful system of government which is largely anti-collectivist. It is a system which provides the yeast for voluntary planning and individual choice. Whilst I am the first to admit that such systems are not perfect, they are still the best that we have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, Mr President, a liberal is one who could be termed as one who prefers individual action to collective action but who still would commend the cooperative efforts of individuals joined in voluntary association. A liberal is also one who would certainly condone government action where government alone is able to do the job. A fitting summary could be: where regulation is not necessary, it then becomes necessary not to regulate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But how does this all apply to Australia in the 1990s? The question of our constitution, government and the role of this very house are being debated now publicly just as our founding fathers did 100 years ago. In the 1890s Australia had the buds of nationhood. Our country was experiencing its own distinctive literature in the form of Paterson and Lawson. Our art, which was depicted so well by the Heidelberg school, was uniquely Australian. So it was no surprise that Australians turned towards a union of the states to demonstrate nationhood in a political sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the 1890s, the founding fathers had the benefit of some 200 years experience in England and America from which to draw. In fact, it could be said that, by virtue of this evolution, the original ideas of liberalism found their way into the modern Australian political structure. Constitutional conventions throughout the 1890s forged and framed our national constitution, which carried forward the tradition of a Westminster style of government, albeit on a federal framework. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The unique advantage of federation is that it caused Australia to exist; it made Australia possible. As in America, Australia had a vast area to govern with a diversity of interests and so federation was a useful system to employ. The bargain for federation was struck on various conditions and understandings. Less populous states were fearful that the rights and interests of their citizens might be subjugated by the greater states. The rights and interests of citizens in each state had to be protected. The Senate was therefore designed to safeguard such rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Western Australia, we tend to view states rights as citizens rights. Certainly a pastoralist in the north-western corner of Australia would have different concerns and interests to a factory worker in Dandenong, Melbourne. A sound federal system must accommodate these diverse interests and rights. States rights is not a philosophy or idea which is peculiar to Western Australia; it is essential to the federal system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This house, therefore, is charged with being a states house. Indeed, when this honourable house was conceived, it was initially termed the States' Assembly in order to reflect the vote of this body being one of a states house. That, of course, is not the end of it, for the Senate has been established as a check on government, a check on executive autocracy and a check on the unbridled growth of centralism, which can only impede in the long run the rights of states and the freedom of their respective citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Section 53 of the constitution provides that the Senate shall have equal power with the House of Representatives in respect of all laws save for those provisions dealing with money bills. Quite clearly, therefore, we are not a rubber stamp for the House of Representatives, nor are we meant to be. The Senate must not be curtailed in its role in any way. If this house is deficient, we have only ourselves to blame. If we responsibly uphold the role of the Senate, Mr President, it will ensure good democracy for this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have mentioned, I represent the state of Western Australia. Western Australia is unique by any standards. It occupies 2.5 million square kilometres, which is an area just less than the size of western Europe. It occupies a third of the landmass of this continent, yet it has only 9.6 per cent of the nation's population. Despite that small percentage of population, the state contributes 25 per cent of the nation's total exports. If ever Australia is to make an economic comeback, it will be led by this great state.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Western Australia is a major producer and exporter in the areas of wheat, sheep, iron ore, gold, diamonds and fishing. In 1991-92, that state attracted five times its population in the area of tourism. Our wine industry is world-class and, if not impeded, will no doubt contribute greatly to the state's future exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Western Australia is a state which is acutely aware of the problems facing the rural sector. Throughout the state, farmers are experiencing great difficulties. Over recent times, a combination of bad seasons, high interest rates and a lack of foreign markets has resulted in the destruction of rural family life and country towns as we know them. Any plans for Australia's future must address this potential disaster. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Western Australia also has a great mining industry, which in 1992 was worth no less than $12 billion to this country. This, too, must be encouraged, although I am the first to acknowledge that any development must address environmental issues, albeit in balance with the needs of this country to develop. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Indeed, there are legitimate environmental problems in Western Australia which need addressing. For instance, soil degradation in the west is a major concern for the state. Of all the saline soil in the country, 57 per cent is found in Western Australia. Ground water found in the inland is often saltier than the ocean hundreds of miles away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another issue of great concern to Western Australia is the recent decision by the High Court now known as the Mabo decision. It was handed down last year and it affects my state greatly. Until that case, there had been two forms of title: Crown title, and various types of lesser titles which derive from a grant from the Crown, such as freehold or leasehold. Mabo's case created a third category of title&mdash;namely, native title. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since Federation, land management and title have remained exclusively in the jurisdiction of the states. The states derive this as a result of residual powers in the constitution. It was something obviously addressed by the founding fathers, as it was not included in the Commonwealth's enumerated powers contained in section 51 of the constitution. It was deliberately left out and clearly done so as part of the bargain for Federation. As a result of the Mabo decision, the Commonwealth has now encroached on to an area previously the exclusive domain of the states. This is a move, which on a constitutional basis, I oppose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are, of course, the wider and more important economic problems caused by this decision. This decision resulted in economic uncertainty of immense proportions. Up to 80 per cent of Western Australia is theoretically subject to claims as a result of this decision. Not only in Western Australia but across the country investor confidence has been eroded. Uncertainty as to land title cannot be tolerated. The result of any such uncertainty will cause the system of land title to collapse and along with it any form of investment. Again on this basis I am opposed to this decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This does not mean that I am opposed to any assistance to our indigenous peoples&mdash;quite the contrary.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The process of any reconciliation with our indigenous peoples is a completely different question to that of Mabo. The Mabo decision will not enhance the situation of Australia's indigenous peoples as some protagonists say. All Australians, whether black or white, deserve equal opportunities.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Mabo decision will not stop the 30 per cent mortality rate of fringe dwellers in Kalgoorlie, Western Australia. Maria Meredith from the Ningamia community, which forms part of those fringe dwellers, stated publicly last week that questions such as health and education had to be addressed if fringe dwellers were to have a chance. There was no mention of the Mabo decision and how it would decrease that mortality rate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the Western Australian Liberal State Conference this year, two Aboriginal identities in Kalgoorlie stated publicly that what Aboriginal people really want is employment.

The two must co-exist for any system to survive and prosper as a just society. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where does Australia go from here? Firstly, this country has no problem with its identity. For a small country Australia has had more than a passing influence on international affairs since federation. Tragically, part of this influence has been by the way of the loss of too many Australian lives in two world wars.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this Bill follows on from the changes to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989 which were passed by the Parliament in the Autumn Sittings. Its primary focus is not on the Commission itself (commonly referred to as ATSIC) but on the Regional Councils.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides, in essence, for:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">reforms to enhance the roles, effectiveness and accountability of Regional Councils including strengthening of the provisions relating to the declaration of pecuniary interests;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the election processes to be followed for the Regional Council elections;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the introduction of a ward system for those Regions where this is considered desirable;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">proposals for further boundary changes to the 36 regions established under the Act; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a number of other desirable administrative measures including provisions relating to the Minister's power to remove Council Chairpersons and Deputy Chairpersons and to establish unambiguously what constitutes misbehaviour.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This second package of amendments, like those introduced earlier this year, flow from recommendations contained in the Commission's report to the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs on the operation of the Act. They will further enhance the representative nature of the organisation and strengthen the role of the Regional Councils as the linchpins of empowerment for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable Senators will recall that, when I introduced the first package of reforms, I foreshadowed that further changes would be required.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As I pointed out at that time, the responsibilities of Regional Councils have been progressively increased. They are making more of the decisions about how the funds appropriated to ATSIC are distributed, and are becoming progressively more involved in the whole range of activities and policies that affect the lives of their people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is highly pleasing that other Commonwealth agencies, and State, Territory and local governments, are increasingly recognising the important co-ordinating role of Regional Councils in planning and in prioritising programs and activities to meet the needs and aspirations of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first Bill included provisions dealing with two of the recommendations of ATSIC Commissioners relating to Regional Councils. The Regional Council structure was  strengthened by reducing the numbers of Councils, as from the next round of elections due later this year, from 60 to 36; and by providing for full-time appointments for Regional Council Chairpersons.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill builds on those reforms. It does not, however, cover all the further changes to the Act that are necessary to implement the totality of the reform package flowing from the Commission's review of the operation of the Act. In particular, it does not deal with:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">major changes that are envisaged to arrangements for the Torres Strait, including the establishment of a Torres Strait Regional Authority;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">streamlining of the financial provisions of the Act&mdash;one of the effects of which will be to facilitate the further devolution of authority to Regional Councils; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">strengthening of the role of the Office of Evaluation and Audit to include powers to evaluate and audit Regional Councils, Aboriginal Hostels, the CDC, Land Councils and ATSIC funded organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These are important and complex matters. It has not been possible to complete drafting in time for their inclusion in this Bill, which needs to be passed quickly in order that its provisions apply to the forthcoming Regional Council elections. The Act requires that these elections be held before the end of this year, and it is essential that those who wish to stand for election are aware of the new rules that will govern the elections, and the operations of Regional Councils.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is my intention to introduce a further Bill encompassing these further reforms later in these Sittings.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I turn now to the major provisions of the present Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Parts 1 and 2 are formal provisions. Part 3 relates to changes to Regional Council Advisory Committees. Currently members of such Committees are not entitled to receive any remuneration and allowances for their time and contribution. Clause 4 provides for such remuneration and allowances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 5 adds a requirement for members of Regional Council Advisory Committees to declare any direct or indirect pecuniary interests in matters being considered by that Committee. This has been included to bring the requirements for members of Advisory Committees into line with those of Regional Councils and is considered important as a consequence of provisions of the Administrative Decisions (Judicial Review) Act 1977. The Clause also provides for terms and conditions, including resignation procedures, for members of Advisory Committees.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 4 of the Bill provides for the introduction of a ward system for Regional Council elections. Clause 8 includes a new section 100A to provide for Regional Council election rules to make provision for the division of a region into such wards as are specified in the rules and the setting of boundaries for such wards. There will be a maximum number of 5 wards for each region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Honourable Senators may recall that I foreshadowed, when introducing the first package of amendments to the Act, that a series of workshops would be held to discuss the proposed changes, and that one of the key matters to be discussed would be the option of introducing a ward system. There was widespread support for this idea as such a system could provide an assured level of representation for each significant area of a region. These changes are included as a direct consequence of the outcome of those discussions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 10 amends sub-section 102(1) to provide that a person is not qualified to stand for a Regional Council ward election if the person does not live in that ward. This is consistent with the existing requirement that a candidate for election live in the region concerned. Clauses 11 to 19 also relate to the election processes for wards and operations of Regional Councils and are consequential to the decision to move to a ward system.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 20 relates to the timing of the application of the changes and provides that the amendments (other than those included in Clause 17) apply to the elections due in 1993 and subsequently.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 5 of the Bill relates to the operations of Regional Councils. Clauses 20 to 26 strengthen the eligibility requirements and obligations of Regional Councillors. These provisions result directly from the Commission's report to the Minister and is a clear indication of the strength of the Commission's commitment to the highest standards of management and public accountability.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 22 amends section 102 of the Act by adding a provision that a person is not qualified to stand for election as a member of a Regional Council if he or she is bankrupt or in similar circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 23 amends section 119 of the Act by replacing the existing disclosure of interests provisions for Regional Councillors with strengthened requirements, similar to those provisions applicable to Commissioners. The clause will also provide the Minister with the power to issue determinations in relation to pecuniary interests. Currently, the definition of what constitutes a pecuniary interest is a matter for legal interpretation. The new provisions allow for the Minister to provide a comprehensive list of criteria to guide Regional Councillors in understanding their obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister will also be empowered to determine when a Regional Councillor may continue to participate in the discussions on a particular matter notwithstanding any declaration of interest. This flexibility is considered important because of the difficulties which may be associated from time to time with maintaining a quorum for the meeting.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clause 25 widens the circumstances whereby a person ceases to be a Regional Councillor, which includes continued failure to attend meetings. Clause 26 makes provision for suspension and removal from office for physical or mental incapacity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Clauses 27 to 30 relate to the positions of Chairperson and Deputy Chairperson of Regional Councils. Currently the Act provides for the election of an Executive Committee. Given that Chairpersons will become full time, as a consequence of the amendments already passed by the Parliament, it will be important to ensure that there is always some person able to undertake the role of Chairperson in his or her absence. The replacement of the Executive Committee by a Deputy Chairperson, and provision for election for an alternate to the Deputy Chairperson, fulfils this requirement. Provisions for the suspension or removal from office of the Deputy Chairperson similar to those for the Chairperson have also been included in this Part.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 6 of the Bill relates to the Torres Strait Regional Council and provides for the deferral of the election of members for the Torres Strait Regional Council from 1993 to 1994 to bring it into line with elections due pursuant to the Community Services (Torres Strait) Act 1984 of Queensland. As I have mentioned, major changes to arrangements for the Torres Strait are expected to be included in a further Bill, and this Part provides a fall-back in case of delays in passage of these changes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 7 of the Bill relates to the remuneration and allowances payable to certain office holders under the ATSIC Act. These amendments ensure that the Commission can set a global limit on the remuneration and allowances payable to members of advisory committees established under sections 13 or 96, the Torres Strait Islander Advisory Board and Regional Councils. This provision is not meant to restrict the independence of these bodies nor to impose restrictions on the number of meetings. It is intended to provide parameters in relation to the commitment of funds and ensure that the budgets approved under Division 8 of Part 2 of the Act are effectively managed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this regard I should emphasise that the impact of the amendments on total Commonwealth appropriations will be neutral. It is ATSIC's intention to introduce these  significant changes from within its global allocation, offsetting costs from efficiency gains.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under Part 8 of the Bill the Minister will be empowered to make determinations about what constitutes misbehaviour thereby ensuring that Councillors are aware of their full obligations and responsibilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 9 of the Bill replaces Schedule 1 of the ATSIC Act bringing the 36 regions into line with those recommended during the round of consultations held in June this year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Part 10 of the Bill provides for transitional provisions relating to the replacement of 59 original Regional Councils by the 35 new ones and are essential for the transfer of estimates, draft budgets and other necessary matters to ensure the proper transition from the old Councils to the new ones. This Part does not apply to the Torres Strait Regional Council, hence the reference to 35 not 36 Regional Councils.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, let me return briefly to the proposal to introduce a ward system. Given the level of support for the idea I believe it essential to introduce provisions allowing for the subdivision of regions into wards in time for this year's Regional Council elections.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The boundaries of the wards that I will set in place are to be regarded as interim. In establishing the boundaries I shall take into account advice from the Commission following consultations that they have held with Regional Council Chairpersons in each State and Territory. I will also have regard for the number of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander persons living in each ward and communities of interest within Council boundaries. Providing that this Bill is supported I will make Rules establishing the first ward boundaries prior to fixing the date of the 1993 elections.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In Amendment Bill No. 3 that I will bring forward in a few weeks I will set out details for the establishment of an Electoral Review Panel and a process of appeals. This Panel will provide an independent report on electoral processes and boundaries. The Panel will have as one of its key responsibilities examining any further changes that need to take place to Regional Council and ward boundaries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Overall, the effect of this package of amendments represents a careful balance between implementing the principles of self-determination and self-management and the accountability requirements of Parliament. ATSIC, and particularly the Regional Councils, are further empowered to make their own decisions while ensuring that the processes they follow are open to public scrutiny. This is something which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples have themselves demanded, and reinforces ATSIC's established commitment to high standards of accountability.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also suggested that more important changes were identified in this review and are currently being examined and would be included in a separate bill at a later date. It concerns me somewhat as to what these more important changes might involve. It seems that the department's consultation in relation to any possible changes to the ACT constitution would have been somewhat narrow. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current so-called review is, I understand, one that is being done behind closed doors between the department and the minority administration in the ACT assembly. I understand there was no discussion with the other major party in the assembly and I am not aware that the Independents were consulted. One would have hoped that, in a matter as important as this, the department and the minister would have consulted with the other relevant parties and even with the wider community. The limited extent of consultation in this instance raises some concern as to who was consulted in relation to the more `important changes' which are being examined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In matters relating to the constitution of the Australian Capital Territory there should be bipartisan support, but the government will not get that sort of bipartisan support if it consults only with its own mates as to how the constitution should be changed. The process of changes to the constitution of the ACT, like changes to the constitution of any state, or changes to our own constitution, should be very carefully entered into and only after major scrutiny and consultation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Labor Party's record in constitutional matters is not good. Labor leaders around the countryside have called for various changes to our own constitution to incorporate such major alterations as abolition of the states, abolition of the Senate and the installation of a new head of state&mdash;no doubt to be chosen in a way that suits the political purpose of the Labor Party. Just as the Labor Party cannot be trusted with money, neither can the Labor Party be trusted when it comes to things like traditions and constitutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the issues raised in the bill before the parliament do not seem to be of particular importance. Certainly the coalition supports some review of the ACT constitution which would give the ACT legislature power to determine how frequently it meets, how laws passed by it are notified to the public, and the level of remuneration for its members, ministers and senior officers. We believe that these matters are rightly matters for the assembly to determine, knowing full well that any such determination will be subject to review by the electors in the ACT and that any misuse of those powers should bring retribution at the next election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, some of the actions of the current administration in the ACT assembly leave one with some uneasiness as to whether the administration has the political maturity and experience to make decisions upon major parts of the constitution which could have a very serious effect on democracy, justice and fairness in the operations of the ACT parliament. Also, it should be noted that, whilst most of the state parliaments in Australia have an upper house and a governor which provide some form of checks and balances against the excesses of the government, there is no such similar restriction on the ACT assembly. Whilst the Governor-General does have to sign certain bills into law, even his powers of persuasion and consultation are somewhat restricted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For all of these reasons, it is the view of the Liberal  and National parties that the power to determine the number of members of the ACT Legislative Assembly should, for the time being at least, remain with this federal parliament. Accordingly, I will be moving amendments in the committee of the whole to restrict and take from this bill those provisions which would have provided for the ACT assembly to have power as to the number of members in the assembly. Should any substantial or worthy case be made to the federal parliament to alter the number of members in the ACT Legislative Assembly, I am confident that bipartisan support would be obtained for any alteration to the ACT Self-Government Act as required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it would seem that the current number is, for the time being, the correct number and the coalition would be concerned to allow the Labor Party to manipulate the numbers to suit its own political purpose. One would think it would be inappropriate for the ACT assembly to, for example, double the number of its members to provide jobs for mates of the various factional leaders who do not seem to be doing all that well in the ACT Labor Party ranks at the present time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, it would be unfortunate if, for purely political purposes, the current administration decided to reduce the number of members to ensure that, in the next election, there was little chance for any other party or group to obtain a majority. There are a number of concerns in this regard and the lack of any consultation on the proposal with the ACT assembly does give some cause for concern. I repeat that any well reasoned argument for variation would no doubt achieve support in the federal parliament, but unless that case can be made out it seems improper to allow the current administration to manipulate the numbers to suit its own political purpose. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is often said that the ACT assembly should be run in a form similar to the Brisbane City Council, but even the Brisbane City Council determinations as to its constitution and the number of aldermen sitting on the council are matters determined by the state parliament which set up the local government in the first place. The question of the number of assembly members goes right to the heart of the operations of the assembly in the ACT and, for this reason, it is the position of the coalition that, for the time being, that decision making power should remain with the Commonwealth parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In all other respects, the amendment bill before the parliament appears to be appropriate and the coalition will be supporting those other provisions as they relate to the ACT Self-Government Act and the other pieces of legislation that are changed in a very technical and drafting way by this omnibus bill. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That amendment seeks to include in the bill a provision&mdash;Senator Sherry will be impressed with it&mdash;which will tidy up a little matter in Tasmania. I will be moving that amendment which I hope is now under active consideration as it is being distributed. That amendment is very simple. The purpose of the amendment is to protect Exit Cave, Australia's longest cave system, in a way that is more permanent than merely a regulation. It will place the gazettal notice of 1992 which prevented further blasting at Benders Quarry into the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act, thereby providing a safeguard for the Exit Cave system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1983 the Labor government introduced the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act to stop the Franklin Dam. In 1988 following a recommendation from the Helsham Commission, Exit Cave was listed. At the time, it was recognised that a quarry operation at the nearby Benders Quarry might impact on the cave system. In 1991 that possibility was proven. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">World Heritage listing obligates the federal government to do all in its power to protect the areas it nominates for listing. You will notice, Madam Acting Deputy President, that right at the end of this bill that we have before us there is an amendment which considers the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act 1983. In the spirit of making this particular bill a tidy-up measure, I intend to continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That obligation for this government to do all in its power to protect the areas that it nominates should not be lightly dismissed. Last year Minister Kelly watched while quarrying operations continued to eat away at the fundamental values for which Exit Cave was originally nominated for world recognition. Minister Kelly sat on that problem and refused to budge and refused to do that which the act obliged her to do, despite several motions, several speeches and several examples of all the other parliamentary strategies which I was able to have at my disposal. Despite all that, and despite all those attempts to call on her as minister responsible for managing our World Heritage responsibilities to proclaim the area and to stop the blasting, she did nothing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In early May last year the Democrats sought to suspend standing orders to debate the motion that the Senate call on the government to immediately announce that it would use its world heritage powers to close down quarrying. That motion was opposed by both Liberal and Labor parties in this chamber. Later that month the minister announced that quarrying would have to cease. We rejoiced in that. It was welcomed by the Democrats. We were concerned by the absence of any concrete action being taken at that time. We were also alarmed by the lack of detail in the minister's announcement. The lack of detail led to speculation about what could or could not occur at that quarry site. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A couple of weeks after the announcement, there developed some strong speculation that further blasting was going to occur. It had become abundantly clear at that stage that on environmental matters neither this government nor this minister could be trusted. The fact that blasting did not occur is probably due to the outrage that erupted then. It should be recalled that the World Heritage Properties Conservation Act 1983, under which the minister issued the gazettal notice to close down the quarry, is not regarded as an instrument for the ongoing management of Australia's World Heritage properties. The act is only enabling legislation. It enables the Commonwealth to prevent damage to World Heritage values through the prohibition of prescribed acts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a site to be subject to the act it must first be an identified property. It must have been proclaimed by the Governor-General to be in danger of being damaged by some proposed activity. The activity must then be specifically prescribed by the minister. This was done by the gazettal notice of 15 September 1992. It is that notice which this amendment that I am now foreshadowing will insert into the act. This will ensure that the proclamation and the minister's subsequent refusal to consent to further blasting of the quarry should not be revoked or amended by ministerial action. The only way to permanently do this is by legislation. That is why I will be moving this amendment, and I think the Senate should support it. </PARA>

This bill involves the removal of sexist terminology in the Australia Council Act 1975, the correction of citation errors in the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975 and a drafting correction in the National Gallery Act 1975. These are technical changes that the opposition will not be opposing.</PARA></TALK.START>

The claims are that the coalition does not share the alleged artistic integrity of the ALP. Those claims are fallacious; they are totally wrong. What has happened is that some of the media have fallen into the trap of believing the Labor Party propaganda. They have been fed lies and they have fallen for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If people from the media talked to Senator Newman, they would find that she played a bassoon; if they talked to the new shadow Attorney-General, Daryl Williams, they would find that he had his AMusA in music and that he plays the piano for recreation. I am sure the Deputy Clerk would be interested in that, since she shares an interest in playing the piano as well. One of my colleagues consumes books in a way that would most probably leave nothing in his pay packet because he reads constantly. Many of us attend the arts and we have a long history of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to take a moment here, because I do not want to take up time in an adjournment speech on Monday night, to mention one of my particular interests in the arts. It is very timely because I want to speak about an artist of great stature in Australia; that is, Celia Rosser. Mrs Celia Rosser is a Victorian artist. Anybody who has visited my office will know that I do not have artwork on my walls from the collection; I happen to have my own artwork. That is the interest I take in the arts. I have around my walls six prints of banksias done by Mrs Celia Rosser in the late sixties for the herbarium in Victoria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Celia was working as a graphic artist at Monash University when she was asked if she would do some illustrations for a book entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mosses of South-East Australia</EMPHASIS>. They were trying to decide whether they would do pencil sketches or photographs. When they saw the work that Celia had done, they were so overwhelmed by it that they asked her to illustrate the book. Behind each moss is a pencil drawing of the cell structure of that moss. That book, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mosses of South-East Australia</EMPHASIS>, is not only a fine scientific book, but also a magnificent example of biological illustration. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was the foresight and vision of the founding vice-chancellor, Louis Matheson, that resulted in Celia being commissioned by the university to paint all banksias in Australia. At the time she started the banksia project, there were about 68 or 69 of them and more have been discovered since then. She started that project about 20 years ago. It was the time I was at Monash University undertaking my PhD. Celia was there finishing each banksia, but nobody really took much of an interest when she would finish one. It was a bit like finishing a chapter of a thesis. Because one had not finished the whole project, people did not rejoice over the fact, yet it was a great achievement for the person who did it. Celia, a friend of mine and I used to have a drink every time she finished a banksia. So I became more and more involved in each of these banksias and more and more involved in this great project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Celia has now finished two volumes of the project: the first volume has about 25 banksias in it; the second has another 25 or 26.

Volumes were bought for this Parliament House and they will be in some people's rooms. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The reason I wanted to incorporate this table is that it demonstrates one of the greatest frauds this government has perpetrated on the arts. There has been monumental propaganda saying that there has been a massive increase in funding for the arts from which anyone who even looks as though they are related to the arts will benefit.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The facts are that the highly publicised, well promoted special grants to the arts have to some extent been at the expense of existing clients of the government, existing arts organisations, whose allocations in real terms are being cut. Who is paying for the big increases?  I will not deny that there are some overall increases. But the basic clients of the Australia Council are having their total allocations cut in real terms. Apart from a specific instance of a fall in one program, all of the boards of the Australia Council are having their money funding increased by only about half of the inflation factor this year&mdash;I think inflation will go up about 3 or 3 1/2 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We see that funding for the Literature Board will go up by 1.67 per cent; in other words, after one accounts for inflation its funding is cut. Funding for the Performing Arts Board will go up by 1.64 per cent, but after accounting for inflation that board's money is being cut. Funding for the Visual Arts/Craft Board will be cut; it will get a 1.56 per cent money increase which is a cut in real terms. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Arts Committee will get a 1.56 per cent increase; inflation will mean that is a real cut. The Community Cultural Development Board funding will go up by 1.55 per cent, which also represents a real cut. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The funds for the council's own programs and strategic development will be cut in money terms, let alone real terms, by 2.67 per cent. Advocacy travel will go only by 1.26 per cent, another real cut. However, I should add for the purposes of rounding it out, that creative fellowships&mdash;in other words, the big ticket Keating ones&mdash;will go up by 20 per cent because they are called Keatings. Obviously they have to go up because that is the big-noting one, the one that the Prime Minister identifies with. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Here we have the highly promoted increases in arts funding being, to an extent, at the expense of traditional art forms and traditional arts bodies that depend on the Australia Council for their funding. This is despite the fact that it has become evident that the demands on many Australian arts organisations, particularly those which have a national flavour and travel interstate, have increased. One reason for this is that many of them have had very difficult seasons in that economically disastrous centre, Victoria. That extends across quite a lot of arts bodies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that some of these bodies will have to approach the government for an increase in their funding, particularly after their basic funding has been cut in real terms. By the way, this includes the Australian Opera in that its basic funding has been cut in real terms because its money funding increase is less than the expected inflation rate. I understand from the debate in the Senate estimates committee that the government, when dealing with these increasing appropriations to keep pace with inflation, has been using an inflation rate of only about 2.3 per cent. These cuts have not met the government's own rate. Yet the government's budget says the inflation rate will be some three to 3 1/2 per cent this year. There is simply no way in which the government will meet this kind of target. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I repeat that it is a disgrace that this government is hiding behind its special allocations, its vote buying schemes, at election time&mdash;I have to say that it is delivering those vote buying schemes&mdash;but at the expense of traditional arts organisations. This can be shown even more dramatically when one looks at funding for film. Unfortunately, the appropriation figures did not reveal in clear, unequivocal terms just what the cut was, but the budget figures indicate that funding to the Film Finance Corporation is falling by about $5 million this year&mdash;a cut. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today we heard Senator McMullan getting up and saying,  `Isn't it wonderful how all these Australian films are doing so magnificently?'&mdash;by inference all because of this government. What is the government doing? It is cutting the allocation to the Australian Film Finance Corporation by just under $5 million. Next year it will cut it further by about $9 million; the year after, a further cut of&mdash;heaven's above&mdash;quite a bit. Over the three years we will end up with a cut of about $12 million. When one goes back a year it will involve a cut of some $17 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators will remember the enormous furore when the coalition in the run up to the election said that it would limit the cut in film funding in the next parliament. We said that we would only cut film funding by about $20 million, which is almost exactly the same ballpark as this government is now aiming at in these budget figures. There is a difference between us of only $3 million or $4 million. The reason that the government is cutting film funding is exactly the same reason that the coalition said it would cut film funding; that is, because the films are earning revenues. It is that revenue and the hope that there would be greater investment income that would enable the government to lower the grants. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the coalition policy had something extra going for it. It was providing increased incentives for investment in film. There is no incentive under this government to invest in films with the result that there has been a dramatic collapse in private sector investment in Australian films. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This government was crowing before the election about its magnificent contribution and was damning the coalition for even suggesting that there might be a cut in film funding under a coalition government. What do we have? We have a $5 million cut this year. We have a $9 million cut next year and further cuts the year after. In 1996-97, the budgeted figure at the moment in the projections is that instead of a total assistance to the film industry of $81.4 million, it will go down to $19.9 million&mdash;a cut of over $60 million. This is what the government states in the budget papers:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Following reviews of film funding in 1991-92, funding of the FFC falls to $57m in 1993-94 (from $61.9m in 1992-93), with funding continuing at declining levels through to 1995-96. Funding beyond then is subject to further review.</PARA>
<PARA>Yet here we have these actors conned by this government to appear in a vicious campaign against the coalition. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LE4">Senator MICHAEL BAUME</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I accept the interjection. These actors were conned by this government into supporting a policy which involves a reduction in film funding. Let us get that perfectly clear. This is another area where meeting the government's election promises has resulted in making a cut to some traditional areas of funding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that earnings from some of these successful activities will offset the reduction in government funding. But the absence of any stimulus or incentive to investment will make it very difficult, whereas I believe that our policy and incentive system&mdash;with a reduction in government funding which, as I said, is in the same ballpark as the government's own reduction&mdash;would have made it a lot easier for the film industry to increase the revenue made available to it. We were much more interested in using taxation incentives than grants because that means it is market driven, not bureaucratically driven. But this government would much rather dictate, through the bureaucracy, the nature of this industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will also mention in passing that it is unfortunate when the minister for the arts puts out a press release which quite wrongly claims that the Australia Council's allocation this year is $58.73 million when it is $58.13. It is a difference of only $600,000, but it is a little boost, a fiscal stimulus on paper, which does not exist in reality. The same thing happened in relation to a grant of $24 million to the Sydney Cove authority to smarten up Sydney Cove. That grant appears in this year's estimates but it appeared in last year's as well. It made it look good last year&mdash;an extra $24 million going to the arts. It was not spent last year so it appears as an estimate again for this year. The government is getting twice the joy for the same amount of money&mdash;or for the appearance of big spending, the appearance of meeting obligations, when the reality is often so different. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since this budget, which reduces the total allocation in real terms to the Australia Council, I have not heard a peep out of all those people who attacked the coalition saying that we were trying to destroy the Australia Council. The Australia Council's total appropriation has gone up by 1.96 per cent&mdash;that is, about $1.12 million&mdash;of which $288,000 relates to the creative fellowships, the Keatings. So the rest of the boards have had lower increases.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The total grant appropriation available for grants for the Australia Council has gone down by $733,000, but that is explicable; I understand what that situation is all about. Nevertheless, there is a clear reduction of $733,000 in the appropriation from this government available for grants by the Australia Council. I hope this table clearly indicates that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By the way, I had some difficulty establishing what the cuts were because they were not clearly shown in the appropriations. I am grateful to the Australia Council for providing this information. But what I am concerned about is that this government has required these individual boards to fund some specific interest groups out of existing reduced appropriations. For example, the literature board has introduced a new type of grant&mdash;the Asia-Pacific fellowship. I think it is great to have it. Last year $48,000 in fellowships were approved. The problem is: that is at the cost of other fellowships that the board can grant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The same applies in respect of the Visual Arts Crafts Board approving the allocation of 21 per cent of its budget towards the council's arts for a multicultural Australia program. I am all in favour of a multicultural Australia program, but the problem is: should we rob the non-multicultural program element in order to pay the multicultural program? That is what is happening in this situation. We are robbing Peter to pay for Paul's promises. That is simply unacceptable. It is unacceptable that there should be this phoney campaign on the arts before the election&mdash;a campaign which has now been shown to be partly a fraud. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As a Tasmanian, I feel it is my duty to rise and speak against the foreshadowed amendment by Senator Bell of the Australian Democrats. I think it is important to scotch this issue at a very early stage. I notice that my colleague Senator Calvert will be joining me in just a few moments. In fact, it is so important that I will confine my remarks to no more than two minutes to ensure that the proposed amendment is defeated tonight.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats have done enough damage to the orchard industry in Tasmania without adding salt to the wound with this wide-ranging amendment. I think they should hang their heads in shame. Surely these orchardists have had retribution enough. As such, Mrs Kelly, the Democrats and others have a very heavy cross to bear in terms of the damage that they have done to orchardists in the Huon River region as a result of the closure of that lime quarry at Lune River. What this decision has meant to the orchardists is that a considerable cost will be added to producing apples, which will have to be recovered in the export price of the fruit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Lime is an essential ingredient for the propagation of the fruit. It is not a question of opening any quarry for any lime. The quality and the chemical composition are important factors. As a result of this, trucks will have to come down from the north and north west coast on a daily basis to service the needs of these orchardists&mdash;more trucks on the highway and higher production costs which, as I said, must be recovered in the export price of the fruit.

I would like to know, looking at this foreshadowed amendment, just what Senator Bell is on about when he says, `. . . in relation to the area known as Exit Cave, Tasmania'. I would like to know how big an area he means. Obviously it takes in Bender's Quarry. He is trying to stop any other operation opening up to provide limestone to the apple industry. I find that quite astounding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bell has only this week been talking about concerns about the use of chemicals. That is fair enough; I support him in that, being an orchardist myself. I know the damage that has been done and can be done by the use of chemicals without proper knowledge. But this decision to close Bender's Quarry has burdened the fruit growers of the Huon with about half a million dollars extra cost. They use that lime because it colours their fruit. I do not know whether Senator Bell wants all the red apples in the Huon to remain green in memory of him or not, but what it means is that a lot of those fruit growers will be tempted to use chemicals to colour their apples, as he knows very well, and it has been proved that some of the chemicals that have been used to colour apples are rather toxic and dangerous to people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bell got publicity from the stunt he carried out last year and I thought he would have been satisfied with that by now. He got headlines in Tasmania, he got the publicity and Bender's Quarry was closed down. There was evidence given by more than one expert that no damage was being done to the cave by blasting it to quarry. It was a stunt to create support for the Democrats and support for the Greens before the election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that, now the election is over, Senator Bell would have given up and found something else to talk about. I just think, quite frankly, the people of the Huon would be very disappointed to know that Senator Bell, a self-professed free spirit in politics in Tasmania, would come in here tonight and try to create another stunt, as he did last year, to the detriment of the people and jobs in the Huon area.

I did not hear them all, but when I came in Senator Patterson was talking about something that had nothing to do at all with any part of this bill.

In the two days after the election I remember Senator Baume complaining bitterly about the stupidity of the arts policy that he had to try to sell as part of Fightback, which had enabled the Labor Party to get a lot of support from the arts community in this country&mdash;support that we still have. Senator Baume does not understand that the arts community supported the Labor Party not because of any question of money, but because they know that in our present Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and within the government there is a genuine commitment and understanding of the arts. That is in contrast to Senator Baume himself, who may have an interest in the arts, but no influence in the Fightback policies which were going to effect big cutbacks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Neither of the two foreshadowed amendments will be supported by the government. Senator Macdonald's amendment dealing with the size of the ACT House of Assembly is unacceptable to the government and we will oppose it. Senator Bell's foreshadowed amendment again has nothing to do with this bill, but is tagged onto it because the heritage bill before us is part of this omnibus bill to restrict exit cave access and so on and is on another agenda.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="0X4">Senator SPINDLER</NAME><ELECTORATE>(Victoria)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP> (7.32 p.m.)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Tonight I wish to address some human rights concerns which relate to the Macedonian ethnic community living within the borders of Greece. I do so in the context of Australia's international human rights obligations which are grounded in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights agreed by the United Nations assembly with 48 supporting votes, including Greece, and eight abstentions, mainly by the socialist republics of Eastern Europe, including the then Yugoslavia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Together with the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights, ratified by Australia in 1975, and the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, ratified in 1980, this United Nations covenant constitutes what is generally accepted as the international bill of rights. It sets standards of human rights which all nations should not only aspire to observe within their own borders, but should also actively seek to have accepted on a global scale. . </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that in contrast to the United Nations predecessor, the League of Nations, these documents speak of `peoples', which has generally been accepted as including ethnic communities within a nation. This is an important definition which, for instance, includes the Aboriginal community in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, tonight I wish to address in this context the human rights concerns of the Macedonian community living within the borders of Greece. The past year has seen more than 20 people sentenced to prison terms for opposing government policy on the subject of Macedonia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By way of example, three such prosecutions raise concerns about the Greek government's treatment of ethnic Macedonians within its borders. I briefly name the people in the three groups who have been treated in a way that I believe is a breach of human rights before Greek courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first example concerns Christos Sidiropulous and Tasos Boulis. Both received five-month sentences for `spreading false information and instigating conflict'. They did this, apparently, by telling a Greek magazine that they feel `Macedonian' and by asserting the existence of an ethnic Macedonian minority in Greece. The next example concerns Michael Papadakis, a 17-year-old school student, who received a one-year sentence for distributing a leaflet which contained the statement:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Macedonia belongs to its people. There are no races. We are all of mixed descent.</PARA>
<PARA>The third example concerns Archimandrite Nikodimos Tsarknias, an ethnic Macedonian priest and well known human rights campaigner who was defrocked by the Greek Orthodox Church and subsequently charged under the guise of insulting his Archbishop. His trial is set down for April 1994. I believe that we should raise our voices to ensure that these prosecutions do not continue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is useful to quote the concerns expressed by human rights agencies, Amnesty International and Helsinki Watch, which have made the following comments on what they judge to be a denial of basic human rights to ethnic Macedonians in Greece. Amnesty International states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Amnesty International is gravely concerned at these restrictions on the right to freedom of expression which the Greek Government guaranteed to uphold when it ratified the European Convention for the Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the European convention of 1974, in addition to the one that I mentioned before, the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Amnesty International has also stated that any persons convicted by the Greek authorities on the basis of contradicting the Greek government's official policy on Macedonia will be considered prisoners of conscience. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Helsinki Watch states that it used these trials `as disturbing violations of freedom of expression rights guaranteed by international law'. In none of these cases has any of the defendants been charged with violent acts or any other criminal behaviour. The charges are based purely on publicly expressed opinions that conflict with the views which the Greek government says is in contradiction of its laws. All of the defendants face possible sentences of several years as well as large fines. Helsinki Watch calls on the Greek government to immediately drop charges against the defendants in each of the cases. It adds:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These trials are based on statutes that violate international law on free expression. They are aimed at peaceful political expression. The government can stop these prosecutions if it wants to. Until it does, and moves to repeal the repressive laws it is using to muzzle dissenter views of Greece's friends around the world&mdash;and everyone concerned about freedom of expression ought to speak up and tell the country's misguided government to pursue its Macedonia policy through persuasion, not coercion.</PARA>
<PARA>These concerns are now being given some exposure in the media. The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> in an article entitled `Greece and Macedonia: Do Not Disagree' states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many countries suppress free speech. But these trials are taking place in a member of the European Community . . . Although the undersecretary for foreign affairs has said that some of the trials are a mistake, the government has not dropped any charges. In one case, the public prosecutor even appealed against a unanimous verdict of not guilty.</PARA>
<PARA>The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Times</EMPHASIS> says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Freedom of expression has been hit by a series of astounding criminal convictions of people who were foolish enough to question the Greek hard core line toward Macedonia. These trials are disturbing because they are antidemocratic, intolerant, deeply destructive and contrary to the European convention for human rights.</PARA>
<PARA>I believe it is time for Australia to play a part in conveying the message to the Greek government that Greece has an obligation to observe international human rights standards. The Australian government also has a moral responsibility to represent the interests of some 200,000 Australian Macedonians by taking an active role in adding its weight to pressure the Greek government to cease its discriminatory policies and stop prosecutions</PARA>
<PARA>aimed at ethnic Macedonians which cannot be justified on legal grounds. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The  answer  to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) No. The responsibilities of the Surgeon General and two of his directors general are predominantly medical in nature necessitating that medical qualifications be a prerequisite. The responsibilities of the third director general are such that the position is available to both medical and other health professionals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) Yes. This arrangement is entirely in keeping with modern military medical practice. The health services in the Australian Defence Force provide a service not available from the civilian sector: a field service in support of military operations. At the most senior levels of management, the task is to situate the provision of health services in the military context. This involves the provision of health advice and the development of health policy with an appreciation of the impact that such advice and policy will have on the provision of military health services to meet military operational needs. Considerable military experience is necessary and, as the advice requested and the policies generated are predominantly of a medical nature, the Service medical officer stream would seem to be best placed to provide candidates for these positions. Nevertheless, as indicated in answering the first question, the responsibilities of one of the one star health positions in the Australian Defence Force are such that the position is available to both medical and other health professionals.</PARA>

This is being confirmed with State authorities so that a formal withdrawal of registration can be undertaken for both chemicals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Agriculture and Resource  Management Council of Australia and New Zealand (ARMCANZ), which met in July 1993, agreed to totally prohibit the use of  aldrin and dieldrin in Australia from 30 June 1994.</PARA>

While alternative control measures are suitable in some parts of Australia, and may allow an early phase-out of the use of cyclodiene insecticides, there is some uncertainty as to their effectiveness in the control of the more voracious Mastotermes species of termites which are present in the northern part of the continent. The use of chlordane as a termiticide has been referred to the newly established National Registration Authority for Agricultural And Veterinary Chemicals (NRA). The Authority is to establish a working party to examine alternate termite control methods and if appropriate, propose a timetable for implementing further changes, including a phase out of all remaining use of organochlorine insecticides.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="848" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NSW">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The situation in the occupied territories remains unsettled and tense. Israel's indefinite closure of the occupied territories is causing hardship to the Palestinian population. While the closure has been successful in reducing the incidence of violence by Palestinians against Israeli civilians, violence continues in the territories between Palestinians and Israeli security forces. The number of Palestinians&mdash;including children&mdash;killed or wounded by Israeli Defence Force gunfire has drawn international criticism, including from organisations such as Amnesty International and the International Committee of the Red Cross. Details of economic and social conditions in the territories are given in response to question (2).</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The closure has in effect divided the territories into four separate regions: the northern West Bank, East Jerusalem, the southern West Bank and the Gaza Strip. Special permits are required for entry into Jerusalem and Israel, including travel between the West Bank and Gaza. This has resulted in disruption to the daily life of Palestinians, caused high unemployment, and negatively affected commerce, medical care, education, and access to services.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The economy of the occupied territories, already unstable, has been adversely affected by the closure. According to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees (UNRWA), "losses from wages previously earned by an estimated 130,000 Palestinians with jobs in Israel can be conservatively estimated at $US2.75 million per day. In the West Bank nearly half of the total labour force, or about 100,000 labourers, worked in Israel just prior to the closure; in many villages bordering Israel the percentage was as high as 80 per cent. In Gaza, 25 per cent or about 30,000 labourers had jobs in Israel before the closure, half of pre-Gulf war levels". Overall, unemployment in the territories is now conservatively estimated at 50 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The deteriorating economic conditions are having adverse consequences for the health of the Palestinian population. UNICEF has warned of the risk of widespread malnutrition and anaemia unless the economic decline is reversed, or widespread food distribution organised to the families of the unemployed. The closure has restricted access to medical care for Palestinians in the territories. Two major hospitals&mdash;Maqassed and Augusta Victoria&mdash;are located in East Jerusalem, and are therefore unavailable to patients from the West Bank and Gaza.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government is concerned about the situation and, in response to an appeal, has recently provided further emergency relief worth $325,000 to the occupied territories, to be channelled through UNRWA. This is in addition to the $2.6 million core contribution that Australia provided to UNRWA in 1992/93.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Australia makes periodical representations to the Israeli government expressing our concern at the human rights situation in the occupied territories and the conduct of the Israeli Defence Force. The last such representation was made by our Charge d'affaires in Israel in April this year. We also raise with the Israeli authorities individual cases of alleged human rights abuse, some of which are referred to us by the Amnesty International Parliamentary Group.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During my visit to Israel in May 1992 I raised with the then Prime Minister and Foreign and Defence Ministers the Government's concern about the use of administrative detention, collective punishments such as curfews and demolition of houses, conditions in prisons, the issue of family reunification, and the shooting of unarmed Palestinians by undercover units of the Israeli Defence Force. I made it clear that the Australian Government views such practices as violating the Fourth Geneva Convention and other internationally accepted norms of human rights behaviour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) While Israel has yet to comply with United Nations Security Council resolution 799 calling for the return of all the 415 deportees, over 100 of the deportees have been allowed to return, and the remainder are expected to be able to return by the end of this year.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(5) The Government supports United Nations Security Council resolution 799 and we have made representations urging Israel to comply with it. On 18 December 1992, I issued a statement deploring the deportations, and on 22 December 1992 officers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade called in the Israeli Charge d'affaires who was advised of the Government's condemnation of Israel's action. Our Charge d'affaires in Israel was also instructed to protest against the deportations to the Israeli Foreign Ministry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(6) In addition to the representations mentioned above, at the United Nations Commission on Human Rights this year, Australia urged Israel to accept de jure applicability of the Fourth Geneva Convention to the occupied territories and expressed concern over continuing human rights abuses against Palestinians. Australia has also made representations to the Israeli government protesting against the closure of the occupied territories which the Government considers constitutes a collective punishment prohibited by the Fourth Geneva Convention. I reiterated these concerns in discussions on 28 April this year with Israel's Deputy Foreign Minister, Dr Yossi Beilin.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from the Departments of Defence and of the Arts and Administrative Services (DASFLEET) departments and agencies are not permitted to purchase vehicles in Australia.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nature and price of vehicles leased by DASFLEET to departments and agencies varies considerably, depending on whether the lease includes fuel, maintenance and insurance, the purchase cost of the vehicle, the duration of the lease provided, the expected residual value of the vehicle at the end of the lease and the cost of funds, among other things.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator Schacht</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Government has decided to implement a consultation and review process to examine the need for changes to the way national marine science and fisheries research is structured in order to better serve client needs, particularly marine-based industries. The consultation and review process is being led by Professor Ken McKinnon, Vice-Chancellor of the University of Wollongong who prepared the major Oceans of Wealth? report for the Government in 1989. Professor McKinnon will report to the Government late in October this year and any decision on restructuring marine science and fisheries research, including the two CSIRO marine divisions, will not be made until after his report is received and considered by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among the issues that will be examined when the Government considers Professor McKinnon's report will be ways to maximise cross-disciplinary research, not just within the CSIRO, but across the broader spectrum of the Commonwealth's marine science and fisheries research.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government, on my recommendation, has implemented the consultation and review process to examine ways of better strengthening and focussing the national marine science effort. This is especially important given the impending declaration of Australia's Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ). The EEZ will represent an area about 1.5 times our land mass. Its declaration will result in heightened demands being placed on our marine science effort, and will present both major challenges to the Government to ensure sustainable development and management as well as providing new opportunities for growth of marine-based industries.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The honourable Senator is referred to the answer to part 1.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The project to which the honourable Senator refers is called the CSIRO Climate Change Research Program. The aim of the project is to combine data collection on ocean, sea ice and terrestrial environments with the development of numerical climate change models. The project makes an important international contribution to climate modelling because of its data collection on the Southern Hemisphere and Oceans. As the main developed country in this part of the world, Australia is in a unique position to contribute and I am very pleased that the CSIRO is doing this.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(4) Any changes that the Government might consider to the CSIRO marine divisions, including the Division of Oceanography, will ensure that necessary arrangements are in place to ensure that existing contracts and other such obligations are fully met. Indeed, the Government's consideration of current arrangements for marine science are driven by a desire to ensure that its broad client needs are properly met now and in the future.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> One of the objectives of the Aboriginal Employment Development Policy is to widen the spread of occupations and industries in which Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people are employed, in recognition of the fact that much Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander employment is in relatively low paid jobs that require low levels of skill. One means of achieving this is through assisting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people to acquire employment of high status and wages and thus provide role models for other members of their communities.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Nevertheless, I consider it important that there can be no reasonable grounds for concluding that an officer of the Department has been treated more favourably under the program than people who are not officers of the Department but whose circumstances otherwise are similar. The TAP guidelines are currently under review. It is intended that TAP will continue to be available to employed persons who need assistance to progress to more highly skilled employment or to another occupation or industry and who cannot be assisted through other programs or services, including assistance that would normally be provided by the employer. The Australian Public Service Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Recruitment and Career Development Strategy should provide adequate training opportunities for people to advance through the public service. However, TAP may be available for public servants who require it to move to other employment. Henceforth, it is proposed that only Senior Executives may approve the provision of this assistance in cases where officers of the Department apply for TAP assistance other than through the APS Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Recruitment and Career Development Strategy.</PARA>
