<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="BH4">Senator HILL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to Senator Schacht who, I think, regards himself as the minister for organising Labor's electoral support in South Australia. I refer the minister to his threat to withdraw federal funding from the multifunction polis if the Liberals won the election in South Australia. In view of the overwhelming endorsement of Dean Brown and his team, does the minister still stand by that threat? Has the minister communicated to the Prime Minister, Mr Keating, the extent to which Labor's election lies, the fuel tax and the wine tax contributed to the Liberals' consolidating their support in South Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4379" SPEAKER="Schacht Sen The Hon C.C." NAMEID="4J4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="SCIENCE AND SMALL BUSINESS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was hoping I would get this question. With regard to my electoral record in South Australia, I point out that during my nearly 8 1/2 years as party secretary I never lost a Labor-held state or federal seat. Senator Minchin, who was then the party secretary of the Liberal Party, would acknowledge that I won every contest in South Australia when I was secretary. I never lost. I gave the Liberal Party more than a fair belting around the head.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everyone acknowledges, and I certainly do, that the number one issue regarding the South Australian election was a state issue&mdash;the State Bank. The electorate made its judgment accordingly. There can be no excuse by the Labor Party. The State Bank collapse and the $3 billion bail out was the number one issue at the election.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said before and I say again that the MFP is an international project. If Mr Brown and the Liberal Party in government wish to turn it into a limited technology park venture, without its international or national connections, it will then change the whole scope of the MFP and the basis on which the federal government has contributed money.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The money is contributed to the MFP in two ways. It is contributed under the better cities program. That program is under negotiation. The matter has been raised that the better cities money is part of the proportion allocated to the states. It is argued that that money could be redirected elsewhere under negotiation. The other specific allocation of money is by the federal government to the administration of the MFP because it is an international project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I emphasise again to Senator Hill that he should talk to his colleague in South Australia Mr Brown and point out to him that the MFP is an international and national project, not a local government technology park. I think if he understands that he will understand why the federal government is supporting the development of the MFP, which is a long term project.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Hill raised other issues about the state election campaign purely to try to get some comfort from the election win. People baying on the other side want that comfort because they realise that had they adopted similar tactics in the March election campaign, they would not be sitting on the other side. It was their stupidity that lost the unlosable election. I think Dean Brown made some adjustment to his policies to ensure that he could capitalise on the State Bank debacle in South Australia. All in all, the election victory for the Liberal Party in South Australia is of no comfort to the Liberal Party here. It was the monumental political incompetence of those opposite that cost them the election in March this year. That is why we are still sitting on this side and those opposite are still sitting on the other side after 13 years.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FY5">Senator DENMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Tourism. I understand that the latest figures from the Bureau of Statistics show that there has been a significant increase in international visitor arrivals to Australia. Is the minister aware of these figures and is he able to provide any further information on international visitor arrivals to Australia?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4380" SPEAKER="Schacht Sen The Hon C.C." NAMEID="4J4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="SCIENCE AND SMALL BUSINESS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is good news for the development of the tourist industry and for the economy in Australia. Of course, members opposite may not want to hear it because they always try to ignore the very good recent economic news. I am aware of the Bureau of Statistics figures on visitor arrivals. They confirm that the Australian tourism industry continues to attract increasing numbers of international tourists.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Overseas arrivals for September, a traditionally slow month for international tourism to Australia, were at a record high of 224,000. That represents an 18 per cent increase, compared with September 1992. For the first nine months of 1993 international tourist arrivals increased by 16 per cent compared with the same period in 1992. It is also significant that our embassies and consulates, especially those in the Asian region, have reported an increased level of visa issuances over the past few months. Airlines are experiencing high levels of demand for travel to Australia in December. All the indications are that in 1993 we will break the three million barrier for international visitor arrivals.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another pleasing aspect of the increased growth in international tourism is the increasing numbers from both established and new markets. This increased diversification is highlighted by a 75 per cent increase in arrivals from Taiwan, a 71 per cent increase from Korea and a 51 per cent increase from Indonesia. Also, despite the downturn in the Japanese economy, the Japanese market has continued to grow. In fact, while the outbound tourism from Japan has decreased in 1993, the number of Japanese tourists visiting Australia has grown by six per cent and Japan continues to be our largest single market, followed by New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the USA.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1995 the Australian Tourist Commission anticipates 3.8 million international tourists to visit Australia, and this figure is expected to grow to 6.8 million by the year 2000. Of course, we expect the successful bid for the Olympic Games in Sydney in 2000 to further enhance the number of visitors coming. With that in mind, both the government and the industry are already planning on how best to capitalise on this exposure. We need to ensure that we maximise the numbers of international tourists not only in the year 2000, but also in the years leading up to that. This is one more example of where the government, in partnership with industry&mdash;and we emphasise that it is in partnership with industry&mdash;is building more strength into the Australian economy and providing opportunities for new employment growth. The industry is to be congratulated for its efforts to make the tourist industry one of the real success stories in the Australian economy.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YE4">Senator BOSWELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development. I refer the minister to the proposed Mackay joint venture sugar refinery which would have moved Australia into the expanding $5 billion a year refined sugar export market for the first time, and which the Trade Practices Commission refused to authorise. I refer also to support for entry into the refined sugar export market from the Industry Commission, support for the project from Kelloggs, ABARE and the Prices Surveillance Authority, strong support for the project from the Queensland government and the Department of Primary Industry and support from the government's own Department of Industry, Technology and Regional Development. Like its own departments and agencies and Labor state government, does the government also support the joint venture going ahead? If so, what does it intend to do to ensure that it does proceed?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4380" SPEAKER="Schacht Sen The Hon C.C." NAMEID="4J4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA" MINISTERIAL="SCIENCE AND SMALL BUSINESS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4J4">Senator SCHACHT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Boswell has been well noted for his interest in small business issues in this parliament, particularly the role of the Trade Practices Commission. In the past he has insisted on the Trade Practices Commission taking action to ensure that competition is allowed and that small business gets a fair share. He has often asked the TPC to be pro-active in intervening in that way against monopoly activities. Therefore, it was with some surprise initially that I heard that he supported this merger taking place and that he is now criticising the TPC decision. He has made these representations to me on a number of occasions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although part of this matter is dealt with by my colleague the Treasurer and the Assistant Treasurer, represented by Senator McMullan, it is true that there are industry aspects about this that are important. It is true that the Department of Industry, Technology and Regional Development closely considered the joint venture, for which applicants sought approval from the TPC. The department concluded that the application was likely to result in: firstly, a significant increase in real value of exports; secondly, the fostering of business efficiency; and, thirdly, rationalisation resulting in more efficient allocation of resources. My department made it quite clear that  it  saw  a number  of  merits  in  the proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On 8 December the TPC&mdash;which, of course, is an independent statutory authority&mdash;released its final determination rejecting CSR's application for authorisation of a joint venture involving other sugar refineries. The TPC found&mdash;and I summarise&mdash;that CSR's involvement in the project was likely to, firstly, substantially lessen competition which would otherwise arise from the presence of new competitors. Secondly, enhanced exports would constitute a public benefit, but this benefit was not attributable to the proposed joint venture. It found that enhanced sugar exports are likely to occur with or without the joint venture. Thirdly, it found that the benefits of rationalisation were not likely to flow through to the public. Fourthly, there were not sufficient public benefits to outweigh the anti-competitive detriments, and for this reason the TPC refused that application for authorisation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As you can see, Mr President, the advice from my own department, when it considered this matter, made a number of positive points. The TPC obviously took that and other information on hand and it came down against the proposal. I emphasise also that the TPC is the government's independent competition expert and it would be inappropriate for the government to interfere with its administrative proceedings. While the government has power to direct the TPC to place special emphasis on particular matters, it cannot direct the TPC to come to a particular decision in authorisation proceedings relating to individual cases. The joint applicants are able to lodge an appeal from the TPC's decision with the trade practices tribunal within 21 days of the determination. That tribunal will be able to independently assess the decision of the TPC and that is the proper and legal process to go through. It is up to the participants, particularly CSR, to determine whether they wish to take that choice.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the minister for his answer, in which he quoted extensively from the TPC report. I advise him that I can read the TPC report as well as he can. My question was: does his government support the amalgamation? If it does&mdash;I would suspect it does because everyone else does, including CSR, the sugar industry, the milling industry, the Queensland government and, I suspect, most people&mdash;what does it intend to do about it?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought I had clearly indicated DITARD's response. As minister for the department, I can state that our view is that there were a number of positive things about the merger for the future of the industry. However, I emphasise that the TPC is an independent body and I would imagine that some members opposite would be the first to scream if the government interfered in the independent processes of the TPC, so we are damned if we do and we are damned if we don't. However, because of Senator Boswell's consistent interest in this issue, I will have further discussions with my colleagues&mdash;the Treasurer and the Assistant Treasurer&mdash;and come back with a further response, but I emphasise that the company does have the right to appeal.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NE4">Senator BEAHAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and refers to the progress towards democracy in South Africa. How significant are recent political events for the transition to a non-racial democracy in South Africa&mdash;events which have seen the establishment of the Transitional Executive Council on 7 December, and a decision by the multi-party negotiators to bring the apartheid homelands system to an end? Secondly, what assistance will Australia provide to elections in South Africa? Will Australia join other members of the international community in observing the country's first non-racial elections in April next year?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is important to state for the record&mdash;we were a bit distracted from doing so last week by other things&mdash;how warmly Australia welcomes the establishment on 7 December of the Transitional Executive Council which, for the first time in South Africa's history, does acknowledge the role of all South Africans, regardless of race, in the government of the country. The TEC will work alongside the South African government to, in effect, level the playing field in the lead-up to the elections next year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Three days after the establishment of the TEC, we saw the Nobel Peace Prize conferred upon President Frederik de Klerk and the President of the ANC, Nelson Mandela. Again, I think it is appropriate to congratulate those two on the crucial personal and political commitment they put into the negotiation process, which has produced these results.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The successful outcome of the negotiations was a remarkable achievement and a great tribute to all those South Africans who have committed themselves to a peaceful democratic ending to apartheid. We had already welcomed the agreement of an interim constitution, which is now expected to pass into law during the current session of parliament. Provision in the constitution for the repeal of the legislation establishing the so-called homelands is especially significant in this respect and, when this happens, one of the really crucial last vestiges of the apartheid system will have been swept away.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We hope very much that the various conservative parties which have boycotted the multi-party talks in recent times&mdash;including the white right wing groups, the Inkatha Freedom Party and some of the homeland governments&mdash;continue their talks with the ruling national party and the ANC. We hope, furthermore, that they will join the majority of South Africans in supporting that transition to democratic elections and the new post-apartheid government, and will end any threats of secession and violence. I hope that a number of those opposite who, over the years, have given strong support to Chief Buthelezi will exercise whatever residual influence they might possess in this respect to encourage Chief Buthelezi and the IFP to now participate in these talks and not to persist with the rather extraordinary liaison in which he has recently been engaged with the extreme right wing white parties.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the Australian government is committed to doing everything we can to help the transition to democracy through the coming critical months. We joined other Commonwealth countries at the heads of government meeting in Cyprus on 25 October in reaffirming support for the elections next April. We will contribute towards a Commonwealth group to monitor those elections. We also stand ready to provide technical assistance to the electoral process. We are also continuing our participation in COMSA&mdash;the Commonwealth observer mission to South Africa&mdash;which is working with UN and other international observers and with members of the South African peace accord to try to help bring an end to violence. We would expect to maintain our participation in COMSA until after the elections in South Africa.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister for Health and relates to his package of health reforms. I acknowledge that he has consulted with a number of individuals about his plans but, given the considerable concern about his proposals now being expressed by almost every health related organisation in the country, does he believe that he has an obligation to consult far more widely and fully before putting these proposals to cabinet?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4E4">Senator RICHARDSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No. I have consulted pretty widely. When one seeks to bring about any major reform package it is not at all unusual for community groups to react, particularly when they see anything that is traditional under threat. In two areas of the package that has certainly been the case. One was the levy proposal, which, as has already been announced, will be referred to a working party between the caucus of the Labor Party and the ACTU to discuss over the course of the next few months. That is quite sensible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second area is that part of the package which refers to allowing a gap for the medical cost and then making sure there is only one fee and effectively, therefore, putting a cap on surgeons' fees. While I know that is different because there is a gap involved&mdash;and that will obviously upset some people&mdash;the truth is that when ACOSS and ACA find themselves lined up with the AMA and the surgeons they should wake up that they are on the wrong tram.</PARA>

Is it a fact that a United States geological and geophysical research station has been operating at Alice Springs under an agreement signed in 1954?  Is it also a fact that this facility was converted to so-called joint status in 1978?

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="OF4">Senator COLLINS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The entire purpose of the government's reform program&mdash;and it has succeeded in doing it&mdash;is to get this industry into the same situation as every other industry in Australia, and that is where employers and employees are not having their hands held by the government every five minutes in a national labour pool with the government inextricably involved in the relationships in this industry. The whole purpose of that reform exercise was to put this industry in a situation where the employers and the employees work out their arrangements themselves.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The article goes on to acknowledge something that Senator Panizza has not acknowledged, and that is that the federal government's waterfront reform program has brought about a fundamental structural change in the Australian stevedoring industry to make that industry subject to the same employment arrangements as other Australian industries. This has brought about, as the article acknowledges, direct productivity and efficiency benefits, but it has also brought about, as I have acknowledged here in the Senate on many occasions, the need for those parties to reassess their commercial and industrial practices and relationships. That industry has been operating for almost half a century under these outmoded arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> As I have told this Senate before, when the formal period of waterfront reform had concluded&mdash;which it did about a year ago&mdash;and when the enterprise agreements that were put into place under those formalised arrangements under a structured government program had concluded, there would be a period of time when the first enterprise agreements were negotiated party to party and these sorts of strains would be evident, and indeed they have been. For the first time ever the government has provided for this industry the basis of a strongly competitive environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since the completion of the program in October 1992, these competitive pressures have directly resulted in the merger of two stevedoring companies into Australian Stevedores in order to provide a stronger and more commercially viable competitor to Conaust, additional changes to waterfront work practices, and further changes&mdash;downwards&mdash;to waterfront employment levels. Both employers and employees are now adapting to this changed commercial and industrial environment.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It should be noted that over the past 12 months the changes have been negotiated with relatively little disruption to stevedoring operations. I might add that these changes have brought about pressures, because the amalgamation that I have just referred to resulted in the need for significant additional redundancies. At the end of the formalised process we had removed from the Australian stevedoring work force almost six out of 10 employees. In addition to the loss of those workers to the industry, the recent merger of the companies to form Australian Stevedores resulted in a further number of redundancies that totalled almost 250 at the last count that I saw.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These changes have brought about pressures, but the pressures are necessary for the further reform of the Australian waterfront. I am confident that the competitive arrangements that this government has put into place will continue to provide for further improvements and enhancements and further competition in the Australian waterfront industry.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is addressed to the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services. I understand that the Australian Bureau of Statistics released figures today about the number of people who worked in cultural and leisure activities in the 12 months ending March 1993. What do these figures show about the size and scope of cultural industries within Australia? Do they confirm the government's view about the economic worth of cultural industries and their importance as a key source of employment opportunities?</PARA></TALK.START>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="4384" SPEAKER="McMullan Sen The Hon R.F." NAMEID="5I4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="ACT" MINISTERIAL="ARTS AND ADMINISTRATIVE SERVICES" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="5I4">Senator McMULLAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;What we have had released today is probably the most important set of statistical data about cultural industries in Australia. It should make very interesting reading for those people in this place who from time to time when the arts are discussed say, `What about the concern of working people?' I have been spending some effort during the course of this year in seeking to persuade Australians, my colleagues and the Senate that this is an important industry and that it creates a lot of jobs. But I have to confess that I substantially underestimated the amount of employment and the amount of community activity in this area.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most significant factor to which the ABS draws attention is that during the past 12 months 1.6 million people&mdash;that is, 11.8 per cent of the population&mdash;over 15 years of age were involved in work in culture and leisure activities. On top of this, another one million people saw their involvement in culture and leisure activities as a hobby. These figures are very large, but when one breaks them down what one needs to look at is the number of people actually in paid employment in this area because many of those people are working in a voluntary capacity.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What really struck me when I read the figures today was that more than 550,000 Australians are in paid employment, full-time or part-time, in cultural and leisure activities such as heritage, museums, literature, library, archives, music, performing arts, visual arts, film, video, radio, TV, education, festival and arts administration.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, in that narrow definition of `arts and cultural and leisure activities', there are more than 550,000 people who are receiving payment for their participation, with more than 100,000 of them in full-time employment in those industries. The fact that more than two million Australians are giving a substantial amount of their time to these activities shows not only the enormous size of the voluntary sector but also that the figures we have used in the past, drawn from more general population statistics, greatly underestimate the scope of employment opportunities in the arts. These new figures certainly confirm the government's view about the economic worth of cultural industries and their importance as a source of employment in the economy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the nature of employment changes and with the growth in employment that is under way in the economy at the moment, these will be important industries in the development of employment, and they will create very important job opportunities for the tens of thousands of young Australians training in this area in tertiary institutions around Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are, of course, a large number of other people involved significantly in arts activities who are not measured here.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Last week a very important conference was held in Australia. It was the OECD world conference on small and medium size enterprises and job creation. It is the first time such a conference dealing with these issues has been held outside the OECD headquarters in Paris. Australia was selected in recognition of the efforts being made by Australian governments, both state and federal, to promote small business.</PARA></TALK.START>

This compares with the 50-minute disaster she made recently at the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian Business Monthly</EMPHASIS> awards where she sent people to sleep with her long, tedious, ideological statements.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the conference a wide range of issues and problems were discussed. We discussed the unacceptably high level of unemployment within the OECD, which is at the moment around 36 million people. The points also discussed included the need for venture capital and the need to constantly encourage development of an entrepreneurial culture. Within those discussions what became very clear and what I was pleased to hear from the many foreign guests present was that they believe that Australian governments, both state and federal&mdash;this is not just a partisan comment I am making&mdash;and the private sector rank equally with what is going on in the world in the development of small and medium size enterprises. In a number of areas they believe that Australia is ahead of the development in other parts of the world. This includes the things we are doing in Australia to assist small and medium size enterprises to become export oriented, encouraging women into small business and encouraging technology and innovation amongst small businesses.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They also commented on the way Australia deals with the No. 1 one issue which has been raised in Australia and overseas and that is the need for investment capital for small business, whether it be overdrafts from banks, development capital, venture capital or seeding capital for small and medium size enterprises. This was the No. 1 issue discussed.

<TITLE>US Nuclear Testing</TITLE>
<ANSWER PAGE="4392" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="VIC" MINISTERIAL="FOREIGN AFFAIRS" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In answer to a question from Senator Bourne on 9 December, I said that I would keep the Senate informed as further information came to hand on the issue of previously undisclosed United States nuclear tests over the past 50 years. I also have some answers to the questions raised today by Senator Margetts on the same subject. I now table, as I foreshadowed last week that I would, the following documents: first, several official fact sheets of the United States Department of Energy released in Washington on 10 December concerning US unannounced tests, pre-1961 Pacific tests, national archives and records administration declassified records, and an FOI act request regarding classified programs; secondly, a list of US nuclear explosions extracted from the Australian Geological Survey Organisation's database on nuclear explosions; and, thirdly, AGSO's quarterly reports on underground nuclear tests for the period 1 January 1987 to 30 September 1993.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">According to the US documents to which I have referred, the US government did not inform Australia, or other countries for that matter, of 204 nuclear tests&mdash;not 250 tests, as has been suggested in media reports. Through routine seismological data exchanges, including with the US seismological network, the Australian Geological Survey Organisation, AGSO, was aware of 116 of those undisclosed tests, although data about the remainder is still unavailable in Australia. Of those 116, 49 were conducted between 1962 and 1969; 56 between 1970 and 1979; 10 in the 1980s; and one in 1990.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The US authorities have confirmed that the US has conducted no tests in the Pacific since 1962. All the tests in the Pacific that were conducted before that date were announced. They took place at Enewitok between 1948 and 1958, on Johnston Island in 1958 and 1962, on Christmas Island in 1962 and on Bikini Island between 1946 and 1958. It is clear that, in referring to the unannounced tests, Energy Secretary O'Leary was disclosing only underground nuclear tests which had been conducted in the continental United States. Moreover, although some of these tests were undoubtedly detected by seismic arrays elsewhere, they were not identified by the Australian seismic network as nuclear tests, essentially because they were all small in size&mdash;less than 20 kilotons.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the organisations in Australia which detect these things, in 1986 the Australian government established in AGSO a nuclear monitoring group which, through its own seismic monitoring network and through its exchanges with other such networks, maintains a database on nuclear testing activity. This work has been carried out in preparation for global verification under a comprehensive test ban treaty, when in due course that is negotiated, and reflects the high priority that Australia places on the conclusion of such a treaty.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the United States station in Alice Springs, about which Senator Margetts asked, the situation is as follows: the US Geological and Geophysical Research Station has been operating at Alice Springs under an agreement signed in 1954. It is run by the US Air Force technical applications centre and I understand that there are no Australian personnel at the station. Australia has been receiving a complete set of raw data from this US station since 1978. Until 1986 it was transmitted to the ANU's Research School of Earth Sciences and from 1986 the data has been transmitted to AGSO. Since coming on stream in 1986, AGSO, through its own arrays or through information supplied from the US station in Alice Springs, has not, as I have said, detected any unannounced nuclear explosions, essentially for the reason that I have mentioned, that they are all so small in size. Taking place as they did at that distance in the continental US, the Australian networks or arrays by themselves were simply unable to pick them up.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, seismic monitoring is an inexact science when it comes to differentiating between low level nuclear tests and natural seismic activity. It is, therefore, particularly important, in order to refine verification procedures for a future test ban treaty, to know precisely what past tests have been conducted and when. It was for this reason that the answer given to Senator Bourne in the Senate last week registered Australia's disappointment at the US failure to disclose approximately one-fifth of the tests conducted. Nevertheless, we continue to welcome the new US openness in respect of these tests, data about which should enable seismologists to re-evaluate the information&mdash;they already have&mdash;and thus assist in the complex process of elaborating verification measures for a CTBT. The US has also foreshadowed the release of more data on its nuclear weapons program and we look forward to that release as a further contribution to enhancing the nuclear disarmament process.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Health (Senator Richardson), to a question without notice asked by Senator Lees this day, relating to health insurance.</PARA>
<PARA>I was fascinated to hear Senator Richardson's response to Senator Lees because he is in a fascinating position at the moment. He has fallen out with ACOSS, the Consumers Health Forum, the Australian Council on the Ageing, the Public Health Association, Dr Deeble, one of the developers of Medicare, the ACTU and, incidentally, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), of all people. I listened to Question Time in the House of Representatives this afternoon. The Prime Minister attacked the coalition, saying that the coalition was pulling away at the entrails of Medicare. How better could one describe what Senator Richardson is doing at the moment&mdash;pulling away at the entrails of Medicare?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the first time Senator Richardson has admitted that after 10 years Medicare has failed. Why else is he trying to promote private health insurance? At last he has seen the light. He spent nine months finding out what is going on with Medicare. He has been told, quite rightly, that people are dropping out of private medical insurance at a fast rate&mdash;two per cent a year. They cannot afford private insurance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister said today&mdash;this is where Senator Richardson has a great education program ahead of him&mdash;that they were dropping out of private insurance and leaving the private health care system to go to the public system because Medicare was working so well. There are 100,000 people on waiting lists around the country, as acknowledged by Senator Richardson, trying to get into hospitals. They cannot get in. But it is working so well, according to the Prime Minister, that they are leaving private insurance to go to the public system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like the Prime Minister to explain why 20,000 people in Queensland took out private insurance last year. Overall in Australia 72,000 dropped out of private insurance but 20,000 in Queensland took it out. If the public hospital system is working so well in Queensland, why are they privately insuring? He cannot have it both ways. The only group that I can see that Senator Richardson has on side for his proposals is the Australian Health Insurance Association. As I mentioned before, the director, Mr Russell Schneider, is supporting them. The only reason that it is supporting Senator Richardson is that the big health insurance associations will get bigger while the smaller ones will get smaller&mdash;or will disappear and be amalgamated. That is where he is getting that support. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out to the Australian Health Insurance Association that it had better watch out for the three-card trick. The first card is to reduce the number of health insurance associations from their current 38 to fewer than 20, which is what Senator Richardson is proposing. The next proposal is to have one large insurer in each state, as well as Medicare Private. The third card is to have one national insurer. The left wing of the Labor Party will love that. It is a three-step process: the first step is to reduce the number of health insurance associations from 38 to fewer than 20; the next step is to have one major insurer in each state, plus Medibank Private; and the third step is to nationalise the lot. Senator Richardson has parts of the Australian Private Hospitals Association in favour of his proposals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fundamental thing that Senator Richardson cannot see&mdash;I have told him this personally&mdash;is that he is going to bring in, between the patients or people who get sick and the doctor who is treating them, a private hospital in agreement with the Health Insurance Association. So, when one gets sick, one would not go to one's doctor; rather one would go to a private hospital and the Health Insurance Association and say, `How much money can I have to be treated with?'. When one is told what sort of money, one can go to the doctor, and the doctor has to have a contract with the private hospital to determine how much will be spent on him or her. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the preferred provider organisations system as in the US. It did not work there but we should look at what it did. Those hospitals would only take in patients who would not be there very long. They would race them through for that amount of money to get them out as fast as they could because they would lose money if they kept them any longer. This is what Senator Richardson is proposing. No wonder the Prime Minister is opposing him, no wonder Dr Deeble is opposing him and no wonder the ACTU is opposing him. He is obviously in an intolerable position because if he does get rolled on this, he has to resign. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>Happily, this document before us is the first annual report of the Australia-India Council. I congratulate all the members of the council, including the chairman, my friend Graham Feakes, former High Commissioner for Australia in India, on the council's work in its first year. As is acknowledged at the beginning of the report, the council was established following the recommendation of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade that there be such a council to promote knowledge of Australia in India and knowledge of India in Australia in a way that is economically to the benefit of our peoples. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note on page 3 of the report that in its first year the council has had three priorities&mdash;three very introductory and broad priorities: firstly, to put the council on the map, both in Australia and in India, to see that there is a council in place and ready to respond to good ideas from within each country, especially Australia; secondly, to put India on the map in Australia; and, thirdly, to inform Australians and Indians interested in the bilateral relationship of key developments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In an appendix there is set out, with dollar amounts, a whole range of activities the council has undertaken this year. I acknowledge, as the council does, that a number of these will bear fruit in the subsequent year and maybe even in a longer time frame. In fact, I commend the council for taking a long-term view and for trying to assess projects to be supported which will have an enduring positive effect on the relationship between our two countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite an important observation to make that where 70 per cent of Australia's trade is with that part of Asia encompassing the countries that make up the Asia-Pacific economic consultation process, APEC, it is possible for Australians not to give enough attention to south Asia and to India, in particular. It is so vital that we have a close relationship and a good understanding with Japan, China, the Philippines and the other ASEAN members&mdash;Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, Brunei&mdash;and the other tigers, Korea, Taiwan and Hong Kong, that we put so much effort into this strategic area of priority for Australia and forget that the relationship with south Asia is important as well, all in its proper perspective. Therefore, I welcome the existence of the council and commend it on the work that it has done as set out in the order constituting the Australia-India Council, which is included in this brief report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I particularly want to refer to the development of a directory of institutional and other links between Australia and India. I look forward to seeing this directory in due course. I hope it will include the Australia-India parliamentary friendship group within this parliament; the names of the members of the group; and also some reference to those Australian senators who wrote the original Senate report and who have, as I do, a continuing interest in developing the Australia-India relationship, not just with India but also with the other countries of south Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also refer to the director of the secretariat of the council, Mr Ian Wille. I think he is a former counsellor of the Australian High Commission in New Delhi&mdash;a long serving diplomat of Australia who has now taken on this dedicated job to be based in Canberra but available for all the activities of the Australia-India Council. I am impressed with his dedication to the work of the council and I commend him for the first year of the council's operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has probably not gone beyond the notice of most senators that the captain of the Australian cricket team, Allan Border, is a member of this council. I am very pleased to have been amongst those who first nominated that he be there because one of the languages common to Australia and India is not just English but, of course, cricket. I wish him and all the other members of the council real success in the second year of the council's operations. </PARA>

<PARA>In the couple of minutes that I have had to look at this official report of the department, I have noticed two fairly glaring errors. On page 80 a photograph clearly shows Mr David Simmons MP, a federal member of this parliament and the former minister for local government in the federal parliament, and refers to him as the New South Wales minister for local government. It seems quite incredible that in its annual report the department cannot even remember a couple of months ago to a time when Mr Simmons was one of the ministers of that super department. There is no doubt about it; in the ALP when you are finished you are really finished. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YW4">Senator IAN MACDONALD</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I take Senator Kemp's interjection. But perhaps I should say, by way of acknowledgment&mdash;it seems that no one in the Labor Party will acknowledge it&mdash;that Mr Simmons did in fact have an understanding of local government, being a local government representative himself before coming into the federal parliament, and he was certainly sincere in his desire to assist in local government and had a real understanding of it. I suspect that I would not be on record as saying the same about the current minister.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other curious thing about this report that came to my attention is that at around page 200 the department very dutifully lists the press releases by the various ministers with responsibility for this department. It has a list of all the media releases by Mr Howe; Senator Richardson; Senator Crowley; Mr Johns, the parliamentary secretary; and even the former minister, Mr Simmons. It goes through and lists all Mr Simmons's press releases, but, curiously, it left out the one which was issued by Mr Simmons on 2 July 1992&mdash;so it should have been right at the top of the list&mdash;entitled `Local government elected members exempt from super levy'. One might remember why it forgot to put that one in. That press release was Mr Simmons's promise on behalf of the Labor Party that local government members would be looked after when it came to exempting them from superannuation contributions on allowances&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is another broken promise. Mr Simmons promised it. I think he promised it in good faith. The government, of course, has done nothing about it, in spite of the fact that I have introduced and the Senate has passed a bill that will do exactly what Mr Simmons promised to do in his press release. The Labor Party still has not picked that up in the lower house. It seems intent on ignoring it and ignoring Mr Simmons's commitment to local government before the election.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Local capital works does feature significantly in the report by the Office of Local Government in this portfolio. It is a program that I agree did show very clearly that local government and Commonwealth government could get together and very quickly deliver a program. My concern about that program always has been that only 400-odd councils out of Australia's 917 local authorities received any support from that project. There have been suggestions that it was distributed on a formula which did favour the Labor Party in the run-up to the federal election. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;The first reference that the report makes, quite properly, is to activities of the Department of Defence in relation to peacekeeping throughout the last 12 months. It was my privilege to visit the Australian Defence Force contingents in Cambodia twice in the last 14 months and also to visit the contingent in Somalia. The distinction with which the Australian Defence Force carried out its duties in both those peacekeeping operations was exemplary. The report does note that it was the biggest overseas deployment of Australian troops since Vietnam, but it does not go on to say too much about the significance of that. Coping with those numbers overseas certainly placed quite a strain on the Australian Defence Force, given the poor resources that it has at present.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Without being unkind to the government in any way, I point out that peacekeeping operations are just about the only operations of an operational nature that the Australian Defence Force can now perform. We have had a considerable reduction in numbers as part of the force structure review and a definite diminution of the capability of the Australian Defence Force. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have been worried for many years about the total lack of sustainability. There is not a word about sustainability in this report, as I see it, from a very quick look. In plain terms, that means that if we have to use the Australian defence forces on armed operations, which is why we retain them, at a cost of over $9 billion, the sustainability simply is not there. There are not the reserves of ammunition and equipment that we need to sustain the Australian defence forces on active service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The nature of operations has changed so much in the last 30 years that the availability at short notice of things such as precision guided munitions and missiles simply does not exist. We have to have an in-house inventory within the country to give us any security and, therefore, to give any credibility at all to our defence forces. Furthermore, unless we have them in the country and train with them, we are certainly not going to be able to use them effectively on the first occasion. Sustainability is absolutely the dominant issue that faces the Australian Defence Force. From what I can see, there is not a word in this document, which is the major statement of the department for the year, which deals with that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another great glaring defect, which gets scant treatment in this report, is our weakness in electronic warfare capability. As I have said in the Senate many times, we have to be in the position where we can dominate the electromagnetic spectrum. All communications and a large number of sensors operate in the electromagnetic spectrum. We put some money into it, but we do not put anywhere near the amount of money into it that we need to, particularly for research through the Defence Science and Technology Organisation. Again, it is something that we cannot do overnight. If we have an emergency, we simply cannot acquire these skills from overseas and we cannot perform the research in a crash program, and we cannot get the equipment we need into production within any sort of meaningful time frame. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third great area that seems to be missing in this report is any reflection and comment on the morale in the Australian defence forces, which is now at a very low level. Part of that comes from the fact that the government seems to have no defence policy at all. People in the defence forces feel abused, in so far as no-one appreciates them, no-one can tell them what they are there for, they are short of money for equipment, they are short of money for training, they are short of money for operations, and it all seems very pointless. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Added to that, the ready reserve scheme, which is showing all the signs of a total failure, has had a catastrophic effect on the morale of the army. Arguably its best brigade&mdash;6th Brigade in Brisbane, along with 8/9 Battalion, 6th Battalion and 49th Battalion&mdash;has been disbanded and replaced with the ready reserve scheme. We have had a spate of resignations or redundancies forced on the defence forces through the commercial support program, which again has operated very much against morale. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Added to that, a whole lot of unfortunate legislation is being put through, such as the fringe benefits tax for conditions of service, which has completely demoralised the defence forces. Those subjects that I have mentioned are very much part of the accounting that the department should do when presenting its annual report to the parliament, but it either avoids comment on them altogether or skates over them very lightly. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>This annual report reports on a disastrous year for Australia's most important primary industry. Out of this terrible year came the Garnaut recommendations that have been fully aired in this Senate. Last week the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) made the board appointments to the two new industry structures that arose from the Garnaut report&mdash;the Australian Wool Research and Promotion Organisation, AWRAP, and Wool International. These appointments have received a mixed reaction from the industry and from the opposition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The appointment of Mac Drysdale as chairman of AWRAP has been universally accepted as essential for continuity and his depth of knowledge, which is invaluable. The appointment of Charlie Massey, a grower from Cooma, gives me a great deal of pleasure. I have known him for many years. He is innovative with both his management and plans for the future of wool and he is committed to the future marketing of wool correctly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other appointments to AWRAP are encouraging, with the exception of Mr Jack Hallam. I cannot see why Minister Crean keeps appointing this relic of the Wran government in New South Wales to anything. He was first appointed to the AQIS advisory council and now he has been appointed to AWRAP. It very much has a ring of `jobs for the boys' about it. The only encouraging thing may be that even more people will realise that Mr Hallam has risen far beyond his level of competency, but that, unfortunately, will not help the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The appointment of Mr Dick Warburton as chairman of Wool International has raised a few eyebrows, not that this reaction reflects on Mr Warburton's credentials as a leading and capable businessman; it is just his existing role of chairman and chief executive of Du Pont Australia&mdash;the maker of synthetic fibres which are in direct competition with wool. This introduces the prospect of a conflict of interest, which will be a real concern to the wool industry. Mr Warburton was on the selection committee and now finds himself chairman. While the appointment of the chairman is solely within the power of the minister, it is all a little cosy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Crean knows full well that many European processors are openly sceptical of Wool International. It is therefore critical to win their confidence and support for the new board. The appointment of Mr Warburton may make this task a little more difficult. Both the minister and Mr Warburton will need to move immediately to convince the industry that there will be no conflicts of interest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister, along with the rest of the Labor government, has no idea how important confidence, faith and goodwill will be in rebuilding the wool industry. In times past in the wool industry, your word was your bond. It is essential that that situation be returned to for the benefit of the wool trade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every step must be taken to assure the trade that Wool International is above reproach and that the commercial secrets of the wool industry will not be discussed around the boardroom tables of its competitors. I know that I speak for every woolgrower, however, when I wish Mr Warburton well in his new role. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is the second last annual report of AWIC. It will formally report for 1993-94 but not after that time. Time has moved on. The wool industry now goes forward under new structures. Above all, I am hopeful of a more sustainable market for the survival of growers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A lot of criticism has been directed at both the Australian Wool Corporation over the past four years and the Australian Wool Realisation Commission, which has operated for the past two or three years. There are some very capable and decent people in those two organisations who have a great knowledge of the industry and a great commitment to its future. Some of them will stay in the industry and some will leave. To those who stay and play their part in the new structures, I wish them well. </PARA>

<PARA>This is the first annual report of ANTA. For the past 18 months, it has been in a transitional period whilst the secretariat establishes itself in Brisbane, Queensland, as a national focus for setting out advice and a draft plan for vocational education and training. ANTA will operate in full flight from 1 January next year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had debates on the formation of ANTA. It is based upon legislation that was passed in the federal parliament and legislation that will be passed in some states which is parallel with the national legislation. Today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Notice Paper</EMPHASIS> lists some amendments to the ANTA legislation that the government is proposing. That debate will take place later today or early tomorrow morning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note in response to this first annual report my confidence in the chairman of ANTA, Brian Finn, who is the managing director of IBM Australia. He has taken a careful interest in vocational education and training for many years. Indeed, because of his research and writing of reports, he has become a national authority on the subject. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also have confidence in the chief executive officer, Mr Terry Moran, who was formerly the chief executive officer of the Office of Training and Further Education in Victoria. He is a man who, I have noted in the past, has been given a salary by the Commonwealth parliament that is greater than the Prime Minister's salary. I have high expectations of Mr Moran. I still have to meet him. I am looking forward to the chance to meet him as soon as appropriate after 1 January when he comes around to the states and territories to meet with those of us who are directly interested in vocational education and training policy. As honourable senators know, ANTA is principally interested in national policy for what we know as TAFE colleges. The operations of TAFE colleges are still the responsibility of state ministers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I will make has been noted by a number of honourable senators in debates about ANTA, and it will continue later today. I wish to express a scepticism, and I hope it is a healthy scepticism. I state it again now to give encouragement to ANTA to avoid a danger that it faces. My scepticism relates to a second layer of empire bureaucracy that sits above the state bureaucracies and determines all sorts of guidelines about national policy which amount to a lot of motherhood. If it were anywhere in that direction that ANTA ends up, many of us will be greatly disappointed with this new national authority. We want to see end results in individual students and we want to see individual Australians equipped to make a good contribution to the Australian economy and to their lives and families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is this end point that needs to be kept in mind in the actual training outcomes of Australians. It will lead us to make our evaluation of ANTA, not as is naturally too much the case in the report that is before us now, with some very worthy generalisations which we would all support. I look forward to further reports of ANTA in the years ahead. </PARA>

<PARA>As I previously indicated, the Greens have a number of concerns about the implementation of enterprise bargaining. While the rhetoric has been about worker flexibility and improvement of conditions, too often the reality has been divide and conquer and reduction of terms and conditions for little gain in pay. In particular, we have been concerned that those workers in weaker bargaining positions or those who may not be well informed or consulted may have their interests overridden by the majority. This would be the case, for example, with women, youth, non-English speakers and any others who fit into a smaller bargaining position. Women's groups, in particular, are worried about the potential impacts of enterprise bargaining on women workers, and I have heard them specify a number of fears. Surveys are also indicating some worrying aspects, though the overall verdict is still not in, due to lack of experience with enterprise bargaining and poor reporting systems in many states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to increase protection of the interests of under-represented groups, the Greens are putting forward an amendment that requires the Industrial Relations Commission to do three things: first, the commission must identify any employees covered by an agreement whose interest may not have been sufficiently taken into account in the negotiations for, or the terms of, the agreement; second, the commission must ascertain whether the relevant employees were consulted about the agreement and had adequate information about the agreement and its effects; and third, the commission must make whatever orders it thinks necessary to remedy both any failure to consult or explain and any effects. These steps will have to be taken for both certified agreements and enterprise flexibility agreements. The commission is to be given a good deal of leeway in fulfilling these directions and there will not be any additional burden on those seeking the certification of agreements if they do the right thing by all their employees. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The thing we are most concerned to do is to make sure that the act properly recognises the different strengths with which people come to the bargaining table. This explicitly seeks to do that. It says that there are parties to these contracts who are in very weak positions relative to others and it is necessary that we should take that into account. If the government had not felt that was done in the bill itself, we would have put in something like this in the first instance. But this will certainly make it clear to the commission that it is a primary concern of the parliament that those people who come to the bargaining table in a relatively weak position in relation to other parties to the contract need explicit and particular recognition and protection. Therefore, the government is prepared to accept the amendment. </PARA>

The expression `belt and braces' may be appropriate, but we think that it is better explained in the actual text of the amendment moved by Senator Margetts. The final part of that amendment is quite instructive. Proposed subsection (4) in part reads:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If it&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>meaning the commission&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">considers that there has been a failure to consult or explain . . .</PARA>
<PARA>I think they are very important words. They are words that we really need to be careful about when looking at what has happened with the Industrial Relations Reform Bill, as proposed. At one stage in the very longstanding debate on it, I suggested that the minister needed to consult more widely. At that time I suggested that those with whom the minister should have consulted were the employer groups. Again, in this process, there was also a period in which there were certain other affected parties who believed, rightly or wrongly, that they needed more consultation. I would like to quote from a couple of letters I received in this regard. Both are from the National Pay Equity Coalition. The first letter of 31 August in part reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Pay Equity Coalition believes that the government's proposals to extend enterprise bargaining to non-union areas will be a disaster for women. We have compiled a page of facts and figures to let you know the true situation regarding women and non-union bargaining. We hope you find them informative.</PARA>
<PARA>I communicated with this group and I presume the government did too. Because of the outcome, I presume also that the government consulted and did what this very amendment suggests the commission may ensure is done. The government must have taken some trouble to explain as well. I believe there were also alterations as a result of this first communication. On 19 October, I received a communication from the National Pay Equity Coalition, which in part reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Pay Equity Coalition is much happier with the final version of the industrial relations legislation than we were with previous suggestions. We believe that adequate safeguards that protect women's wages and conditions are now in place.</PARA>
<PARA>It then goes on to express one of its remaining concerns. I think that process is an admirable process and one which we should ensure takes place at any alteration or consideration of any alteration to people's terms and conditions of employment. Senator Margetts's amendment ensures very completely that that will take place, even though proposed section 170MC(1) reads:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission must certify an agreement if, and must not certify an agreement unless, it is satisfied that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) the agreement does not, in relation to their terms and conditions of employment, disadvantage the employees who are covered by the agreement.</PARA>
<PARA>I interpret that Senator Margetts is attempting to ensure that all employees who are covered by that agreement are taken into account, not simply 50 per cent plus one. With this amendment, Senator Margetts is attempting to ensure that, when this bill says `employees', it really does mean `employees'&mdash;all of those who are considered by it. I think it is a worthy amendment to achieve that purpose and therefore we support it. </PARA>

As the bill stands at the moment, if the commission has been satisfied that an extension of a certified agreement would not be in the interests of the employees covered by the agreement, the commission would have to terminate the agreement. That is what the bill as drafted says. That is not really what we want. What we want, and what this amendment will make possible, is: if the commission thinks an extension is not in the interests of the employees, it will not extend it. The agreement still stands; it just does not have its term extended.

<PARA>Democrat amendments Nos. 9 and 10 are consequential and complementary. I will speak to both, even though I have moved just No. 9. The amendments require that, where a certified or enterprise flexibility agreement has expired and is continuing as an award, as is the case in the bill, the commission must review that agreement every three years. If the commission finds that an agreement is unfair to employees, it can terminate that agreement or ensure that it is varied.

<PARA>This amendment relates to page 41 of the bill. It requires the commission to publish a notice, as prescribed when approval is being sought for an enterprise flexibility agreement. It replaces the requirement that the commission notify unions which are a party to an award which is varied by the agreement. This does not alter the right of such unions to be heard on application for approval. The Democrats support that right and, in any case, believe that the commission would grant such a right under section 43, even if this specific provision of the bill were removed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, the automatic notification of unions really smacks of the commission doing the homework that is rightly the task of the unions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This area has been a matter of great concern, and in some cases undue concern on the part of both employers and unions involved&mdash;the degree to which one group should be doing the work of another, the degree to which one group should be intervening in the affairs of others. I am particularly concerned that this opportunity to be heard at a commission hearing has been characterised as a right of intervention and, even worse, as a right of veto by some commentators on this matter. The recent case in Tasmania concerning the Delta Hydraulics agreement should be enough to demonstrate that the opportunity for unions to be heard in the actual conduct of the enterprise agreement hearing before the commission has been upheld by Tasmanian courts. It is a right with which I agree, and I think any sensible person should because, after all, what we are looking at is the alteration of an award in which the unions have had a considerable role. That is how in the past awards have been arrived at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The right to be heard is a right which does not confer an opportunity for veto. It is not a right to intervene, it is not a right to impinge on the process of negotiation. The right to be heard is the right to express a point of view. Whether the commission takes any notice of that point of view is up to the commission. When I was speaking on Senator Margett's amendment, I noticed that the first part of the process of certification of agreement reads, on page 32 of the bill, under section 170MC(1):</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Commission must certify an agreement if, and must not certify an agreement unless, it is satisfied. . . </PARA>
<PARA>There follows a considerable list: (a), (b), (c), (d), (e), (f), (g) and (h). Section 170MC(2) then lists a considerable set of tests that the commission must apply. Not one of them mentions the union's concurrence or the union's agreement. Not one of them says that the union has the capacity to deny the agreement's approval. What is listed is a set of tests which are there to safeguard the enterprise itself and the employees. When those tests have been satisfied, the commission must certify the agreement. I remind senators of the word `must'&mdash;the commission `must'. The union has the opportunity to be heard but it does not have the opportunity to veto.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we should spend a lot of time clarifying this aspect of the legislation because it has led to a great deal of fear and misunderstanding in this area. It is unjustified fear, I believe. </PARA>

We seek to reduce the opportunity of such a union to be able to put in perfunctory, matter-of-course objections. If we preserve that situation, we preserve a situation which is to the great disadvantage of both the employees and the enterprises involved. So it is with that in mind that I have moved Democrat amendment No. 11.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government is opposed to this amendment. We understand the motivation, but the problem is that the mere publication of applications without individual notification increases the possibility that a union will not be aware of an application. The notification obligation which is included in the bill is not going to be any major burden to the commission. The details of awards to which the employer concerned is a party will be known to the commission and notification will involve no more than checking off the list of respondents and notifying them accordingly&mdash;and in these days of union amalgamation that is not going to be a very long list.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I am concerned about with this amendment is that the appearance of unions before the commission to represent the interests of employees who might be affected by the decision in one way or the other will be determined perhaps by the efficiency of the administration of a union rather than the merits of the case. It does not seem to me to be the appropriate process to have outcome determined by accident rather than judgment of the merits. It seems to me to be an unfortunate addition to the bill. I think it would be much better if we were able to do everything in our power to make sure people who have a right to be heard&mdash;and I accept what Senator Bell said about that matter in broad principle&mdash;are at least aware of the right. They may well choose not to exercise it, but that conscious decision can be based on the merits of the matter, whereas there may be some substantial merit in not being canvassed because the right to be heard cannot be exercised. For a right to be heard to be effective, one needs to know the circumstances in which the opportunity to exercise that right is before one.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support Senator Crane's amendment. It is worth putting to the committee that the government amended this clause in the House of Representatives.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This section does not affect any other right of an organisation of employees, or of any other person or body, to intervene or be heard, or to apply to intervene or be heard, on an application to the Commission . . . </PARA>
<PARA>It is totally inappropriate for a union to be involved in enterprise agreements unless it is representing members in the enterprise concerned. This proposed subsection enables any union to come in and intervene in an enterprise agreement that has been determined between the employees and their own employer. It is one of these appalling things, the effect of which will be to diminish the rights of people who genuinely want to engage in an enterprise agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The statutory involvement of unions will deter non-unionised employees from even attempting to negotiate enterprise agreements. It is worth quoting a recent Australian Chamber of Manufactures survey which stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.Only 8% of employers with non-unionised workplaces had entered into enterprise agreements requiring the approval or certification of the AIRC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.42% of the non-unionised employers reported that the requirement for union involvement had discouraged them from pursuing enterprise agreements.</PARA>
<PARA>This makes a total sham of the remarks made by the minister and the remarks made by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that this legislation to introduce enterprise agreements was also meant to cover the non-unionised sector of the work force. That will not happen because neither the employers nor the employees want it to happen. They do not want their ordinary everyday work interfered with by some third party which has no relationship whatsoever to the organisation in which it is intervening. In fact, the terminology should be `interfering', not `intervening'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other comment made by Senator Crane was that the majority of the work force can decide things by secret ballot and there will be no union involvement. What is wrong with the majority of the work force making a decision? Is that not what our democracy is all about? After all, that is the way we elect people to parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point, which I think Senator Burns took umbrage at, was the idea of a secret ballot. Anyone who has had any involvement in the work force and has seen militant unions at work will know that they have a vested interest in opposing secret ballots. There is a pretty good reason for that. People who go along to a union meeting to determine something that will affect them in one way or another&mdash;usually a strike&mdash;are not game to put up their hands to defeat a proposal by a union delegate. </PARA>

I have seen this happen for years. One gets only 20 per cent of the work force turning up, and I have asked the people who did not attend, `Why didn't you go to the meeting?'. They say, `We're better off to go down the pub and have a few beers because we don't agree with what they're doing but we wouldn't be game to put our hands up'. As everybody knows, this happens in closed shop situations because the union has the economic power of life and death over those particular members; that is, `no ticket, no job'. It is not only `no ticket, no job' but also no democracy because the unions do not go along with secret ballots. The reason is that when they have to conduct a secret ballot, they cannot control their members.

It is a very important motion; it is a motion which provides some protection for employees and employers against the power and privilege of trade unions. I think it is one of those tests that the Australian Democrats&mdash;a party which had its roots in small business&mdash;will have to undergo, as we wonder whether it is prepared to get up in this chamber and defend small business.

If any of them have been involved in this sort of activity they are absolutely ignorant of these matters. Having conducted probably thousands of trade union meetings in my many years in the trade union movement, I can speak with some authority and quote instances where those opposite are so wrong as to be quite ludicrous.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have always felt that the democratic process was important, but never have I seen the need for a secret discussion by trade unionists about their attitude to a particular set of wages and conditions that, with an employer, they may be seeking to reach agreement on. I have always encouraged open and forceful debate where people have put a point of view; it gives a clear understanding of the attitudes of people who represent those on the floor and how to go about negotiations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have seen situations, for instance, where a lot has been made of the fact that people vote a particular way because they do not have the protection of a secret ballot. Some years ago the National-Liberal party government in Queensland changed the legislation governing industrial relations to provide that strikes could be legally conducted if a secret ballot were held&mdash;and Senator Parer would recall this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite a substantial number of people who were engaged in construction were involved in a dispute at the Gladstone power house. The dispute ran for some weeks and, finally, an order was made by the commission that a secret ballot should be held. During that time, included as part of the discussions, negotiations and meetings that went on, to which reports were made, there was a meeting of the wives who voted even more firmly than had their husbands in favour of a continuation of the dispute. But, finally, the Electoral Commission conducted the secret ballot and the vote in favour of staying on strike was even higher than it had been at open meeting&mdash;even higher. The point is that it was being said at the time that, if there were a secret ballot conducted, they would all return to work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to see any small meeting at a workshop held to discuss conditions and wages being cluttered up with a silly secret ballot with people wanting to hide what they feel behind silence. They should feel free to say what they think and to vote however they choose&mdash;and they are. Let us look at this in comparison, though, with some other areas. Throughout this country there are virtually thousands of organisations continuing to operate and have meetings at which they do not hold secret ballots on policy issues, on decisions they make to go about the work for which they have been established; they do not do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For instance, if one looks at elections of people to boards of management, day by day we read in the paper who has cast their vote in favour of a particular board member. They do not hide behind the fact that they cast a million share votes behind a board member. But I must say this: when that board of directors is elected, behind the doors of their organisation they secretly make decisions every day which affect workers and people in the community; they do that secretly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe that things should be done in that way. I think we should do things openly.

Obviously, things that I have said in this chamber as well as history show that that is how I have operated always&mdash;having discussions in a workshop with people who are members of the union, although they are sometimes not, and majority decisions being made. But that has always been on the basis of there being some equality in terms of the negotiations where people have been empowered on both sides with knowledge of what the issue is about. It is not an uneven competition or contest where, on one side, we have people who know exactly what is going on&mdash;they understand the way in which the company is constructed, what its reserves are, what its policy is and are advised by the top industrial relations policy people available to them for whom they pay&mdash;and, on the other side, we have a group of people in a workshop who have had no experience with struggle or negotiation and who are so disadvantaged that it is totally unfair to go ahead with it. </PARA>

Well, here is the answer&mdash;and Senator Crane will be able to anticipate our answer to the proposed amendment: the Democrats enthusiastically support the concept of a secret ballot. They practice it, unlike a couple of hypocritical groups in this place who wander in and say how wonderful it is. One really wonders what sort of leader might be delivered to the cacophonous group assembled on my right if a secret ballot were to take place for its leadership.

I support Senator Parer's criticism of some of the argument advanced by Senator Burns. It was pretty obvious to me that it would be appropriate for a secret ballot to be ordered in a great number of the situations that Senator Parer described.

Contributions are made in the areas of education, sailing, swimming and sunbathing by those who do not have a lot of experience or qualifications in any of those areas.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The proposed section of the Industrial Relations Reform Bill that we are dealing with in relation to this amendment provides for the right of trade unions to be heard before the Industrial Relations Commission before an enterprise flexibility agreement is approved by that commission. This amendment provides for an additional clause to be added, which is worded:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This section does not apply where a majority of employees in an enterprise have approved an enterprise flexibility agreement by secret ballot.</PARA>
<PARA>This amendment seeks to withdraw the right of a trade union to be heard before the Industrial Relations Commission where a majority of employees in an individual enterprise have agreed to an enterprise flexibility agreement. That is a quite logical and proper amendment to make to this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If a majority of employees in a particular enterprise have approved an enterprise flexibility agreement by secret ballot, what need or justification, what rhyme or reason is there for a trade union to get involved in that matter? What rhyme or reason is there for a trade union to be heard by the Industrial Relations Commission in regard to a specific enterprise flexibility agreement when a majority of the employees have, by secret ballot, said that that is what they want?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking here of a situation where there are no union members on site, no union members employed by that particular enterprise. In this legislation they are still given the right to appear before the Industrial Relations Commission. If an enterprise flexibility agreement is approved by secret ballot by a majority of employees, it is clear to me that that enterprise flexibility agreement has been achieved without any of the intimidation that some may like to allege might occur with some enterprise flexibility agreements being established. If there is a clear decision by a majority of employees in a secret ballot, no intimidation has been present in the way which may occur if the agreement was achieved by means other than a secret ballot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also clear that an enterprise flexibility agreement does not have general application. It applies only to a particular enterprise. It cannot be argued that the unions ought to have the right to appear before the Industrial Relations Commission because a particular agreement might have effects at other enterprises, because it might flow on to other enterprises where there are union members present and where the union therefore may claim to have some legitimate interest. The very nature of an enterprise flexibility agreement is that it applies only to that individual enterprise. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no reason for the unions to have a right to appear before the Industrial Relations Commission in the circumstances where a majority of the employees in that particular enterprise have said by secret ballot, `This is what we want. This is the way we want to go. This is the agreement we want with our employer. We agree to it'. As I said, it is done by secret ballot and without intimidation. There ought not to be the opportunity for a trade union, which has no legitimate interest in the affairs of that enterprise and those employees, to have the right to try, by appearing before the Industrial Relations Commission, to prevent that enterprise flexibility agreement being accepted and registered. That is why this amendment ought to be incorporated within the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This amendment is an attempt to enshrine in this legislation a bare modicum of industrial democracy. It seeks to give people who have already exercised a choice, by choosing not to belong to a union, the opportunity of making it incredibly clear whether they want the union to participate in the process before the commission. These people have already voted once with their feet not to belong to a union. We seek by this amendment to have secret ballots so that these people, for the avoidance of any doubt, can express their clear views on whether they want a union to be present before the commission.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is wrong with people being entitled to say, secretly in a ballot, yea or nay to union participation in this process? What is there to be achieved by denying those people a process which I understand is guaranteed to people in Russia&mdash;that is, a right to a secret ballot? I know that there are people on the other side of the chamber who look askance when one says `secret ballot'. To those people a secret ballot is only secret if one shows at least one other person how one voted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side of the chamber believe that there is nothing wrong with a secret ballot. Why should a person who has already voted with their feet not to belong to a union be obliged to make an application and to fight for a right to have a secret ballot? Why should somebody have to apply for an order for a secret ballot? It is perverse to say that there is something intrinsically wrong with a secret ballot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those who oppose this amendment are saying, `We do not believe that a secret ballot is an appropriate way to proceed'. The people who are supposedly interested in the rights of employees are saying, `We do not believe employees should have a right to exercise their own conscience and their own freedom of choice by way of secret ballot'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite believe that for one of two reasons. The first is that they believe secret ballots are intrinsically bad, which in itself is a ludicrous statement. That assumes that secret ballots are worse than the alternative to a secret ballot&mdash;namely, a public ballot which everybody knows to be wholly objectionable, wholly unconscionable and open to all sorts of terrible intimidation and manipulation. That goes without saying. Secondly, they believe that the better alternative is to give people no right at all, or to have to fight for the right to a secret ballot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Either they believe secret ballots are bad, or they do not want the secret ballot to proceed for another ulterior motive. Surely the ulterior motive is fear. It is fear that the workers will exercise their rights, the workers' rights, in a manner which would preclude the union from being present before the commission&mdash;not in all cases but in this particular case&mdash;for a hearing to ratify this particular agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That situation in itself raises some grounds for concern. These people would have already voted once with their feet. They would be voting yet again not to have the union present and for it to have absolutely nothing to do with the matter. The people who oppose this amendment are saying, `Notwithstanding the views of the employees who have twice expressed that they are against the presence and participation of the union in this process, somehow the union should be brought in over the top, contrary to the wishes of the workers in that workplace'. That is an incredibly patronising view. That view suggests that the workers do not know what is good for them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That may have been the case at the turn of the century when some of the redoubtable union leaders came upon the scene. In those days in Australia, people were not on the whole terribly well-educated and exposed to concepts such as they are today. I would have thought that workers in the 1990s are at least capable of doing some basic arithmetic to work out whether they would be better or worse off and are at least sufficiently well-educated to be able to exercise some sort of conscience and free choice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that hilarity and laughter has come from other end of the chamber. We shall see in just a few minutes exactly where everybody in this chamber stands, even those who have been assiduously sitting up the back of the chamber and sniggering. We will be calling a division on this amendment because we do not believe in the patronising view which is being expressed by those who are opposed to the amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Moreover, we believe that there is an ulterior motive in wanting the union to be present. This arises not just because those who oppose this amendment do not believe that workers are capable of exercising their own minds without assistance. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EU4">Senator O'CHEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is a smokescreen. The motive is to get the union to appear all the time. There are three things that the union could say before the commission. In one instance, it might agree to the voluntary employment agreement. If it agrees to the agreement, why is it bothering to turn up? If the workers say, `We don't want you', and the union agrees, why should the union have the right to turn up anyway? The union is superfluous.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The union will be saying one of two things. It will be saying, `We do not believe that this agreement is in the best interests of the workers'&mdash;again, we get back to the patronising view that the union thugs know better than the workers whom they purport to represent; or, in this case, whom clearly they do not represent because the workers have told them where they can go and put their union tickets&mdash;or, in the alternative, they will be saying, `We do not believe that this agreement is in the best interests of union members who are not in this workplace'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why would that be? Clearly, the union members who are not in that workplace and who are not covered by the agreement will not lose any rights. They will not lose their pay, because this agreement is for that workplace only. They are afraid that the union members will wake up to the fact that the union is not doing a terribly good job of representing them. This occurred in the Gazal case. The union took the view that it would prefer to close down the factory rather than see these people make an agreement which they thought might show up the union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The ulterior motive is the protection of unions, not the protection of workers. Ultimately, the protection of unions means the protection of trade union officials. A good union can adequately and effectively represent its members, be it in the workplace or other areas, and I congratulate unions on looking to give other benefits to their workers. A good union will always continue to exist and flourish. But the lax, large and uncompassionate unions are protected by this amendment. That is why we believe those who oppose this amendment do not have the best interests of workers' rights at heart. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Sherry behaves himself, I will. In essence, what this amendment could, and maybe should, be called is the small business amendment. I point out a couple of things which I did not say in my opening remarks. The first is that, purely and simply, this does not compel the employees in the workplace to have a secret ballot. It gives them the opportunity, if they so choose. I think that is very important. It is quite different from the proposition in section 135, which has been raised by Senator Bell and Senator Harradine. In that case, to have a secret ballot there has to be an instruction from the commission. In this particular case, our amendment gives employees in the workplace the right to have a secret ballot, if they so wish. There is a very big difference.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I refer to the point raised by Senator Harradine about the different types of occupations within a workplace. It is quite obvious that if the work force is made up of permanent employees, casual employees or employees of some other type, any agreement reached will be very different from that for a work force where the employees all work full time. I do not see how that in any way impedes the secret ballot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important that we be fair. We spent quite a bit of time the other night debating discrimination. This particular clause, as it is now, discriminates very much against those employees who come into the agreement. It also discriminates against the employers. We notice that there is no provision for the employer organisation to be heard on behalf of the employer. It is a very selective discrimination in favour of the union movement. Every time we bring in legislation which discriminates in favour of one group, we tread on the toes of or discriminate against another group. It does not matter which way we look at this. This legislation is probably one of the worst examples of discrimination. Our amendment will put some balance back into the legislation&mdash;if the government chooses to exercise it. I think that particular point needed to be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point I want to make&mdash;and it is fundamental to the position of the Australian Democrats&mdash;concerns how a party can move or change its position at its convenience. It must be said that the Labor Party has been consistent in its position on this for a number of years, and I believe that we have been consistent in our position for a number of years. I have no doubt that when we deal with what I term the small business amendment, we will be looking at the history of the Democrats and how they have reacted to this legislation before us. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While Senator Bell may think that it is irrelevant, it is worth noting that a very different position was taken on industrial relations in the days of former Senator Chipp, former Senator Jack Evans, whom I knew particularly well at that time, and former Senator John Siddons. That position is in contrast to the changes that occurred when former Senator Powell and former Senator McLean were involved in issues such as this. At that time we saw the movement towards what small business fears most&mdash;mega-unions. </PARA>

At that time there was no concern about the ILO conventions or the right of freedom of association from the opposite side of the chamber nor from the end of the chamber. Once again, much of this bill is based on the selective use of conventions and much of it will end up in the High Court. We must forget that when we put up legislation we have a responsibility in this place to try to avoid the lengthy cases and the drawn out situations which arrive from things being taken to the High Court. There is no doubt that this legislation will end up in the High Court.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I had thought that the Democrats had gone as far as they could to the left, particularly while they still claim to represent small business. Under the regime of Senator Kernot and Senator Bell, we have seen them moving even further to the left. In relation to that, they may be going down the track that Senator Harradine suggested may be taken. The Democrats are not taking the opportunity to take out some of the discrimination in this clause and to balance the ledger. I am particularly dismayed by that. As Senator Parer and others have said, all the small businesses which have approached me&mdash;I have talked to quite a number, and received many faxes, but I will leave the faxes out of it for a moment&mdash;have said that they do not want a bar of this legislation, these clauses and the way enterprise flexibility agreements are being handled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have no doubt that history will judge that the government's approach to bringing more flexibility into the labour market&mdash;picking up the thrust of Mr Keating's 21 April speech&mdash;did not succeed as a result of this legislation because too many barriers were put in the way of small business. At the end of the day, when the assessment is made on this legislation it will be primarily at the hands of the Democrats because they would not support us in this legislation. The government's position is purely and simply to pay back the ACTU for services rendered. We all know that. I do not see much point in debating that while speaking on this amendment. I certainly think that it is very important that if we are serious about giving small business the opportunity to develop flexibility agreements, this amendment must be carried.</PARA>

I acknowledge that Senator Bell and Senator Harradine have comprehensively rebutted the claims made by opposition senators.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Crane raised the issue of so-called balancing the ledger and made the assertion that employers would not enjoy the same rights as a union organisation would under proposed section 170NB. The whole basis of industrial relations is in redressing the imbalance in bargaining power between employees and an employer. There is an imbalance. It is a matter of finding the mechanisms that preserve a relative balance in negotiating power between employees and the employer or groups of employees and groups of employers. Because employers do not have the same `right' before the commission, Senator Crane claims that that is discrimination. I would put it another way and say that he is saying that protecting people is discrimination. In effect, that is what he is arguing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Harradine was quite right in his contribution in this debate. Whilst I do not agree with some of the rhetoric he used, I do agree with the arguments he advanced and his central philosophical position on industrial relations&mdash;that is, the need to have a commission protect not only the interests of union members and employees, but also the interests of the wider community in general. That is a central principle that is held by Senator Harradine&mdash;he has held it for as long as I have known him&mdash;and a central principle on which he is correct. The arguments he put were very sound. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Bell raised a number of issues that I intended to comment on. The opposition is attempting to amend proposed section 170NB relating to enterprise flexibility agreements. This section provides that a federally registered organisation of employees is entitled to be heard before the industrial commission on whether an agreement may be approved or whether an agreement's period of operation should be extended. It only has an entitlement to be heard if it is a party to an award that binds the employer in respect of work performed in the enterprise. Senator Parer was asserting&mdash;I notice he is not here&mdash;that any union could be heard. That is not correct. It is only a union that is a party to the award that attempts to bind employees in a particular enterprise for which the agreement is to be made that can be heard. So he was incorrect in his assertion in that area. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Murphy is right&mdash;only an union that has the right to cover the employees in terms of its constitutional coverage covers those employees before the enterprise. This section gives interested federally registered unions the right to go before the Industrial Relations Commission. It does not give them the right to exercise a right of veto; it gives them the right to be heard. That is the central principle that Senator Harradine and Senator Bell addressed. On what does it give them the right to be heard? It gives them the right to argue that there could be possible breaches of the statutory protections for employees. It gives them that right to be heard. Even if a secret ballot was adopted, what about the rights of the minority who did not agree with the majority in balloting on this enterprise agreement? Does not the minority have a right to be heard before the commission?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition, by its amendments, is overriding the rights of a minority to be heard. I would have thought that a minority which does not agree with the majority in the ballot, whether in a union or not, at least has an entitlement to put a view before the commission. In effect, the opposition is excluding such a minority from even doing that. We are not opposed to secret ballots, but it is the point at which we exercise a secret ballot, it is the appropriate mechanism as to when we have a secret ballot, and this is not the appropriate time to have that secret ballot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the commission believes that it is appropriate to have a secret ballot, then as Senator Bell and Senator Harradine have pointed out, the commission will order that secret ballot under section 135. For example, it would be appropriate if there was uncertainty about the level of consent to an enterprise flexibility agreement. Senator Harradine raises a very important issue. It was a major problem in the SPC agreement about which we had much debate last year in the Senate. The enterprise agreement at SPC bound the seasonal workers, who were a majority of the work force at SPC at certain times of the year. But the seasonal workers were not consulted about the contents of the agreement. The agreement did away with many of the entitlements of seasonal workers. So Senator Harradine raised a quite legitimate point about who is the work force at the particular time when you have the ballot. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are saying, and what Senator Harradine and Senator Bell are saying, is that you should not take away the rights of a union to represent its member or members before the commission. You cannot take away its right to put an argument. You are not taking away its right to veto because it does not have a right to veto. I am also informed that employer organisations could appear and represent employers if this was necessary. Section 42 of the Industrial Relations Act does provide for that, so there is further argument against Senator Crane's assertion that this somehow is unbalanced. With those comments I ask the Senate to reject the amendment that is being sought by the opposition to section 170NB. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Those remarks of Senator Sherry's cannot pass without comment. He objects to this opposition amendment on the grounds that it denies the minority the right to be heard if, in a secret ballot of employees of a particular enterprise, a majority agree to the particular enterprise flexibility agreement concerned. I direct his attention to clause 170NB(3) which says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This section does not affect any other right of an organisation of employees, or of any other person or body, to intervene or be heard, or to apply to intervene or be heard, on an application to the Commission.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, those employees can be heard at their own request. If they are not satisfied with the result of a secret ballot, they can apply to the commission to have their point of view put. Or, indeed, a trade union can apply to the commission to have its point of view put or, if you like, the employees can ask a trade union, which in turn can ask to be heard on their behalf. So nothing in the amendment that is being put by the opposition precludes the right of that minority of employees to be heard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What this amendment seeks to achieve is to remove the automatic right of a particular trade union to be heard by the Industrial Relations Commission without any need to apply to the commission and put up argument as to why it ought to be heard. That is what we are about&mdash;removing this automatic right of a particular trade union which is involved with the award to which an enterprise flexibility agreement might apply to be heard without having to put an argument to the commission as to why it should be heard. It does not in any way remove the capacity for a minority of employees or indeed for a particular trade union to be heard if they have valid and good reasons to put to the commission as to why they should be heard. So that disposes of the argument put by Senator Sherry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wanted to deal with the points raised by Senator Harradine. As I interpreted Senator Harradine's remarks in relation to the opposition amendment&mdash;and I am sure Senator Harradine will correct me if I am wrong&mdash;and putting them in a nutshell, they were to the effect that this opposition amendment was returning us to the bad old days where the shop committees made decisions. In his terms, shop committees were dominated then by communists and, as a result of that, enormous damage was done to businesses and to the economy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that there are two fallacies inherent in what Senator Harradine has said. Firstly, we are talking here about a secret ballot of all employees at that enterprise, not a self-appointed or even elected group, but a small group of employees, a shop committee, making the decision but with every employee having the right to be involved in that secret ballot and to participate in that decision. More importantly, we are talking here about enterprises where there are no union members. So again we are not talking about a union shop committee; we are talking about employees who do not have any association or involvement with a union. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, in terms of the capacity of such an approach to inflict damage on enterprises more broadly and on the economy, therefore, what Senator Harradine is talking about is that from the decision taken with regard to this enterprise flexibility agreement there will be flow-ons to other enterprises. Other employees will get, in effect, the same deal. He is talking about the concept of comparative wage justice, that a deal and concessions and benefits won at a particular enterprise will flow on throughout the economy to other businesses, to other employees, so that everyone, in effect, gets the same benefits. That is the very antithesis of enterprise flexibility agreements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I argued earlier in this debate that this legislation was a charade and a facade, that it was not going to get genuine enterprise agreements which were individual and appropriate to particular enterprises because the union movement will never give up the concept of comparative wage justice. So whatever benefits might be achieved at one enterprise will be sought in other enterprises. But if one genuinely believes that this legislation is about what the government claims, that it is going to get greater flexibility in the workplace, then there is no place for comparative wage justice in that concept. Again, the point made by Senator Harradine is, therefore, a fallacy. So on those grounds this amendment ought to be supported and passed by the Senate. </PARA>

The parliamentary secretary at that time totally misinterpreted what I was saying on that point. Others may only appear after having put argument before the commission. It is then at the discretion of the commission as to whether or not they can appear, which is totally different to the giving of a right.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be relatively brief because to some degree this amendment is similar to the coalition's amendment No. 6.

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">wages and conditions of employment of the employees covered by the agreement are regulated by one or more awards (as defined in subsection (3)) that bind the employer . . .</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">wages and conditions of employment of the majority of employees covered by the agreement are regulated by one or more awards (as defined . . . </PARA>
<PARA>This adjusts the threshold of the paragraph downwards so the commission can approve an enterprise flexibility agreement only if the majority of the employees concerned are covered by awards. As I indicated earlier, this is similar to our amendment No. 6, except that it applies to enterprise flexibility agreements rather than certified agreements. The whole aim of the enterprise flexibility agreements was to enable as many people as possible in Australia who wished to go into enterprise flexibility agreements, whether they be part of the unionised work force or the non-unionised work force, to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Again, this relates to the majority. I suppose one cannot help wondering what has gone wrong with this country when one considers that the laws that have been made at all levels of government, I might say, going back 10 or 20 years, have been geared towards minorities. The minority views are important and they should not be overlooked, but in any sort of democracy the rule of the majority of people should apply with respect to any sort of agreement. I simply support the amendment because of that. It is all to do with the commission being able to approve the implementation of agreement where the majority of employees are covered by the agreement and regulated by one or more awards. Where that is not the case they do not have to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might just mention for the benefit of the Australian Democrats from Queensland that this important amendment was suggested to the committee that looked into this by the Metway Bank. The Metway Bank is a very interesting case. This was an agreement entered into freely between the employer and the employees of Metway Bank. While Metway Bank has union members&mdash;not many, but there is a percentage involved&mdash;the vast majority of employees are non-unionised. They had a ballot on it within the Metway Bank. They want to keep it that way. They do not want union involvement, neither do they want to be roped in&mdash;because the whole thrust of this legislation is to rope companies into awards. </PARA>

That reduces the burden on the employer and the obstruction to the process of breaching an agreement. It removes those burdens, recognising a little of the reality of the world and allowing things to progress much more smoothly. </PARA>

I was speaking about a number of faxes which have been received by members of all religious complexions in this parliament. It was said that I had described a particular group as a fanatical religious group. In fact, I described the particular group's interpretation of scripture as peculiar and particular. I used those words in their strictly technical sense in that because that group's interpretation of scripture is not in the mainstream, it is very particular.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very familiar with this group because my wife was a member of it for some years and I worshipped with them.

Those words were put in my mouth by Senator O'Chee and they are certainly incorrect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also said in my speech on a number of occasions that that group and any other religious group have a right to represent their own points of view. My only objection is when they seek to force those opinions upon other Christians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator O'Chee's speech the other night was very interesting but, I am afraid, not very helpful in terms of the support that he said he feels for this group. I suggest that he was underlining and speaking against what this amendment tries to do. He was raising within this place religious prejudice. He spoke about patristics. I would like to let him know that the word he was looking for was patrology, which is the study of church fathers&mdash;patristics is an adjective. But, in fact, I was not talking about patrology.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The study of the church fathers refers to the second to fourth, and fifth and sixth centuries AD.

I was speaking about the first century in which the new testament was written. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I could say a lot of things about this. I could draw Senator O'Chee's attention to an historical example which is very important to me. In the 1985 SEQEB strike in Queensland, the government of the time tried to discriminate against a group of Christians who took a particular part in that debate. These Christians were arrested under a law promulgated at the time by the National Party government and were charged under it. </PARA>

When the state government appealed to the Supreme Court of Queensland the law was again defeated. Finally, in the High Court of Australia the law was again defeated.

This is exactly what I am trying to say we need to address in the amendment moved by the government. There ought not be discrimination.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Woodley in his remarks a few moments ago said that he supported the rights of people to hold beliefs as long as those beliefs did not interfere with the beliefs of others. To my mind that makes those beliefs in a sense very ineffective. Certainly if people have rights which they wish to exercise, it is obviously beneficial if those rights can be exercised without interfering with the rights of others. If someone has very strongly held beliefs, those beliefs are largely irrelevant unless that person has the opportunity to exercise those beliefs or can act in accordance with those beliefs. If they are simply beliefs that a person holds in one's head then they are of no value at all.

It provides an exemption for an institution that is conducted in accordance with the doctrines, tenets, beliefs or teachings of a particular religion or creed with regard to discrimination in employment. By what logic does the government include an amendment such as this which refers to an institution but excludes a business? People who own that business may similarly have doctrines, tenets, beliefs or teachings of a particular religion or creed within which they would choose to run their business.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposed section 170NO recognises the rights of unions to collectively represent their members.

It should be remembered that these unions have no power of veto over the agreement. If the majority of the employees agree and the agreement meets the legislation criteria, it will be approved by the commission. Many enterprises will have a mix of union and non-union areas in their work force, although eligible unions to become bound by agreements will encourage comprehensive enterprise-wide agreements and provide for greater certainty and commitment to the agreement. </PARA>

This section attempts to achieve the same result as the section it replaces, but does it in a more efficient and comprehensive manner. It provides more certainty, and even more flexibility. Once a union has agreed to be bound by an enterprise flexibility agreement, this section will ensure that the union remains bound, but there is the possibility that the commission may vary the agreement to remove an ambiguity, an uncertainty or a discriminatory provision. In that case, the variation is not considered a variation in the sense of an agreed variation by the parties, but rather a variation which is required.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will answer one specific question that Senator Crane rightly asks, and that is how on earth one determines the opinion of the majority of the people involved. As I indicated in the debate over the secret ballot question earlier this evening, the answer lies on page 31,402 in division 4, section 135 of the Industrial Relations Act 1988. If Senator Crane wishes me to, I could read the following sections all the way up to 31,503&mdash;</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7U4">Senator BELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would have thought that with Senator Crane's experience in this area, he would have been familiar with the fact that division 4 of the act is headed `Ballots ordered by Commission' and section 135 is headed `Commission may order secret ballot'. That is one of the many techniques that the commission has at its disposal to determine the findings of the majority of employees in question.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is precisely why it is entirely consistent to support an amendment which, for its implementation, relies upon the commission having the capacity to determine the opinions of the majority. The commission does not have to restrain itself either to conducting a secret ballot or ordering one to be conducted. The commission may use any one or several methods to determine it. It can ask whether certain techniques have been conducted by those who purport to represent the workers involved. In fact, it is required to do that to determine that there has been a process of proper consultation, that there has been a process of proper information sharing and that there has been a process which allows for the proper expressions of opinion by those affected. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because the commission is required to do that and because it also has the capacity to adopt whatever methods it finds necessary to determine what the opinion is, I would have thought that the answer to Senator Crane's question&mdash;which was how on earth do we determine the opinion of the majority&mdash;was obvious. As I stated previously, section 135, with its extensive description of how, when, where and why secret ballots should be conducted, is the very safeguard to prevent the commission from being flippant in its consideration of what is being put before it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to comment on what Senator Bell has just said to the committee. He referred to section 135 of the Industrial Relations Act, which is headed `Commission may order secret ballot' which states:</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>As I understand this particular amendment, the union will be bound by that certified agreement if the majority of employees have agreed to it. When one is dealing with that situation I cannot see how section 135 can apply because if the majority of employees have agreed, there is no dispute. That seems fairly logical to me. Maybe I cannot read or I do not understand, but I think that I do know what an industrial dispute is. This amendment is most illogical. It is totally wrong and a misuse of the powers of the commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again we see flawed legislation here.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to have one point clarified. As I understand it, an eligible union can agree to be bound by an enterprise flexibility agreement simply by telling the employer in writing that it wants to be bound. I believe that is a correct understanding of the clause in English and not in the gobbledegook that we have before us in this amendment. If that can occur, how would the process ever get to the particular point that the parliamentary secretary has just raised? The simple, logistical, practical fact is that it will not.

<PARA>We have already run the arguments in respect of the previous amendment. I think that I have proved quite conclusively that the government has no process. The parliamentary secretary tried to shuffle around that point a moment or two ago. The amendment is quite clear. It is also quite clear that the government has no processes by which that mechanism will be dealt with. There is no process by which the government will be able to establish whether or not the majority of employees who are subject to an agreement can be dealt with. I do not need to say any more, other than that I have no doubt that about March or April next year we will be back in here with the government proposing an amendment to fix up the mess that it has made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It gets back to the point we made when this whole debate started: because there have been so many changes and amendments to this bill&mdash;amendments and decisions made on the run&mdash;and an almost total lack of proper consultation with the employer groups, this legislation should have been referred to a Senate committee for proper consideration. If that had been done, we would not be party to the processing of legislation which has so many holes and flaws. This is yet another example of a huge hole, and another example of the inconsistency in the provisions of secret ballots. I might also add&mdash;which I did not at the time, and I should have read that particular clause in the bill a little more carefully&mdash;that what we said about it only applying to an industrial dispute also applies to the previous position which we debated. So we will also be back here fixing up that hole in the legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Parer interjects, the real purpose behind this clause is that of roping in, so that employers who may not wish to be involved in a particular agreement are, in due course, roped into that agreement by further action from the trade union. There is no need to allow a union to be bound by such an enterprise flexibility agreement; the employees of that particular enterprise have already agreed to be bound by it. So we come back to the very purpose of enterprise flexibility agreements. They are for employees and the employer at an individual enterprise to work out their own arrangements and to be bound by them through an agreement.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to direct a number of questions to the parliamentary secretary. This whole division is based on a number of international conventions. I draw the parliamentary secretary's attention to those listed on page 50. There are some five heads of power, I suppose one could call them, on which this whole section operates. I am opposed to using these conventions and international law as the basis for a constitutional power for the government to legislate and intrude into what has previously been the domain of states and private arrangements between individuals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment moved on behalf of the government and, indeed, this whole division, go to the whole area of the right to strike. I think the fact that the government has had to rely on so many heads of power shows the weakness of its position. If the government, in its trawling through international conventions and international customary law, could have come up with one clear clause which gave a right to strike, I have no doubt that it would have junked all five conventions and put in that clause. I put it to the parliamentary secretary that that was not possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like the parliamentary secretary to provide some answers&mdash;I do not need to have them at the moment. This whole section will be tested in the courts and will ultimately go to the High Court. Therefore, it is of considerable interest, I believe, to find out the precise words the government is relying on under each of these five headings. For example, (e) refers to customary international law relating to freedom of association and the right to strike. I would like the parliamentary secretary to tell me&mdash;hopefully within the next 24 hours&mdash;what precisely the government is relying on in order to obtain, as one might say, the head of power. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that under the ILO there is no unqualified right to strike. I believe that the government recognises this. This is why we have so many legs of international covenants and international law. I believe that the fact that we can attempt blatantly to alter and modify our constitution by relying on these heads of power is an absolutely appalling practice that will come back to haunt this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite misleading. As Minister McMullan said in this chamber last Thursday, it does not really matter all that much because in order to put these covenants into effect we have to pass laws in the parliament. That is correct. But he misses the point that these ILO conventions, and apparently international customary law, provide a constitutional head of power. They are enormously significant and important in the way this country develops, and the government should not downplay that. Without those heads of power, this whole bill would fall down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has not relied on heads of power within the constitution, as agreed to by our people; nor has it gone out and put to the people of this country by way of the normal process of referendum that it wants those heads of power. The government has gone off and signed various conventions, without any approval by or reference to this parliament. The government then argues that it has a constitutional head of power on which to enact wide ranging industrial relations legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like an assurance from the parliamentary secretary that he will provide me in writing, or preferably incorporate the information in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>, just what particular conventions and customary law the government believes arise under each of those five obligations. I believe this will be of great interest to the High Court in years to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to say how utterly foolish this whole exercise is. I put it to the parliamentary secretary that I belong to a party which at this stage is opposed to using ILO conventions in order to provide a head of power for legislation. I think that is a perfectly proper stance for our party to take. But it is more than likely that if the Labor Party continues to act in this manner, Liberal Party members in the future may say, `What is good for the goose is good for the gander'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us look at this convention that the government has put in the schedule of this act. Article 2 of schedule 15 states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Workers and employees, without distinction whatsoever, shall have the right to establish and subject only to the rules of the organisation concerned, to join organisations of their own choosing without previous authorisation.</PARA>
<PARA>What would that give as a head of power to any conservative government in this country? I will tell the parliamentary secretary what it would give. It would give the opportunity to legislate voluntary unionism in as many unions as people wish to join. That could override all the other laws which have been built up since Federation, since 1901. The government, in its naked pursuit for a head of power in order to entrench trade union power and privilege in this country, is setting up precedents which I believe will come back to haunt the Labor Party and the ambitious union leaders who have insisted on this bill being passed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me come back to my original point. Can the parliamentary secretary or his advisers tell me precisely which are the clauses which give an obligation to provide the right to strike?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I think it is well known that the opposition will be opposing this amendment. I have to say that we are now getting to the crazy part of this bill. I never thought I would be standing in this parliament putting in place a situation whereby people have 72 hours to do something and can then go on strike, or a situation where employers can give 72 hours notice to employees that they will be locked out. What are we here for? Are we not here to progress this nation?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It really comes back to the issues I raised at the beginning of the debate. I then talked about the objectives of the act. This is where the changes come into play. The 1993 bill states that its objective is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to provide a framework for the prevention and settlement of industrial disputes . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The 1988 act states that its objective is:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . to promote industrial harmony and co-operation among the parties . . . </PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt that the amendment now before us has created the necessity for the changes to the objectives. I just have to say, on behalf of the opposition, that that is totally the wrong way to go in terms of dealing with things. In fact, it is encouraging and legitimising disputation. It is creating a situation in which you actually write a letter to tell the other party that you are going to get stuck into them. Just how crazy can this become?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do we want to address the situation faced by the one million people who are unemployed in this country? Do we want to get ourselves back to the living standards that we used to enjoy? This bill will do nothing on those lines. Indeed, it will send us in the opposite direction. The government has to ask itself a few questions about whether it is serving the interests of this nation or whether it is going to continue to placate the ACTU and bow to its demands. This is what this is all about. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government said, `Employers objected to this so we put in a 72-hour clause to enable them to lock people out'. Who will they hurt if they lock people out? Who will get upset with them if they lock people out? They will upset the very people with whom they have to operate in the workplace. Who will they damage economically? They will damage themselves. It is stupidity, silliness and craziness at their absolute worst. For a government to bring into this and the other place legislation which in fact will cause and create disharmony amongst people in the workplace is totally beyond me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> The Industrial Relations Commission is still in place and it has some tasks. We have an arbitration and conciliation process. Is that not the sane, sensible way, if the government is going to continue down that line, to deal with these matters? It is the government's decision to continue down that line, but it is also its decision to put in place provisions in this legislation which will exacerbate and increase industrial disruption. Those provisions will damage business, they will damage our economy and we will fall even further behind the rest of the world in terms of international competitiveness. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard a lot in recent times about GATT and the GATT agreement, and hopefully we will get a good result out of that. But why not put in place an industrial system that will allow us to maximise the benefit of that? Let us not have a repeat of what occurred when our financial system was devalued. That occurred because we did not grasp the other components of an economic situation and amend, change or deregulate them. We did not do that. Instead, we blew the benefits we could have gained from financial deregulation. Most of them went up in smoke and they are gone. It is no good saying now that our inflation today is two per cent or three per cent. The fact is that we blew that a long time ago and we cannot get the opportunity back. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is giving away the opportunity it has to bring about real industrial reform. It is creating a situation in which the old `us and them' situation will be built up. That is what the government is doing and that will be the result of this legislation. It almost leaves me speechless when I think of how one should try to deal with such a situation. </PARA>

This government is facilitating a situation that I did not want to see again in my lifetime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I thought when I came into this place three-and-a-half years ago that one might have been able to make a constructive contribution to prevent that situation arising again. When we get legislation like this, we can get up and say everything we like. We can have inquiries and do all of those things, but at the end of the day if reason does not prevail, if people do not adopt a sensible attitude to these things and look at all sides of the equation, we will end up with very bad legislation. </PARA>

I say to the government, to the Democrats, to the Greens and to Senator Harradine that that may be the model they want in Australia, but we on this side of the chamber do not want a bar of it.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FF4">Senator CHAPMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The parliamentary secretary interjects that they have dropped substantially. One of the reasons they have dropped substantially, of course, is that this government has driven the country into recession. Employees, therefore, cannot afford to take the risks that industrial action involves. The other thing that he ignores is that other forms of industrial action have been substituted for strikes, such as work to rule and those sorts of quasi-strikes. If we go over the whole history in this century of Australia's industrial relations, we again find that the number of strikes that have occurred is many multiples of the number of lockouts that have occurred in our industrial history.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reality is that this legislation writes into law a right to strike. Therefore, to give the appearance of equality, it writes into law the right to a lockout. But, in the practical application of this law, it will be the right to strike that is exercised and not the right to a lockout. As Senator Crane said a few moments ago, that is giving all of the wrong signals to the practitioners of industrial relations in this country. </PARA>

By its very nature, once something is written into law, it gives encouragement to its practice&mdash;it gives it succour; it gives it approval. It is respected once it is written into law.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to comment on this amendment from the government and reinforce the remarks made by Senator Crane and Senator Chapman. It seems to me to be introducing legislation which is a throwaway, like Marie Antoinette's `They haven't got bread. Let them eat cake'. The government has introduced the right to strike and someone has said, `Well, there's another side to that coin. Why don't we throw the employers the right to lockout?'.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chapman raised the question of lockouts. Lockouts have not been a feature of industrial relations in this country. I can recall reading left-wing trade union papers some years ago that said that one of the worst things that an employer could do was lock out. We can hark back to examples in history. I might be wrong, but I have an idea that the miners reckon the 1949 coal strike, where Chifley put the troops in, was a lockout. To the union movement, this was the equivalent of scab labour. That was the sort of ferocity with which they looked at lockouts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I ask the parliamentary secretary&mdash;because it was raised by Senator Chapman&mdash;just how many lockouts have been recorded by the Department of Industrial Relations over the past 10 years. Senator Sherry said that strikes have diminished. I might be wrong, but it is my understanding that there are still something like one million man days lost in strikes in this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this bill, supposedly, is to encourage enterprise agreements. That means agreements at the enterprise level, whether they be with people who are members of recognised unions or people who are not members of recognised unions. There is no doubt that, once we start to introduce a bill or an amendment like this which gives various rules and regulations regarding lockouts, we will have lockouts where we have never had them before because they will be legal. On 72 hours notice it is possible to have a lockout. What that will do for employer-employee relationships boggles the mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think everyone would agree&mdash;I have even heard people on the other side say it&mdash;that we need a more cooperative framework for industrial relations in this country. We need an attitude similar to the attitude of the successful countries in South-East Asia: for example, the very well-known attitude in Japan where there is a recognition between employees and employers that if the company is successful so too will be the employees and that if the company is not successful people's jobs are at risk. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Crane said, it entrenches the them and us position&mdash;`East is East, and West is West, and never the twain shall meet'. We do not want that. No-one wants that. Yet it goes down the line of the ACTU because the ACTU and the trade union movement have a vested interest in maintaining that split between the two. They would like the people who work for companies to believe that they are employed simply because of their union membership, not because of the fact that they work for someone who has made an investment and who wants to have a cooperative work force which is to the benefit of all concerned. I would be interested in the figure, if the parliamentary secretary could get it for me from the department, of just how many lockouts there have been over the last 10 years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that concerns me about this amendment&mdash;there is a complete section on it&mdash;is in regard to immunity from civil liberty, which means that we entrench the right to strike and the right to lockout under certain conditions. There is talk about a bargaining period. When written notice may be given before the start of the bargaining period of either a lockout or a strike, whatever it might be, it seems to be open ended. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that when framing industrial relations policy for any country, we would look at those countries whose policy has been successful as compared with those where it has not been successful. A classic example is the United States system at the time of the end of three-year agreements. It is not unusual to find that there is either a six-month strike or a six-month lockout or a combination of both, which is not to the advantage of the business, or to the employees, or to the country as a whole. It would be particularly disadvantageous for a country such as Australia with our high unemployment and our current account deficit continuing to run at an enormous deficit to go down that track. I fear that we will follow the United States line, which is not the one to follow in this particular instance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would surely be more productive if we were to follow the Japanese line. It is not that we should copy anyone in particular, but when we look at other countries and see what they have done we look to see why they are successful. It is not a matter of union bashing because those countries which are successful have company based unions. They are all working towards a common cause. </PARA>

I do not know any company that does not have the ambition to grow, to become more successful, to become more productive and to employ more people. It is the natural nature of man and woman; satisfaction comes from growing and becoming successful. It used not to be the case in this country.

I was under the impression that this amendment actually reduced that burden by removing the possibility that an employer could contemplate industrial action by mistakenly not notifying just one employee that that employer would no longer have immunity under the negotiating period while negotiations were being conducted to arrive at a single business certified agreement. If I was mistaken, perhaps we ought to look carefully at what the amendment does. I would appreciate the parliamentary secretary's advice as to what this amendment does.

<PARA>In this place tonight we have already run the merit of secret ballots and having a bit of democracy in industrial relations in this country. This amendment has become even more crucial in view of the amendment that was just carried in this place. People in the workplace who go on strike&mdash;in many cases, at a significant cost to themselves&mdash;should make the decision to do so and should not have it made for them by the hierarchy within the union organisations. In practice, in most instances&mdash;not all&mdash;the latter is what happens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment has reached a new dimension since we had our last debate, not in terms of democracy but in terms of its importance to this legislation and this clause. Once again, it will be a test of whether the government, the Greens or Senator Bell, on behalf of the Democrats, believe in industrial democracy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not sufficient to hark back to the previous section in the 1988 act where the commission may order a ballot, because the situations in which that would occur would be very minimal. One might well pose this question to Senator Sherry: how many times has the commission ordered a secret ballot before people operating under an award&mdash;which can be much greater in number than the coverage of one award&mdash;have determined whether they will go out on strike?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I well remember about five or six years ago meeting some people who happened to live in the unit next-door to me in Como in Perth. It turned out that they happened to be a couple of union organisers who were working with one of the mining companies in the Pilbara. They were absolutely irate because their workplace was out because of a dispute which was related to their union in Wollongong. They said, `What the hell is going on here? Our people are up there in the dust, the heat and the flies with an opportunity to earn good money, which is why they go there. It is an opportunity which they take, and they work long, hard hours in difficult conditions'. I have no problem in acknowledging that. But when they should have been up there doing their job, they were out on a prolonged strike over something that had occurred in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there had been a secret ballot of the membership of that organisation, I have no doubt that that strike would never have occurred. The individuals who work in the mining industry in Western Australia far outnumber&mdash;probably 10 to one; I do not know and I am not going to even try to predict it&mdash;the number of people in a similar situation in New South Wales. That emphasises very clearly the importance of the fact that, if there is to be a strike, there be an opportunity for all who will be involved and economically hurt&mdash;including the families, who have to meet their hire purchase commitments, housing payments and all the things that everyday Australians have to meet&mdash;to vote in a secret ballot to determine whether they want to hurt themselves, because that is what they are basically doing from an economic or financial point of view. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Given that we failed to preclude the right to strike in the writing in of this legislation, it is absolutely essential that this opposition amendment, which provides for a secret ballot to be implemented before strike action is undertaken, be included in the legislation. Senator Crane has laid out fairly clearly the need for that. It is essential to ensure that industrial action is taken on a democratic basis and that it is genuinely the will of the employees who are required to embark upon that action, and not simply an action taken at the behest of union leaders or an active minority of employees.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the past we have all seen the situation where public meetings of employees are called to discuss an industrial dispute, and a decision to strike is taken there and then at that meeting as a result of a vote taken on the basis of a show of hands. We all know what happens then: intimidation, thuggery and pressure is brought to bear to ensure that a majority vote in favour of that industrial action is obtained with that public show of hands. That in no way represents a genuine expression of opinion by employees. The only way that there can be a genuine expression of opinion by employees is by having a secret ballot conducted in accordance with the rules laid down by the commission. That will avoid having the vote taken on a public basis at the meeting, and it will avoid the opportunity for intimidation to be applied to the people attending the meeting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That must be an absolute requirement. If this right to strike is to be retained in this legislation there must also be an absolute requirement written into the legislation to ensure that before any such industrial action can be taken a secret ballot is taken of the employees who are potentially embarking upon that industrial action to ensure that it is the genuine will and wish of a majority of those employees that such action be taken. They must be cognisant of the costs that will be borne by them and their families as well as the costs they will cause their employer and ultimately the capacity of that employer and business to provide them with better standards and remuneration and enable them to retain their jobs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I support the amendment moved by Senator Crane. I make it clear from the outset that employers do not want to lock people out and they do not want strikes. In the main, employees and their families do not want strikes and they do not want to be locked out. I think that should be the basis of industrial relations legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been argued that if employees have a secret ballot on a strike it does not necessarily mean that they will vote against the strike. I agree with that. Senator Burns gave an interesting example with the Gladstone power station. In that case a secret ballot resulted in the employees deciding to continue to strike. My answer to that is, so be it. If that is the case, so be it. At least it gives them the opportunity to express their views without concern. It may not be heavy handed stuff from union delegates that makes employees strike but it certainly can be peer group pressure particularly in isolated areas. I am sure Senator Sherry would know about that given the experience he has had in Tasmania. People would prefer not to attend a meeting rather than put their hands up in support of a certain type of industrial action that they did not want. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were talking before about Japan and industrial relations. I was in Japan when there was a strike. It involved one of the major shipbuilders. When I asked why the strike was on I was told that the company had cut back the working week from six days to 5 1/2 days. The employees were on strike because they felt it would diminish their productivity and thus reduce their competitiveness on world markets. That is a very different attitude and is interesting because it relates to the interjection that Senator Margetts made about the attitudes of people when there is a close relationship between a company and its employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A classic example of the right to a secret ballot occurred recently in my old industry. It decided to take five days off because the miners union decided that it did not like the price at which BHP sold coal to Turkey. So our biggest export industry went on strike for what ended up being three days because of the existence of sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act. The threat came from those companies that were not selling coal to Turkey. They were asking, `How come we are not involved?'. They were then threatening action under sections 45D and 45E. They did not pursue it. As is the case with most of the 45D and 45E actions, they were never pursued to the damages stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anyone involved in the union movement will know&mdash;I see Senator Burns is in the chamber and I welcome him back&mdash;that the stories are legion. I can remember one union leader telling me that he had a gathering of the men, as he called it, and said to them, `Comrades, the decision is whether we strike on Friday or Monday'. One of the workers got up and said, `Shouldn't the question be, do we have a strike?'. The union leader said, `You are out of order. The question is whether we strike on Friday or Monday?'. That is the sort of thing that went on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt that it will continue unless people are given the opportunity to express their views. Prior to Senator Burns coming into the chamber, I mentioned the example he gave of the Gladstone power station. The opposition has no concerns with the fact that if people decide by secret ballot to go on strike, so be it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Repeating what Senator Chapman said, having lost the right to strike clause, we would prefer to have a bill that is a deterrent to strikes and lockouts rather than one that encourages those. Having failed that, we believe the most democratic way to approach it and to improve legislation&mdash;which, I suppose one would argue, cannot be improved too much&mdash;would be to give people, before they pull a strike, the chance to vote on whether they want to go on strike or not.</PARA>

The imposition of a compulsory ballot in all circumstances is unrealistic, but we strongly support the capacity of the commission&mdash;this is what we rely on&mdash;to determine if and when a secret ballot is necessary.

If my question is impossible to answer, I think the AIRC will have some pretty pertinent questions to answer, because if it does not keep a record of what it does, then there are some problems.

As far as I am aware, it relates to a section of the Industrial Relations Act that has been very sparingly used. In fact, there is no evidence or information to suggest that that situation will change. So I find it interesting that the government uses the argument that our position is too rigid when I feel our position is a democratic right of individuals, when, in fact, the government's bill  makes the whole thing so darn rigid and puts up so many barriers and things in the way that, in the end, there will be very few, if any, enterprise flexibility agreements.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>This amendment applies to pages 58 and 59 of the bill. It aims to ensure that the creation of the new bargaining division will not create debilitating divisions between the award and the bargaining streams of the Industrial Relations Commission. As the bill is presently drafted, the provisions give the vice-president of the bargaining division an effective veto over decisions by the president to make available commissioners to help the core members of the bargaining divisions cope with the high workload periods. Our amendment would remove that right of veto and leave the decision solely in the hands of the president. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats are concerned that the new division raises a real potential for conflict and friction within the commission. The interface between the award and the bargaining streams could easily become unwieldy and inefficient, giving employers and unions opportunities to play procedural games with this process, making a to-and-fro effect between the two streams. In our view, the amendment that we propose would give the president a more appropriate degree of authority to ensure that the commission operates in a cohesive and productive fashion under the new arrangements. If there was ever anything designed to stymie the progress of the new bargaining division, it would be this potential friction between the two streams. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had initially proposed that the president assign the core members of the new division. However, we have been made fully aware of the administrative difficulties that such a proposition would throw up. As we know, the minister appoints members of the commission and he will clearly be appointing some members on the strength of their conciliation and bargaining skills. It is reasonable for the minister to expect that those members would be used in the role they are appointed to play. It would undermine the purpose of the minister's appointments if those new members could be assigned elsewhere. For that reason, we have replaced our previous amendments with the version we now have here, intending to achieve the purpose that I have previously outlined. </PARA>

We were endeavouring to restrict it to a situation which involved a demarcation dispute and the preference would be granted to a union member over a non-union member.

<PARA>I am pleased Senator Kernot is in the chamber at the moment because it is an amendment with which she has particular identification. This amendment requires that the minister commission and table an annual survey on the impact of enterprise bargaining, particularly on women, part-time employees and immigrants. This particular provision, in our view, is an essential device for monitoring the impact of enterprise bargaining on workers who may have low bargaining power. How that is defined is perhaps a matter of some degree of difficulty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But in the discussions leading up to the introduction of the Industrial Relations Reform Bill there was a contention that some people who did not have the skills, the opportunity to develop skills, or the efficient representation to bring those skills to the bargaining table could well miss out on wage rises that were promised by the enterprise bargaining process&mdash;wage rises, improvements in conditions or flexibility of employment. It is quite often the case that some of those people who are in such positions may need that extra flexibility to be more productive in the workplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These fears had been expressed not only to the Democrats&mdash;I would be the first to admit that&mdash;but also to the government, to employer groups and to the committees that conducted inquiries into sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act and the Industrial Relations Reform Bill itself. Those opinions and concerns having been expressed, we believe that it is important to assess the actual impact of enterprise bargaining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In some instances the fears could be shown by statistics to be unfounded. But we all know that statistics can be presented in a number of formats and in a variety of ways to suit the arguments of those who use them. So the Democrats are very careful not to assume that one particular point of view prevails in this area. We want this survey to be commissioned and presented to parliament so that it can be discussed and evaluated in full. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A recent survey by the Department of Industrial Relations found that only 15 per cent of women had won pay rises through enterprise bargaining compared with 24 per cent of men and that, while such women may have access to pay rises through other means, the growing emphasis on bargaining will increasingly restrict other options as time goes on. We believe that it is essential that any regressive impact on workers with low bargaining power is identified promptly. One way of doing that is through this device of the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is for that reason that we are moving this amendment, which achieves the commissioning of that report. It also brings about some degree of ongoing monitoring of this process through the parliament. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have the same problems as expressed by Senator Crane on this late amendment, the insertion of which has made it difficult to keep up with these amendments. There is a clause that refers to no automatic flow-on of certain awards and agreements. Award flow-ons have been a major problem for a long time in this country because they have not recognised the capacity of certain industries to pay. Looking back over the past 10 or 15 years, a lot of industries have been arguably destroyed by award flow-ons. The current Prime Minister (Mr Keating) may well have used that argument to describe the activities of a union leader in the metal trades industry back in 1982-83.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>The amendments to which I refer relate to clauses 38, 39 and 43 and schedule 3, standing in my name. The Greens are very pleased that the government has at last improved the operation of the boycott provisions of the 1974 Trade Practices Act so as to more readily exclude political and environmental boycotts. Such boycotts should never have been covered in the first place, but at least now the situation has been improved. Nevertheless, the Trades and Labor Council in Western Australia has unanimously expressed its disquiet about the impact of the remaining sections on boycotts. The use of the legal sanctions in these sections against workers who express dissatisfaction with their working conditions has the effect of allowing employers to avoid dealing with the subject matter in a proper way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act turn worker dissatisfaction into a legalistic argument. It actually restricts and often removes entirely the capacity for workers to directly address the real problems. Robe River is a useful case study. Issues that affect the lives of workers on and off the job have been treated with contempt by the management of that company. The only way workers can get the managers of that company to the negotiating table is to take industrial action. As a result of sections 45D and 45E, as soon as workers take industrial action the matter is taken out of their hands and is handed over to lawyers. This is hardly efficient. It removes the capacity of the work force to deal directly with its employer by transferring a dispute from the workplace to a court of law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be cruel but I would like to remind the government that before this particular secondary boycott provision was in place there was not anarchy within the workplace. It is perhaps even crueller to remind the government that, from the 1991 Australian Labor Party platform resolutions and rules as approved by the 39th National Conference in Hobart, the Labor Party said that trade unions&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">provide for a legal framework to ensure that registered organisations and community organisations and their members are able to exercise their right to take industrial action and other legitimate forms of demonstration consistent with the principles of freedom of association, without legal penalties such as the secondary boycott provisions of the Trade Practices Act and common law actions in tort.</PARA>
<PARA>In fact, the Labor Party has asked for secondary boycott legal provisions to be withdrawn. We all know, as has been argued again and again by the business interests who appeared before the sections 45D and 45E industrial relations committee, that it is always possible for boycott provisions which specifically cause damage to one industry by another to be prosecuted under common law. So it does not allow one industry to damage another just for the sake of being nasty. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In order to express our deep concern for the situation as it exists, and as it is likely to continue with the secondary boycott provisions, the Greens WA are requesting that secondary boycott provisions be removed from both the Industrial Relations Act and the Trade Practices Act. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it is very sensible but also predictable. Of course, one cannot deal with these amendments which are before us now without looking at the whole concept of what the Greens, through Senator Margetts, are trying to do. With them having been described as&mdash;and I do not say this disrespectfully&mdash;`the gumnut twins', I think one can say that they are well and truly out amongst the gumnuts now in dealing with this. In short, what they are saying is that employers should have no protection or effective reform against any type of boycott action.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We can go into a whole range of matters on the effective mechanisms for protection against boycott actions, including restrictions on tort actions and others. But, of course, two features of sections 45D and 45E which came out in the inquiry into those sections of the Trade Practices Act were, firstly, their speed and effectiveness when employers were forced into a position of having to use those provisions; and, secondly&mdash;and this came out very clearly and is something which I am sure Senator Bell will remember&mdash;that the process was quick compared with a common law action, which is argued as the alternative to a tort action, through the supreme courts. The costs were only 60 per cent of those for a court action, providing that one only had to take out an action in one supreme court. There is much opinion and evidence to suggest that if we were caught in a situation without the protection of sections 45D and 45E, we would find ourselves in a position where we would have to take it out in a number of the supreme courts around the country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of sections 45D and 45E is to allow business to go about its legal everyday process of doing business without being boycotted out of existence. I believe that that is a legitimate position for businesses to find themselves in. The sections have also been used on at least one occasion by one union against another because it was aggrieved&mdash;and that evidence was also presented to the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But at the end of the day, when we are dealing with industrial relations, we have to ask ourselves whether or not we want an industrial relations system or the freedom and the right to go about our business; whether we want that to be handled through the law of the land or through one group of people being able to hold another group of people or individuals to ransom. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On this side of the chamber we would argue that the processes which are now in place have served this nation particularly effectively and they have prevented a lot of industrial disputation. As an example, they have certainly prevented the situation whereby we would have had to go back to the wharves and load our live sheep. But that is not the only example. It extends into the coal industry; it extends into the iron ore industry; it extends into such things as perishables. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can well remember the situation when the cauliflower growers down at Manjimup&mdash;and I would remind Senator Margetts and Senator Chamarette that they got a few votes down there or in the proximity of that area at the last election&mdash;put their cauliflowers on the wharves in Fremantle to be loaded onto a particular vessel that was there at that time. There was a boycott placed on those cauliflowers and without the speed and effectiveness of section 45D, those vegetables would have rotted on the wharves. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on this side of the chamber believe that it is absolutely crucial under sections 45D and 45E to have an effective remedy&mdash;an injunction&mdash;so the process of exporting those cauliflowers, for example, can continue. Had that not been in place at that time, the other processes in law would have been too slow. Not only would the cauliflower growers have been hurt severely&mdash;and they have legitimate rights and were far removed from the industrial dispute&mdash;but also our Asian friends, who would have been the recipients of those cauliflowers which would have been safe once they had been put in storage in the ship under proper cooling conditions, would have been disadvantaged and hurt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not only is it giving those people down at Manjimup a real biff under the ear, but it is also damaging our cauliflower trade. It was very much in its infancy and developing into Singapore and&mdash;dare I say it&mdash;Malaysia. The horticultural industry in Western Australia has been expanding by about 2 1/2 to three times on a year by year basis. It is continuing to expand. We are developing markets into Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That injunction, as I understand it, still remains in place and has been a very effective mechanism to stop what I call this rogue behaviour. It does not prevent the people who had the disputation in the first place from using the proper processes to resolve their dispute, but it prevents the cauliflower growers from being damaged and the consumers or recipients of those cauliflowers being damaged&mdash;as well as the people who developed that export industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This example with perishables might seem to be very dramatic, but the principle applies right through, in terms of the importance of sections 45D and 45E in ensuring, firstly, that we protect our markets at the end; secondly, that we protect those businesses developing markets in the middle; and, thirdly, that we protect the producers at the other end of the scale. I want to emphasise that sections 45D and 45E are a proper mechanism for resolving these types of issues so they can be dealt with in a sensible, proper manner. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The alternative model is one of holding people to ransom and saying, `Do what I say', as a gun is pointed at their heads. That will not resolve the issue. Inevitably, this model will go out of the process. The government's alternatives do not satisfactorily resolve this situation. They would certainly have difficulty resolving the type of situation I described. When they go, this country will go back to people having no option but to take the law into their own hands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is what the loading of the live sheep issue was all about. That is what the effect will be with the cauliflower growers I have mentioned. Extraordinary damage will be done to our coal, iron ore and nickel industries&mdash;and others added one after the other. It is absolute lunacy by the Greens, the government or the Democrats that we are even contemplating removing these sections&mdash;or fiddling with them on the edges and saying we will come back to these aspects. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is not the case as we understood it, but we are prepared to go along with it. The Australian Democrats will not support this amendment as proposed. I understand Senator Margetts's concerns with regard to the opportunity for sections 45D and E of the Trade Practices Act, as they have recently been interpreted, to deny the participation of environment, community or any other groups which want to protest about a number of matters and which have now recently been threatened with and effectively intimidated from taking part in such actions. But I believe that to delete sections 45D and E of the Trade Practices Act in their entirety would have other great far-reaching effects which would result in perhaps greater trauma than is being effected by their current, I suggest, misinterpretation anyway.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats have attempted to redress the fact that these sections of the Trade Practices Act have been interpreted to apply to areas for which we believe they were not originally intended. Our reaction to that has been to support the removal of the industrial aspects of those particular provisions into the Industrial Relations Act and to there apply those measures which are appropriate under that regime. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To remove them in their entirety would, as I understood Senator Crane to say, permit any form of boycott action. If that were so, we do not have to use very much imagination to reach the situation where virtually a frontier attitude would prevail&mdash;a cowboy situation where we would have a couple of enterprises facing off at dawn saying, `This town ain't big enough for both of us'. This sort of ridiculous stand-off is not too far from reality, because if commercial boycotts could be permitted, then we would have the sort of mayhem which is seen in any community where there is a lack of regulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The regulation which subsections 45D and 45E bring to the supervision of commercial competition is appropriate. What is not appropriate is when those particular provisions have been used to prevent genuine protests, on the basis of environmental concerns and community matters unrelated to industrial matters, which are not part of a commercial boycott but are the only action left for people with concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To be provocative, I might say that in the instance of the live sheep loading, my interpretation is that this is not an industrial matter relating to the working conditions or wage and salary payments of those involved; rather, it is an animal welfare consideration. That is the core of the matter, and however it was translated is in fact irrelevant. I would suggest that the primary motivation was animal welfare, and that whatever opportunities could be taken were taken to address it from that perspective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it important that the opportunity to take that action is retained. With that in mind, the Democrats have followed the path that we have to ensure that those aspects of subsections 45D and 45E which apply to industrial action are preserved within the Industrial Relations Act, and that the interpretation is clear that those aspects of the Industrial Relations  Act  do  not  pertain to  actions by environmental or community concern groups. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is with that understanding that we see no need to repeal subsections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act in their entirety. We see many good reasons for the retention within the Trade Practices Act of those aspects which govern commercial competition. As Senator Crane mentioned, there have been circumstances where unions have taken action against unions under these provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say in passing that I hope there is some way&mdash;although I cannot see it under 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act&mdash;by which we are able to look at a government instrumentality, or a quasi-government instrumentality, as it has become, namely, the Federal Airports Corporation. It is interpreting its role in the competitive business of airport car rental firms in a thoroughly improper way. If there were any way I could interpret 45D and 45E to prevent the Federal Airports Corporation from continuing its persecution of small businesses trying to conduct their affairs at airports, I would.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In defence of the Greens (WA) amendments, one of the reasons why this request has been made very strongly by the labour movement in Western Australia is that it lives daily with the implications of organisations or corporations which have the money and the resources to provide Queen's Counsel whenever they feel they can intimidate their workers into submission. This is not the case with every employer, but the provisions exist and while they do exist this will continue to happen.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we are pleased that some provisions for the right to strike have been included, the secondary boycott exemptions that are written into the new legislation are very narrow and limited to the bargaining period. I have been told of examples, especially in remote areas, where it has been very difficult for workers to fight a problem, even if it is something which may affect their health or perhaps even their lives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One example was a dangerous truck at one workplace. The matter went through an inquiry stage but not an inquest, so much of the information did not get out into the public arena. People in other workplaces which had similar, but not the same, equipment were not able, for their own workplace safety, to take their own strike action to ask their own companies to take action. They would have had to go to court to prove that there was a connection between what they were being asked to do and what the other company asked its workers to do. A worker was in fact killed in an accident involving a piece of equipment which was inappropriately altered by the company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So whilst we are pleased with some of the changes that have been made in relation to the secondary boycott provisions, it is still foreseen that there will be occasions when the provisions of this legislation will be used against workers who have legitimate concerns, simply because it can be argued that it is something from another workplace and not their own and that it will be counted as a boycott  rather  than  a  legitimate  primary strike. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are still fights to be fought but the workers must fight the legal system without access to the resources that are available to the large corporations. That is why we have been asked to undertake what we know is a flag-waving exercise&mdash;because these problems still have not been fully addressed by the provisions for secondary boycotts within this bill. </PARA>

The aim of the report was to evaluate and provide information on the role and impact of the Australian Heritage Commission regarding the conservation of native forest in Australia, with particular reference to the south-west forests of Western Australia and the WA AHC-CALM model for assessment of heritage values. This report is timely.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At a time when large tracts of native forest are under threat, there is a great need to accurately identify, and protect, wilderness areas, old growth forest and other areas of high conservation value. In the West Australian context, the AHC has done neither. While the AHC does not have a mandate to protect forests, it is expected to identify places to be included in the national estate and advise on matters relating on conservation, preservation and improvement of the national estate. However, by having to take into account forest management, its independence has been compromised. It has not adequately nor accurately identified forest areas that should be protected and, by its acceptance of CALM's management practices, it has implicitly endorsed the destruction of national estate forest by logging and burning.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are some things that the AHC has done well. There is a need for a credible, nationwide inventory of high conservation value wilderness, old growth and other kinds of forest and the AHC has an important contribution to make to this inventory. AHC identification of such areas, and similar inventories, play a vital role in the preservation of our natural and cultural heritage. The AHC provides a valuable source of advice and information to governments and others involved in planning decisions. The method of regional assessment developed in WA is an improvement on the former, ad hoc examination of individual areas as nominations were made and it allows for the better identification of a particular area's value.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, in the West Australian context, insufficient and outdated data, the lack of onsite confirmation of data and lack of public consultation means that the joint assessment does not comprehensively assess national estate values. There are additional areas of immense value that will not have been identified in this assessment. Further if the AHC is to be effective, it must be able to independently assess the conservation value of places of outstanding natural or cultural beauty. Involving the commission in management decisions, as was the case in WA, places that independence at risk. As Mr Rosauer points out:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"Instead of producing an independent audit of conservation values, to be weighed against other needs and priorities, the AHC has issued its advice `pre-weighed', with compromises to logging already incorporated, through its endorsement for CALM's management plans and timber production levels."</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In conclusion, the AHC assessment process could make a valuable contribution to the preservation of our native forests. However the WA AHC/CALM assessment process, is a dangerous model and, contrary to  the Government's recommendations in the `One Nation' statement, it should not be adopted by other states. Further, there is little point in identifying areas that need protection if we do not provide for that protection and allow them to be logged. State governments in WA, Victoria, NSW, Tasmania and Queensland have done little to stop logging activities that destroy the value of these areas. The onus is now clearly on the Federal Government to implement the National Forest Policy Statement and employ all its available powers to protect the AHC listed places before they are irrevocably lost.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) DSH interest rates are set in legislation. They are designed to be concessional against prevailing market rates and fixed for the life of the loan. The interest rates on DSH loans vary according to the amounts of advances and when they are made, but the maximum rate on loans, other than supplementary loans, is currently 6.85%. This rate was introduced when the Westpac Bank acquired the lending rights in 1987. Loans granted prior to that had fixed interest rates as follows:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) None. Successive Governments have seen fit not to adjust the concessional DSH interest rate in line with the variations in market rates. If the Government was to tie the DSH interest rate to changes in market rates, when interest rates increase, the DSH rate would increase to more than 6.85% per annum.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) Yes. DSH borrowers are able to make prepayments off their loan. For those with a tiered loan, any such payments are apportioned across the tiers so that each tier reduces proportionately .</PARA>
