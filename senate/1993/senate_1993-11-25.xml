<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. The guidelines confer important discretions on the minister which are not subject to review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The explanatory statement advises that such review will eventually be provided by act. In the meantime, however, the guidelines are scheduled to commence on 1 January 1994 without any review. The committee has written to the minister about this apparent defect.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Guidelines confer discretions on both the Minister and the Secretary or an authorised officer. The Ministerial discretions appear to affect personal and commercial rights to a significant degree. The Explanatory Statement, however, advises that new child care legislation presently being drafted by the Australian Law Reform Commission will provide for AAT review of ministerial decisions. This is an appropriate safeguard. Nevertheless, the Guidelines commence on 1 January 1994. The Committee considers that it would be appropriate to amend the Guidelines to provide for AAT review from 1 January 1994 and has written to the Minister accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, the Explanatory Statement gives no such assurance about decisions of the Secretary or an authorised officer. The Committee accepts that these discretions appear to be less important than those exercisable by the Minister. Nevertheless, the Committee has sought advice on whether AAT review would also be suitable for these decisions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Pursuant to contingent notice and at the request of the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, Senator Hill, I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That so much of the standing orders be suspended as would prevent Senator Hill moving a motion relating to the conduct of the business of the Senate, namely a motion to give precedence to General Business notice of motion no. 481 standing in the name of Senator Patterson for this day, relating to an order for the production of documents by the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services (Senator McMullan) concerning the Australian Artists' Creative Fellowship.</PARA>
<PARA>I have put forward a notice of motion requesting information about details of the awarding of an Australian Artists' Creative Fellowship and, in particular, an unprecedented awarding of a second fellowship, which is permissible under the guidelines but which has been questioned by a number of people. I believe that the material, if it were to be tabled, would provide us with the opportunity of examining the awarding of those fellowships in detail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McMullan yesterday brought up an unbelievable furphy when he said that these scholarships are less per annum than our salaries. Our salaries are determined by an independent tribunal. Sometimes we do not always agree with that tribunal and we change the decision, not always in our favour, but that tribunal is independent, it is open, it is public and it is available for all to see. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These scholarships were set up and initiated by the Prime Minister, Mr Keating. As we have discovered, Mr Keating suggested the first advisory panel. Senator McMullan said yesterday, `It cannot happen by a process of osmosis'. It does not happen by a process of osmosis, but there are some question marks hanging over that first panel that was established in the late 1980s because every single one of the seven persons that Mr Keating suggested was amongst the seven that Mr Holding recommended to the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke. One would question whether that is an open and appropriate process. The arts community may have come up with alternative suggestions as to how to determine a panel. That is not casting aspersions on the panel or the people who have been on the panels over time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I have been questioning is the process&mdash;the process by which the panels are appointed and the process by which these awards have been determined. There is some question mark over the accountability in terms of whether minutes have been kept and whether we can know about those scholarships in detail so that the parliament, the public and the arts community can be assured that these prestigious awards are awarded with all due processes being fulfilled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McMullan indicated some concerns the government had about providing information on principles of privacy. In redrafting our notice of motion, I have attempted to ensure, and I believe I have ensured, that an individual's privacy will be maintained. We respect that, but we also believe that the parliament has a right to examine those documents and to ensure that the concerns that have been expressed in large numbers to me by people in the arts community are given due process and due consideration. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will reiterate briefly what I said yesterday before I go on to make some new points. This debate about whether certain documents should be tabled is not the orthodox conflict that we have over such matters, and Senator Patterson has made that clear in her remarks. In this instance, it is not a case of the executive defending its privileges in conflict with the legislature. That is not the issue here today. The issue here today is the rights of a citizen compared to the rights of the Senate. I am not arguing that the Senate does not have the power to seek these documents&mdash;I think it does&mdash;I am arguing that it should not exercise that power which it has because it would not be the appropriate thing to do. There have been other times when we have had debates of great principle about whether such documents can be tabled, but that is not in contention.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So let us go to it. Let us look at the four things that are being sought. There is the application from Mr Tozer. I welcome the fact that it is now qualified in the way Senator Patterson referred to. Were it to be carried, I acknowledge that this is a better version, from my point of view, than that which was previously sought. So I acknowledge that point. Nevertheless, what extra information are we seeking apart from that which I have already tabled? What we need to know is&mdash;and Senator Patterson has not said anything other than that this is what she is seeking&mdash;what were the purposes for which Mr Tozer sought this application?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is really not the issue for the Senate. The issue for the Senate is: what were the reasons for which he was given the application? The accountability requires us to know why the grant was made to this person so we can check whether those conditions have been met. The reasons for which he was given the grant are explicitly stated in the documents which I tabled yesterday; both the reasons for the first grant and the second grant are given in detail. That is the decision that the Senate needs to know so it can check whether that has been properly done. So no argument has been put about what extra information is being sought under paragraph (i) other than it is some sort of fishing expedition in the hope there might be something smelly. The reasons for which the money has been given were explicitly stated in the documents tabled yesterday.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point concerns the minutes of the meeting. I have said that to the best of my knowledge there are no minutes, so I cannot table those. It is not that I resist tabling them; they do not exist. Did they exist, we would need to know what decisions that body made in regard to those matters about which we are concerned, and they are explicitly covered in the report of that committee in its recommendations to the Australia Council. </PARA>

Senator Kemp should not lower the standard. I do not agree with Senator Patterson but she put her case properly. Senator Kemp is just being sordid and sleazy and he should keep out of it. We have the circumstances here. There should be minutes but there are not. Every relevant fact of the committee's view is on the public record and tabled in this parliament. So I cannot do paragraph (ii).</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concerning paragraph (iii), the documents pertaining to the appointment of members have been tabled. I do not accept the point that Senator Patterson wishes to make. There is nothing wrong with a minister expressing a view about who should be on a committee: every committee is appointed by the cabinet. The Australia Council is appointed by the cabinet, on my recommendation. It might have been cleverer if the minister had rung up and said, `Clyde, why do you not do this?' and there would have been no record. But he did not do that, he did the proper thing: he sent a written proposal and we have tabled it. To the best of my knowledge there are no other documents, but certainly that which the honourable senator most wants is there. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With paragraph (iv), concerning the names and addresses of the people, the names are in the documents I tabled yesterday. The only thing we have not got is where they live. Do we have to go and knock on doors? Is that what the Senate wants? Why do we need the addresses? What a ridiculous question. However, if people want the addresses, they are all well-known citizens, why do they not ring them up and say, `Excuse me, where do you live?'. But why would the Senate want all of this tabled? Of course the Senate is entitled to know who the people are who made this decision, and I tabled that information yesterday. It is all on the public record. It is so much on the public record that the people about whom these question marks allegedly exist have been protesting to Senator Patterson, saying, `Why are you saying these things about us?'. So no-one is in any doubt about who they are. They are writing letters to&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We believe that we should suspend standing orders so that we can discuss Senator Patterson's motion. We would like to discuss it for a very short time, once standing orders have been suspended. I think it does need to come to a vote. Firstly, we support these fellowships. We believe these fellowships are very important. This is a very good thing that the government has done and the fellowships should continue. We also understand and agree with the privacy considerations that the minister has expressed. They are very legitimate concerns.</PARA></TALK.START>

We can get the information through freedom of information and, even if we cannot, it is the Senate's right to have it and nobody is disagreeing with that. We believe that the privacy considerations are so important that they should not be disclosed, but that they should be made available to honourable senators, and that is what Senator Patterson has asked for. The suggestion that all personal details be deleted from the applications being made available is a good one, and we agree with that. That should certainly happen. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, Senator McMullan says that the minutes of that meeting do not exist. If they do not exist, fine, we cannot have them. There is no question about that. Thirdly, there have been some documents tabled and that is excellent. We have seen those and they are very interesting. Fourthly, in relation to the addresses, we agree that they should not be disclosed, but that they should be made available in case there is a problem.

<PARA>I do not want to hold up the chamber for much longer because we have been debating this issue and I know that the Australian Democrats want to move along as well. I am not going on a witch-hunt in this exercise. Grave concerns have been expressed to me, which may or may not be right, and I want to allay the concerns of a number of people in the arts community about the way in which the scholarships have been awarded. I repeat that I am in no way casting aspersions on those who have made the decision and I am in no way casting aspersions on those who have received the awards, despite what has been said in newspapers in letters to the editor. None of us like to examine closely these sorts of things because people sometimes feel offended or feel as if aspersions are being cast on them. Let me say on the public record that I do not in any way cast aspersions on the people who have been involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I am saying is that, in some people's minds, a cloud hangs over the awarding of these fellowships.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let me say to Senator McMullan that I know that. Those people have expressed concern and they were quite surprised when that was tabled. It did not appear to be open and clear-cut for many people in the arts community. Other concerns have been expressed. To have it cleared up in my mind and then to put it to rest, once those documents are available I can say to the community, `I do not believe your concerns are justifiable. I have examined the documents'. Because we have put some caveats on the information and on the way it can be used, I will not disclose that information. I have been privy to information before that Senator Tate gave me and I have not abused that privilege, nor would I ever abuse that privilege.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I believe that it will enable me, as the representative of many of those people who have rung me, to make a judgment about whether this issue should be pursued further or whether they ought to be told that people tend to get offended or upset if they do not get grants and that some people will make complaints that are not legitimate. Significant concerns have been expressed about the awarding of the second fellowship to Mr Tozer. In fact, the guidelines say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In exceptional circumstances a new Fellowship may be granted at the end of the first. This could occur if a Fellowship proved to be especially rewarding for the artist and the community at large. No artist will be able to receive more than two Fellowships.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt that Mr Tozer is an outstanding pianist and has a world reputation, but we believe, from the documents Senator McMullan tabled yesterday, that Mr Tozer was planning to open a music school. That was one of the objectives of using the $200,000 grant over a period of four years. We want to know whether that music school has been established. According to my advice, it has not. It is purported that Mr Tozer apparently bought a property in Queanbeyan for that purpose. That property is being sold on 27 November, this weekend. If that is what he said in his application that he was going to do, it would appear that he has not actually achieved it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If there were exceptional circumstances for him then to be awarded a further sum of more than $300,000 over a five-year period, Mr Tozer will have had, over the two fellowships, more than half a million dollars. That is a considerable sum of money. Either we must be able to ensure that that money has been awarded on the basis that he set out to do a task and he achieved that task or we need to know the process by which that decision was made. Senator McMullan has admitted that there were no minutes for the first meeting, which is very peculiar and bizarre. That involved $1.4 million of taxpayers' money and we have no minutes to show how that money was allocated. </PARA>

Senator McMullan says that he cannot provide that. Okay, he has got that on the public record and he can record that when he responds to the motion I am putting forward for the return to order. But I would hope that this is a lesson for all people when they set up grants like this&mdash;that at least we have appropriate minute taking and accountability for taxpayers' money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn now to the issue about documents pertaining to the appointment of members to the original advisory panel. I am presuming that Senator McMullan is saying that they are the only documents that are available and that Mr Keating, when he was Treasurer, did not actually write to arts communities asking for suggestions of names. I do not know whether he did. I would like Senator McMullan to ask whether there are any more documents about whether Mr Keating sought advice from the arts communities about people they thought were appropriate to make a decision on for very prestigious awards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not questioning the awards. We are not questioning whether artists of calibre ought to be awarded fellowships of this nature. What we are again saying is that we are questioning the process by which it has been done. I would like Senator McMullan to check and come back and say that there are no more documents. He said once that there were no more documents. Maybe he has checked that and he could give that answer in response to the return to order motion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The request for the names and the addresses of the members of the original advisory panel at the time when the first round of fellowships was awarded, I think, is a reasonable request because, again, it is for my information only and it will clarify any concerns that people have expressed to me about the original advisory panel and put paid to any concerns that people have expressed on that issue. It may be a totally minor matter; it may in fact be of reasonable concern&mdash;again about the process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think these things I have requested are unreasonable. They are not all for public information. I hope, if the Democrats agree with me, that we can see those documents; that the concerns can be put to rest; that people can be assured that the process of the awarding of these scholarships is totally above board; and that we can be confident that those people that apply are treated equally and fairly, as, I am sure, people on the committee would want.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome that; I was not clear until the honourable senator made that interjection. I welcome it because this process is undermining the credibility of those grants. We have had people coming in here to try to dramatise their point by saying, `Shock, horror, this person has got, in the first grant, $180,000 over four years and, in the second grant, $325,000 over five years'. That is why I made the point yesterday that one can dramatise, inflate and give a shock-horror impression about these figures. I made the point, which some people did not like, that it is significantly less than, for example, everybody here gets paid. I am trying to make the point that what we are saying is that these are fellowships that give some proper recognition to outstanding Australian artists who have made an enormous contribution, and enable them to make a subsequent and continuing contribution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome and strongly support the initiative that the then Treasurer, now Prime Minister (Mr Keating), took in initiating it. It is no secret that he took the initiative. Everybody calls them, in the vernacular, `the Keatings'. Maybe the Prime Minister wishes they would not call them that, because they are supposed to be the Australian Artists' Creative Fellowships and I assume, in time, they will take their proper name. But there has never been a secret that he took a very strong proprietorial interest in this proposal, that he regards it as important. I do, but I do not claim any credit for initiating it. I was merely a supporter. The Prime Minister initiated it when he was the Treasurer. Why should we be surprised that he took a bit of interest in how it works and made sure that it worked well?  I have to say to honourable senators that, when the extra people were appointed on this occasion, they will not find tonnes of documents. I did not write out to 100 people calling for nominations. I talked to a few people; formed a view about the balance of the committee and what areas of art form were needed; and made decisions and recommendations which were approved in the proper and normal process. So inadvertently, at best, we are putting in some jeopardy community support for these important fellowships. That was the first thing I wanted to say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thing is that, in the debate about the original motion and now, we are creating the potential that the Senate is going to try to reassess the way in which these grants are made. Think about that, because what we are talking about is the same process that applies to every Australia Council grant. There are many controversial ones through this arms-length peer review process. I suppose that, if I were making the grants, there are some I would not make. But I do not have the capacity as minister to say, `I do not like that. Change that decision'. I do have the capacity to ensure, and the Senate is entitled to ensure, that the process was proper. But the arms-length principle is in jeopardy when the legislature says, `We want to take to ourselves the capacity to assess whether this committee should have made this grant to this person'. When people ask if all the people were treated fairly, what they are saying is, `Should it instead have gone to somebody else?'. That is the necessary implication, and it is very serious&mdash;more serious than we are, to date, giving consideration to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very worried about the precedent we are setting here and I have to give some consideration to how I will react if the Senate carries this motion. But that is a problem for later today. What I am arguing now is whether or not we should carry the motion, and I am very strongly of the view that we should not. If we were going to put in jeopardy this great principle about arms-length and peer review&mdash;to which members of the opposition recently committed themselves, and I greatly welcome the fact; I am glad they did; but I am not sure if they understand what it means&mdash;there has got to be a pretty powerful reason. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the evidence that we need some extra information about Mr Tozer's application? The only thing that has been said&mdash;and it seems to blur&mdash;is that we will need to know whether some part of the reason he got the money related to the music centre. To the extent honourable senators need to know that is relevant, it is documented in what is already tabled, where it says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A centre of music excellence is a long-term aim.</PARA>
<PARA>But above that, it makes quite clear the reasons for the grant in the following words:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">to expand the musical horizons of the Australian community through additional recordings, the performance of works by lesser known composers and providing material for radio broadcasts.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, it would enable musical activity to be undertaken that commercially could not be undertaken, because nobody could make a living by performing that music. But it was considered culturally important that he had the opportunity to do so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whether that is a better cultural reason than the reason that would have applied to the person who came eighth and missed out, I do not know. I think Geoffrey Tozer is an outstanding pianist, but I am sure some of the other applicants who did not succeed were outstanding, too. What I am saying is that we should not be inquiring. If we are going to have an arms-length process and say, `Politicians are not going to put their arm into this process&mdash;</PARA>

What I am saying is that the arms-length peer review process does not mean that the government cannot do it but the opposition can. The parliament should not. It is no better and probably significantly worse&mdash;but certainly no better&mdash;for the arms-length peer review process to be conducted by a parliamentary committee. I think we should make it very clear to the arts community that that is what is envisaged here&mdash;that we are now going to have a parliamentary process for deciding the relative merits of who should have got an arts grant.

Of course, the honourable senator is entitled to ask, `Was there corruption?', but she has not just stuck to the process. She does not understand. I regret to say that she does not understand the implications of what she is doing. I am prepared to give her the benefit of the doubt that she does not understand and to say that, if she did understand, she would not do it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a source of serious concern, and will be to the whole of the Australian arts community when they understand it, that every time the Australia Council makes grants and people are concerned about it, we are opening the possibility for the parliament to go in and look at the relative merits, under the guise of process. Did anybody on the committee know the secretary of the Turkish theatrical society that got a grant? At the end of the day we will find out that they did not, but we will have had a day investigating whether that society should have got the grant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I often have to debate in public with media people the nature of grants made by the Australia Council. I have open to me always the option of saying, `I did not make it, it was at arms-length', but I am happy to go in to bat for these grants, even ones that I myself would not have made, to try to put the case for why we have to be tolerant and have diversity and recognise the right of the arts to be controversial and to do things with which even ministers for the arts are uncomfortable. I am happy to argue that. But how is it going to continue if the people making the decisions know that those decisions are going to come here, under the guise of review of process, and they are going to be attacked about that, and that the names and addresses&mdash;I accept that those opposite are trying to protect the addresses; I will come to addresses in a moment&mdash;of the people who made the committee are going to become the subject of debate? The names of people on those committees who made this decision are already public; they are not secret and were tabled in the parliament yesterday. So I am not quite sure why we are being asked to do it again. But their names are going to become the subject of debate and they are going to have to write letters to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Age</EMPHASIS> defending themselves, saying, `I acted properly and how dare you imply that I did not', as John Bryson did yesterday, or write to senators complaining about how their reputation has been impugned, as one of the others did yesterday. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do these things easily here and do not consider what it means to the people about whom we are doing it&mdash;what this means to Geoffrey Tozer, to Ross Gengos, to John Bryson, and to the other outstanding Australians on that committee. I am sure they are not ashamed of having their names on it, but there are question marks over this process. And then those opposite say, `We are not casting any aspersions on the people'. How can they say that the Prime Minister had undue influence on the decision but that the decision makers did not do anything wrong, when their brief is to act at arms-length? Either they are saying that they did something wrong or they might have done something wrong&mdash;or why are those opposite asking?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But the honourable senator's implication is that the Prime Minister had undue influence or that there was something else wrong. There cannot be something wrong with the process if every individual within it behaved properly. Those opposite cannot say, `These citizens, these distinguished Australian artists, all behaved with propriety and in accordance with the arms-length peer review process', because, if they acted properly in terms of arms-length and peer review, those imputations that those opposite are making cannot be true. They can be true only if they did not act in accordance with arms-length and peer review. That is why they are offended and that is what those opposite do not understand, and it is why we should not proceed any further down this track.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now want to go to the detail of the information. I will reiterate it only briefly because I said it in substance in my comments about why we should not suspend standing orders in the first place. I accept that people say that suspending standing orders to debate the motion is legitimate. I wish it were otherwise, but I understand that. However, it is different from actually carrying the motion. What possible public policy concern is served by making available the addresses of these people? Nobody has said that there is anything we are chasing about this. Were all these people shacked up together? Is that what we are trying to say? It is absurd. They are all on the electoral roll, if we need to know. I do not understand this. Why are we having a debate here about where Betty Churchill is? It seems bizarre. Why are we doing it? Not one reason has been put forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are chasing four documents. In regard to the first one, all the relevant information has been tabled, that is: why did he seek this money, why was he granted this money and did it relate to this music centre? To the extent that there is any information that is of proper public purpose&mdash;and I accept that the reason why he got the money is a proper public purpose for the Senate to know about&mdash;it is on the table. We have said that. The official reason and the form of the letter that went with it are on the public record. Nobody has said what extra information is being sought. That extra information is not denied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second document we are seeking does not exist. The honourable senator is welcome to ask for it if she wishes. I will write back to her and say that it does not exist. If she wants to carry paragraph (ii), I do not mind. I do not know why she wants to do it, but if she wants to carry it, I cannot pretend that there is any offence in that. The third thing sought is all documents pertaining to the appointment. To the best of my knowledge, they have all been tabled. Certainly to the extent that there is any imputation of wrongdoing&mdash;I think there is none&mdash;to the extent that the honourable senator wants to make that point, that which she alleges is on the record. I do not understand why she is excited about it, but if she is, she already knows it. As for paragraph (iv), the names are public, and asking for the addresses is ridiculous. So I say to Senator Patterson: having reaffirmed her right to do this, please do not do it. </PARA>

I hope nobody's reputation has been impugned because there is absolutely no reason so far for anybody's reputation to be impugned.

They are not being disclosed to the general public, they are not being given to the newspapers. They are being put on the table merely so that other senators can have a look at them. That is the only thing we are asking to be done. The same goes for the addresses. I do not know what Senator Patterson's reason is. One would have to ask her what her reason is for doing it, but if she has a reason to do it and she does not want to publish these addresses further than on that table, that is fine&mdash;put them up, put them on the table. If she or any other senator goes out of this place and uses them inappropriately, if she or any other senator goes out of here and harasses people in their homes, rings them up&mdash;does any of this stuff&mdash;then they should be dealt with, I should be dealt with, we all should be dealt with by the Senate for doing that.

I do not know how far they will go, but I think it is a very good idea. This is the sort of stuff we should have. People should be innovative; people should be able to recommend people. If something as good as this gets as far as cabinet, if it gets as far as being instituted, great. We have no problem with that and we support these grants as far as they can go.

This means that any man-made construction such as an oil rig or oil and gas platform in those seas off the shore of either Zone is not regarded as being part of that Zone.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation was drafted before such expansion of engineering and technology to erect ocean installations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By this bill the problem areas will be covered by extending the land areas in Zone A and Zone B by an imaginary line from the shore point parallel to either the Equator or lines of longitude out to Australia's territorial limit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is interesting to note that the government has amended the Income Tax Assessment Act to include these very situations that I am addressing in the provisions for fringe benefits tax. So this is an opportune time to address this point for Zone A and Zone B, so that claims for rebate can be made by those living and working in those areas for the specified time in each year.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday, there was what was described as a march&mdash;I did not see it; I read about it today&mdash;on this place by a number of people from a certain section of the private child-care industry. I know that some of those people came into Parliament House. I know that, because they physically abused one of my staff&mdash;a matter I find totally unparliamentary and quite unacceptable. But that is just the evidence I have that many of those people were here. Some people here would know that I was caught up in other things yesterday. I did not get to know that march was on or have the opportunity to meet those people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Properly they were here because they understood the debate was on today. Indeed, until this morning, the debate was expected to come on today. On all the advice I had from the whips' meeting, I understood there had been an acceptance that this debate would happen today. If I have got that wrong, I will accept that I have got a wrong understanding of it. Certainly, there was a campaign that was whipped up focusing on today: a march to this place yesterday, and with a certain number of honourable senators, other than me, very busy in the last few days. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZF4">Senator CROWLEY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I was very busy, but I do not wish to say that I was busy on the same business, Senator Macdonald. Why I think it is important, and why I would ask the Senate's support for bringing this debate on today, is because of the huge level of anxiety and fear out in the community that has been created as a result of serious misunderstanding about what this accreditation process is.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would not mind if there was just some confusion. I could perhaps accept just some confusion. It is the business of the government to explain what the accreditation process is about and it is the business of government to counter any campaign to oppose the matter or spread misunderstanding. But I find it very unacceptable to deal with the threats and the viciousness of this campaign. That is one of the things that shock me. I was appalled to be advised that some parents have been rung up and told, `We know which child-care centre your children go to'. That is totally unacceptable. I am not talking about one person; many have been told by people who purport to care for our children, `We know which child care-centre your children go to'. I say to honourable senators: it took my breath away. It took my breath away that that is the level of this campaign. That is the sort of thing that I would want to lay to rest, Senator Hill. If we go back to debating this issue on its merits, I have no dispute about it. But to have people, in the name of some kind of campaign, running threats and vicious campaigns like that is unacceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The misinformation is all the way from sublime to ridiculous. I have to say&mdash;I hope I have already made it clear&mdash;that it is my business, in this case, and that of government to make sure that people have the facts. It is my responsibility to iron out the confusion. It is my business to counter the nonsense that Senator McGauran is running around with. I am assisted by senators who say that I am the minister for cancelling Christmas. Most people would know that that is a nonsense. Most people who understand that are quite right. We are not cancelling Christmas. We are not cancelling Christmas carols. We are not stopping little boys playing with trains and trucks. It is a measure of the opposition senators, the National Party senators, that they would sink to that level of nonsense, but it is not without precedent in their ranks. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not mind dealing with that nonsense. I am prepared to talk to the community at any time about the facts, but I find it absolutely unacceptable that riding just underneath this so-called legitimate campaign is this appalling attack by people who purport to care for children: they are threatening parents, threatening people working in the child-care industry, with lines like, `I know where your child goes to child care'. I cannot think how much lower they can go than that. That is one of the most important reasons, I believe, that this debate should be brought on now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think it is also very important to help people in the community know that they can proceed with their child-care just as they are doing now. These guidelines are a description from the child-care industry itself of what is good practice in child care&mdash;what most child-care institutions are providing now, but some are not. That is what we are talking about, not the madness and nonsense that have been whipped up. Most importantly, because of that anxiety, we have people now very confused about what is the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think a very good case can be made for why we should bring the motion on soon. I would have to say, just as another matter, that one of my colleagues in South Australia had his office extensively covered with what is known elegantly as graffiti; it was smear painted with anti-child-care accreditation slogans. We are getting a bit carried away in the community if this is the level the debate has gone to. For these sorts of reasons, I suggest that there is a very good case for bringing on this disallowance motion forthwith. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave&mdash;Senator Crowley, with respect, is confused. The government two days ago said that it was going to bring on this motion today. There was no consultation with the opposition in this matter&mdash;none whatsoever. The government said that it was going to bring it on. I was out at the front of the parliament yesterday when those parents arrived. Senator Crowley has just said that it is the business of government to counter confusion&mdash;not to consult with the parents, which it should be doing. The government should be meeting those people. There were 21,000 signatories on petitions from parents, and it needs only a few more thousand to actually have a referendum on this matter in the country. If that is what the government wants, that will occur, because the parents are so outraged with the guidelines that have been put forward&mdash;and I do not wish to debate the guidelines at this moment. I will leave that for an appropriate time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is confusion out there&mdash;I agree with Senator Crowley&mdash;and it is of the government's making.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is unsatisfactory that there is a constant repetition of Christmas songs as background at the end of the year. </PARA>
<PARA>Can the government understand that two busloads of parents came up yesterday when they became aware of this through the media? Can it blame them for coming up? I was appalled when I read that, but I had no idea that this reaction from the community would exist. Senator Crowley saw them on the media. It is not confusion. It is there in black and white. I can interpret that as easily as anybody else, but the parents are only just becoming aware of the social engineering that is presented in these guidelines; and we will leave that to another time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there should be further time&mdash;not to counteract the confusion but to have further community consultation. That is all that is intended by the postponing of this debate until 8 December. There is no reason why it should occur today. Senator Crowley has not advanced any argument why it should be today, except an argument about due process when the motion was given&mdash;but no reason to do with community consultation. The only reason she gave was that one of her staff apparently was abused. I am not sure whether that was verbal or physical, but surely that is completely extraneous to this matter. I would put in a report to the security officers of this place, if that were so. That is a complete diversion in relation to this matter. </PARA>

Her explanation seemed to me to be that the community was confused and that the answer to that confusion would be to race this disallowance motion through in the midst of that confusion, not giving the people some explanation of what is in these accreditation principles.

So I do not know how another 12 days are going to do anything but give those people who are opposed to it greater opportunity to whip up more hysteria. I think we really do need to deal with this matter today. I would like to turn to some of the misleading and mischievous work that has been done in this place over the last two days, particularly by members of the National Party of Australia, and put into context something that Senator Herron mentioned about Christmas carols.

Leave has been given to a number of speakers, including Senator Lee, to discuss the question of when this matter should be debated. It seems to me that Senator Lee is now debating the matter.

If we are going to have the debate at some time, this is when Senator Lees will get her opportunity to do that. My point of order is that leave has been given to discuss the matter of when this is to be debated and why the confusion arose, not actually to debate the substance of the matter.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Senator Crowley. I think what has occurred this morning indicates that there has been some confusion about this matter and perhaps it is because of the unfortunate absence of Senator Newman that that has occurred. As I understood the situation, today was the day that it was to have come on but it was deferred by Senator Herron to 8 December. This occurred also at a time when the government was pressuring us considerably to get the industrial relations legislation on and we were conscious that industrial relations was the centrepiece of this week. It is beginning to look as though we will not get to it at all, but we were under the pressure of trying to assist the government to meet that objective of getting industrial relations done.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was two days ago when I first heard&mdash;I think at the whips' meeting, or shortly before it&mdash;that the government was bringing on this matter on Thursday. That took me somewhat by surprise. I knew that we would not want that to occur, but I interpreted it to mean that, if the government was bringing it on, it had the numbers to do so, which clearly it does because Senator Lees has indicated that she would wish the matter to come on today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because of that, I then, of course, advised all of those in my party who wished to speak on the matter that, although it was not our wish that the matter come on today, the government wanted it on today and they had better be ready to speak today; and that is the position. But it is not our view that it should be brought forward to come on today. Unless the government has some mechanism whereby it can bring it on today, we should proceed with the program. There is still a big program ahead and we have wasted a considerable amount of time this morning. Industrial relations has obviously slipped down the list a bit and I do not know why. It is to be started today, when we get around to the government's program, and there are a number of bills still to be dealt with in addition to that. </PARA>

I thought the government would try to make a case for its motion, but apparently it does not think that argument is necessary. But now that the matter has been clarified, this motion relates to the incredible situation whereby the government is seeking to override the time constraints that were imposed by the Senate on the introduction of bills, and it is intending to do it in relation to a bill of major consequence, that is, the Industrial Relations Reform Bill. We on this side of the chamber will oppose that. No case has been made out for the need for urgency.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, the Senate had imposed a restraint upon the government and the parliamentary secretary has come in here and expected the Senate to lift that restraint without putting any argument at all. The onus is not upon us; the onus is upon the government. But I will take the opportunity to remind the honourable senator of the history of the matter that led to the imposition of these constraints on the introduction of bills.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had a problem over the years of an incompetent government basically failing to manage its business in an orderly way, with the consequence that a large number of bills get stacked up towards the end of session and are therefore not dealt with properly by this chamber. The Senate, reacting to the frustration of not being able to do its job properly, therefore, some years ago introduced a time constraint limiting consideration of bills that were not introduced within reasonable time; in other words, bills that were not going to be allowed full and adequate debate in this place. That was referred to commonly as the Macklin motion, because it was introduced by our former colleague Senator Macklin. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It worked reasonably well for some time, until the government at the other end of this building started to abuse it. It did that by stacking the bills up against the time constraint in the House of Representatives so that we were being blamed for the government guillotining large numbers of bills through against the introductory date in the House of Representatives. Again it was simply a case of the government not being able to plan its program properly. That extra frustration after a year's debate caused this chamber to introduce the current constraint, which is a two-level constraint. It means that bills have to be introduced into the House of Representatives to allow reasonable debate in that chamber and then into this place to allow reasonable debate. At the beginning of this session the Senate imposed that obligation. It was done for very sensible reasons. If we are to act properly as a chamber of scrutiny, we have to receive legislation within a reasonable time, otherwise we are simply not going to be able to do the job properly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What the government has done here has been to bring down a major piece of legislation, its industrial relations package, which is highly controversial and severely damaging to small business in Australia. My friend and colleague Senator Crane might give the Senate a little more detail on that in a moment and you might as well, I suspect, Mr Acting Deputy President, if you can find somebody else to sit in that chair. We have this piece of legislation of major consequence to the Australian business community, and therefore of consequence to all Australians, which the government is seeking to bring in in the twilight of this parliamentary session and to ram through this place. I stand to be corrected if I am wrong, but I think the government guillotined it through the House of Representatives anyway. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It demonstrates the incompetence of the government when it introduces 177 of its own amendments to a piece of legislation that it brings in, and then guillotines it through the House of Representatives. In other words, the government would not even allow that chamber full debate, even though the House is continuing to sit today and will be coming back for another week. It really is unforgivable if the government abuses its numbers in that way in the House and fails to allow that chamber full scrutiny of the bill. Be that as it may, all we can really do is make the point that that is intolerable parliamentary practice.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue now before us is whether, in the light of that abuse, this chamber is going to lift the time constraint and allow the government to introduce this bill several weeks after the cut-off time and in a way in which, clearly, it is not going to receive the full attention it deserves in this chamber. The bill did go to a parliamentary committee for a very short inquiry. In many ways, it was an inadequate inquiry, although excellent work was done by coalition members on that committee to at least bring out some of the shortcomings in the legislation. But legislation, being part of a properly planned program, does not have to be processed in this way. What is to be lost if this bill lies on the table here and is debated when the parliament returns in the beginning of February? What is to be lost by that, other than that the public will have an opportunity to give perusal to what the government is intending to pass and the parliament can have a reasonable time for its debate. There is no substantive reason for not dealing with this legislation in accordance with the motion that has already been passed by this chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not want to reflect to any great extent on the substance of the IR bill but this is the bill that removes sections 45D and 45E from the Trade Practices Act. It removes the protections that have been in place for small business for years&mdash;that guarantee against union abuse, which is recognised and appreciated by small business throughout Australia. This is the bill by which the government intends to remove that safeguard. So, with that example alone, it is clear that this is a piece of legislation of major consequence and major detriment to the Australian people. It is obviously demanding of very careful scrutiny in this place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understand it, this is also the bill that the government says frees up the potential of enterprise bargaining for the non-unionised</PARA>
<PARA>labour force. But I also understand that it in fact fails to do that. That is an issue that&mdash;if the government is going to hold out a hope for non-union labour&mdash;simply is not warranted from the detail of this bill. That is something that has clearly got to be considered in great depth and with great care. The history of this chamber is that, when we are given the opportunity to do so, we do exercise that care and, in scrutinising legislation, we do our best to improve it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, we have to be given a fair opportunity to do that. This government is not prepared to give us that. It is not prepared to act in accordance with the resolution of the Senate that is in place. The government comes in here today and wants to remove that legislation and remove the benefits that were written into it of adequate time for proper scrutiny. The government says, `Deal with this now, because we want it'. I think the bottom line to all of this is that the government recognises that this is unpopular legislation and that the longer it takes in the process the more difficult it becomes for the government politically. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is an unfortunate consequence of bad legislation, but it in no way justifies a failure to allow this chamber the opportunity for proper scrutiny. So we will oppose this. No case has been made by the government for its actions. As I said, incredibly, the parliamentary secretary did not even put an argument. I trust that the Senate, which only a few months ago put this safeguard into place, will stand by and uphold that safeguard, and tell this government that it can bring this bill back at the beginning of the next parliamentary session when it can have full and proper debate in this chamber.</PARA>

All honourable senators knew at that time that we were going to face this situation.

We have gone through hours of debate in the House of Representatives on this bill. Did one opposition member of the House of Representatives stand up and say, `We don't think we should deal with this bill today'? Did Senator Crane in the committee ever suggest that, or did any other member of the standing committee?

He knows as well as every other honourable senator that this is an appropriate course of action for the government and has always been timetabled to be dealt with by the Senate on this day and subsequent sitting days. There is no secret in this. It is all very straightforward. It is everything we expected. Commitments and predictions were made when the cut-off motion was originally debated about what would occur in relation to urgent legislation coming before the parliament, and the government has done a fantastic job, an incredible job, in fulfilling the absurd requirements of that motion. We have said all along that it was not possible on industrial relations or on the native title bill.

On day one there were two exemptions referred to explicitly and, as I recall it, acknowledged by at least Senator Chamarette in her speech.

Right from the beginning, I think, Senator Hill made a perfectly adequate case for that. He claimed that the government had not made the case for its importance.

We voted against that cut-off date at the time. Senator Vanstone rightly observed that the notion of a cut-off date was initially a Democrat proposition, known as the Macklin amendment, the Macklin provision, which we think had worked quite well for some years. But it is the constriction of that approach, brought about by the changing of the date to an earlier date, which has dealt us this problem. It would not necessarily be a problem if what Senator Hill said was acknowledged&mdash;that this is a bill of major consequence to the community&mdash;because it is those bills of major consequence which, it was indicated, would get some exemption from what has been described as the ludicrously short cut-off date. </PARA>

As has previously been described by Senator McMullan, all the major players, all the major theorists, all the major opinion holders, all the major stakeholders in a discussion about industrial relations in Australia's future who appeared as witnesses and who made submissions to that previous inquiry did so over the course of a full year.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to this motion, I just want to pick up one point out of Senator Faulkner's irrational tirade. That is when he said there was no misunderstanding in this place that this legislation would be brought forward after the cut-off date. I absolutely and totally refute that. If we look at the evidence and the information from the public statements of the Minister for Industrial Relations, Mr Brereton, it was his intention to take this legislation to cabinet in early August and have it in the chambers soon thereafter. That is on the public record. The reason why that has not happened is purely and simply that, when he went along to his mates at the ACTU conference, they hissed and booed him and virtually kicked him out of the place. He had to go away and reconsider it. That is why this legislation was not here when it was destined to be and that is why it is not in conformance with how it was initially intended, as outlined by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and others.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have just one other comment before I go to the substance of what I want to say, and that is in response to Senator Bell. To try to say that we canvassed virtually exactly the same ground in the second inquiry as we did in the first is absolutely, totally misleading and wrong&mdash;and what is more, he knows it. Moreover, I doubt whether he spent 20 per cent of the time listening to the witnesses and hearing what was said, because he just was not there; it is as simple as that. Certainly, it did cover some of the things we canvassed in the first inquiry, but there was proposed legislation before us, although it is quite different now&mdash;it has been amended 177 times. There were lots of other arguments canvassed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In using this cut-off motion, I just want to remind people of some of the things that were said at that particular time. Senator Chamarette said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . within the House of Representatives which then came through to the Senate without proper notice and the chance of proper debate. </PARA>
<PARA>That was reiterated by the Australian Democrats and also by Senator Harradine, when he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But I would have thought that one of the greatest impertinences has been the way the government has treated this chamber over a period in respect of its duties to review this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA>Now I say to the government and to the other parties here that this is indeed important legislation. But the government has not yet got it right. It needs the time&mdash;</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="UW4">Senator CRANE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will just come to that in a minute. Honourable senators will hear why they have not got it right. We have had very recent discussions. Government people are out there now writing more amendments, as a result of questions we asked them. They will be writing more amendments; they have not got it right. That is why this legislation should not proceed at this particular time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My other point is that it is a misuse of this procedure, a total misuse. The cut-off debate should only be negated when it is a matter of national emergency and the government stepped outside that. This legislation is certainly not of national emergency. The award system will continue; the certified agreement system will continue; what is happening out in the marketplace now with voluntary agreements will continue; the government does not need it to proceed. In fact, what the government proposes will inhibit that particular process and it is far better left alone. The evidence was consistently given to us in that inquiry that, in fact, this was a tightening up of the market; it would be more rigid, not freer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just want to highlight the particular point of why I believe it would be in the interests of the government. It is purely and simply that, when I asked this morning whether or not the no disadvantage clause would apply as far as preferences to unions were concerned, with an enterprise flexibility agreement&mdash;I hope honourable senators understand what I am saying; the preference to unions with enterprise flexibility agreement&mdash;when there were no union people in the workplace, the answer we got was, `We do not know, we will have to go away and check that'. I understand they are now looking at writing an amendment with regard to that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of very good reasons why this legislation should not proceed at this particular time. One is that the government has not finished putting the whole thing together. The government is still out there writing amendments to it now. It would be in the interests of the people of Australia&mdash;business people, employees and the economy&mdash;for the government to take this back, reword it, and get it right. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I first want to thank the opposition for facilitating the time allocation in this debate between Senator Crane and me. Senator Crane, and I think he is reflecting the general arguments advanced by the opposition, put forward two reasons for opposing the motion that I moved to negate the cut-off date so that we could get on and discuss the Industrial Relations Reform Bill. His first reason for opposing it was that we should be negating the cut-off date only because of a national emergency, and they were the words he used.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst we heard a lot of argument from Senator Chamarette and others when the cut-off date was introduced, I do not recall any argument that we should be negating that cut-off point only in the event of a national emergency.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator SHERRY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right, warfare. I certainly do not believe that they are the only circumstances in which we should be reversing that motion. The argument that Senator Crane is advancing is ridiculous. As was pointed out by Senator McMullan, there are another eight or nine sitting days of the Senate, we hope. I note that Senator Crane heads the list of speakers on this debate. Some 15 people have put their names down to speak on industrial relations and that is as lengthy a contribution as we get on most pieces of legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reason that Senator Crane advanced for opposing the negation was that this matter should be dealt with next year&mdash;I think that was his basic thrust&mdash;because there are so many amendments to the legislation. That is not an unusual situation. The superannuation supervision legislation that I dealt with earlier this week in the Senate had some hundreds of amendments to it. I think there were 18 pages of amendments to the superannuation legislation. The superannuation legislation was a very substantial package of legislation, as is the industrial relations package. But the truth is that this debate on industrial relations reform has been raging for at least 10 to 15 years in the political arena. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Chapman interjects and says that we still have not got it right. We are just going to have to agree to disagree on that. The opposition, and I accept this, has a fundamentally philosophically different approach to industrial relations from the Labor Party. Those opposite will continue to argue that we have not got it right. This is an important piece of legislation and it is urgent because it brings to a head many of the legislative requirements that need to be made. It also brings to a head the industrial relations debate, particularly on the issue of enterprise agreements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite critical for there to be some surety out in the industries of this country so that they can plan and know the framework in which they are going to be able to conduct these enterprise agreements. There has been a lot of debate. An election was fought partly on this issue, which the opposition lost. This was a critical issue in the last election. It was one of three issues before the people. They made a judgment between the opposition's approach&mdash;the so-called unfettered, free market, remove the shackles and chains of the Industrial Commission approach&mdash;and the government's approach. We have all heard the same jargon for goodness knows how many years. We heard it in the election and basically the opposition's approach was unacceptable to the people of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have had many years of debate, public and political, about this package and the central themes contained within it. We have had a committee hearing, as Senator Bell referred, that has looked quite exhaustively at the provisions of this legislation. It is a major package of legislation. It was foreshadowed by the minister some months ago. The fact that it was not introduced before the cut-off date has, in fact, given us additional time to make the necessary refinements and to listen to industry and all parties who have concerns. We should now get on and debate this legislation and pass it before the end of the year. </PARA>

Senator Crane said that I had said that the arguments in both inquiries were exactly the same. That is not so. I just said that there were no new arguments. But the most important misrepresentation of my position was with regard to my absence from the committee of inquiry. Senator Crane said that I was not present for more than 20 per cent of the time. That is perhaps a true indication of the situation. I was very critical of my own absence at that time, which was necessary because there was an industrial relations bill before this chamber at that time. I was critical of that and I have taken this opportunity to again emphasise my abhorrence of the situation that we were placed in&mdash;that there was an industrial relations bill here in this chamber at the same time as we had an inquiry.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Thank you, Mr President. The Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Bill has been waiting to come on in this place for some time, so when I say, `Thank you, Mr President', I really do mean it as more than a courtesy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The purpose of this bill is to allow intercepting of certain telecommunications which are currently not necessarily disallowed, but in respect of which the legality of the police procedures is questionable. What the government has sought to do is to identify the circumstances under which an intercept can be made without a warrant. I think that is probably the best way to put it. The bill is, in its primary purpose, seeking to ensure that in certain limited circumstances the police can intercept telecommunications without a warrant, but they are limited circumstances and they are spelt out in the bill. They are emergency situations where there is a threat to property, loss of life, et cetera; and anyone who is interested obviously will see that in the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem, of course, is that there is a traditional reluctance in the Australian community, quite rightly, to allow the police to have any extension of their powers to intercept. That is why in this particular bill the government sought in the first place to, relatively speaking, strictly limit the circumstances under which the police would be able to do it. By amendment moved in the other place, the coalition has not further restricted those circumstances but has at least made sure that there is some sort of check on the circumstances under which this tap can take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, the circumstances are where one party agrees and, secondly, where an officer, or another officer, of the agency is a party to the communication; that is, if it is the AFP, there has to be an AFP person as a party to the communication. What that means in practical terms is that we are not talking about telecommunications interceptions or tappings where there are two parties and neither of those parties is aware that the phone is tapped&mdash;the sort of tapping that you might find in a drug inquiry, for example, where neither party is aware of what is happening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the circumstances being proposed by the government here, either one party will have agreed&mdash;and that may be the person who has a telephone in the house and it is believed that someone in that house has been kidnapped and the person agrees that the tap can be put on&mdash;or, in this second circumstance, where one party to the communications happens to be a member of the relevant agency seeking to put the tap on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not talking about unknown secret taps that might be used in drug offences or in pursuing drug offences and other similar criminal activities. We are talking about a situation strictly limited to where at least one party agrees. That party might be a private citizen who, for one reason or another, has his own life, the life of someone else, or property at risk and he is a party to the communication, or, on the other hand, where an officer of the agency is so placed. So that limits it in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then, of course, there are additional limits. They are these: there have to be reasonable grounds for suspecting that another party to the communication has done an act that has resulted or may result in loss of life or the infliction of serious personal injury; or, secondly, has threatened to kill or seriously injure another person or to cause serious damage to property; or, thirdly, has threatened to take his or her own life or to do an act that would endanger his or her own life or create a serious threat to his or her health or safety. And&mdash;this is a further limitation&mdash;there has to be a consenting party at least on one end of the line; there must be reasonable grounds for suspecting that the list of things that I have just outlined have happened; and there must also be such an urgent situation for this intercept or tap to be done that it is not reasonably practicable for an application for a part VI warrant to be made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is where we have got to as a consequence of amendments moved by my colleague Mr Daryl Williams QC in the other place. In other words, originally all that was required was one party to be consenting and there be these reasonable grounds for suspecting that these dreadful things were going to happen. We have sought, because we are concerned about any extension of the power of agencies to intercept phones, to add to that that it must be a sufficiently urgent act that `it is not reasonably practicable for an application for a Part VI warrant to be made'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So this is not a case where the police can just say, `Let us do this. We can now intercept without a warrant'. That intercept would be unlawful unless they could make out the case, if they were challenged, that it was not reasonably practicable for an application for a part VI warrant to be made at that time. We are pleased that the government accepted that amendment. We think it is a sensible amendment and a sensible limitation on the amendments that the government is seeking to make to the whole bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are, of course, further amendments that we moved, that we believe go further in protecting the community from the misuse of powers by agents who might be entitled to use this technology. One amendment states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As soon as practicable after the doing of an act in relation to a communication under the provisions of subsection (4) or (5), an officer of the agency which is concerned with the communication shall cause an application&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>to be made for one of these warrants. In other words, we are saying that, if these circumstances arise and if one of the parties, a private citizen, consents or there is an agency officer on one end of the line, and if it is so urgent that it is not practicable to apply for a warrant at the time, then yes, they can go ahead with the intercept. But we have added the extra requirement that, as soon as practicable after having put the intercept on, an application has to be made for a warrant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When an application is made for a warrant to authorise the police to so intercept a communication, it may be that a judge could say, `I do not think that in this circumstance you can justify the warrant continuing'. In other words, it does not fit into these categories. If he says, `I do not think that there are reasonable grounds to believe that there is a threat to kill or seriously injure another person', or whatever, then the judicial officer will obviously refuse to issue a warrant. What that will mean is the tap will then have to come off. But that will not make illegal the tap up to that point. So what this does is allow the agencies concerned to function in a fairly practical way, to tap a communication when there is not time, when there is some matter of urgency. Then as soon as practicable afterwards they have to go to a judicial officer to see if they can get a warrant&mdash;in other words, get judicial approval for what they are doing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand the sorts of circumstances that are envisaged might include a kidnapping, for example, where a child might disappear and be thought at the time to be playing truant, off at a neighbour's place or whatever. Then, very suddenly, it becomes apparent that it is a kidnap. I do not think that there is anyone in this place who would want to put the police in a situation where they were not entitled at that time, with the consent of the parents of the child, to tap their phone, to have a proper recording of whatever information might come down the line at that particular time. I cannot see that anybody could think that was unreasonable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I can see that it would be unreasonable to say, `We will let the police decide when those circumstances are and there will be no check on it'. That would be unreasonable and we are very pleased that the government accepted our amendments to so curtail this right. Yes, in order to protect the community&mdash;in some instances from themselves, such as in the case of suicide&mdash;we will allow the police to make a decision that intercept has to take place. But it must be not practical to get a warrant at the time and they must, as soon as practicable&mdash;that is a well understood terminology in the courts, well litigated&mdash;seek a warrant. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;A few weeks ago I attended a reunion at my old school of the class of 1953. The school I was proud to attend was a Christian Brothers boarding school, Nudgee College. In recent times, we have seen allegations of sexual and physical assault by certain Christian Brothers, going back over 40 or 50 years. I wish to speak on this matter as I have viewed with concern and dismay in this chamber calls for a judicial or, failing that, a Senate inquiry into the Christian Brothers. I take a very strong contrary view to those proposals.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me say from the outset that, if any individual has been responsible for sexual abuse, that person would be subject to the full force of law and would face criminal charges. This applies to every one of us, not just Christian Brothers. To push for some sort of judicial or Senate inquiry into the Christian Brothers organisation itself is to smear and taint by implication all Christian Brothers, something I sincerely hope no-one seeks to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia owes much to the Christian Brothers and their role in bringing education to the poor and less privileged in our society. There is no doubt that all of us who were educated by the Christian Brothers readily acknowledge that they are strict disciplinarians. As such, they are an outstanding support group for family values and family principles. They are tough but fair, which guarantees them profound respect. With the benefit of age and experience and the luxury of retrospectivity, there is no doubt that this discipline did us all a lot more good than harm. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of us today reflect the aims of the brothers. We have the capacity to face each day with self-discipline and confidence, thanks to their teachings. The Christian Brothers set standards that many of us continue to try to emulate, and we will do so for the rest of our lives, including long hours of dedication to the task in hand. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Their day started at 5.30 a.m. Then followed rostered responsibilities. Paramount was the teaching program, based on hours of instruction, discipline, encouragement and guidance for the many-faceted personalities that shape a Christian class; followed by playground supervision and sporting coaching; and, finally, ending the day with supervision of controlled study periods and dormitory duty&mdash;all to start again at 5.30 a.m. the following day. They set the example, and that was the example they passed onto their charges going through their formative stages of life. The thoroughness of their programs was such that everyone slept soundly, the sleep of honest and utter exhaustion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was on the sporting field, particularly the football field, that the personal strength of the brothers had to be acknowledged. It was here that the students, smarting from what they felt was unduly harsh treatment from a brother during school hours, took the opportunity to exact retribution. It was always to the brothers' credit that, although they knew what was happening, few sought reprisal, and the student concerned ended his day repentant. It showed a great understanding of human nature, to say nothing of substantial self-control. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as I am concerned, all the brothers with whom I came in contact were real men, genuine Australians who played a major role in shaping this country. There would not be a city or a town in this country that does not have someone educated by the Christian Brothers, and probably a great number. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the recent reunion, we were privileged to have at the gathering the surviving Christian Brothers who taught us in 1953. All students had nicknames for their brother teachers, some of them not very complimentary and all of them great secrets as far as the students were concerned. Of course, that belief was a myth, as every Christian Brother knew what his nickname was. There was Brother `Moose' Gallagher, who taught science and sport, who is now semi-retired and living in the Australian Capital Territory. He is still teaching young people in hospital. Brother `Speed' Miller taught mathematics par excellence and was the swimming and football coach. He is now semi-retired in Ballarat. Brother `Foxy' Keenan, was a teacher and sports coach, and is now in retirement in Brisbane because of failing eyesight. Those who have died but are with us in spirit are Brother `Bromm' O'Connor, headmaster; Brother `Crock' Fogarty; Brother `Lefty' Wright, which is not a very original nickname; and Brother `Crom' Davey. They were all fine men, every one of them.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those of us who were taught by them owe them a great and unrepayable debt. They had to cope with a bunch of adolescent boys who, given half a chance, would have been up to every trick in the book. I might say that many tried but few succeeded. I and the vast majority of students taught by the brothers are not prepared to sit back now and watch these great men smeared by association, or see the great religious order they served besmirched and denigrated. Any organisation as vast as the Christian Brothers must have a few bad apples, but that does not mean that all are tainted because of the actions of a few. A judicial or Senate inquiry would do just that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is now six years since the Australian Parliamentary Association for UNICEF, the United Nations Children's Fund, was formed. Much has changed on the political landscape over those six years. We are in a different parliament house, for starters. The original patrons of the association were Mr Hawke, Mr Howard, Mr Sinclair and Senator Janine Haines, the party leaders at the time. Yet the association has not only survived, it has also grown.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We said at the time that we were the first group of parliamentarians in the world in support of UNICEF, and we hoped the group would be the start of many others. I can now say that similar groups have been formed in countries such as Italy, the United Kingdom and Japan. At the recent Inter-Parliamentary Union conference held in this building the association, together with UNICEF Australia, promoted our work to visiting parliamentarians from throughout the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of former senators with whom many of us have served in this place over the years were involved in the formation of the parliamentary UNICEF group. They include people such as Michael Macklin, the original treasurer of the association, Jo Vallentine and Peter Baume. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today the office bearers of the association are as follows: I am president; Kathy Sullivan MP is vice-president; Senator David Brownhill is secretary; and Senator Robert Bell is treasurer. The genuine multiparty nature of the association has been maintained from the beginning. The association's charter is simple but covers the key issues relating to the work of UNICEF. The charter states that the Australian Parliamentary Association for UNICEF will do the following things:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">1. Support and promote the Declaration of the Rights of the Child as adopted by the United Nations in 1959 and support the adoption of the Convention on the Rights of the Child.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2. Promote in the parliament and throughout the Australian government and the Australian community the work of UNICEF for children and their mothers. 3. Encourage Australian governments to give priority support to children and their mothers in Australia's overseas assistance program.</PARA>
<PARA>Our most important role, I think, is as a consciousness-raising group in this place. The success of UNICEF's work is dependent upon political cooperation and goodwill. We should not run away from the role we can play as decision makers. As I have said before, priorities must be moved towards the poor, which places a responsibility on the major industrialised nations to review trade, aid and financial policies in relation to the developing world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">UNICEF talks of a grand alliance for children, including teachers and religious leaders, mass media and government agencies, voluntary organisations and people's movements, trade unions and business leaders, women's groups and health workers. The Australian Parliamentary Association for UNICEF is a small but proud part of that alliance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">UNICEF has worked since 1946 to improve the lives of the world's needy children. It is almost 50 years since UNICEF went to work in Europe under a mandate to aid children suffering the aftermath of the Second World War. Today, UNICEF is at work in 128 developing countries where governments have requested UNICEF cooperation in programs providing basic health care, clean water supply and sanitation services, education, nutrition and training. UNICEF concentrates its efforts on fighting silent emergencies&mdash;the insidious combination of disease, malnutrition and poverty that kills 35,000 children in the world every day. Two-thirds of these children die from causes that are easily preventable at low costs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of UNICEF's efforts now focus on generating the political will to make these simple, low cost remedies and preventive strategies available throughout the developing world. The grand alliance for children helped achieve, in 1990, the World Health Organisation-UNICEF goal of immunising 80 per cent of the world's children against six preventable diseases that take so many young lives&mdash;measles, tuberculosis, tetanus, diphtheria, whooping cough and polio. This program saves 3 million lives each year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In 1991 the then Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, became the 104th national leader to sign the World Summit for Children declaration on the survival, protection and development of children, thus committing the Australian government to a series of goals for children. The goals for this decade include eliminating neonatal tetanus by 1995; reducing deaths caused by measles by 95 per cent; eliminating polio by 2000; promoting oral rehydration salts and home remedies for diarrhoea in order to help prevent deaths due to diarrhoeal dehydration; and the provision of universal access to basic education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The parliamentary association has a great deal of material that I would urge all parliamentarians to look at. Each year UNICEF publishes a report on the state of the world's children. In the latest report there is a proposition which states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the principle of `first call for children'&mdash;meaning that protection for the growing bodies and minds of the young ought to have a first call on societies' resources&mdash;should become an accepted ethic of a new world order.</PARA>
<PARA>Let us not forget that 90 per cent of the growth of a human brain, and much of the growth of the human body, is completed in the first five years of life. There is no second chance. The association also has copies of the 1993 edition of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Facts for life</EMPHASIS>. This is the most authoritative expression in plain language of what we now know about practical low cost ways of protecting children's lives and health. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yesterday I received from UNICEF copies of the latest edition of their quarterly publication, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">First call for children</EMPHASIS>. Every politician should have a look at <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The progress of nations</EMPHASIS>, which records each year national achievements in child survival, health, nutrition, education, family planning and progress for women. The inside cover sums up the philosophy behind UNICEF:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The day will come when the progress of nations will be judged not by their military or economic strength, nor by the splendour of their capital cities and public buildings, but by the well being of their peoples: by their levels of health, nutrition and education; by their opportunities to earn a fair reward for their labours; by their ability to participate in the decisions that affect their lives; by the respect that is shown for their civil and political liberties; by the provision that is made for those who are vulnerable and disadvantaged; and by the protection that is afforded to the growing minds and bodies of their children.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe it is important that all of us, as decision makers, familiarise ourselves with the material in these publications. I am happy to provide any of my colleagues in the federal parliament with this material. Since 1991, the association has hosted an annual dinner here in Parliament House. In 1991, our guest was renowned soccer player Craig Johnston, UNICEF Australia's special representative for sport. The role played by prominent community figures such as Craig Johnston in support of UNICEF deserves recognition. The parliamentary UNICEF group has also hosted well-known Australian artist Ken Done. Ken is UNICEF Australia's goodwill ambassador, a role he has performed with distinction. Recently he designed the cover of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Weekend Australian</EMPHASIS> for the Sydney 2000 Olympic decision. He donated his fee to UNICEF Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last year we hosted Scholastica Kimaryo, UNICEF's representative designate in South Africa. This year we welcomed Ian Macleod, UNICEF Australia's man in Somalia and a former officer of UNICEF, back to the country on a short trip and had him inform parliamentarians of the situation in Somalia and UNICEF's work there. Last year the association donated the sum of $1,878 to UNICEF's Somalia campaign. We propose to continue these dinners each year. Whilst all of us are overworked and often cannot fit in everything we would like to when the parliament is sitting, by hosting a dinner annually we give parliamentarians the chance to catch up with the important work of UNICEF through our special guests and the contingent from UNICEF Australia whom we meet with in the parliamentary dining room. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally I would like to pay tribute to the dedicated workers of UNICEF Australia. As president of the association over the last six years, I have always been impressed by their dedication and their professionalism. Their work in stimulating interest among the people and governments of Australia in the welfare of the world's children and achieving greater financial support to enable UNICEF to expand its programs, which bring life and hope to children at risk, deserves recognition. The Australian Parliamentary Association for UNICEF will continue to recognise, promote and support UNICEF's work. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to support Senator Parer in his submission that there should not be a judicial inquiry into the Christian Brothers in Australia, nor a Senate inquiry for that matter. At the outset let me declare an interest. I was educated at Trinity College by the Christian Brothers. My father as well was educated by the Christian Brothers. I can say to the Senate that, from my own experience, I never saw any evidence at all of abuse of young boys, as has been alleged. That does not mean that I dismiss such allegations. In fact, the allegations that have been made are extremely serious. Not for one minute would I suggest that they should be swept under the carpet.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Christian Brothers were established in Ireland in 1802 by Edmund Rice. They came to Australia in 1868. They have a commendable record for the education of young boys. In fact, the congregation was set up for the education of poor boys in Ireland, and that theme was carried through in Australia. Perhaps a brief summary of the matter so far might assist in placing this matter in perspective. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier this year, I think it was, an ABC television series brought this matter to a head when it suggested that there was an abuse by Christian Brothers of young boys who had been brought to this country from England. Following that, various articles appeared in the press and there was a good deal of response. More recently, allegations have been made concerning the abuse of children at Bathurst Island in the Northern Territory. In New South Wales, 240 writs have been issued recently in relation to civil proceedings against the Christian Brothers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My point is a somewhat legal one in that I think it is entirely inappropriate for a judicial inquiry to be conducted at this stage. Litigation is pending in New South Wales, there is a police investigation pending in the Northern Territory, and there is a police investigation pending in Western Australia. Such an inquiry could well frustrate all three of the matters I have mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Recently the Crown Prosecutor in Western Australia, Mr McKechnie, announced that prosecutions would not be commenced in relation to 16 cases. But that is not the end of the matter, of course, because there are still other matters being investigated by the police, and quite properly so. The Attorney-General for Western Australia, Cheryl Edwardes, announced that that state would not be conducting an inquiry, and, again, that decision was made on quite proper grounds. One of the points made by the Attorney-General was that the Catholic Church had acknowledged that there had been cases of abuse and had taken action in relation to that. In fact, in Western Australia an independent panel has been set up under the chairmanship of Jane Brazier, who is a senior public servant, who is not a Catholic, and who comes from the Bureau of Disability Services. I understand that the response to that panel has been good. What is being looked at is how victims can be assisted and also whether any evidence is being put forward which can be acted upon. I understand that that independent panel has a consulting psychologist who is assisting in the investigation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When you consider what is being done and the admissions that are being made, it is really quite inappropriate for a judicial or Senate inquiry to be called for at this stage. When one looks at what such an inquiry could result in, one is left with the question: what could an inquiry do? Not much more than is being done at the moment. The police are investigating the matter, there is this independent inquiry, and people are exercising their rights at law in New South Wales by issuing writs. I would say to those people who insist on an inquiry that there is no benefit to be had from such an inquiry and that only harm could result because of the frustration it might cause to these other matters I have mentioned, which are, after all, an exercise in the due process of the law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one other matter Senator Parer mentioned with which I entirely agree. An inquiry of this nature could also result in the unfair denigration of the Christian Brothers congregation as a whole, which I think would be most unfortunate. We have seen many inquiries over recent years that have resulted in the destruction of reputations of individuals. We have seen inquiries where unsubstantiated evidence has been called under privilege, and that has resulted in a very unfair situation for citizens of this country. One always has to be very careful, when one calls for an inquiry, to make sure that it is the measure of last resort. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to raise an issue that is of significance not only in my state of Tasmania but nationally. I refer to the question of drug law reform. Why is it that we can be acutely aware of social problems associated with substance dependency and yet continue to fail in our attempts to provide appropriate legislation or strategic responses to address the issues? Today I wish to discuss some of the apparent difficulties legislators face with respect to adopting reformist policy initiatives and to suggest that, if we are serious in our intention and desire to deal effectively with substance dependency, we must adopt a program of law reform and we must dedicate adequate resources to appropriate service delivery agents.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is imperative that we begin to widen our view and direct our funds to alternative approaches in dealing with substance abuse. For instance, in Tasmania there are no services offered to drug users where they can receive medium- or long-term residential treatment. Clients are often referred necessarily to interstate facilities. This cannot be interpreted, by even the most residualist approach to welfare, as an acceptable level of service by government. The need for more support services and an increased level of integration between existing services is essential if we are to achieve a level of change and adaptability of our services to meet the needs of drug users in our community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As those who control the allocation of public moneys attempt to rationalise their welfare budget, the service providers working in the field of substance dependency must protect their funding. It appears that often the manner by which agencies receive recurrent funding is more likely to be determined by historical factors than on the grounds of evaluation, input and outcomes. I would argue that we can no longer justify continued financial support of large government agencies and units if it cannot be shown that they provide the standard of service we desire. On the other hand, the funding of community-based organisations with high client numbers has remained low, thus marginalising many of those workers and clients. I know of a community-based counselling service for young people in Hobart that has a budget of $60,000 for 1992-93, yet services over 600 clients. The operators of the counselling service have told me of the difficulties they experience in ensuring continuity of service delivery because of the intense competition for resources. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Bearing in mind that differences exist between states and territories with respect to drug dependency patterns, I draw upon issues from my own state of Tasmania to exemplify some of the areas to which we must turn our attention. Tasmania experiences a dearth of treatment options for our drug dependent population. NCADA funding to the state is disproportionately allocated to the government-run detoxification facilities and the government-run services without there being any clear evidence of significant outcomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To paraphrase Grant Wardlaw in his discussion in 1992 on Australia's drug strategy, the pattern of much of the debate over drug policy in recent years has pitted demand reduction against supply reduction. There has been considerable criticism of law enforcement for its perceived failure to contain drug use. However, most observers now realise that the failure was not of law enforcement but of society, with unrealistic achievements placed upon it. It is time for us to accept that the path we have followed has not provided us with a satisfactory result in our efforts to maximise the harm from drug use. This can come about only if policy is aimed to achieve integration and cooperation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another important aspect of Tasmania's situation is the provision of drug and alcohol services in prisons. NCADA parameters clearly identify that prevention and treatment services in prisons should be developed and that these should be coordinated with services outside the prisons, together with general health, welfare and education services within the prisons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program which operates in Tasmania is provided by a community-based organisation on a budget of $24,000 in 1992-93. With an average population of 300 inmates in five separate locations, I am deeply concerned as to the rationale behind such a meagre level of funding for a program which is explicitly targeted to address a focus of the NCADA guidelines. Once again, this highlights the difficulty in ensuring that what is enunciated in policy through NCADA must find a way of being implemented at the ground level in a manner which reflects our emphasis. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to drug law reform, I can only emphasise the facts that have been produced by many others before me. Treatment of substance-dependent individuals as criminals has not effectively reduced the incidence of drug-related problems. In fact, the negative impact of incarceration, particularly among young people, cannot be refuted. We must find alternatives to legal sanctions and then we must implement them. It is absurd that we continue to explore approaches from other countries and other states and yet hesitate to implement anything that resembles radical reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not believe we can continue to adopt this tortoise-like pace in relation to drug issues. While we procrastinate and debate the possible pros and cons of particular policies without making the necessary changes to our existing position, more of our population is being devastated by the way in which we manage and attempt to help substance-dependent individuals. </PARA>

<TITLE>Taxation: Business Enterprise Centres</TITLE>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I wish to raise a concern about some confusion surrounding the tax-exempt status of business enterprise centres. These business enterprise centres are well established around Australia. In fact, their activities are coordinated by an organisation called Business in the Community Ltd, and a network is in place which in New South Wales is made up of 47 units.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The organisation of business enterprise centres is by no means an amateurish affair. They are largely operated by active and retired businessmen who provide their services voluntarily for the purpose of advising prospective and established business people in the small business area to assist them to survive. In fact, they are one of the most effective ways of assisting small business. They were granted public benevolent institution status similar to that given to, for example, the RSPCA, in February 1992. The effect of this was that they were exempt from sales tax and, at the same time, were entitled to certain income tax concessions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Parramatta branch of the tax office advised by letter dated 7 October 1993 that tax deductions to business enterprise centres will no longer be available from the date of that letter. The Parramatta branch has taken the view that business enterprise centres play more of a counselling, advising and referral role than actually providing relief in a direct sense. We feel that their activities can be distinguished from those conducted, for example, by Skillshare. That particular branch of the tax office goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . we consider that the Enterprise Centres do not provide direct and immediate relief to a class of persons in need of benevolent relief. </PARA>
<PARA>However, the Newcastle office, after consultation with its national office, ruled in favour of business enterprise centres. I put it to the Senate that it is difficult to understand how one branch of the tax office can directly contradict the advice of another, especially when we are told by the national office that it has a computer network that provides the mechanism for uniform advice to all offices right across Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I wish to make is that business enterprise centres clearly do assist the unemployed and the small business sector on an increasingly day-to-day basis. In the current economic climate, with massive retrenchments and voluntary redundancy from the Public Service, more and more people are turning their skills towards small business. They invest their savings and time into small business, and the business enterprise centres provide invaluable assistance in achieving that particular objective. In fact, business enterprise centres are not financed by the federal government, and the Minister for Science and Small Business (Senator Schacht) might like to take that issue on board. Their operating costs are actually funded by state governments and the community&mdash;for example, service clubs and Rotary clubs&mdash;on an equal basis. The greatest resource advice is provided absolutely free by the volunteers, who are active and retired business people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax revenue to be recovered by the tax office, as a result of the reversal of its position on the exemption status of business enterprise centres, will not be significant in any particular way. Generally, the only staff member of a business enterprise centre who is remunerated is the executive officer&mdash;the coordinator. So the exempt status allowed to a business enterprise centre, for example, to purchase a car for the executive officer would normally be free of sales tax. Under the ruling from Parramatta, that will not be so, but under the ruling from Newcastle, people in that centre can be sales tax free. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To require business enterprise centres to pay sales tax but to deny them the other income tax concessions does seem to be unfair. It is essential that they have a public benevolent institution classification so that they can obtain the benefits of sales tax and the other income tax concessions. I call on the Australian Taxation Office to review its position and to ensure, at least, that they get uniform advice and, more particularly, to make sure that they maintain the concessions that are available by means of being public benevolent institutions. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Today I raise a matter in relation to the administration of the Bankruptcy Act. It is a matter I first raised upon the presentation of the annual report by the Inspector-General in Bankruptcy. However, in the time since the presentation of the report last week, I have been contacted by a number of trustees who are active in the administration of bankruptcy who have raised further matters with me. I have worked through those matters and I come to the chamber with much more detail and with very grave concerns about our commitment to enforcing the Bankruptcy Act.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators should understand that the Bankruptcy Act has obligations placed on trustees both to protect the interests of creditors and also, in certain cases, to safeguard the rights of the debtor. Of course, the whole thrust of the Bankruptcy Act is that a person can be relieved of his debts&mdash;he is also relieved of his property&mdash;and he gets an opportunity after the expiry of the bankruptcy to start his life afresh. Most trustees work assiduously at attempting to do this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The difficulty comes, however, when a bankrupt or, in some cases, a debtor under part X of the Bankruptcy Act seeks to alienate his assets so that there is absolutely no money available for the trustee to fund an investigation of the bankrupt's business affairs. Honourable senators have to understand that the trustees can only conduct investigations where there is money available in the estate to pay the costs. In other words, there have to be assets available for realisation. We are not talking just about payment of their own costs and expenses but also necessary legal costs, for example, if a trustee chooses to have a bankrupt publicly examined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I well remember, when I was working in the insolvency profession, a number of cases in which people originally had very substantial assets but, over a period of time, they were alienated, put into discretionary trusts and companies, the shares of which were owned by other companies which owned shares in other companies and so on, so that there were no assets available for distribution to creditors. That is of great concern. That is a fraud on the creditors. In many cases, it is a fraud on the Commonwealth because, frequently, it is a Commonwealth instrumentality that is on the receiving end of some of this fraudulent activity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Bankruptcy Act contains a provision in section 305 that allows trustees to make application to the minister, the Inspector-General in Bankruptcy or the Assistant Secretary of the Insolvency and Trustee Service of Australia for Commonwealth funding of actions in relation to the estate. Frequently, they are public examinations. In some cases, they can be actions to recover assets, for example, that have been alienated within what is called the relation-back period. In other cases, they are more substantial actions to recover assets, sometimes overseas assets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting, when one turns to page 118 of the 1993 annual report, to see a dwindling in the number of cases approved for funding under section 305 of the act. In 1986-87, there were 237 cases which received approval for government funding under section 305. The next year it was 168; the next year it was 51; then 58, 87, and now 68 cases in the 1992-93 financial year. The government was coming before us last financial year and saying, `We must become tough with bankruptcy administration, we must streamline the simple bankruptcies, but we must give extra powers for trustees to investigate the particularly heinous or objectionable bankruptcies'. Reference was made to Mr Skase, and I do not disagree with that at all. At the same time as the government was talking tough on bankruptcy administration, it was restricting the funds available to trustees under this section. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The interesting thing is that it has always been the case that the 305 funding, as it is called&mdash;that is, the guarantees or the underwriting of legal expenses given under section 305&mdash;has been paid out of fees on the realisation of assets. Honourable senators will not be aware of it if they merely read the act, but if they read the rules in bankruptcy, which do not accompany the act in the form in which it is available from the Australian Government Publishing Service but which are available separately, they will find that in rule 179(4) there is a fee which is prescribed as payable by a trustee on the lodgment of his accounts in the estate of the bankrupt. The trustee has to lodge these accounts every year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the first $50,000 of the prescribed amount, the fee is three per cent. If the prescribed amount exceeds $50,000 but does not exceed $100,000, it is a fee equal to $1,500 plus an amount of 2 1/2 per cent on everything over $50,000. Above that, it is a fee equal to the sum of $2,750 and an amount equal to 1 1/4 per cent of the amount that exceeds $100,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Paragraph 5 of the rules goes on to say what is a prescribed amount. Basically the prescribed amount is the total receipts less any amounts paid to secured creditors in respect of their securities, any amounts paid by the trustee in the carrying on of the business of the bankrupt and any amount of the surplus. In many cases, of course, when we are dealing with a bankrupt estate there is a secured creditor, but it is not that common that they are going to have a cost in trading order business because most bankruptcies are not of that nature. That is a cost which is more ordinarily incurred in the winding-up or receivership of the company. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I went through the annual report and looked at the total receipts by trustees, both official trustees and also private trustees. Under part IV of the Bankruptcy Act, which is bankruptcy, and under part X of the act, which is debtor arrangements under the act, something in the vicinity of $27,441,039 was received into the common investment fund of the official trustees; funds totalling $18,478,373 were received by trustees in respect of bankrupt estates and $38,358,393 was received by trustees in relation to part X estates. The total receipts by trustees under the Bankruptcy Act last year were $84,277,805. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Roughly speaking, that should mean that fees payable will not exceed $2.5 million. Three per cent of that is a bit over $2.5 million but it is unlikely to be that different from the $2.5 million. The exact figure, which is probably in the vicinity of $2 million, was received by the registrars in bankruptcy in each of the jurisdictions. So we have $2 million which has been received in fees; yet in the last financial year total approvals for funding under section 305 amounted to $413,200. That is something in the vicinity of one-fifth of the total amount of fees received. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It gets worse, of course, because we all know that in many cases the actions succeed in recovering assets. The report of the Inspector-General in Bankruptcy makes it perfectly clear that the Commonwealth is never required to pay out all the money which is approved for funding. In fact, it says that over the last few years the average annual amount paid out is $104,000, which is a very small sum. It is something like one-twentieth of the total amount received in fees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That sounds bad enough, but it gets worse. Guidelines were issued under section 305 of the Bankruptcy Act to trustees this year on 21 July. They were also accompanied by a letter from the Inspector-General in Bankruptcy, Mr R. G. Moss, which is dated 3 August 1993. I do intend to speak on them very briefly, but at this point I seek leave of the chamber to have those documents tabled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="EU4">Senator O'CHEE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I table the documents and I thank the Senate. Section 305 funding is governed by these guidelines and it is quite interesting to see what it says. For example, in the scope of the funding, it says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2.3 Funding may be available:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;where there is a significant public interest to be protected</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">&mdash;where there is not a significant public interest, and no creditors are able or willing to indemnify the trustee, but where the Inspector-General considers that there are good prospects for recovery of assets or property if the proposed action is pursued and there are creditors deserving of assistance.</PARA>
<PARA>That makes it sound as though the Inspector-General is going to be reasonably generous in allocating the section 305 funding. But his explanatory letter says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This section is streamlined, to emphasise there are two clear funding categories: those where there is `a significant public interest to be protected', and those where there is not. In the latter case, funding will not ordinarily be provided.</PARA>
<PARA>The problem is, if the creditors have looked at it and have decided that they are incapable of funding it for commercial reasons, people are unlikely to get the section 305 underwriting. The problem with that is that in many cases the creditors are not able to fund it because they are carrying so many debts that are owed by the bankrupt estate anyway and their own business is being squeezed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other difficulty with these guidelines is that they require trustees to get lawyers to do the work for 80 per cent of the scale fee. The trustees themselves do not get remunerated unless they can recover sufficient funds to pay the costs of the lawyers, pay their own costs and then make a distribution to creditors. In the very peculiar case that trustees get their costs covered, they are only covered at 80 per cent. Those would be the cases where it is in the public interests for a trustee to pursue a bankrupt&mdash;for example, Mr Skase. Yet we expect this trustee to do this work at 80 per cent of the scale fee. In those cases, the work involved is quite substantial and trustees do not operate on large profit margins. The consequence of that is that the work will not be done. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The program portfolio estimates of this department were slightly misleading. They set out quite clearly the expenditure, which is in fact declining this financial year. The expenditure of Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia will decline from a 1992-93 estimate of $27,635,000 to a 1993-94 estimate of $22,252,000. When we look at the revenue aspect of the program, on page 74 of the program portfolio estimates, we see that it talks about the revenue received by the Commonwealth. It also talks about dividends paid to Commonwealth instrumentalities, usually the Australian Taxation Office; about official trustee fees, which are taken on a scaled fee basis on realisations; and about interest on the common investment fund which does not get credited to bankrupt estates. In 1991-92 that totalled $7.9 million. In 1992-93 it totalled $8.98 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are seeing Commonwealth funding going down and revenues going up, but nowhere in the program portfolio estimates is there an outline of the amount of fees that are also received by the Commonwealth through the registrars in bankruptcy from the estates of bankrupts and paid by the trustees. We see that that may well be in the vicinity of $2 million. So what we are seeing is a government beating its chest a lot about getting tough on bankruptcy administration, but not matching that with resources. It is also not matching that with funding. In fact, it is taking very large amounts out of the coffers of the trustees, and out of the hands of the creditors, and it is not even displaying those figures in the annual reports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope this will receive some action by the Inspector-General in Bankruptcy or by the Attorney-General. Bankruptcy is a very serious matter. We do have to have compassion for those who are bankrupted but we also have to have an enforcement of the legislation where it is appropriate. I think the government should match its words with deeds. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak about the film <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cenotaph</EMPHASIS>. Senator Faulkner was kind enough to draw to my attention the fact that the film was being shown in Parliament House. I had the chance to view the film and, given the importance of this particular project, I would like to make a few comments about it. I think that most Australians who see the film will think of it as a very moving film. Many people will find the historical footage of the First World War and the first Anzac day parades to be a very emotional experience.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think many families will be able to effectively identify with some of the individual stories which are mentioned in the film of the young men who went to the First World War. The film also records the visit of the old diggers to France. I think that was in August. Part of the film focuses on the school that was built in Villers-Bretonneux after the war, through the contributions of Victorian school children. This is a story which I think deserves to be told and retold. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The film told the story of the Great War from the perspective of the township of Hay, from which township a very high proportion of the young men decided to volunteer in the First World War and left our shores. I think that was a particularly original approach. It gave the backgrounds to all those weathering memorials which appear in virtually every township throughout the nation. I always feel it is particularly moving to drive into an Australian country town and to see, often in the main street, a memorial to the men who left that township some 75 years ago. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This film is part of a series of films. It is the first of seven films on Australia's forces. The aim was to show to viewers the impact on our culture, our heritage and our character of the participation of our forces in the various campaigns in which Australians have fought. Senator Faulkner expressed the hope that it will boost community awareness of the participation and contribution made by Australians to notable events and the campaigns within these conflicts as well as of the overall outcomes.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are five matters that I would like to raise in, I hope, a constructive way. I think the film is a worthwhile film. It is a film that I certainly hope a lot of Australians will have the opportunity to see. I think it was a pity that the film did not mention the great strategic significance of the First World War for Australia. Without mentioning this at least in a brief manner, the viewer of the film may be left wondering why this magnificent army ever left our shores. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the great war historian Bean points out in his book <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Anzac to Amiens</EMPHASIS>, had the Great War resulted in a German victory, `the first term in the peace treaty would have been the abolition of the British Navy; and for the Australian nation this meant either subservience to Germany or extinction at the hands of the Japanese'. Honourable senators will recall that around that period there were a number of areas in the Pacific region where Germany had control. Of course, one of those areas was the neighbouring country of Papua New Guinea. So there was a significant strategic reason why Australia had a great interest in a successful outcome to this war. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unless we say that, it is a bit hard to explain why so many Australians were prepared to leave our shores and fight for so long. It seems to me that, to a certain extent, we undervalue the sacrifice made by these Australians if we do not mention the overall outcome. Despite the dreadful loss of young men and despite the blunders that were made, at the end of the day the war was won, and that was of great strategic significance for Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point I would like to make is that, while the film appropriately highlighted the dreadful loss of life and the great agony of war, to my mind, it largely ignored the brilliant victories in which Australians played a significant role. It is interesting that some dramatic events occurred on 8 August 1918, just 75 years ago. This was the occasion when the five Australian divisions broke through the German lines. General Ludendorff, who was in charge of the Germany army, described this as `the black day of the German Army in the history of the War'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If, as Senator Faulkner said, we are to consider the contributions Australians made to notable events, to my mind, it would have been appropriate to mention again, albeit briefly, the battles in the months leading up to the armistice on 11 November 1918. Monash says in his book on the battles of 1918:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I think that the claim may fairly be made for the Australian Army corps, that in each of the stages of operations which led to the military overthrow&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>of the German Army&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the corps played an important and, in some of them, a predominating part. No better testimony for such a conclusion can be adduced than the admissions of Ludendorff himself.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third point I would like to make in relation to our national character is that Bean further observes that Australians achieved more than national security. He points out that the experience brought `a new confidence into Australian national undertakings . . . the return of the AIF, its leaders covered with distinction, its ranks acclaimed overseas as one of the notable fighting forces in history, deeply, if insensibly, affected that outlook'. There is no question that the First World War and the experiences, both negative and otherwise, did have a major effect on the Australian character. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fourth point I make, and it is a related point, is that we should not be shy of acknowledging the great fighting qualities of these men. It is often expressed that we do not want to glorify war, and I agree with that. On the other hand, it is appropriate to pay tribute to men who show great skill in the military arts and show the great characteristics of courage and sacrifice. This was touched on in the film when it referred to the magnificent army. I think that Patsy Adam-Smith expressed this point particularly powerfully in her book on the ANZACs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Correct, a great Australian writer, and I do not think anyone would describe Patsy Adam-Smith as a conservative. In her book on the ANZACs she wrote about the Australian armies in the First World War and she addressed them directly. She said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You had the greatest number of casualties per men in the field of all the Allied armies; you travelled furtherest, were away the longest. You were the only volunteers. You came from a newer land, were a younger race than any who entered that awful arena.

<PARA>As I said, we should not be shy of acknowledging the great fighting skills of these men and of the armies which they formed. I think it is a pity that the impression was left at the end of the film&mdash;and I make the qualification `if my memory serves me correctly' as I do not have the text before me&mdash;when in the final comments it was suggested that soldiers were court-martialled and shot if they refused to fight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the features of the Australian army, which is very well known in military circles&mdash;and, I hope, in the wider community&mdash;is that desertion was not punishable by death. I think this actually marked the Australian army as being quite different from virtually all other major armies. As a footnote to history, it is worth noting that the British House of Commons, 12 years after the war, voted to abolish the death penalty for desertion from their own armies. I understand it was said in that debate:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If it can be demonstrated that the Australians could fight as gallantly as they did without the death penalty, then it is a libel of the courage of other British  troops  to  say  they  cannot  fight  without it.</PARA>
<PARA>The point I am making there is that we undervalue the heroism of these troops by including what, I think, was an historical inaccuracy. As I said, I think the old footage in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cenotaph</EMPHASIS> of the vast columns of returned servicemen marching in the early Anzac Day parades shows just how proud these men were of their achievements and, indeed, rightly so. To a certain extent, the film will explain to the current generation of Australians aspects of this pride that these men felt. My comments today should be read in the light that the film could have given some emphasis to some areas which were mentioned only briefly, or ignored. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This legislation, which the opposition will not be opposing, amends five acts. The amendments proposed to the acts concerned are fairly innocuous. There is no real theme to the amendments. There are essentially no great policy changes involved. While the bill lacks any theme, the focus of the amendments is to improve rights and conditions of service.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Very briefly, the effect of the amendments is to modify section 52 of the Defence Act to reflect the fact that certain productivity superannuation determinations are no longer interim; to limit the right of appeal from conscientious objection tribunals and the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to the Federal Court to appeals on questions of law; to streamline overseas command procedures where forces of Australia and other nations serve together and to provide a more precise delegation provision, which means they have got some authority; to allow a minister, rather than the Governor-General, to appoint certain trustees to welfare trust funds; to provide a special loan benefit to Australian Defence Force members for warlike service; to amend section 117A dealing with salvage claims by crews of naval ships; and finally to amend the Military Superannuation and Benefits Act to remove the liability for double benefit for members who have transferred from DFRDB to MSBS and who have since retired. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will deal briefly with those changes. In relation to the conscientious objection tribunals, these amendments raise a couple of minor questions that the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) might care to address. Firstly, considering that the legislation to validate the conscientious objection tribunals was passed only last year, following a gestation period which goes back to the mid-1980s, why is this being changed now? Why was it not foreseen and done at the time? I am curious to know why it has now been decided to restrict the right of appeal merely to questions of law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the home loans provisions, according to the Department of Defence annual report, the objectives of the scheme include encouragement of home ownership during service as a cost-effective alternative to rental assistance. Further, it is to assist in the reintegration of defence force personnel into the community on return to civilian employment. Basically, the scheme entitles members to an interest subsidy on a loan funded by the National Australia Bank. Interest on the loan is subsidised to the extent of 40 per cent of the average interest payable over the term of the loan. The maximum loan to which a subsidised interest rate can be paid is $40,000. Various rules apply as to eligibility and so on. The amendment seeks a waiver to the qualifying period, as defined in clause 13 of the principal act. Additionally, it extends the years of loan subsidy, depending on the length of warlike service, and allows for future extension, dependent upon subsequent service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This amendment represents another method for compensating members of the ADF and recognising their overseas service. Recent examples of this were the Gulf War, which attracted slightly different rules, and service in Cambodia, Somalia and the former Yugoslavia. This loan will count in the assessment of income for the purpose of estimating family payment and additional payment. Under a recent amendment to the Social Security Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1993, this loan now becomes a fringe benefit if the recipient is in that income area which is considered low enough to attract additional assistance for the family. This group, therefore, will be financially penalised, depending on the formula as contained in the act, for taking up this loan which Defence claims is a cost-effective alternative to rental assistance. However, if the recipients in the services are above the AFP cut-off point, then this loan will be of benefit to them. In practice, what the government has done has been to create two different classes of recipients within the Australian Defence Force&mdash;those who gain home loan assistance as a condition of service and those who acquire a home loan as a fringe benefit. The great irony here is that fringe benefits are normally something acquired by people on high incomes, not on low incomes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the legislation that passed through this chamber a few months back, legislation that was enthusiastically supported by the minister at the time, those in the Australian defence forces who are on higher incomes currently do not receive any so-called fringe benefits, but it is those on the lower salary scales who are going to be classed as receiving a fringe benefit. Not only do they receive this so-called fringe benefit as a basis of their conditions of service but the sad consequence of it is that, since it will now be classified as a fringe benefit for low income earners, they will not get the family support that they needed to maintain their standard of living and consequently they will go backwards. They are, of course, the group in the defence forces which can least sustain this attack on their family budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I raised this matter with the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, Senator Faulkner, during the estimates hearings, and he started off by comparing members of the ADF with the Public Service in terms of remuneration. I have always argued in this place, as all honourable senators would know, that the members of the Australian Defence Force are not members of the civilian community; they are a unique force and they are paid certain allowances as a reward for the conditions of service that are different from all civilian occupations. He also made this admission at the start of the Senate estimates hearing, when I was questioning him on the effect of the legislation on these low income groups:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I cannot say to you directly what specific impact there will be on any individual defence family.</PARA>
<PARA>The minister also stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As you would be aware, the Minister for Social Security or the minister who represents him in the Senate would obviously have more direct knowledge of this than you would expect the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel to have.</PARA>
<PARA>I certainly do expect the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel to have a very detailed knowledge of the impact of legislation on his own people, the people in the Australian Defence Force. Later on in the Senate estimates hearing he did say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am aware of the impact on defence families and other Australian families of the bill that saw passage through the Senate. . .</PARA>
<PARA>He realised that there was going to be an impact but he could not quantify it. He did not know what effect it is going to have, and I do not think that is good enough. It is nowhere good enough for a minister, particularly in the defence field, to not defend to the limit the interests of his constituency, the people he is responsible for in the Australian defence forces. It would be one thing if we are talking about a minister for the Treasury or for social security or something like that where there is a great aggregation of people in the Public Service under comparable conditions. But for the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Defence Science and Personnel not to have fought for the interests of the members of the ADF and won the case, as they could well have&mdash;because there is no way anyone would describe Senator Ray in a political forum as a lightweight or an easy push-over&mdash;is I think quite reprehensible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next item I want to talk about is superannuation. This legislation also deals with defence superannuation. It cleans up a problem the government itself created through a badly framed disallowable instrument last year. Additionally, an amendment is made to reflect the fact that productivity superannuation determinations are no longer interim. These measures are acceptable to the opposition. However, again it is odd that the government is involved in an exercise to clean up the defence superannuation area on the one hand yet on the other is apparently using superannuation as an instrument in its attempt to achieve increased separations to preserve government budget targets with respect to the Department of Defence budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, if ADF members separate voluntarily but before the completion of their term, they attract a superannuation penalty, but, should they accept a redundancy package prior to the completion of their term, the penalty is waived. While it is not directly related, I should comment that, as far as I can ascertain, the return of service obligation is also being waived on a selective basis. But, to return to superannuation, reports are now circulating that superannuation is also being used as a convenient way to ensure&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is the case that the deputy head of UMNO youth has sent a letter to Australia's High Commissioner in Malaysia, Mr John Dauth. That letter is not a communication from the Malaysian government. The High Commissioner, in fact, is currently accompanying a senior Malaysian business delegation to the national trade and investment outlook conference in Melbourne, which is where Senator Cook is at the moment. It is the biggest such conference in the history of this country and one of the most important contributions that could be made to the business environment of this country, I say by way of interpolation in response to Senator Hill's original, opening, very churlish remarks. Mr Dauth, as the High Commissioner, will respond appropriately to the letter in question when he returns to Malaysia.</PARA>

I add just this: our relationship with Malaysia is a very substantial and very balanced one which I think is unlikely to be blown off course by cross-winds of this kind. It is an important relationship which produces major benefits, not just for Australia but for both sides. Both our leaders have a habit of expressing themselves from time to time in rather forthright terms, but I believe that our bilateral relationship is capable of withstanding such exchanges.</PARA>

This program has formally been in consultation with the child-care industry, which involves centres and parents, since the beginning of 1992. But the process was proceeding well before that.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank Senator Murphy for his question. I am sorry that people do not think investment in Australia is as important as distorting the child-care guidelines. Most Australians do consider investment to be important. It is actually a particularly timely question. The Australian Bureau of Statistics yesterday released its September quarter survey of private new capital expenditure. The survey shows that in the June quarter, private new capital expenditure grew by 2 per cent in seasonally adjusted terms. Those commentators who have expressed some scepticism as to the importance of these numbers have failed to look behind the aggregate figures and analyse their composition. It is important to note&mdash;and if the commentators had assessed the figures they would have noted&mdash;that investment in plant and equipment increased by a very solid 5 per cent. Expected new capital expenditure for 1993-94&mdash;that is, business expectations&mdash;has risen by 6 per cent since its already revised June quarter estimate.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This follows a significant upward revision to the actual level of private investment in 1992-93. The rate of growth in the volume of plant and equipment investment has been revised upwards from 1.6 per cent to 5.4 per cent. People on the other side of the chamber are happy to make negative comments, but I have not heard them commenting on the upward revisions. This substantially improves the base on which this latest evidence of improving expectations is now building.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer has publicly noted on a number of occasions in recent days that it is now clear that the economy is on the move, even though the opposition would love to find ways of talking it down. This morning the Australian Bureau of Statistics released manufacturers' sales figures showing that these are estimated to have grown by 2 per cent in real seasonally adjusted terms in the September quarter. Expected sales for 1993-94 have been revised upwards by 4 per cent since the June survey. A pick-up in investment in new productive capacity is crucial to ensuring that the recovery, which is unequivocally under way, is sustained and that unemployment is reduced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased to see that at least one shadow minister is acknowledging that the business situation is improving. Opposition members do not want to hear about the fact that the economy is improving because they are very disappointed when it happens.

The opposition wants to disguise the fact that, as well as employment growing, there are important positive announcements such as yesterday's press report&mdash;that the opposition would hate to recognise&mdash;that the electronics giant Siemens is planning to invest more than $100 million in new research and development in Australia. I have been waiting to hear the opposition welcome that, but I have not heard a word.</PARA></TALK.START>

Company profits figures released today for the September quarter show a further increase of five per cent&mdash;the ninth consecutive quarterly increase which has taken this series to its highest level since the series was commenced in 1985. So I think there is a broad range of statistics that builds on the welcome growth in employment which is being shown in the Australian economy. The significant trend in increased employment, which the opposition always fails to recognise; the increase in private new capital expenditure; the upward revision in the level of private investment; and the release of improvements in manufacture sales figures continue to confirm the improvement. These are not figures I am making up; these are all figures from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, which is recognised internationally as amongst the best one or two statistical organisations in the world.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;With every respect to our Green colleagues, to describe the legislative adventure on which they embarked yesterday as half baked would, I am afraid, be too much of a compliment. Even the most cursory scrutiny of that Native Title (Status Quo) Bill shows it to be full of legal, constitutional and administrative flaws. Quite apart from the question of whether there is a sufficiently strong Commonwealth head of power to sustain legislation of this kind, and quite apart from the question of the possible implied immunity of states from legislative exercises of Commonwealth power which dramatically impact on the performance through legislation of essential state functions, the bill simply does not address the just terms question which always arises whenever any inhibition on state property dealing is involved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Quite apart from that consideration, the bill does not affect&mdash;or even purport to affect, or prevent in any way at all&mdash;any grant or extinguishment made under any existing law or, for that matter, by any exercise of executive power. The bill purports only to apply to inhibitions on native title as a result of legislative action undertaken by someone after 1 July. So it is really full of flaws, quite apart from the other problems associated with delaying the passage of this legislation at this stage.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Far from having the practical impact of inhibiting the passage of the Western Australian government's legislation, the presentation of this little number by Senator Chamarette last night provoked precisely the opposite&mdash;an obscene flurry of activity throughout the night in the Western Australian parliament when, among other things, for the first time in the history of the Legislative Council in that state and against every stated belief of the parliamentary leaders of that state, the guillotine was used.</PARA>

The Department of Veterans' Affairs recently analysed prescribing patterns and has identified several issues. For example, a patient may attend two medical practitioners who each prescribe different drugs. When used in combination they may lead to serious and adverse drug reactions. Often, neither practitioner is aware of what drugs the other is prescribing. Over a recent four-month period there were several thousand instances where dangerous combinations of drugs were prescribed, many of these involving more than one prescriber.</PARA></TALK.START>

I am sure that the honourable senator will find that most parents are very happy with the child-care centres they have at the moment.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I always think there is a difficulty with the application of new drugs. When some patients who have serious illnesses are told that a new drug might help them, there is always considerable agitation for that drug to be made freely available. I think Australia has got it basically right in the way we assess those drugs and the kinds of processes through which the manufacturers must go before they get full approval and before drugs eventually go on to the pharmaceutical benefits list. Interferon alpha-2B is a drug that is currently subsidised for the treatment of hairy-cell leukaemia and hepatitis B.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At its most recent meeting, the pharmaceutical benefits advisory committee also recommended that this drug be made available for the treatment of chronic myelogenous leukaemia. I was actually quite pleased that that occurred because I had a meeting with a number of prominent haematologists from around Australia who were pleading for that. Prior to that moment the pharmaceutical benefits advisory committee had not agreed with myelogenous leukaemia being one of those problems for which this drug could be used on the pharmaceutical benefits list.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we have a conflict between experts who are advising us, as a minister it is always difficult to sort it out. We have never sought to disagree with the pharmaceutical benefits advisory committee and it would need to be a pretty special occasion on which we would ever seek to do so. At the same meeting that the advisory committee extended interferon 2B to chronic myelogenous leukaemia, it also decided against recommending subsidising interferon for the treatment of hepatitis C. It did so primarily due to a lack of what it considered to be sufficient information. The committee was not convinced of the efficacy of the drug for hepatitis C without more evidence. The long term benefits of treatment of hepatitis C with interferon still remain unclear.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It ought to be made clear here that that decision was not based on cost. I have seen some suggestions that it was. A recent report from the NHMRC task force and the health ministers advisory committee stated that the evaluation of more clinical data is needed before precise recommendations can be made about the circumstances in which interferon alfa-2B can be considered in the overall management of chronic hepatitis C infection. With hepatitis C infection becoming a bigger problem in Australia, we will have to monitor this very carefully, but we cannot and should not adopt new drugs simply on the basis of hope. We will need to make sure that proper assessments of the efficacy are made.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This is an important question because an important election is being held on 4 December for ATSIC. This is building on the important step of establishing ATSIC and, in that way, increasing the empowerment of the most disadvantaged in our society. It is important to use every opportunity to encourage a high rate of participation in these elections because, for very good and obvious reasons, information on racial origin is not recorded on the Commonwealth electoral roll and, therefore, we need to take steps to encourage people to seek to participate in these elections.</PARA></TALK.START>

At one stage it states that the MFP project will no longer have Gillman as a core site, but that the Liberal Party will continue to environmentally upgrade the Gillman site and go ahead with the expenditure of money under the better cities program.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Probably 20 to 30 different tech parks are being developed around Australia, and none of them get federal funding. They are all developed by state governments as tech parks. If we turn the MFP from an international project into a state tech park project, every other tech park will say, `If you are going to continue the funding on that basis, we want our cut of the cake'. I do not think the federal government will be in a position to say that we will start funding the development of every tech park in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are supporting the MFP because it is a long-term international project with an international commitment to the principle of the MFP.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On Tuesday, Senator Ferguson asked me a question relating to the community cultural, recreational and sporting facilities program approval for applications from category 4. First, it must be stated that applications in all categories are eligible for funding, including category 3. Ineligible applications are eliminated before the categorisation process commences. The audit office was under some confusion about this. When it first raised this question, it was using as its guide out-of-date criteria. It has since rectified its mistake and now acknowledges that these applications are eligible for funding.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The figures quoted by the ANAO do not tell the whole story. Obviously, when one looks at selectively published groups of figures it is easy to misinterpret the situation. The opposition's finance spokesman fell for that this morning when he stated that a project was more likely to be funded if it were in category three. The truth is that he got it wrong.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The categorisation program used by Mrs Kelly's department forms the basis for decisions in this program. In the last round of grants, 55 per cent of category one applications were funded compared with 26 per cent of category two and 15 per cent of category three. Clearly that shows that a high quality grant in category one is far more likely to be approved.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, in the assessment of the categories it became clear that a number of very high quality applications had been ranked in category three because of a minor mistake in their applications.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For example, if an applicant with an otherwise excellent application requested $31,000 out of a total cost of $60,000, the department would place it in category three. The minister believed that the categorisation was unduly harsh and considered the application on its other merits. If funding were approved for these projects, it was approved only on the basis that the organisations applied a revised budget in accordance with the guidelines.</PARA>

<PARA>I want to take a minute of the Senate's time to respond to the answer that Senator Schacht gave. I want to respond to his unprecedented threat to the people of South Australia&mdash;what one might call electoral blackmail. The minister said that if the incoming government in South Australia decided to put the MFP money where it should be&mdash;that is into the scientific research and the industrial application of that research&mdash;instead of wasting it in the swamp at Gillman, then he would perhaps withdraw Commonwealth funding for the project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is an appalling threat that is certainly not in the best interests of South Australia. He ought to be ashamed to come in here and use electoral blackmail in that way.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That was an extraordinary performance. This matter is obviously stinging the opposition. The opposition has realised that it is turning a project which has international support into a limited state technology park. It has realised that by doing so, it will lose international support. Of course the Australian government has to assess its contributions to programs such as these. We do not fund state technology parks around Australia per se.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The comments made by Senator Hill indicate that the opposition will say that it will add a bit of money to the Adelaide University, the Waite Institute and the South Australian University in order to make them centres of excellence. All of those programs are already operating in Australia, including the program in the cooperative research centres. In Australia, we already have funding for those programs but it is under a different guise and a different name. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is extraordinary that the Liberal Party would want to destroy the only major international project that South Australia has had in the last couple of decades. The opposition wants to turn South Australia's only such project into a limited minor vision for a state technology development park. There is no future in that. The international partners will be off. They are only in it because they see the MFP as part of an international project. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, those opposite want to turn the project into a narrow-minded, petty, parochial state development. Well, they can do so. But they cannot expect the federal government to automatically front up with money for such a project when it is being replicated all round Australia in every state and territory&mdash;or all of those bodies could also demand money for those sorts of developments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out to Senator Hill that the federal government not only provides moneys under the better cities program, which is specifically for urban upgrading, to help the development of the Gillman site but also provides funds separately to the MFP for administration, the corporation and consultancy work. That money is a specialised allocation to the MFP in the annual budget of my department. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, it will be very hard to justify making that sort of continuing allocation if the project is only a replica of every other state technology park around Australia. That is what I am warning the people of South Australia about. The vandals in the Liberal Party, by destroying an international project, are putting the federal funding at risk, because the federal government is in this project only because of its international and national dimensions, not on the basis of its being a purely state run, state technology park. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said this on four or five occasions now. I know that it is hard for Senator Hill and his ilk to understand the point. I only do so to warn him and the others that, if they go down this path of wrecking the international aspects of the MFP, it will be on their heads. The consequences for South Australia would be very severe indeed because we would lose a major international project&mdash;a project the likes of which has not been developed in South Australia or any other area for many years. That is why it is so disappointing to see the narrow focus and the parochialism of the Liberal Party of South Australia and its supporters in this chamber.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am absolutely delighted that the opposition has at long last caught up with the duplicity of both the federal and South Australian Labor governments with respect to the MFP. Honourable senators will recall that for years I have been asking questions in relation to this nonsense development&mdash;this waste of money. Former Senator Button used to criticise me regularly, with the support of the opposition, over my position on this wastage of money.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Schacht, in response to a question from Senator Chapman, said that Senator Chapman was confused about the nature of the MFP. To give just one example of how confused this government was, the original proposal for the MFP put forward by the South Australian government talked about the recreation capabilities of the Gillman site. It talked about people recreating on the beaches in the mangroves. People who know anything at all about mangrove areas know that they do not have beaches; they are full of sticky mud and one does not lie on them and recreate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators will recall that repeatedly in answers to questions about the financial support for the MFP Senator Button said that no government money was to into it; this was going to be privately driven. I think Senator Chapman is confused because my estimate of the amount of money which the federal and state governments have already committed to the MFP is $167 million. When we look at the original proposal we see incredible and amazing maps of the Gillman site showing axes named `Water', `Humanity' and `Environment', which quite miraculously happen to cross at the Gillman site. Of course, anybody with any sense could see that those lines could be drawn on any map anywhere and could be made to intersect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we look at the environmental assessment of the Gillman site, we find that the Department of Environment and Planning in South Australia advised the South Australian government that the Gillman site should not be touched. The government went back to the Department of Environment and Planning in South Australia and said, `We don't like your report. We want you to report differently'. The Department of Environment and Planning went back to the South Australian government and said, `The Gillman site should definitely not be touched'. So there is clear evidence that the Gillman site is totally unsuitable for the sort of development which the South Australian and federal governments are trying to foist onto it&mdash;with very inappropriate planning and thinking. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to the other matter that Senator Schacht has just raised in his comments. In the federal area, since 1983 this Labor government has consistently cut down the money which goes into research institutes and universities around Australia. Then it turns around and says, `We need to spend money on an MFP'. What it should be doing is precisely what the Liberal opposition in South Australia is now, belatedly, recognising: the money should be going back to the starved research institutes and universities around this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are many excellent projects which should be supported. With respect to this aspect, I think that at long last the Liberal opposition in South Australia has got it right. It is unfortunate that it has taken it so many years to recognise that, but it does have it right. That is precisely where the money should be going. Senator Schacht spoke about this project having international support. We have repeatedly invited Senator Schacht to tell us exactly how much international money has come into the MFP. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services (Senator McMullan), to a question without notice asked by Senator Tambling this day, relating to an Electoral Commission inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA>Today, in answer to a question, Senator McMullan acknowledged that the government was guilty of both retribution and vindictiveness with regard to various community associations and organisations. We have seen the sensitivity of a Labor government that is not prepared to talk to anyone who takes a contrary or different, and perhaps controversial, view from its own. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This saga goes back to just following the March election when the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) raised the possibility of retribution against business groups which in his opinion had exerted or exhibited an election bias. It was, of course, the right of groups such as the Housing Industry Association and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry to take a principled position on views which differed from those of the government. But not according to Mr Keating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At about the same time, the Treasurer, Mr Dawkins, also engaged in a degree of criticism and implied that the government would take very strong action against the business community and, in his words, would treat them accordingly. In that respect, very early in the piece we saw those sorts of actions from both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer. During the Senate estimates committees in September, I again raised this issue, particularly and specifically with regard to the Housing Industry Association. I was informed on 3 September by Mr Howe's departmental secretary, Mr Cole, that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The government has made a decision that it is not going to deal with the Housing Industry Association. I have been instructed that the department should not deal with the Housing Industry Association. Accordingly, where the Housing Industry Association as such was represented on the various consultative committees that we have with the industry, its representatives have stood down from those positions.</PARA>
<PARA>That, of course, brought out the ire of the Housing Industry Association, which, in a letter to me, responded as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One issue we found bemusing was Mr Cole's observation during the hearings that the Association had "stood down" from representation of various committees. In fact, this was not a choice the Association made. The HIA was notified officially by the Department that it had been "suspended" from the housing committees.</PARA>
<PARA>Again, right through the estimates of 3 September and 25 October, it was very clearly established that Minister Howe very vindictively had wiped the Housing Industry Association out from any contact with the Labor caucus or, for that matter, the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Similarly, Senator Crowley at the estimates committee very clearly established her own bias. In a letter that was incorporated at the estimates committee hearing she made some very strong and similar statements. It stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Government considered that in taking this action&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is the electoral action it took&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">the HIA had moved from the conventional role of a non-party-political peak association lobbying on behalf of its members over particular issues, to a partisan political position.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Taking this changed role into account, the Government questioned the extent to which the HIA could continue to represent the view of organisations in the housing industry.</PARA>
<PARA>That is an incredible position for a government to reach. It certainly would appear that it has countered the views&mdash;and certainly the spirit&mdash;intended in the electoral act. Whilst I am aware, as Minister McMullan mentioned earlier today, that complaints had been made against the Prime Minister and Mr Dawkins, I believe the actions very clearly indicated and taken by the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Howe, who is the portfolio minister relating to housing, and Senator Crowley should also be subjected to inquiry now by the Electoral Commission. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It again reveals the arrogance of this government in dealing with anybody that is representative. Anyone who takes a contrary view to that which the Prime Minister wants to espouse or the Labor Party believes it has a divine right to hold, will be wiped from the face of the earth. The fact that such people might represent most of the industry organisations, as does the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry or the Housing Industry Association, reveals the government's arrogance and shows very clearly where the Labor government is heading. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know the detail of what is being alleged was done by Mr Howe and Senator Crowley. But what I said in the answer stands: if someone wishes to make a complaint, it is a matter for that individual to make that inquiry, and the Electoral Commission will independently assess it. But nobody can say that the law requires us to sit and talk to someone just because we used to. If after talking to them for a while, we find it an absolute waste of time, why would we bother to continue? That certainly was the view I took in dealing with the Housing Industry Association in my areas of responsibility.

I just found it an absolute waste of time and stopped doing it. </PARA>

But the situation is simply this: that, in the circumstances of any minister's conduct of operation, as I have said and as Senator Tambling would know, he or she has to make choices. That is not the same as saying that we seek to interfere with the right of that organisation to discharge its obligations on behalf of its members&mdash;that is the business of the organisation and its members. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nothing has been done that seeks in any way to interfere with the right of either of those organisations to liaise with its members, to represent its members or to participate in democratic dialogue.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we cannot come in here pretending that, in some way, a law which says that we should not discriminate against people requires us to continue to participate in useless dialogue with people who have spent an enormous amount of time trying to distort the position and create unreasonable and unfair propositions&mdash;at least in our minds.

<PARA>The issue that Senator Herron raised with Senator Crowley related to the very contentious issue of the child-care guidelines which have been brought before this chamber. It is correct to say that there has been a great upwelling of fury on this particular issue from the wider community. Those who listen to talkback radio and read the popular press will see the very widespread concern that exists in the community about the government's actions in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to reflect why this has occurred. When one reads through the guidelines, many are unexceptionable and indeed some would be regarded as quite normal by a lot of families. When one takes the whole package together, one finds that it is bureaucracy in the extreme, and often the guidelines are contradictory within themselves. A number of guidelines reflect an astonishingly trendy view of how children should be brought up. It is interesting that the guidelines speak about being sensitive to multiculturalism, which I think is appropriate, but at the same time the guidelines are astonishingly insensitive about Australian culture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Every year in this country for some 200 years we have had the occasion of Christmas in which Australians join together to sing Christmas carols. It is one great part of our cultural experience as children. I would suggest that this would be the first time that any document has ever been put out in this country which somehow says that on the Christmas occasion carols are not culturally relevant to many people. It is interesting that at the same time as the document so constantly speaks about being sensitive to different views and attitudes in the area of multiculturalism, it tramples so shamelessly on the sensitivities of most Australians. That is the first  point  I  wish  to  make before  the chamber. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point is that, whereas the guidelines pretend to be sensitive to multiculturalism and use that as a way to attack what has been regarded for some 200 years as a traditional Australian custom, they also trample on many of the values of multiculturalism. Many migrant groups have particularly traditional and conservative views on the role of the family. I find myself sharing many of those views in common with those groups. I do not know how they would react to the very strange views that these guidelines have about giving boys trucks and trains and giving girls dolls. A lot of these groups would feel exactly like me that this is a perfectly normal thing to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we read these guidelines, I find it astonishing that such customs and attitudes should come under attack and be treated in such a disapproving manner.

<PARA>The Government has already required a significant improvement in the information that superannuation funds must provide to members and prospective members. Considerable improvements with respect to superannuation funds were made with effect from 1 July 1992 with the insertion of "Division 2&mdash;Information on fund management" (Regulations 18C to 18S inclusive) into Part II of the Occupational Superannuation Standards Regulations (OSSR). These broadly require that the trustees of superannuation funds disclose certain information to members, prospective members and former members of funds. The amount and  determination of members' benefit must be provided by means of regular reports. Information with respect to the management and financial affairs of the fund must also be supplied regularly to members of funds which have more than four members. Additional information must be disclosed to fund members on request.Existing regulation 22 prescribes the disclosure of information standards pertaining to approved deposit funds (ADFs). The regulation requires, broadly, that the trustees shall give to each depositor a written statement setting out the opening and closing balances, deposits, withdrawals and earnings for each year of income. A similar report is required upon a person ceasing to be a depositor. Upon request, a copy of the ADF's returns, certificates and notices must be provided.The Superannuation Industry (Supervision) legislation (SIS) empowers the making of regulations with respect to the information to be disclosed to members. It is the Government's intention that the intent of the current regulations be broadly transferred to the SIS regulations. However, the development of the SIS regulations will also provide an opportunity to improve the current regulations, particularly with respect to the relevance of the information provided to members and the public, and to limit funds' compliance costs.The Government does not consider that publication of details on fund costs and returns by the ISC is warranted because it is already being provided by the private sector. For example, there are comprehensive comparisons published of the entry, exit and annual fees and earnings rates of superannuation entities.The Government, industry bodies and professional organisations are currently examining the possibility of adopting standards of both measurement and presentation of performance indicators.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>3.  The Committee recommends that the Government monitor trends in changes in the investment portfolios of superannuation funds to enable appropriate judgements and decisions to be made about the extent of diversification.</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>Accepted in part</PARA>
<PARA>Comments</PARA>
<PARA>The Government will continue to monitor the general investment practice of the superannuation industry.  However, the Government notes that the optimal degree of diversification will vary from fund to fund depending upon a number of fund specific factors.  For this reason the Government believes that trustees of superannuation funds are best placed to determine what is an appropriate investment profile for a particular fund.  The SIS legislation contains covenants which are to be included in the governing rules of superannuation funds.One of these covenants is the 'prudent person rule' which is designed to ensure that trustees adopt a suitably diverse investment portfolio consistent with maximising retirement income.  This covenant (under paragraph 50(2)(f) of the SIS legislation) requires the trustees of a superannuation entity 'to formulate and give effect to an investment strategy that has regard to the whole of the circumstances of the entity including, but not limited to, the following:(i) the risk involved in making, holding and realising, and the likely return from, the entity's investments having regard to its objectives and its expected cash flow requirements;(ii) the composition of the entity's investments as a whole including the extent to which the investments are diverse or involve the entity being exposed to risks from inadequate diversification;(iii) the liquidity of the entity's investments having regard to its expected cash flow requirements;(iv) the ability of the entity to discharge its existing and prospective liabilities.'The Government will, of course, continue to monitor changes in investment portfolios as evidenced by data published by the ABS, information collected by the ISC as part of returns provided by superannuation funds and life companies, other information published by the private sector, and from industry contacts.</PARA>

<PARA>Not accepted</PARA>
<PARA>Comments</PARA>
<PARA>At the Special Premiers Conference in October 1990, the States and the Commonwealth reaffirmed the long standing view that responsibility for non-bank financial institutions lies primarily with the States.

There are a number of complying superannuation funds run by friendly societies that do report to the ISC.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>5.  The Committee believes that the initiative of the ABCI in conducting a strategic assessment of superannuation is a forward looking one which warrants the full support of both the superannuation industry and relevant government regulatory and enforcement agencies.  Accordingly, the Committee recommends that the Treasurer and the Attorney-General take steps to ensure that a thorough and systematic assessment is made.  Further, the Committee recommends that, upon the completion of the assessment, an appropriate strategy to combat the entry of organised crime into superannuation be developed by the end of 1993.</PARA>

<PARA>The ISC's audit procedures are designed to form an opinion on the validity of the trustee's claim that the fund is complying with all relevant operational standards.  These procedures also facilitate the monitoring of key prudential concerns, in particular, minimising the risk of fraudulent misappropriation of members' funds. The procedures seek to identify weaknesses in internal control systems and to identify situations or events that increase the risk of fraud to enable appropriate and timely remedial action.  The Government will be giving consideration to what further assessment and analysis needs to be undertaken in this area.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>6.  As the Committee has not received sufficient evidence on the matter of unfunded public sector superannuation liabilities, and as it does not have the resources or time to carry out a far reaching investigation of the problem, it recommends that as a matter of urgency the Commonwealth Government convene a meeting of State Finance Ministers/Treasurers to develop a plan of action for addressing the problems posed by unfunded public sector superannuation liabilities.Not acceptedThe Government considers that decisions on the funding of public sector superannuation liabilities are matters for each individual government.The Government is fully aware of its responsibilities in administering its superannuation schemes, particularly the need to contain the costs of these schemes at manageable levels.  The long term costs of the schemes are reported regularly by the Australian Government Actuary and monitored by the Government.  This and other costing processes also ensure that superannuation costs are fully factored into management and employment decisions.The Government has implemented significant reforms over recent years to lower the long term employer costs of Commonwealth superannuation.  Several States have also implemented major reforms to their principal superannuation schemes and others are considering such reforms.</PARA>

<PARA>3.1  The Committee recommends that, as a matter of urgency, the Commonwealth should initiate discussions with the States with a view to facilitating portability between them and that these objectives be achieved by the end of 1993.Accepted in partFollowing the December 1992 meeting of the Council of Australian Governments a working party was set up to investigate barriers to mobility between State, Territory and Commonwealth sector employment and to recommend solutions to overcome those barriers. Superannuation has been identified as one of the barriers and an examination is being made as to the options and preferred solution. It is expected that this matter will be addressed by a future Council of Australian Governments meeting.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>3.2  The Committee recommends that the Government take steps to provide for the mandatory vesting, as from a date to be determined, of a significant part of the employer-financed benefits in occupational superannuation funds accrued to that date but not otherwise vested. An example of a possible scheme is:Accepted in partThe Government is reviewing the need for minimum vesting standards for voluntary employer-financed benefits in the light of the introduction of the Superannuation Guarantee.(i) The amount to be vested shall be not less than each member's contributions, plus fund earnings, to that date.(ii) The amount should be vested over a ten year period. (iii) Where existing rules would, if applied, result in a greater sum being vested in any member, those rules should apply.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>

<PARA>3.7  The Committee further recommends that the Government should, as a matter of urgency, initiate research into all aspects of appropriate retirement ages and the extent of double dipping in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>Accepted in part</PARA>
<PARA>Comments</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has commissioned from relevant departments and Government agencies a comprehensive review of the manner in which the Government's policies toward superannuation interact with its provision of the age pension. DSS has undertaken some limited research into the incidence of double dipping in Australia, both through commissioned survey work (Later Life Provision Survey, DSS 1992) and review and analysis of existing information (Kalisch 1992, Patterson and Kalisch 1993).The incidence of double-dipping is to a large extent dependent on the size of the superannuation benefit received. Double dipping is not an issue where superannuation payments are small and the pensioner has little or no income or assets from other sources because, regardless of the uses to which it is put, the payment would have little, if any, impact on the level of the age pension entitlement under the DSS income and assets test.Results from the Later Life Provision Survey suggest that the extent of double dipping in  Australia has been exaggerated. The survey showed that only about 3 per cent of pensioners received a lump sum of over $100,000 and most pensioners who had received a lump sum, regardless of its size, either re-invested it to provide income or used it to pay off their mortgage or other debts. Similarly, 19 per cent of non-pensioners had received a lump sum in excess of $100,000, and most non-pensioners also re-invested it or used it to pay off debts. Kalisch (1992) in a paper prepared for an Economic Planning and Advisory Council (EPAC) seminar on the interaction between superannuation and age pensions also found that double-dipping was not as prevalent as had been thought. The paper used the results of a number of other Australian surveys previously published on the double-dipping issue and data from recent Australian Bureau of Statistics surveys to demonstrate that lump sum superannuation payments are largely directed towards income-generating investments or housing. While some limited expenditure on holidays was also relatively common it accounted for a small amount of the total lump sum received.There was some indication that pensioners diverted more of their superannuation lump sums than non-pensioners towards housing investment but on the whole pensioners appeared to be still very prudent in their disbursement of any lump sums they received. Evidence showed that larger lump sums were more likely than smaller amounts to be used to generate retirement income (rather than for immediate consumption) and there was no indication of former high income earners restructuring financial arrangements to draw the pension.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>3.8  The Committee recommends that the ISC, the organisation which it believes is best placed to administer this policy, work towards the achievement of the Committee's long term goal to eliminate early access to retirement benefits. The Committee also recommends that the ISC promulgate a policy to ensure consistency of treatment of applications and further recommends that the ISC develop a more limited set of rules setting out clearly the circumstances for hardship assistance.</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>Accepted in part</PARA>
<PARA>Comments</PARA>
<PARA>The Government acknowledges that in principle early release of retirement benefits should be discouraged. In current economic circumstances, however, the Government is prepared to agree to early release if the fund member is in severe financial difficulties or for other compassionate reasons. The Insurance and Superannuation Commission (ISC) has guidelines for assessing case-by-case whether preservable benefits should be released having regard to the applicant's circumstances. The administration of the guideline was reviewed recently and revised procedures were implemented from 1 July 1993. The new guidelines aim to improve consistency in the treatment of applications, minimise delays, increase uniformity across different categories of applicants and to make some refinements to account for advice from the Privacy Commissioner and the Ombudsman. The ISC has received a large number of applications in recent times which include evidence of severe financial difficulties and which are consistent with the guidelines.</PARA>

<PARA>4.1  The Committee recommends that the Government investigate the possible expansion of long term debt instruments with a view to affording annuity providers greater opportunities to provide lower-cost indexed products.</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>Accepted in part</PARA>
<PARA>Comments</PARA>
<PARA>The Commonwealth's debt portfolio is managed with the objective of minimising long-term cost while limiting exposure to risk. Managing the maturity profile of the portfolio is integral to achieving an appropriate balancing of cost and risk objectives, and the issue of longer-term debt is, and will continue to be, considered in this context. The Commonwealth's conventional (nominal) Treasury Bond portfolio now includes maturities in each year out to the year 2005.In February 1993, the Government resumed the issue of Treasury Indexed Bonds as part of its issue program with the introduction of a new 2010 maturity. There have been four issues to date into the 2010 stock, with total volume outstanding approximately $1.45 billion. At present it is expected that around a further $0.8 billion of Indexed Bonds will be issued over the remainder of 1993-94 with precise decisions as to volume, maturity and price to be made in the light of market conditions and related factors at the time of issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"> The Government intends to issue indexed bonds on a continuing basis over the longer term. The availability of CPI indexed bonds should assist the development of superannuation and other retirement savings products.</PARA>

<PARA>4.2  The Committee recommends that the Government proceed with its announced intention to rebate all income tax otherwise payable by age pensioners.</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>Not accepted</PARA>
<PARA>Comments</PARA>
<PARA>The Government decided not to proceed with this measure because it is not necessarily the best way of responding to its continuing concerns regarding pensioners. The Government is concerned to assist those who rely on the pension as their sole source of income. At the same time, the Government is concerned that the interaction of the pension income test and income tax relief directed towards full-rate and lower-income part-rate pensioners results in high effective marginal tax rates for many part-rate pensioners.The Government will examine other policy options to better integrate the tax and the social security systems and to address problems caused by high effective marginal tax rates.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>4.3  The Committee recommends the assets test be aligned with the income test via the application of realistic, market-related interest equivalents, subject to:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(a) a reasonable allowance, for example $50,000, for personal and household possessions; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">(b) inclusion of actual income on bona fide income-earning assets.</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>Not accepted</PARA>
<PARA>Comments</PARA>
<PARA>The recommendation diverges from the Government position that people with very substantial assets should use some of these assets to support themselves before calling on the taxpayer for assistance. Hardship provisions and the separate pensioner loans scheme are available for people who either cannot liquidate certain assets, or who choose not to.In addition, the assets test thresholds are generous and are also indexed in July each year to protect assets-tested pensioners. Currently, if assessed under the assets test, a single homeowner with assets of less than $112 750 (excluding the family home) would receive maximum rate pension. Assets over this level would reduce the pension payable by $1.50 a week for every $1000 above the threshold until the pension cut-out point (currently $220 000 for a single homeowner) is reached. Married non-homeowners can have up to $419 000 in assessable assets before they lose all the pension.The assets test withdrawal rate was reduced in September of this year from $2 a week for every $1000 in assessable assets above the threshold, in recognition that the decline in interest rates has meant a reduction in income for some retirees with relatively high asset levels. This meant that retirees with assets over the threshold received a pension increase or, in some cases, qualified for a part-payment for the first time. The initiative is expected to help over 40 000 retirees in a year.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>4.4  The Committee recommends that the Treasurer and the Minister for Social Security form a working party to examine income tax and social security legislation with a view to maximising the consistency of definitions and treatment of matters of common concern to the two systems and that the report be tabled in Parliament by the end of 1993.</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>Accepted in part</PARA>
<PARA>Comments</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee advocates the smooth transition from dependence on the age pension to fully self-funded retirement, through the establishment of consistent definitions, concepts and practices between the taxation and social security legislation.Specifically, it cites tax law which treats each individual separately: the incomes of husband and wife are taxed independently, although a rebate is allowed for dependent spouses and any unused pension rebate is transferable. By contrast, all income is allocated equally to husband and wife for age pension income test purposes because social security assistance is based on the concept of the `income unit'; not the individual.In addition, the social security system assesses both income and assets, unlike the tax system in order to ensure that all resources are taken into account in determining pension entitlement.Also, social security eligibility requirements, including the income and assets tests, are based on the provision of income support when and as it is needed. If, as occurs in the tax system, the income test was based around annual reconciliation on a financial year basis the assistance is likely to be unrelated to the needs of the individual at a particular point in time.The differences in taxation and social security assessment of superannuation are particularly marked. The tax treatment is based on a lifecycle approach extending from accumulation to receipt. In contrast, the age pension is intended to provide income to those most in need at particular points in time.While it is recognised that client understanding would be enhanced by consistent treatment across social security and taxation, these considerations mean that the tax and social security systems do not operate in the same way because of the divergent purposes of the two systems. It is not proposed to alter this.The Minister for Social Security has announced an independent review of the pension income and assets tests to report initially in July 1994 with a final report due in September 1994. The objectives of the review require it to examine the relationship between the income and assets tests and the tax system. The terms of reference for the review were tabled in the Senate on 22 November 1993. A copy is attached to this response.</PARA>

<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>Not accepted</PARA>
<PARA>Comments</PARA>
<PARA>Taxation Rulings IT2672 and TR93/17 indicate that expenses incurred by superannuation fund trustees in complying with legislative and regulatory changes are deductible if they are made solely to enable a fund to maintain its complying status.

It would be inequitable to amend the tax law to allow deductions for expenses incurred by trustees where similar expenses incurred by other taxpayers are not deductible.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>7.6  The Committee recommends that the Treasury consider whether there is scope to correct any anomalies that may exist in the application of Capital Gains Tax (CGT) to fund trustees.

<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>Not accepted</PARA>
<PARA>Comments</PARA>
<PARA>Section 290A was amended by Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Act 1993 to overcome some minor technical deficiencies and to ensure that the exemption available to continuously complying fixed approved deposit funds is not jeopardised. Because the exemption available under Section 290A is targeted to a particular group of members of certain ADFs, it is not unexpected that an ADF would need to devote some administrative effort to obtain the exemption. Whether this effort is appropriate in the circumstances of a particular ADF is a matter for that ADF. STRATEGIC REVIEW OF THE PENSION INCOME AND ASSETS TESTS TERMS OF REFERENCE</PARA>

<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>4.1  The Committee appreciates the move by the ISC to include the Chairman of the Joint Superannuation Committee of the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants and the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Australia in its consultations on the supervisory levy.  The Committee recognises that the interests of small fund members will be best served by this initiative. The Committee recommends that section 7(2) of the Superannuation Supervisory Levy Act 1991 be amended accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>Accepted</PARA>
<PARA>Comments</PARA>
<PARA>The Government accepts the Recommendation to amend Section 7(2) of the Act at an appropriate opportunity and undertakes that meanwhile the consultative process will continue.</PARA>
<PARA>The ISC does in practice consult with ASCPA and ICAA through their Joint Superannuation Committee.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>4.2  The Committee is concerned that parties to the consultation process of the supervisory levy have differing expectations as to what that process involves.  The Committee recommends the following:</PARA>
<PARA>that the ISC consult with industry representatives throughout the year rather than after the resource needs of the ISC have been decided with the Department of Finance;</PARA>
<PARA>that the ISC consult with the industry on the way it will spend money rather than just the way it is raised;</PARA>
<PARA>that the ISC provide the industry with budgets which clearly indicate the expenditure priorities for the year in question; and</PARA>
<PARA>that the ISC publish, as part of its annual report, a description of the consultative process it followed in determining the supervisory levy.</PARA>
<PARA>However, the Committee recognises that ultimately the ISC is the industry regulator and, as such, the opinions of the industry should not be binding on it.</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>Accepted</PARA>
<PARA>Comments</PARA>
<PARA>Arrangements have been made for ISC-industry consultations, at appropriate junctures of the financial year, about ISC expenditures and their implications for future setting of the levy.</PARA>
<PARA>Consultations with industry associations are substantive and include estimates and consultations on the way in which levy monies will be spent.</PARA>
<PARA>The ISC does, and will continue, to provide the industry with expenditure estimates.</PARA>
<PARA>The ISC will publish in its 1992-93 and subsequent annual reports a description of the consultative process.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>4.3  The Committee recommends that the costs associated with administering the Reasonable Benefit Limit regime not be recouped through the supervisory levy. This cost should be borne by the Government, as it will be when it is transferred to the Australian Tax Office.</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>Accepted</PARA>
<PARA>Comments</PARA>
<PARA>RBL costs were not included in 1992/93 calculations and will not be included in estimating the levy in future.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>4.4  The Committee recommends that an averaging approach be adopted when setting the supervisory levy. This would prevent any large fluctuations in the levy from year to year and provide certainty in planning both in the ISC and the industry.</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>Accepted</PARA>
<PARA>Comments</PARA>
<PARA>The Government believes that trends in super fund numbers and in ISC supervision costs should be taken into account in setting the levy annually, as they have been in 1992/93.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government also seeks to smooth the levy as much as possible.</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>1991/92 required an unusual increase in revenue from the industry. This was because of a significant increase in supervisory costs, associated with increased responsibilities of the ISC-</PARA>
<PARA>while at the same time the number of funds was contracting.</PARA>
<PARA>Lower than budgeted expenditures as a result of deferred legislation, resulted in a surplus from 1991/92 which, when applied to funding the costs for the 1992/93 income year of super funds, has resulted in the levy remaining unchanged.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government agrees with a smoothing approach but not necessarily the application of a strict arithmetic averaging approach which may work to the disadvantage of funds, especially if supervision costs fall, when for a period levy collections could exceed requirements. The Government believes a 3 to 5 year rolling average may best meet the desire to avoid large fluctuations.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>4.5  The Committee believes that it is not in a position to recommend the precise model which could be used to set future ISC supervisory levies. However, the Committee does have recommendations on the broad parameters which should underlie the levy setting process. In summary these are:</PARA>
<PARA>the current formula based on a flat fee and a variable fee dependent on asset size should be retained;</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>Accepted</PARA>
<PARA>Comments</PARA>
<PARA>The present levy formula can be seen as a flat fee plus a variable fee on funds with assets in excess of $0.5 million.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>the costs of administering the RBL arrangements should not be recouped</PARA>
<PARA>through the supervisory levy;</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>Accepted</PARA>
<PARA>Comments</PARA>
<PARA>Current and future costs of administering RBL arrangements have already been removed from the levy charge.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>the costs associated with the processing of annual returns should be recouped through a flat fee per fund;</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>Not accepted</PARA>
<PARA>Comments</PARA>
<PARA>It is not practical to separate the annual returns processing charge from prudential supervision costs.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>an attempt be made to identify the proportion of corporate overhead costs attributable to other functions which are required for prudential supervision;</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>Accepted</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>As far as possible these costs are identified to facilitate consultations about, and calculations of, the levy.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>and the costs associated with the development of policy and legislation should not be recovered through the supervisory levy.</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>Not accepted</PARA>
<PARA>Comments</PARA>
<PARA>The Government does not agree with the exclusion of certain superannuation supervisory costs from the cost calculations, as development of policy and legislation is an integral part of prudential supervision for the protection of members' interests.</PARA>

<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>5.1  The Committee recommends that cross-subsidisation between different sized funds should be kept to a minimum.</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>Accepted</PARA>
<PARA>Comments</PARA>
<PARA>The Government agrees that cross-subsidisation between different sized funds be kept to a minimum.</PARA>
<PARA>The approach to setting the levy does help to minimise cross subsidisation. Considerable effort is made to achieve this minimisation and, broadly, revenue for the levy on small funds is relatively close to the estimated ISC costs relating to small funds.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>5.2  The Committee recommends that cognisance be had of the likely service categories of funds would receive for the payment of the levy noting, however, that the levy is a tax and not a fee-for-service.</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>Accepted</PARA>
<PARA>Comments</PARA>
<PARA>Cognisance will continue to be made of the service which funds receive for the payment of the levy.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The recommendations apply only to personal superannuation plans which are sold by life insurance companies supervised by the Life Insurance Act 1945. A number of the recommendations have already been addressed in the Government's response to the Trade Practices Commission report on consumer experience with superannuation and life insurance (these are marked with an *).</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>3.1  The Committee recommends that information provided to potential policy holders be presented in a brief and standardised format which will allow consumers to compare different products. (This information would be in addition to the more detailed contractual information.)</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>Accepted*</PARA>
<PARA>Comments</PARA>
<PARA>Legislative amendments to the Life Insurance Act 1945 will set out the broad principles on the timing and content of disclosure to consumers. The amendments will impose a general legal duty on life companies and their directors to provide in a timely, accurate and comprehensible way all the information consumers need to make an informed choice.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee further recommends that the brief and standardised information include:</PARA>
<PARA>a written description of each investment option facing the consumer and an outline of the general policy and strategy of the fund;</PARA>
<PARA>a written description of all fees and charges, (including any initial, ongoing and/or termination fees/charges) and, where these are variable, the minimum and maximum charges:</PARA>

<PARA>Accepted in part*</PARA>
<PARA>Comments</PARA>
<PARA>The Insurance and Superannuation Commission (ISC) will prescribe the structure and content of documentation to be provided at each stage of the policy life cycle (promotional documents, policy information statements and annual statements). It is envisaged that policy information statements will include a disclosure statement in brief and standardised format.</PARA>
<PARA>The level of detail which can be practicably disclosed at the point-of-sale, and whether it is appropriate to exempt any particular distribution methods, companies or intermediaries, from these requirements will be a consideration in the final form of disclosure.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>3.2 The Committee recommends that, in conjunction with investment information, a 'needs analysis' based on the consumer's individual circumstances and preferences should be carried out and retained by both the life office and the consumer as verification of advice to the consumer.</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>Accepted*</PARA>
<PARA>Comments</PARA>
<PARA>Legislative amendments to the Life Insurance Act will subject intermediaries to a `know your client' rule identical to the rule applying to investment advisers under the Corporations Law.</PARA>
<PARA>Intermediaries will be required to prepare a written `needs profile', recommend products appropriate to the client's financial circumstances and clearly describe their relationship with each life company they represent.</PARA>
<PARA>The ISC is developing a compulsory Code of Practice for life companies with the assistance of the Trade Practices Commission (TPC), the Federal Bureau of Consumer Affairs (FBCA), industry and consumer groups. The Code of Practice will prescribe minimum standards for the `needs profile' which must be appropriately documented, explained and provided to the consumer.</PARA>
<PARA>A `compliance committee' of the board of each life company will be required to monitor agent compliance with these rules, and the ISC will undertake random audits of life office compliance mechanisms.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>3.3  The Committee recommends that the ISC encourage the adoption by the industry of standard clauses within promotional material and contract documentation and the adoption of plain English documentation.</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>Accepted*</PARA>
<PARA>Comments</PARA>
<PARA>The ISC will prescribe the structure and content of documentation to be provided at each stage of the policy life cycle (promotional documents, policy information statements and annual statements). The disclosure rules will not prescribe the structure or content of the policy contract between life company and policyholder as this might inhibit product innovation to the detriment of consumers.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>In implementing this policy, appropriate material for consumers from a non-English speaking background should also be developed.</PARA>
<PARA>Comments</PARA>
<PARA>Details of the disclosure requirement will be worked out in consultation with the industry. The extent to which Government intervention is required to meet the needs of consumers from a non-English speaking background will be considered in that context.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>3.4  The Committee recommends that life insurance agents disclose both orally and in writing the amounts of commission, as well as other benefits that accrue to them, as a consequence of the sale of personal and group superannuation products.</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>Accepted*</PARA>
<PARA>Comments</PARA>
<PARA>Commission disclosure is currently required on single premium products. Commission disclosure for other life company products will be required in promotional statements and in Policy Information Statements. Consultation with interested parties will establish the precise form of commission disclosure, the level of detail which can be practicably disclosed at point-of-sale, and whether it is appropriate to exempt any particular distribution methods, companies or intermediaries, from these requirements.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>3.5  The Committee recommends that any new commission disclosure scheme applying to life insurance agents be reviewed by an appropriate Senate Committee within three years.</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>Not accepted</PARA>
<PARA>Comments</PARA>
<PARA>It is noted that three years after the implementation of the above mentioned Code of Practice the ISC, TPC and FBCA will conduct a Government review of the consumer protection measures. A Senate review of the new commission disclosure scheme within three years might therefore prove unnecessary and a decision should be delayed to that time.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>3.6  The Committee recommends that, to distinguish the role of the different types of agents and life brokers, agents should be required to disclose:</PARA>
<PARA>the organisations with which the agent holds agency agreements;</PARA>
<PARA>whether the agent is acting for the life office(s) with which the agent holds agency agreements and the nature of the fiduciary relationship with the life office;</PARA>
<PARA>whether the agent is remunerated in whole or in part by commission on behalf of the life offices for selling the companies' life products;</PARA>

<PARA>See also comments on Recommendations 3.1 and 3.3.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>3.7  The Committee recommends that the Prices Surveillance Authority closely monitor the level of fees, charges and commissions applying to superannuation products and report on its activities in this area in its Annual Report to Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>Not accepted</PARA>
<PARA>Comments</PARA>
<PARA>The Prices Surveillance Authority (PSA) does not have a formal monitoring function under the Prices Surveillance Authority Act 1983. The number of superannuation funds would also present difficulties and the Authority may feel that to adequately monitor prices it would need to monitor a range of other indicators such as company profits and costs.</PARA>
<PARA>Moreover, it would be inappropriate to have the PSA monitoring superannuation charges on an on-going basis so soon after major public inquiries into the industry and proposed major changes to the regulation of the industry. Requirements under the Life Insurance Act for full disclosure of all fees and charges, (including commissions), will put pressure on the industry to ensure competitive pricing. Already some life companies have reduced fees and charges on their products.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>3.8  The Committee recommends that the Insurance Contracts Act be amended such that the term `free look period' is replaced by `cooling off period' and made to apply to all personal superannuation plans.</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>Accepted.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>3.9 The Committee reiterates its recommendation in Safeguarding Super that an external review body be established to adjudicate on superannuation disputes.</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>Accepted*</PARA>
<PARA>Comments</PARA>
<PARA>The Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints)Bill 1993, introduced into Parliament on 27 May 1993, provides for the establishment of a Superannuation Complaints Tribunal to operate from 1 July 1994.</PARA>
<PARA>The Tribunal will be able to deal with any complaint which relates to a decision made by a trustee in relation to a particular individual. The Tribunal will provide mechanisms for the conciliation of complaints and, where the complaint cannot be resolved by conciliation, review the decision of the trustee(s) to which the complaint relates. The Tribunal is not precluded from dealing with complaints arising from personal superannuation products sold by life companies.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee further recommends that Government's proposed dispute resolution tribunal adjudicate on consumer complaints arising out of personal superannuation contracts entered into after 1 July 1992 where these have not been satisfactorily resolved at the company or industry level.</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>Accepted in part*</PARA>
<PARA>Comments</PARA>
<PARA>The Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Bill 1993 does not expressly limit the kinds of complaints the Tribunal can deal with, in terms of the time at which the decision to which the related complaint was made. However, the Bill confers discretionary power on the Tribunal to effectively withdraw a complaint if more than 12 months have elapsed since the trustee has made the decision to which the complaint relates. This will ensure that the Tribunal is able to operate efficiently and effectively in its handling of complaints, without precluding it from handling valid complaints arising from any trustee decision, no matter how old.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>3.10  The Committee recommends that the ISC and key superannuation industry groups representing the interests of consumers and providers, combine to develop and implement a five year superannuation consumer education strategy for implementation in early 1994.</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>Accepted</PARA>
<PARA>Comments</PARA>
<PARA>The ISC together with other key entities is developing a community education strategy about superannuation. It is expected that consumer groups will be consulted in the process as appropriate. This strategy will identify the main aims of an education program and the best methods of achieving those aims. It will undertake certain educational activities to promote community understanding about superannuation and be catalytic in encouraging other superannuation educational activities such as inclusion of instruction about superannuation in high school curricula.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>3.11  The Committee recommends that consumer counselling services be provided by the ISC in each of the capital cities and major regional centres.</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>Not accepted</PARA>
<PARA>Comments</PARA>
<PARA>The ISC provides information and education to consumers on the superannuation and insurance legislation it administers. It would not be appropriate for the ISC as a prudential supervisor of the insurance and superannuation industries to provide counselling on matters that are mainly of a private financial nature. Consumer counselling which requires detailed analysis of a person's financial needs and circumstances, and a knowledge of the financial products suited to those particular needs and circumstances, would most effectively be carried out in the financial services marketplace. The cost of such a counselling service could be high, if offered by a public sector organisation in competition with the private sector. Levies on superannuation funds and life offices, which ultimately fall upon the retirement savings of fund members and policyholders, have already had to be significantly raised to fund ISC supervision.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>3.12  The Committee recommends that the industry establish and maintain an agent registration system, together with a code of conduct to be approved by the ISC.</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>Accepted in part*</PARA>
<PARA>Comments</PARA>
<PARA>Existing legislation imposes obligations on life companies to be responsible for the conduct of their agents. The ISC is developing a Code of Practice for life companies which will, inter alia, address agent regulation. It is envisaged that the Code will impose minimum obligations and standards on each life office with regard to supervising agent selection, training, competence and conduct. A Compliance Committee of each life office will be required to monitor the company's compliance with the rules and the ISC will undertake random audits of life office compliance mechanisms.</PARA>
<PARA>There will be a mechanism to ban agents who have failed to comply with the legislation or the Code from working in the industry.The consultation process will establish detailed requirements for agent regulation to be incorporated in the Code.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>3.13  The Committee recommends that the ISC report annually on developments in the area of agent registration and that in three years an appropriate Senate committee inquire into and report on this matter.</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>Accepted in part*</PARA>
<PARA>Comments</PARA>
<PARA>The ISC will report annually on the operations of the Code of Practice for life companies which will continue to be responsible for agents. Agents will not be registered. However, given that the ISC, TPC and FBCA will be reviewing the implementation of the Code of Practice in three years, a Senate inquiry and report on this matter at that time may be unnecessary.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">General Points</PARA>
<PARA>The Government accepts the Report and the recommendation of the Committee which is related to the Government's retirement income policy.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government is conscious of the need for the early implementation of legislation to increase the prudential control and supervision of superannuation funds.</PARA>
<PARA>The Superannuation Industry Supervisory Bills which the Government introduced into the Parliament on 27 May 1993 give effect to increasing the prudential and consumer protection arrangements for superannuation.</PARA>
<PARA>Recommendation</PARA>
<PARA>The Committee in carrying out a close study of the Queensland Professional Officers Association Superannuation Fund observed the consequences when the principles of trust law are neglected and abused. It remarked on the important role government had in educating both trustees and members as to their respective rights and responsibilities as a means of preventing a Queensland Professional Officers Association Superannuation Fund situation. The Committee recommends the early implementation of legislation to increase the prudential control and supervision of superannuation funds.</PARA>
<PARA>Response</PARA>
<PARA>Accepted</PARA>
<PARA>Comments</PARA>
<PARA>The Government welcomes the Committee's Recommendation that the Superannuation Industry Supervisory legislation be put into effect quickly. That package of legislation gives effect to the prudential and consumer protection arrangements for superannuation announced by the Government on 21 October 1992. The legislative framework includes a comprehensive system of prudential supervision. The legislation is designed to support honest and diligent trustees and give members a greater say in the management of funds. The Insurance and Superannuation Commission (ISC) will be monitoring and auditing compliance.</PARA>
<PARA>The Government has also recognised the importance of education trustees and members about occupational superannuation. This will improve the effectiveness of trustees and their understanding of their responsibilities and so improve the security of retirement savings. Better informed fund members will also contribute to improved fund operation. The Government also recognises a need to increase community understanding of the critical role superannuation plays in retirement income.</PARA>
<PARA>The ISC is working with other government agencies, representatives of the superannuation industry and consumer groups to develop an effective education strategy. A range of education and information initiatives will be developed and implemented to ensure trustees, their professional advisers and members understand superannuation as a retirement income strategy and their obligations and rights.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In speaking to report No. 327, which deals with the response to the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts into the Midford Paramount case and related matters, several important areas need to be drawn to the attention of the Senate. I would like particularly to single out the comments that have been made by the Director of Public Prosecutions in response to the report of the public accounts committee. To say that they are disappointing and that the DPP seems to have learned little, whereas in evidence it said it had learned something, is to put it mildly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee has taken the almost unprecedented course of answering the responses by the DPP so that, on the record, they can be seen as the facile comments that they are. Time permits me to deal with only a selected number of them, but I would like to point out some of the more salient points. The first area I wish to address deals with the failed prosecution which the DPP mounted. To understand the context of this prosecution, it is necessary to set the scene of just what transpired. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Midford Paramount company had been in business making shirts and other garments for 40 years. It was a company owned by the Macdessi family, who came to this country as migrants, established a successful business, were well respected in the community, provided employment for 400 people in Wollongong, enjoyed the confidence of many members of parliament and enjoyed the confidence of the citizenry generally who came to know them. They conducted their business in a highly professional way, they used the services of reputable and known consultants and they were regarded as one of the great success stories in Australia. Their reputation, health and businesses were destroyed by the actions of the Australian Customs Service, involving at least two officers of the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce, and by the failure of the Director of Public Prosecutions to properly prepare the case which finally came to court and was thrown out in no uncertain terms and in a scathing way by the magistrate. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The DPP says that the collapse of the prosecution did not mean that the DPP was at fault. The DPP concluded that the net result of the approach taken by the committee in assessing the evidence before it was that findings of fact made by it must be treated with considerable caution at the very least. The DPP has sought to try to cover up its own ineptitude by attacking the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me go to the statement that the DPP was a fault. The committee comments on the assertion that the DPP says that it was not at fault for preparing a poor case in the following way:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the `committal proceedings foundered at an early stage' it is hard to see why the competence of those running the case would not be called into question.</PARA>
<PARA>This is a perfectly reasonable comment, I would think. The committee goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the committal hearing it become apparent during cross-examination that the two `expert' witnesses for the prosecution were far from expert. If, as asserted at paragraph 28 dot point 3, `copies of all relevant Cabinet documents were in material originally provided to the DPP by ACS&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>the Australian Customs Service&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">and were given to the prosecuting counsel', why were the `expert' witnesses apparently unaware of them, or of their significance?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In short, the Committee concluded in Report 325 that officers of the DPP failed to properly perform their duties and this led to a debacle.</PARA>
<PARA>Further, the DPP said in paragraphs 7 to 12 that the case was a very difficult one and that the committee set unrealistic standards and `failed to recognise it was reviewing the case with the benefit of hindsight'. A very simple answer to that point is the fact that if the case was so complex, why did it choose to run the case under the Crimes Act and not the Customs Act, and why was it then allocated to an inexperienced and relatively junior DPP case officer?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me refer to the evidence given at hearings by one Mrs Hannam, the relatively young and inexperienced officer of the DPP. When I asked Mrs Hannam why the source documents were not part of the evidence, she replied that they were not relevant. Of course, the magistrate held that they were and that was in fact the reason that he threw the case out. Mrs Hannam said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The evidence that we relied on to set out government policy was not through tendering those documents themselves; it was through Dr Fitzpatrick. His evidence gave the history of the schemes and how they were set out. He was who we were relying on. He was our witness.</PARA>
<PARA>I went on to ask her:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">So you simply accepted what Dr Fitzpatrick said as the basis of your case?</PARA>
<PARA>Mrs Hannam replied:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No. I had seen the documents&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>I then said that Dr Fitzpatrick had told me in estimates hearings that he did not see the documents. Another officer of the DPP replied that that was a matter of regret. Regret? This destroyed the lives and reputation and health of Australians who had worked hard and contributed to the economy of this country. It has resulted in the government having to accede to the request of the public accounts committee that compensation be paid. We the taxpayers are accordingly having to fund $25 million in compensation to people whose lives were destroyed by actions of incompetence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet the DPP has the audacity to come back and say, `You can't blame us because we got it wrong'. The point is that, on the DPP's very own admission, if it was such a complex case, why was it not given to a senior person and why was there no checking of the way in which the case was conducted? In the further examination of Mrs Hannam, I said that she knew what was in those documents and she knew that they were never dealt with in evidence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The management of the case in fact resulted in people being prosecuted in a way that would have resulted in permanent injustice.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to raise a further point&mdash;that is, the action the DPP took to prevent the committee from beginning its hearings. </PARA>
<PARA>We were ready to commence our hearings when the DPP asked to see us to tell us that he did not want the hearings to begin because he would be relying on the evidence of two witnesses who would appear before our inquiry and he did not want the credibility of those witnesses to be tested other than in the court case that he was presenting. We, the committee, acquiesced in that request. To my dying day, I will regret having done that, because I do not know whether or not it was in fact that evidence given by those two people that convicted the people who were prosecuted and about whom the DPP was concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The reason that I have a personal concern is that those two witnesses&mdash;Mr Robinson and Mr O'Shannassy&mdash;were found to be highly discredited witnesses. In a way, the committee was placed in a position where its acquiescing in the request of the DPP not to proceed with its hearings let those witnesses be seen in a light other than that in which we found them in our inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The DPP states in paragraphs 14 and 15 that much of the criticism against him was based on the conclusion that the case was flawed. The DPP states that it was not possible to do this because the issues were not tested in law. The committee very properly comments:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee made no findings on matters of law. Plain English definitions and common sense were applied to the interpretations of the Cabinet documents and quota instruments referred to in paragraph 15 and the interpretations sought by the ACS and DPP were not sustainable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">During public hearings the interpretation of the quota instruments was discussed at length. The DPP witnesses were unable to produce authoritative documents, either during or after the hearings, to support their contention that the phrase `sourced from' was equivalent to `manufactured'.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .              . . .             . . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee concludes that the DPP appears to be covering up for its failure to prepare adequately for the case.</PARA>
<PARA>There were further examples of poor preparation and, indeed, misleading evidence and missing evidence. I refer again to Mr O'Shannassy and Mr Robinson, the two officers who went to Malaysia to try to find proof in order to prove the case which they were determined to prosecute. They obtained documentary evidence and statements from people in Malaysia in defiance of a court order of the court of Malaysia. When the pressure was stepped up and an injunction was obtained, those two officers did what could only be described as a moonlight flit: they left their dirty washing behind in the hotel; they did not use their proper airline tickets; there were Telecom records of telephone conversations with Australia; they took stand-by tickets and got out of the jurisdiction, taking the documentation with them. This caused a diplomatic incident. There was grave concern about the continuing effectiveness of the five power defence treaty. The Australian Customs Service tried to bolster a case which was flawed from the beginning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In paragraphs 19 and 20, the DPP accuses the committee of subjecting witnesses `to personal abuse bordering on harassment', that questions often took the form of lengthy diatribes and that the proceedings were sometimes `conducted more as an inquisition than an inquiry'. The DPP adds that this treatment contravenes section 19(1) of the Public Accounts Committee Act which affords witnesses the same protection and privileges as before the High Court. The committee very properly responds:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As the Inquiry progressed, the Committee found itself faced with hostile Government agencies. Massive quantities of evidence were given to the Committee but they were unindexed, often duplicated other evidence and in numerous instances were irrelevant. Witnesses were often evasive, giving evidence which was subsequently found to be incorrect. Occasionally, they altered their story whilst giving evidence. This is commented on in Report 325.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee was faced with the task of examining ACS officers who had lost their notebooks, had a diary page reporting events on a crucial day only affixed to the document by sticky tape, had mislaid notes of crucial conversations, had altered evidence pertaining to the case, and had lost the original of a brief sent to the DPP.</PARA>
<PARA>This is discussed at length in the report of the public accounts committee into the whole sad, sorry, saga of the Midford Paramount affair. </PARA>
<PARA>The committee further responded as follows:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.In the face of continued obfuscation the only way the Committee could extract anything resembling the truth from some witnesses was to engage in close questioning. The Chairman told the Comptroller-General of Customs that the Committee did not resile from this task.</PARA>
<PARA>Here is the most bobby-dazzler statement of the lot! This, I remind the Senate, comes from the Director of Public Prosecutions. It is truly one of the more amazing statements I have ever read. In paragraphs 22 and 23, the DPP accuses the committee of giving undue status to the legal presumption of innocence. The Director of Public Prosecutions says we gave undue influence to the legal presumption of innocence! This is the man charged with ensuring justice. We heard evidence that the DPP was desperate to get a conviction, and yet we gave undue evidence to the presumption of innocence. How can we possibly continue to have confidence in an office which says it has forgotten that the presumption of innocence is prima facie and fundamental to our concept of justice under the criminal law?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We asked very early in this inquiry why the Director of Public Prosecutions chose the Crimes Act and not the Customs Act. It was because the Crimes Act meant that people faced up to 20 years in jail and meant that the DPP could invoke the use of the Proceeds of Crime Act and freeze all the people's goods and bank accounts. The DPP destroyed the business altogether. The significance of the Director of Public Prosecutions's downgrading of the presumption of innocence should not be lost, or left as a statement with which anyone in this parliament could live. The committee's answer to the Director of Public Prosecutions's accusations is this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.The major flaw in the conduct of the investigation by the ACS was that it presumed Midford was guilty, and that all it had to do was find the right evidence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.It should be noted that the Committee received huge volumes of conflicting evidence, and made no assumptions that the ACS, DITAC DPP, Midford or anyone else's material was entirely accurate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">.In fact, the comment in paragraph 23 displays an ignorance of the parliamentary committee inquiry process . . .</PARA>
<PARA>There is one other matter that is equally of grave concern, and it concerned us at the time of the hearing. The DPP complained that, in its words, we placed considerable weight on self-serving affidavits filed in Malaysian proceedings and that we made positive findings on the basis of those affidavits. There was a continuing undercurrent, which I and others found totally unacceptable, that somehow evidence of Australian customs officers was preferable and better than evidence given by Malaysian people. The fact of the matter is that those affidavits were sworn in the way that affidavits by Australians were sworn. The innuendo that somehow, because they were Malaysians, one would place less reliance on their evidence than on Australian evidence is totally and utterly unacceptable. Those affidavits were given due weight, but we relied on extraneous evidence to those affidavits to come finally to the conclusions that we reached. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The whole story of the Midford Paramount saga is one that has to set a standard that says that individual Australians must not be subjected to the brute force of bureaucracy and the open-ended purse of the public sector. It says that this parliament will provide justice for individual Australians who are persecuted in the manner in which these people were. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This matter began in the estimates committees where I began asking questions. It then came into this chamber where, with the concurrence of the Australian Democrats, the matter was referred to the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. Two years of inquiry passed and a mammoth report was produced. It then took the government 11 months to compensate those people, because we saw the bureaucracy attempt to retry the issues. It was only after I and other senators brought pressure to bear that we finally saw the interdepartmental committee make a report and the announcement of the $25 million compensation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Look at the personal lives of those who were affected. A director of the company of Midford Paramount was hospitalised. One adviser is a former shadow of his physical self. Another has lost his business and is being sustained only by his church. One former senior person in the company has died. The compensation can never restore what these people had, but it does recognise that justice can be brought about by actions within this parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The matter began in an adversarial way. The minister, former Senator Button, fought off an attempt to have this matter fully inquired into. But when we finally came to the business of the inquiry, a bipartisan effort transcended party political differences and we worked together to find the truth and vindication for people who had been oppressed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second thing that we all wanted, again in a bipartisan way, was a fundamental change in attitude on the part of the bureaucracy which perpetrated this horrendous case upon a group of Australians. There has been a total change in the culture of the Australian Customs Service. It does not continue with the attitude that it has got it right and that everybody else is wrong. I can only say of the DPP that when Mr Coghlan said in evidence that they had learned something from the failure of their prosecution, the rest of the DPP's operatives learned the same things. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I never again want to see or hear from the person charged with prosecuting ordinary Australians that there is undue influence put upon the presumption of innocence. That is the essence of our criminal system. We must all stand fast in this parliament and say that those in whom we put the confidence of upholding the law and seeking justice&mdash;and, indeed, punishment for those who breach it&mdash;must pay attention to the principles that bind us, of which the presumption of innocence remains fundamental. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Inquiry into the Midford Paramount Case and Related Matters investigated the failed prosecution of a Wollongong-based shirt manufacturer, Midford Paramount and revealed significant failings in Commonwealth administration. This of necessity resulted in a report to the Parliament which was critical of both the Australian Customs Service and to a lesser extent the DPP. While the Committee may have anticipated that these agencies would not agree with all of its recommendations, it did not at any time foresee the gratuitous comments that would be offered by the DPP in the Finance Minute.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The DPP's comments, if read in isolation, would present a reader with a false view of the Committee's Inquiry and Report 325. Therefore to ensure that the Parliament and other interested parties are presented with a balanced view, the Committee has prepared this report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The DPP's criticisms appear to be based on selective quoting, a failure to read the entire Report, and contain simple errors of comprehension and demonstrate a lack of understanding of basic fundamentals such as public accountability, the role and functions of parliamentary committees, and the presumption of innocence.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has put in place a review to examine the external funding targets for Government research agencies including CSIRO, ANSTO (the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation) and AIMS (the Australian Institute of Marine Science).

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Agreed in principle</EMPHASIS>  The Government provides funds to agencies in the budgetary process sufficient to realise the objectives set. Funding is based on the explicit objectives of programs, and it is the responsibility of management to ensure that the full cost of their various programs and activities are assessed and provided for within the allocated funds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government is aware, however, that costs of imported scientific equipment have risen substantially in the face of the falling dollar, and is encouraging agencies to seek other forms of income.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Not agreed </EMPHASIS> The salaries of academics and science teachers are set through the normal industrial relations processes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Salaries for teachers are a State responsibility. There has been considerable effort in recent years to implement pay structures for teachers based on national benchmarks which treat teachers as a single professional group. Implementation of new structures involving improved career paths and substantial pay increases began in 1991 with Tasmania the only State yet to implement the new structure (a decision by the Tasmanian Industrial Commission to adopt the new structure is being appealed by the State Government).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recent changes to the wages system increase the flexibility for agencies to reward staff within the limits of their overall budgetary resources. In its October 1991 National Wage Case decision, the AIRC adopted the Enterprise Bargaining Principle to enable wage increases based on productivity increases at the enterprise level. In July 1992 the Government amended the Industrial Relations Act to encourage the use of certified agreements as a vehicle for workplace bargaining.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On 4 December 1992 an agreement between the Government and public  service unions entitled Improving Productivity, Jobs and Pay in the Australian Public Service 1992-94  was certified by the AIRC.

The CSIRO also has the power to pay bonuses to persons or teams in respect of discoveries or inventions made by them. Academics often have rights to engage in consultancy up to a certain percentage of salary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In addition, other rewards such as undertaking work of public value and the intrinsic interest of the work have always been factors in public sector pay fixation.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Agreed in part</EMPHASIS>  The Government regularly monitors needs and has decided that, from 1994, capital funds for higher education institutions will be provided as part of their operating grants.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">11.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Already in place</EMPHASIS>  The Government does this. The funding provided per EFTSU to institutions takes into account the different funding needs of the various disciplines and covers the full teaching costs including infrastructure.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">22. Research agencies be provided with sufficient resources to enable them to carry out these functions. (paragraph 7.39)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">25. Sufficient appropriation funding be provided to government departments and agencies to enable them to meet the cost of  contracting good quality research. (paragraph 7.47)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Agreed in principle </EMPHASIS> Expanding the performance of research and development by the private sector is one of the major goals of Government policy for science and technology. This goal is being pursued in a variety of ways, including the strengthening of linkages between public sector research organisations and the users of research. This requires that research agencies understand the capabilities of the private sector and strive to ensure that companies are involved in research programs to the fullest extent possible. The Government sees `contracting out' as a useful means of developing researcher-user interaction and as a valuable mechanism to facilitate commercialisation and technology transfer.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The current practice in the research agencies is that consultants are recruited on the basis of their capacity to add value in a cost-effective way. In much research, environmental research for example, the quality and credibility of the work done in the agencies cannot be matched in the private sector.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">28. Other Commonwealth research agencies evaluate the appropriateness of the attractiveness/feasibility model for use in the internal assessment of priorities for the expenditure of untied research funds. (paragraph 7.61)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Agreed in part  </EMPHASIS>The importance of ensuring that Australia's substantial investment in research and development produces appropriate benefits for the nation has meant that considerable attention has been given to priority setting in the Government's policies for science and technology.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The 1992 White Paper Developing Australian Ideas articulates the Government's role of identifying overall national goals  and the responsibilities of individual agencies for establishing their own priorities within that overall framework.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's strategy is to allocate decision making to the appropriate level, so that decisions can be taken by informed people and in the context of factors such as industry or other end-user interest and support, or an understanding of social or economic needs. This strategy has been developed and strengthened over recent years and most, if not all, Departments and agencies now have priority-setting procedures closely matched to the characteristics and strategic plans of the industry or area of social or economic activity for which they are responsible. The White Paper required the Coordination Committee on Science and Technology (CCST) to report on these procedures and address their adequacy and the Committee is now undertaking this task.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As noted in the White Paper, the Government considers that one of the most effective and direct mechanisms of priority setting is to have users pay directly for the research they intend to use. This has been implemented through the setting of earnings targets for some research agencies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The need to prioritise proposals for national research facilities is accepted. As noted in the White Paper, the CCST will keep a watching brief on the development of specific proposals for national research facilities, particularly those that cross departmental boundaries. As far as possible, the Government intends to ensure that Australian industry will be involved in major facilities, both in Australian content and as a user of the operating facility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Some other Commonwealth research organisations have taken the CSIRO attractiveness/feasibility model for use in the internal assessment of priorities for the expenditure of untied research funds. However, research agencies may choose to develop other forms of priority-setting mechanisms, and are best positioned to determine their own priorities based on interactions with relevant users of their research.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A number of research agencies, including DSTO and agencies within the Primary Industries and Energy and the Health portfolios have already considered the suitability of the CSIRO model for priority setting. They have found that, while the model contains features such as consideration of cost-benefit, economic returns, attractiveness, potential benefit, feasibility and commercialisation potential, their own rigorous priority setting mechanisms better match their particular needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">54. In conjunction with other research institutions, the universities, the private sector and the Cooperative Research Centres, CSIRO develop a 10-year master plan to identify high priority strategic research which is essential to the national interest. (paragraph 11.46)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Not agreed</EMPHASIS>  The Government has implemented policies and programs to encourage business and the research sector to take a longer term view when determining their research priorities. CSIRO already has a well established intensive planning process which involves external consultations and includes the preparation of five-year strategic plans, which are published. It is the Government's role to identify overall national goals and objectives. The Coordination Committee on Science and technology was tasked with examining national priorities for research in the 1992 White Paper on Science and Technology (see response to Recommendation 28 above).</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Not agreed</EMPHASIS>  The Government recognises the need to advance the knowledge base of the nation and its long-term economic welfare through applied, strategic and basic research. By such decisions as determining the level of appropriation for research agencies and providing funding for higher education research, it seeks to ensure an appropriate level of public sector research for these purposes. The Government does not accept that there is an appropriate definable ratio between private and public sector R&amp;D, and also notes that R&amp;D balance differs on a sector by sector basis. The international experience is that levels of private sector R&amp;D have generally increased  at a faster rate than public sector R&amp;D. The level of private sector R&amp;D in Australia is still low by international standards and the Government has a range of measures in place to encourage its increase.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Agreed in principle</EMPHASIS>  The term `commercialisation' has a number of different meanings depending on the context in which it is used. Two common uses are:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commercialisation as the appropriation of some of the value of the research results  by licensing or sale of patent rights, or trading for equity, as in the case of Gene Shears Pty Ltd; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Commercialisation in the wider industrial sense  describes the processes involved in getting a new or improved product or process  to the market, and generating economic benefits from the process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More important is the clarification of the intended meaning in context where it is used&mdash;in legislation, guidelines, statistical surveys and other Government documents. As far as possible use of the term (in statistical collections particularly) should be in accordance with standard international definitions, but such definitions have yet to be adopted.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A definition for commercialisation may be developed as part of the continuing work of international experts in OECD countries to implement standard guidelines for collecting technological innovation data. Research results are considered to be `commercialised' when they diffuse into (Australian) industry and new products are manufactured or new processes employed. It may be more appropriate for agencies such as the CSIRO and DSTO to use a broader definition for commercialisation than that chosen by the Committee, to include advice provided by agency consultants and research under contract to external organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If a common definition of commercialisation is needed for national and international R&amp;D reporting purposes, this could be  a sub-set of a broader definition better suited to research agency needs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government intends to continue to encourage innovation and competitiveness on all fronts. To encourage commercialisation, the Government has focused on stimulating market demand. The different technologies, companies and industries interact in different ways and no universal optimum strategy for commercialisation exists. Government officials, researchers and companies are being encouraged to understand the process of innovation and the peculiarities of the particular companies and technologies involved. The Government has established the Australian Technology Group Pty Ltd (ATG), Pooled Development Funds, and changed the "prudent man" rule to catalyse private sector finance for research and technology.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The CSIRO corporate planning process assesses the ability of Australia to capture the benefits of research as commercial or other gains, aims to maximise involvement with the business community in Australia and internationally in identifying long-term strategic options, and to increase the investment by Australia's local and multinational companies in innovation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a new position at CSIRO Head Office of Director of Corporate Business, responsible with other Directors for linking research planning to long-term industrial development and for designing and negotiating larger commercial contracts for CSIRO. CSIRO's preferred commercialisation approach is for industrial partners to become involved as early as possible in research projects, perhaps even before specific research has begun. Examples of major collaborative research agreements are those made with Boeing, BHP, CRA, Queensland Metals Corporation involving MIM and Ube of Japan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AIMS's Act was amended in 1992 to enable it to pursue commercialisation objectives. A draft Business Plan and commercial capability statement has been prepared and AIMS is going ahead with proposals and is receiving some attention from industry. A recent scientific collaboration with scientists at the University of Rhode Island has resulted in a marketing and distribution arrangement for Australia and SE Asia for simulation software for the trajectory and fate of oil spills.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DSTO has identified commercialisation as an objective in its Corporate Planning Statement 1992-96. This objective is fulfilled by DSTO undertaking, on a commercial basis, the provision of consulting services, contract R&amp;D, training, the hire of unique facilities, and the medium to long-term exploitation of DSTO's intellectual property through licensing of technologies to industry, collaborative research and development, and joint venture arrangements. Currently DSTO holds  numerous patents, has arranged  many manufacturing licences with industry and is involved in three incorporated joint ventures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Primary Industries and Energy R&amp;D Corporations were established with the view to encourage increased funding towards the commercialisation end of the R&amp;D spectrum, where this is shown to be a productive means of providing returns to their levy payers. The Corporations are able to borrow money, form corporations, enter into agreements and participate in joint ventures, take out patents, generate income from royalties and licences for successful R&amp;D, and determine their own internal structures and processes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A key objective of the Cooperative Research Centres Program is to capture the benefits of research and to strengthen the links between research and its commercialisation by the active involvement of research users in the work of the Centres. It is expected that all Centres with industrial applications will have strong participation by appropriate business enterprises. It is mandatory for all Centres to put in place firm strategies to manage the intellectual property they produce and to commercialise the results of their research to the benefit of Australia. The proportion of the forward commitment by CRC partners provided by industry has increased from 17% to 28% as the Program has developed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">45. Research organisations involved in commercialising their research:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">consider the optimum profile of skill sets required in carrying the results of research from the laboratory to the market place; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">recruit and retain such skill sets. (paragraph 10.31)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Agreed in part</EMPHASIS>  The Government does not consider that the research agencies should necessarily commercialise research themselves. Rather, they should have the skills needed to tap into and/or initiate the commercialisation process which includes excellent links with companies and other users who have the necessary skills. Agencies should have access to such skills and a good understanding of the commercialisation process, but not necessarily `own' the skills. ATG, ATICCA companies, or private sector companies may provide these skills.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Departments and the research agencies regularly review their systems and practices. The Government notes that different technologies, companies and industries interact in different ways and that no universal optimal strategy for commercialisation exists. Government officials, researchers and companies are being encouraged to understand the process of innovation and the intricacies of the particular companies and technologies involved. A case in point is the CSIRO which is already training staff in-house on the processes of commercialisation of science and technology.</PARA>

Major examples at CSIRO include the recent Memoranda of Understanding with BHP, Boeing and the Sydney Water Board. The 30% external funding requirement is also aimed at this.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Cooperative Research Centres Program has as one of its four major objectives "to capture the benefits of research, and to strengthen the links between research and its commercial and other applications, by the active involvement of the users of the research (industry) in the work of the Centres".</PARA>

This is addition to the statutory financial reports the ATG is required to provide under corporations law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With regard to utilising the expertise of the IR&amp;D Board, the ATG Board and management have been establishing links with interested expert groups and various Australian sources of technology. In developing its business strategy it will be open to the ATG Board to decide on a commercial basis the extent to which it accesses the client base of the IR&amp;D Board to grant recipients or utilises external experts, such as members of the IR&amp;D Board, to evaluate research and technology for commercialisation.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">53. The funding period for decision making be extended beyond the present three-year funding mechanism. (paragraph 11.46)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Under review</EMPHASIS>  The Forward Estimates process adds to the certainty of planning for all agencies by providing a four year timeframe&mdash;Budget plus three outyears. This funding, while not guaranteed, nevertheless gives a reasonable indication of likely allocations over that period in respect of current policy. The triennium arrangement for the science agencies provides additional security.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has agreed to defer consideration of triennium funding for the science agencies, pending decisions on nuclear science and technology arrangements and marine science research. The Government anticipates making a decision on triennium funding not later than the end of 1993.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">57. CSIRO assess the need to rationalise its location at 108 sites and 150 laboratories in terms of the economical, efficient and effective utilisation of its resources (paragraph 11.65)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Agreed</EMPHASIS>  CSIRO is acting in accord with this recommendation. Following an extensive workshop in July 1992 in which it reviewed the progress of CSIRO, the CSIRO Board suggested that the Organisation should continue to be active in "seeking opportunities both to reduce costs and to improve flexibility, such as through further site rationalisations (not necessarily centralisation) and from streamlining provision of site services". CSIRO is strongly committed to further developing its major sites in Canberra, at Clayton and North Ryde and to rationalise elsewhere to the extent that is compatible with research and collaboration needs. In doing so, it has to respond to very strong pressures upon it to open new sites, a recent example being the recommendation by the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Public Works to locate the CSIRO Division of Food Processing at Wagga Wagga.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">58. CSIRO develop a longer term capital replacement program in the light of the assessment (paragraph 11.65)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Agreed</EMPHASIS>  CSIRO is committed to maintaining its capital infrastructure, has developed a long term capital replacement program and is acting to link this more closely with forecasts of the demands of its evolving research priorities.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Agreed</EMPHASIS>  Revised procedures will be implemented in the 1993-94 financial year. The essential features of the revised process are:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the provision, on an annual basis, of a Defence Science and Technology Strategy, providing essential top down guidance to DSTO for long-term planning of its research program;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the introduction of a Client Program structure (for planning, reporting, reviewing and evaluating the program) with four Defence client segments, and a fifth commercial segment; and</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">62. Adequate capital funding be provided for the accommodation and equipment needs of the Defence Science and Technology Organisation (paragraph 12.28)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Agreed in principle</EMPHASIS>  DSTO's operating efficiency is being hampered by existing facilities and equipment needs. DSTO Salisbury has developed costed options to consolidate its activities into new, refurbished and recently built accommodation on part of its present site. Such consolidation would achieve a very substantial reduction in site operating costs and would also provide gains in research output.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, funding must be considered in the light of overall Defence priorities and Government expenditure priorities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">63. The Defence Science and Technology Organisation establish a mechanism whereby it can effectively establish its funding needs and attach priorities to these needs  (paragraph 12.33)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">64. The Department of Defence monitor the adequacy of the funds allocated to the Defence Science and Technology Organisation in relation to its capacity to maintain its technological base and provide additional funds when they are needed (paragraph 12.33)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Agreed in principle</EMPHASIS>  Implementation of these recommendations is closely allied to the current restructuring of DSTO's planning procedures mentioned above. See responses to Recommendations 61 and 62 above.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">65. The level of funding provided for the commercialisation of the Defence Science and Technology Organisation's research be monitored (paragraph 12.46)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Agreed</EMPHASIS>  However, the JCPA report identifies only two strands to DSTO's approach to commercialisation&mdash;transfer of technology to the private sector so that Australian firms can supply goods required by the Defence Forces, and making DSTO research available for the commercial production of non-defence related products. This is too narrow a view. A significant amount of the interest shown by commercial enterprises in DSTO research is in research which has the potential to result in products for world defence and commercial markets. To a large degree this is the factor which can make manufacture in Australia cost-effective, by providing for manufacturing sustainability and economies of scale. Overseas sales are often critical to the success of commercialisation as local volumes are too small.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With regard to technology transfer from DSTO, the mechanisms referred to (Defence funded contracts for the early stages of R&amp;D, and support or adaptation of locally manufactured equipment throughout its life cycle) are only two of many successful mechanisms used by DSTO. Other mechanisms are: staff training and programs, industry contracted R&amp;D expertise, facilitation of outside development of DSTO technologies through Technical Support Service contracts, the Defence Industry Development program, direct provision of technical data, licensing, joint venture development and scientific presentations. DSTO is trialing an Industry Support Office to increase industry awareness of commercialisation opportunities arising from DSTO research and development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DSTO's commercial activities are not concerned solely with "commercialising" existing inventions, but with exploiting its overall R&amp;D capability for the national benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The JCPA noted that the 1% limit reflected the level of effort Defence is prepared to divert to supporting the commercial exploitation of DSTO's R&amp;D capability. However, as a result of the November 1992 review of industry policy conducted for the Parliamentary Secretary, the 1% limit on net diversion of appropriated resources to commercial activity will be removed, and DSTO will increase its formation and use of strategic alliances with Australian industry. These changes are supported by the findings of the Australian National Audit Office's review of DSTO's commercial activity. It is intended that DSTO will manage these changes without detriment to its ability to meet Defence R&amp;D requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a result of their commercial activities, Business Development Units have developed considerable expertise in managing and protecting intellectual property, which is of significant value to DSTO's mainstream activities for the Department.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">66. This funding be adjusted, in the light of cost-benefit analyses, to maximise the income from the Defence Science and  Technology Organisation's commercial activities (paragraph 12.46)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Not agreed</EMPHASIS>  The Government does not accept this recommendation. Maximising the income from DSTO's commercial activities may not provide the best results in terms of national benefit. National benefit, rather than income maximisation, should be the key criterion in determining priorities for commercial activity. The programs must respond to strategic and national goals. For example, maximum income from a licence might be achieved by selling it to a foreign company, but the national interest might be better achieved by selling at a lower price to an Australian company, thus providing employment, export income and industry infrastructure growth.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">67. The Department of Defence, the Department of Finance and any other organisations, that are identified as delaying the commercialisation of the Defence Science and Technology Organisation's research, review their procedures with a view to streamlining them (paragraph 12.50)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Agreed</EMPHASIS>  The Government accepts this recommendation. However, it notes that the current arrangements for the commercialisation of DSTO research are conducted within existing guidelines and legislative requirements. Specifically, the Government, in determining its response to the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration on Government Companies and their Reporting Requirements (1989), decided that the Minister for Finance and the Attorney-General be consulted in advance on any proposals to establish or vary a direct Commonwealth interest in a company. Nonetheless, Finance is willing to review any proposal to streamline administrative procedures that may assist in the satisfactory resolution of DSTO commercialisation proposals</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">68. An independent review be carried out of the adequacy of the funds available to employ individuals with the best available skills for negotiating, establishing and managing the commercialisation arrangements of the Defence Science and Technology Organisation (paragraph 12.54)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Not agreed </EMPHASIS> This recommendation is not accepted as the situation has to be balanced against DSTO's prime customer requirements. It is not clear that an independent review (assuming this means external to Defence) would be able to comprehend all the issues. With regard to employing individuals "with the best available skills", DSTO recognises the importance of this but believes that such skills are best obtained externally by contracts or consultancies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">DSTO routinely assesses the industrial capability of its innovations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">69. The Defence Science and Technology Organisation identify those areas where its expertise coincides with Australian industrial capability and defence requirements, and concentrate on these areas by:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">72. Increased funding be provided to the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation to enable it to upgrade its facilities and purchase new equipment, particularly a new reactor. (paragraph 13.27)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Under review</EMPHASIS>  In 1992, the Government established the Research Reactor Review to examine and report on the need for a new research reactor. The Review has produced its first report and has recommended that no decision need be taken on a new reactor for at least five years. The Government is considering this and the other recommendations of the Review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">73. The nuclear reactors and associated plant belonging to the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation be reviewed regularly by an appropriate, independent, overseas organisation. (paragraph 13.36)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Not agreed</EMPHASIS>  The safety of ANSTO's nuclear plant is monitored and reviewed continually and closely by the Nuclear Safety Bureau (NSB), whose operations are monitored by the Safety Review Committee, which has found that the NSB carries out its responsibilities thoroughly and professionally. The recent amendments to the ANSTO Act have provided increased independence  from the NSB. ANSTO commissioned a review of its Nuclear Technology Program in 1990 by Atomic Energy of Canada Limited. This review considered operational procedures and objectives of the program, and was not focused on nuclear safety. The review recommended many improvements in practices and procedures, which have been acted on by ANSTO.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">74. The Government ensure that sufficient resources are provided for R&amp;D on radioactive waste management and its commercialisation. (paragraph 13.44)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Already done</EMPHASIS>  The Commonwealth Government has spent over $25 million on the development of Synroc by ANSTO. Synroc is a highly stable wasteform for the immobilisation of high level radioactive wastes produced by the nuclear fuel cycle overseas. Further development of the technology now requires a country generating high level radioactive wastes to adopt Synroc as its preferred technology for high level radioactive waste disposal on a commercial basis. ANSTO would then be well placed as Australia's expert on Synroc technology to contribute to the international application of Synroc.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">75. The Commonwealth take urgent action to select a site for and construct a safe and secure nuclear waste repository. (paragraph 13.48)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Agreed</EMPHASIS>  ANSTO is playing a significant role in assisting the Department of Primary Industries and Energy to identify the most appropriate site for a national repository for low level radioactive waste and is expected to be involved in a safety assessment of a prospective site. The technology for the disposal of Australia's low level radioactive wastes at a national radioactive waste repository has been developed and ANSTO operates facilities for the conditioning of radioactive waste prior to its transport to, and disposal in, a national radioactive waste repository.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In paragraph 13.45 of the report the Committee states that the "potential threat to the community from having radioactive waste stored in built up areas needs to be urgently addressed and prompt action taken". While some current temporary storage in urban areas is not ideal, the wastes remain under control of Commonwealth or State Government authorities and do not present an appreciable hazard to local communities. The only way of dealing effectively with these concerns is by removal of wastes for disposal at a national repository located well away from major population centres.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Safety Review Committee (SRC) has recommended each year that action be taken as a matter of priority to identify a site for, and construct, a national radioactive waste management repository. The SRC reviewed ANSTO's waste management practices in detail (1991) and found that they are sound, and safe for members of the public. Nonetheless, there is still considerable public concern. The National Resource Information Centre (NRIC) is assisting in the process of identifying a suitable site for a  national low-level radioactive waste repository.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">76. The Government coordinate arrangements with State and Territory Governments for improved annual reporting of radioactive waste holdings to a central authority. (paragraph 13.53)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Existing arrangements are adequate</EMPHASIS>  State and Territory Governments already provide details of the radioactive waste holdings on a voluntary basis to the Department of Primary Industries and Energy which has portfolio responsibility within the Commonwealth Government for radioactive waste management. This information is given to assist the Commonwealth in its coordinating role to establish a national radioactive waste repository by providing information on the likely capacity requirements for the repository. The Commonwealth will provide approximately 90% of the radioactive waste for the repository, and Commonwealth waste holdings are well documented. Existing reporting arrangements for State/Territory holdings are considered adequate. However this is a matter that could be considered by the Nuclear Regulation and Monitoring Inter-Departmental Committee in its report to Government.</PARA>

Bearing in mind the recommendation of the McKinnon Review that an Australian Maritime Industries and Sciences Council be established, the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce consider whether new mechanisms are required to provide advice on funding and research priorities (para 14.25)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Under review</EMPHASIS>  In the Government's response to the McKinnon Review it decided not to proceed with the formation of the Australian Marine Industries and Science Council (AMSIC) but rather to make more effective use of existing mechanisms. As such, the Heads of Marine Agencies group (HOMA) was asked by Government to provide appropriate advice to ensure that important areas of marine R&amp;D of national benefits and/or commercial opportunity are funded, directly or in liaison with NBEET, ARC, FIRDC, the IR&amp;D Board, ERDC, CSIRO or other appropriate bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the request of the Coordination Committee on Science and Technology (CCST), HOMA has undertaken a major review of the state of publicly funded marine research in Australia. The study examined current funding levels and the extent and effectiveness of existing coordination mechanisms. The study was presented to the CCST in July 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Since the report was prepared the Government has considered a proposal by the Minister for Science and Small Business to establish a new National Institute for Marine Science, to be formed by the amalgamation of the Australian Institute of Marine Science and the CSIRO Divisions of Fisheries and Oceanography.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Already in place</EMPHASIS>  A number of mechanisms for marketing Australian expertise in marine sciences and technology are already in place. In 1989 the Australian Marine Science and Technology Project Office was established with the aim of marketing the expertise of the Commonwealth marine research agencies to these areas. The Government allocated $250,000 seed money in the 1989 Science and Technology Statement and INTROMARC (International Tropical Marine Resources Centre) based in Townsville, was established in 1991 with the role of promoting the use of Australian expertise in tropical marine ecosystems and in training in this area.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Already in place</EMPHASIS>  Where opportunities arise, levies or fees are regarded as options to raise funds for management, of which research may be an aspect. For example, the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service collects park use fees for all of its mainland national parks ie Kakadu, Uluru and Jervis Bay. Under a formula determined by the Department of Finance, funds collected are used for a variety of park management related activities or returned to consolidated revenue. Further, in June 1992 the Government announced that tourist operators using the Great Barrier Reef are required to pay a fee from 1 July 1993 as a contribution to management of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. A major proportion of this levy will be directed to funding relevant environmental research within the Cooperative Research Centre for Ecologically Sustainable Development of the Great Barrier Reef.</PARA>

The Terms of Reference of this review took into account the June 1992 JCPA Report and sought advice on the most appropriate funding arrangements for the AGSO. The review team has consulted widely, and reported to the Government in May 1993. Funding issues raised in the report were addressed in the Budget context with the allocation of funding for the construction of a new building complex for AGSO; maintenance of AGSO within the Primary Industries and Energy portfolio with amended administrative arrangements; additional funding for core projects and application of a 30% external earnings target of AGSO's 1994-95 Budget appropriation to be achieved in 1995-96.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The dividend imputation provisions support the policy of Commonwealth support for R&amp;D. As the JCPA noted (paragraph 3.19), the dividend imputation provisions ensure that the greatest benefit of the tax concession is to those companies who boost working capital. This is clearly indirect support of commercialisation and marketing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The other issues raised in the recommendation are being analysed by the BIE and are being considered by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3. Section 73B of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 should be amended to give the Industry Research and Development Board the power to determine the eligibility of plant and equipment purchased for research and development purposes, subject to the concession for eligibility being retained only for plant and equipment which is used solely for research and development purposes. (paragraph 3.35)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Not agreed</EMPHASIS>  Administration of the Income Tax Assessment Act is the responsibility of the Commissioner of Taxation. Plant expenditure that qualifies for the R&amp;D concession is expenditure on plant that is used exclusively for R&amp;D activities (subsection 73B(1) ITA Act). What constitutes such activities is a matter for the IR&amp;D Board (section 39K IR&amp;D Act) on which the Board's certificate binds the Commissioner of Taxation (section 73B(34) ITA Act). In practice, the Australian Taxation Office would seek expert advice from the IR&amp;D Board where there was any doubt about the purpose of the plant and equipment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Expenditure incurred in acquiring or constructing plant that is to be used exclusively for the purpose of carrying on R&amp;D activities qualifies for the R&amp;D concession and can be written off over three years of income. The concession applies in the first year of income in which the plant is used exclusively for R&amp;D purposes and in the two succeeding years of income (subsection 73B (15) ITA).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The concession is not available for plant that is acquired or constructed with the intention of using the plant for the concurrent dual purposes of producing assessable income and conducting R&amp;D. In these cases the plant will qualify for depreciation deductions in the normal way (section 54).</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If after the first or second year of income in which plant has been used exclusively for R&amp;D purposes, the plant is no longer used exclusively for that purpose, the R&amp;D concession is no longer available. However, the proportion of the cost of the plant that has not been claimed (two thirds or one third as the case may be) may be depreciable (subsection  73B(21)). In such a case none of the concession allowed for the years in which the plant is used exclusively for R&amp;D purposes is clawed back.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4. The enabling legislation be amended to remove any doubt that the concession applies to research and development which is mainly undertaken in Australia, as currently interpreted by the Australian Taxation Office. (paragraph 3.35)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Agreed</EMPHASIS>  The definition of R&amp;D activities for the purpose of section 73B refers to activities that are carried on in Australia or in an external Territory. However, in Taxation Ruling 2442, the Commissioner of Taxation has ruled that, where some ancillary or incidental part of a project that is being carried on in Australia has to be undertaken overseas, expenditure on the overseas activities qualifies as R&amp;D expenditure. For instance, it may be that testing facilities of a particular kind are not available in Australia or that R&amp;D staff go overseas for training, to observe techniques or to attend relevant seminars. In both examples, where the activities undertaken overseas are directly related to the company's R&amp;D activities carried on in Australia, the cost of those activities will be accepted as part of R&amp;D expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the Government will make the necessary legislative amendments to remove any uncertainties in this regard.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">5. The Australian Taxation Office and Industry Research and Development Board continue to work in close consultation on matters of legislative interpretation, particularly as it relates to the commercialisation of research and development and the determination of whether the research and development is undertaken by companies on their own behalf.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">6. The Industry Research and Development Board, in consultation with the Australian Taxation office, continue to monitor the operation of the syndication and collaborative research elements of the tax concession to ensure that every opportunity is provided for joint research efforts that will bring net benefits to Australia.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Agreed</EMPHASIS> The recommendation is consistent with Government policy, which is to achieve an appropriate balance between encouraging joint research efforts and discouraging artificial tax minimisation schemes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">7. The Industry Research and Development Board and Australian Taxation Office continue to discourage use of the tax concession legislation for artificial tax minimisation schemes which do not result in a net benefit to the nation. (paragraph 3.39)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Already established process</EMPHASIS>  In the 1992-93 Budget, the Government announced legislation to limit eligibility for the R&amp;D tax concession in the case of syndicates, and other structured financing arrangements, involving tax exempt researchers where the investors' funds were not fully at risk. The IR&amp;D Board was also given discretionary powers to declare particular finance schemes to be ineligible for the R&amp;D concession. The IR&amp;D Board will develop and publish the guidelines used to assess whether or not an ineligible finance scheme exists in relation to particular research and development activities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">8. Market analysis and development of market entry strategies be allowed as eligible supporting activities under the tax concession legislation, up to a limit of 10% of total eligible research and development expenditure in the relevant project. (paragraph 3.41)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Not agreed</EMPHASIS>  This recommendation has been previously considered and rejected by the Government, most recently in the 1992-93 Budget context.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">9. The Industry Research and Development Board, in consultation with the Australian Taxation Office, examine the potential for distortion of investment and commercialisation decisions created by subsection 73B(27A), in conjunction with other parts of the Income Tax Assessment Act. (paragraph 3.44)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Not agreed</EMPHASIS>  Subsection 73B(27A) reflects intentional Government policy: if a taxpayer receives a deduction for R&amp;D expenditure then any receipt which results from that expenditure should be included in the assessable income of that taxpayer. This is consistent with the general taxation principle of matching deductions with related income to  ensure that tax is levied on the net income or profit of taxpayers. To allow deductions from an activity to be received by one taxpayer while attributing the income of that activity to another taxpayer would allow taxpayers to artificially structure their affairs to minimise tax with a consequent loss to the fairness and revenue generating powers of the taxation system.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Already in progress</EMPHASIS>  The Government has established the Australian Technology Group Pty Ltd (ATG) as a technology commercialisation corporation to contribute to the translation of Australian research into products and services which can be delivered to the Australian and  international markets on a totally commercial basis. Given the long-term and high-risk nature of investment in technology commercialisation and the need to attract private sector investment to the ATG, it is clear that the ATG must be allowed to develop its own business strategy and operate along commercial lines.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The ATG Board has indicated during public seminars held in late 1992 that it is conscious of the need to focus its activities to develop credibility and investor confidence and to forge appropriate alliances both in Australia and overseas during its initial operations. Whilst the ATG may well develop along the lines suggested in these recommendations, the initial focus of its operation is a matter for the ATG Board and management to consider in the development of their business strategy. In that regard it should be noted that the ATG has appointed a Managing Director and other staff who bring with them extensive experience in international technology commercialisation and specialist knowledge in high technology areas.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">14. The Government require superannuation funds to report details of their holdings in certain types of investments, including investments in new asset classes such as development and venture capital. (paragraph 3.78)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Partially accepted</EMPHASIS>  The Government has undertaken to establish a comprehensive and effective prudential framework to give adequate protection to superannuation savings and to promote a more efficient superannuation industry, while avoiding the imposition of unreasonable supervisory and compliance costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The disclosure of adequate and appropriate information to members is a critical element in the prudential arrangements. However there are significant costs to an appropriate level of regulation. The direct financial costs to superannuation funds of complying with supervisory requirements are ultimately reflected in lower benefits available to fund members when they retire.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Substantial new disclosure requirements, which the Government announced in August 1991, have applied to all superannuation funds with five or more members from 1 July 1992. These extensive requirements must include, among other things:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the investment strategy, proportions, or the amounts, of the value of assets of the fund specified by the asset classes listed in regulation 18K(1) of the Occupational Superannuation Standards Regulations, and the value of particular assets of the fund if they exceed 5% of the value of all assets;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To the extent that the Government requires information on particular types of funds investments for policy purposes not related to prudential supervision, there may be merits in obtaining this information from surveys of a representative sample of funds rather than introducing further mandatory reporting requirements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">15. The Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner develop a standardised reporting system for use by superannuation funds in reporting on their investments. (paragraph 3.78)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Partially accepted</EMPHASIS>  The Government supports the recommendation that there be prescription of specific asset allocation for use by superannuation funds in reporting their investments and has developed such standards. As mentioned in response to Recommendation 14, the disclosure requirements introduced from 1 July 1992 require the reporting of details of the proportion, or amount of the value of assets invested in certain prescribed categories. In addition, trustees must report details of individual investments which exceed 5% of the value of all assets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">16. The information provided to the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner be reported to the Parliament. (paragraph 3.78)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Agreed in principle</EMPHASIS>  The Commissioner receives information from over 70,000 funds on an annual basis. Aggregating such information to permit a meaningful report to Parliament would involve an unwarranted resource cost.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has, nevertheless, recognised that public dissemination of some fund information is desirable from an accountability perspective. The Insurance and Superannuation Commission (ISC) has developed a public access database system in the context of the Superannuation Guarantee arrangements to provide readily available information concerning the compliance status under the OSS legislation of superannuation funds. The Government also announced in the Strengthening Super Security Statement (21 October 1992) that it will further improve the availability  of information to third parties, by requiring funds to provide, on request, the annual report and (on an aggregate basis) such information as fund members are entitled to request.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Already undertaken</EMPHASIS>  The Government has just completed a review of the prudent man rule and announced in the Strengthening Super Security Statement that it would codify in legislation the prudent man provisions. These provisions will be comparable to those in United States legislation. In this Statement, the Government noted that:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">one of the essential duties of trustees is to invest in a manner that seeks to maximise the rate of return on members' entitlements commensurate with a prudential approach to risk;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the best way this could be achieved would be to encourage trustees to adopt a balanced portfolio approach to the investment of members' funds; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the adoption of a balanced portfolio approach will allow trustees to invest a proportion of funds in areas such as venture capital without breaching their fiduciary obligations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">18. The Government examine the possibility of introducing a tax exempt savings program with a requirement for a substantial component of the savings accumulated to be invested into Australian research and its development and commercialisation. (paragraph 3.84)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Not agreed</EMPHASIS>  Tax exempt savings accounts are unlikely to be an appropriate means of addressing any perceived shortage of capital for investment in research and development as there are significant doubts as to their ability to encourage greater national savings and conditionally favouring R&amp;D could be at the expense of other economically worthwhile investments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In the context of providing tax support for superannuation, the Government has indicated that it does not intend to specify where superannuation funds can invest, except to the extent necessary for prudential purposes. Similarly, if tax support were provided in the form sought in the Report there is no basis to suggest that such funds should be invested other than on a fully commercial basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">19. The Government establish an independent body to review the costing and structure of the Patents Office and determine whether there is any scope to achieve greater efficiencies and streamline the process. (paragraph 5.59)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Not agreed</EMPHASIS>  There have been a large number of independent and in-house reviews of the Australian Industrial Property Organisation (AIPO) and its predecessor in the last decade. These reviews, including the DITARD/AIPO/Finance review of the Management Improvement Program, have led to major changes in the AIPO's framework and operations. On 1 July 1993, AIPO moved to a Group 2 Trust Account. The benefits of AIPO operating under a Group 2 Trust Account arise largely from the systems and procedures which AIPO are to adopt as a condition of the arrangement. These include the adoption of accrual accounting, the development of corporate objectives and strategies to achieve them, and pricing and performance targets which substitute for the absence of effective competition. Under these arrangements the Government believes AIPO will be a more cost-effective body and responsive to the market for industrial property rights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AIPO's fees and service compare favourably with the major international industrial property organisations. It should be noted that the fees charged by AIPO form only a small portion of overall patenting costs. The costs imposed for services provided by the patent attorney profession, the costs involved in obtaining overseas patents, and the cost of enforcement of patent rights through the court system are all significant elements in the overall cost of patenting and are all outside the control of AIPO.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AIPO has ongoing review and monitoring mechanisms in place and is responsive to user needs. It maintains close contact with its main interest groups on all matters of significance&mdash;including fees. In addition to these informal arrangements, AIPO makes use of more formal working parties to consider major issues. Appropriate arrangements for the oversight of AIPO's business and administrative activities are also under consideration by the Minister for Science and Small Business.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">20. The Department of Industry, Technology &amp; Commerce:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">set up an advisory committee of users to monitor the costing structures of the Patents Office on an ongoing basis and provide feedback on their needs and the services provided; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">consider whether programs supporting research and development should be extended to giving assistance towards the cost of patents where those costs may deter the commercialisation of research and development, especially on an international basis. (paragraph 5.59)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Agreed in part</EMPHASIS>  The Government accepts that an advisory committee of users to monitor costing structures and to provide feedback on their needs and the services provided may be useful. Members would need to have experience or expertise to understand the environment in which the Office works. As mentioned in the response to recommendation 19, however, AIPO already seeks and responds to feedback and suggestions of its users. The current move to a Group 2 Trust Account for AIPO will also provide a more efficient and responsive service for users. The Minister for Science and Small Business is considering appropriate arrangements for the oversight of AIPO's business and administrative activities. The role of the Industrial Property Advisory Committee in providing policy advice to the Minister is also under review. The establishment of an advisory committee of users will be considered in this context.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government does not believe it is appropriate to extend the scope of existing programs to cover the costs of patents. It is the Government's view that the commercialisation of research should by and large be handled by those closest to the research project as they are in the best position to judge both the commercial viability and risks associated with any particular research and commercialisation project.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The recommendation would require Government to determine which projects have commercial potential and/or whether the cost of patenting is the actual deterrent to commercialisation, or whether the development costs are the prohibitive factor. These assessments are best made by those undertaking the commercialisation process. Government already provides substantial assistance to encourage innovation through a range of programs such as the 150% tax concession for research and development and the Grants for Industry Research and Development program. In the Government's view, existing programs provide the appropriate balance between assistance and commercial decision making.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">21. The Law Reform Commission review:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Government's policy for protecting intellectual property;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the appropriateness of the present legal framework for protecting intellectual property, and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the administration of intellectual property protection by three Departments. (paragraph 5.65)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Agreed in part</EMPHASIS>  The Australian Law Reform Commission (ALRC) is not well placed to undertake such a broad review of the Government's policy for protecting intellectual property as its legal focus is not suited to investigating the broad economic and policy considerations involved, and its function is to investigate and report on the state of the law, rather than government arrangements for administration and policy development. Further, much of the individual Intellectual Property legislative regimes have been or are in the process of being reviewed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The patent legislation has been the subject of a review in recent years and the new Patents Act 1990 is a direct result of this review. The trade marks legislation has also recently been reviewed and it is expected that an exposure draft of the new legislation will be available for public comment towards the end of 1993. The designs legislation is currently being reviewed by the ALRC. Various aspects of the Copyright Act are currently under review by the Copyright Law Review Committee (CLRC), which has presented six reports during 1983-1991 and is expected to report on its two current references in 1993. The Government has responded to the CLRC reports already presented and will in due course respond to the reports expected from that body and the ALRC.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The operations of the Plant Variety Rights scheme have also been reviewed recently and the Plant Variety legislation is being redrafted following public consultation and review. The Government will continue to review legislation and individual issues on a case-by-case basis drawing on the advice and work of those organisations best placed to undertake such reviews.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In regard to the administration of the intellectual property system, this issue will need to be considered further in the light of the possible benefits and costs associated with changes to current administrative arrangements. The Government acknowledges there may be benefits from forming a single intellectual property protection administrative body,  such as the convenience of a "one stop shop" for users and client groups of one or more of the intellectual property systems, and possibly a more consistent, focused and comprehensive legislative and policy approach to intellectual property as a whole.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, the extent to which it is practical to integrate approaches to review and reform of the various intellectual property regimes, with their diverse policy objectives and dependent industries, needs to be carefully considered. Also, there are possibly costs involved in a single overall intellectual property administration, such as a loss of direct involvement with clients, and a possible erosion of the relevance and effectiveness of the focus on individual elements of intellectual property rights (eg the separation of Plant Variety Rights from the Department of Primary Industries and Energy might mean the agricultural/horticultural interests are not as effectively addressed) needs to be considered. The issues of funding and charging would also need to be addressed as the individual elements of the intellectual property system operate under varying cost recovery regimes or, as in the case of the copyright system, generate no revenue for its administration. It should also be noted that the Government already has in place mechanisms such as the Intellectual Property Consultative Committee, to improve the coordination and consultation between agencies responsible for intellectual property regimes. This issue will need to be further considered in the context of current coordination arrangements and the potential costs associated with a single administration.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A range of intellectual property issues identified in a report presented to the Prime Minister's Science and Engineering Council and another report prepared by the Industrial Property Advisory Committee are currently being considered by Government. Issues being considered include awareness and education in intellectual property protection, practice and procedures for the enforcement of industrial property rights in Australia and Australia's involvement in intellectual property issues associated with Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">22. The Government consider amendments to the taxation legislation to allow the depreciation of world-wide patents that add to work in Australia, but do not provide income, as a means of encouraging Australian companies to operate on the world market. (paragraph 5.73)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Already established practice</EMPHASIS>  Current industry policy seeks to encourage Australian companies to become more internationally oriented. Some companies have claimed that international patents costs are prohibitive and have been a deterrent to pursuing certain international markets.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under existing tax law, capital expenditure incurred in the development or purchase of a patent may be amortised over the effective life of the patent in the hands of the owner. For expenditure incurred after 21 August 1990, amortisation has been extended to foreign patents, provided they are used for the purpose of producing assessable income in the year of income or a previous year of income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The interpretation of the legislation by the Australian Tax Office is to allow deductions for the cost of foreign property rights which are purchased by Australian businesses to protect exports in foreign markets from competing production where the exports generate assessable income in Australia. Given that such costs are presently deductible, the Government considers legislative change unnecessary.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Already instituted</EMPHASIS>  The IR&amp;D Board is examining its Strategic Plan as part of the Board restructuring process. Under the new administrative structure an ongoing task will be the evaluation of the program to meet the evolving Government policies and economic strategies and the needs of industry.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">POLICY</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">36. Agencies, which provide grants for research and its development and commercialisation, continue to concentrate support for areas in which Australia has a competitive advantage, and tailor the assistance provided to the particular needs of industries and firms. (paragraph 10.19)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Agreed</EMPHASIS>  The Government supports the principles underpinning this recommendation. Moreover, it notes the possibility of creation of advantage based on intellectual endeavour in areas where Australia might reasonably develop a competitive advantage. At the same time, competitive advantage based on research findings and new technologies can be very quickly and easily lost, and it is important to make decisions predicated on future market opportunities and threats and the dynamics of the innovative process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Cooperative Research Centres (CRC) Program, through its requirement for close involvement of industry and other research users in all activities, including planning and management, ensures that CRCs continue to address the needs of industries and firms and that their activities build on Australia's competitive advantages and are relevant to industry's capabilities.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The IR&amp;D Board is restructuring and will set its priorities in terms of industry areas in conjunction with DITARD. The Board is somewhat limited in its support for commercialisation as it focuses assistance on R&amp;D under the Act's definition. There is some scope available for flexibility in grants and the Board is looking at this aspect in its restructuring.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Primary Industries and Energy R&amp;D Corporations have a strong commercial focus. Strong links with industry mean that grants for research and development activities do consider Australia's competitive position and dovetail with needs of Australian industry. The R&amp;D Corporation model reflects overall Government policy which is directed at the need to develop better links between government, research users, the public sector research effort and private sector research effort.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">37. Agencies awarding grants for research and its development and commercialisation review the merits of requiring at least part repayment of grants by firms that gain financial benefit from receiving them. (paragraph 4.40)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Under consideration </EMPHASIS>  The IR&amp;D Board is also currently  examining the issue and the Industry Commission Report on the National Procurement Development Program (NPDP) put forward suggestions for a restructured, self funding NPDP scheme. The Industry Commission is expected to address the issue in the forthcoming Inquiry into R&amp;D. The Government will take into account any proposals or recommendations bearing on this matter arising from the Industry Commission Inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government notes that the concept of sharing the risks and benefits of research, development and commercialisation has already been adopted by the public sector research agencies and the Primary Industries and Energy R&amp;D Corporations. These matters were discussed fully in a (January 1992) paper "Costing and Pricing of Research" put out by the Coordination Committee on Science and Technology, and the 1992 Government White Paper on Science and Technology endorsed general principles covering costing and pricing of research. These provide for the transparent negotiation of contracts between research and funding organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">38. The Government provide a performance bond guarantee facility for sales in Australia of technology and related products, as recommended by the Task Force on the Commercialisation of Research. (paragraph 7.40)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Not agreed</EMPHASIS>  The Government does not consider public monies should be used to underwrite the commercial viability of new technology based products. This would insulate manufacturers from </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">market discipline and involve high costs in admiistration and operation. The Government has taken steps to encourage the private sector to fill this role&mdash;a workshop sponsored by DITARD and the Australian Development Capital Association Ltd was held in Sydney in October 1992.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">39. The Government increase the role played by organisations representing engineers and technologists in providing advice to the Government and assisting in framing policy relating to innovation. (paragraph 10.65)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Already instituted</EMPHASIS>  The Government supports a pluralistic S&amp;T policy-making process and welcomes the input of individuals and groups with interest and/or expertise. It recognises that Australia's diverse science and technology system requires effective coordination, and put a number of formal mechanisms in place in the May 1989 science and technology policy statement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The most recent significant example of its support was the announcement in the 1992 White Paper on Science and  Technology that the Prime Minister's Science Council be renamed the Prime Minister's Science and Engineering Council; and that it was to be expanded to include the President of the Institution of Engineers, as well as the Treasurer, reflecting the Government's view that science, technology and engineering must be integrated into the broader policy debate.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">40. The Government consult widely with all sections of the community to establish concrete targets for increased production and exports of value-added goods and services. (paragraph 10.71)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Not agreed</EMPHASIS>  The Government considers that production is usually organised most efficiently through the use of markets. The Government aims to provide the environment and the infrastructure in which this can be done with maximum efficiency. It is recognised that the market does not always necessarily operate in such a way as to maximise industrial competitiveness, or welfare in general, and where market failures exist there may be a case for intervention, subject to rigorous analysis of the economic, ecological and social costs and benefits of the alternatives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">REWARDS FOR COMMERCIALISATION</EMPHASIS></PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Already instituted</EMPHASIS>  Several public and private prizes are already in place. These include the Australia Prize, the Clunies-Ross National Science and Technology Award,  the Sir Ian McLennan Achievement for Industry Award and the Eureka Prizes. DITARD's Science and Technology Awareness Program is exploring ways by which the Government might use its influence and resources to increase the public awareness of the achievements of the winners of these prizes and the importance of their work, in order to demonstrate the commercial importance of research and technology.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">42. The National Health &amp; Medical Research Council and the Industry Research &amp; Development Board cooperate to produce a program to further stimulate the commercialisation of medical research. (paragraph 4.44)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Action proceeding</EMPHASIS>  Australian medical researchers are world leaders in a number of fields and there can be significant net benefits from successful commercialisation of medical research. The Government recognises the potential for greater commercial benefit from Australian medical research and is pursuing it by, amongst other things:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the exchange of expertise between the IR&amp;D Board and the NHMRC through attendance of the Board Chairman at the Medical Research Committee (MRC) meetings and by his membership of the MRC's Development Grants Sub-committee which assess development grants applications;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the charter of the ATG which includes commercialisation of medical research. The ATG will have complete independence from the Government regarding decisions as to the areas of research to support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">43. The Business Regulation Review Unit and the National Health &amp; Medical Research Council consult on an ongoing basis with interested parties to identify regulatory barriers to the commercialisation of medical research and recommend on ways of minimising them. (paragraph 9.25)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Action proceeding</EMPHASIS>  The Government, through the Office of Regulation Review (formerly Business Regulation Review Unit) and, if necessary, through specific inquiries from time to time, has an ongoing agenda to remove or redesign regulations across all areas of the economy which are unnecessary impediments to the international competitiveness of Australian industry. Any regulatory impediments to the commercialisation of medical research would be expected to be identified and dealt with by these mechanisms. The Government notes in this regard that the JCPA report acknowledges the substantial streamlining of the regulatory process for the registering of drugs and pharmaceuticals for human use following action by the Government in response to the Baume Report.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In framing its recommendation the JCPA also referred to the Coghlan Report on Commercialisation of Medical Research Discoveries which recommended closer links between the NHMRC, the Business Regulation Review Unit and interested parties as regards regulatory barriers. The Government believes that existing arrangements provide an appropriate mechanism for liaison between the two bodies. Consideration of the Coghlan Report's recommendation by the Development Grants Sub-committee of the NHMRC's MRC is expected to shape the nature and the extent of such liaison.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">NATIONAL INDUSTRY EXTENSION SERVICE</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">44. Additional funds be made available to the National Industry Extension Service so that it can supply its services to firms that have not yet used them and more extensive services can be provided to existing clients. (paragraph 6.29)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Not agreed</EMPHASIS>  The Government recognises the importance of the work of the National Industry Extension Service in enterprise improvement. It also notes the complementary work of Primary Industries and Energy's Marketing and Business Service, which focuses on rural areas. The Government considers, however, that further funding should be considered within the context of the Budget process, not before the end of its current funding period or prior to the Industry Commission Inquiry.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Agreed in part</EMPHASIS>  The Government has decided to continue support for the National Procurement Development Program. This has occurred within the context of the grants component of the Industry Innovation Program (IIP). The IIP has itself been extended to December 1995. By that time the Industry Commission will have reported on its review of Research and Development and the future of the IIP will have been considered by the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">46. The Industry Research &amp; Development Board continue to modify the Program to eliminate inefficiencies in its operation. (paragraph 7.36)</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Already instituted</EMPHASIS>  In line with the operational review of the grants programs (including the NPDP) and the IR&amp;D Board, a number of initiatives have been taken to improve its efficiency and effectiveness.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In February 1993, the Board launched the new, streamlined Industry Innovation Program, which incorporates the Discretionary and Generic Technology Grants schemes; the Advanced Manufacturing Technology Development Program; the National Procurement Development Program; the National Teaching Company Scheme; and the 150% tax incentive; and aims to make the schemes much more accessible and responsive to client needs and to speed up the whole grant approval process. Applicants now need to put in only a single Expression of Interest for all the schemes which will be considered by one of five new industry focused committees. They will provide feedback and decide if it is worthwhile  for an applicant to go ahead and make a much more detailed full application. Unsuccessful applicants receive greater feedback as to the reasons for their lack of success.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There will be a single point of contact in each State, and advisory services and project management will be located in the relevant State offices, where staff can become more involved in monitoring, reporting and reviewing the project, and commercialisation of the results. This should make the program more accessible to companies, researchers and purchasers. Such requirements as establishing milestones will be strengthened and become an essential part of a stepped payments regime through the life of the project.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The structure of the IR&amp;D Board has also been revised to enable committees to develop a greater understanding of the needs of specific industry sectors, and to reduce the time taken for applicants to receive feedback and notification of successful, or unsuccessful applications. The sectoral committees are:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Information, Communications &amp; Electronics</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Not agreed</EMPHASIS>  In its report No 305 Implementation of the Offsets Program the Committee recommended that ". . . an independent full scale assessment be undertaken of the national significance of the offset policy . . . .". In a supplement to the Finance Minute on JCPA report 305 the Department of Defence responded and did not accept the recommendation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Resulting from a study of Defence Policy and Industry in 1992 (under the guidance of Parliamentary Secretary Price) a policy decision was made to use offsets only as a measure of last resort and specific commercial arrangements are to be preferred for the transfer of technology and development of support capability in Australian industry. The Industry Commission is due to review Defence Procurement in July 1993 and will include Defence Offsets as part of the review.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the new initiatives and the diminished role of Defence Offsets in the procurement process the Government does not consider a separate review of the Defence Offsets program necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">48. The Department of Defence produce a separate report containing details of the Defence Offsets Program, similar to that produced by the Department of Industry, Technology &amp; Commerce on the Civil Offsets Program and the Partnerships for Development Program.

<PARA>The 1992-93 annual report of the Australian Wool Realisation Commission will be the second last report of this body set up in 1991 to take over the $2.7 billion debt of the AWC, the $4.6 million stockpile of the AWC and the warehouse and other properties held by that body. The main task of the AWRC was to discharge the debt in accordance with a specified seven-year repayment program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the next two years of the operation, the market conditions changed significantly. The AWRC operated within its legislative requirements and I commend the role of Bob Richardson in this regard. His job has not been easy. As a woolgrower, I admit that we all have the capacity to shoot the messenger, especially in circumstances that have been as depressing as they have been for the current wool market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the AWRC was set up, there was substantial agreement that the stockpile be transparently reduced. Bob Richardson was determined to re-establish the respectability of an industry that had been seriously wounded by government policy. It was not the stockpile that was breaking the industry; it was the debt. The AWRC had a set repayment requirement. These targets were initially met. But, as it is clearly known now, the repayments schedule became unsustainable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The 1992-93 season, which this AWRC report comments on, saw a further major deterioration in the wool market. The annual target was again changed and the government responded further by setting up the Garnaut committee which laid down a regime for the future. Garnaut's proposals have passed through the parliament and have set down an entirely new infrastructure for the management and sale of the Australian Wool Realisation Commission's stockpile. After 1 July 1994, the stockpile and the debt will be inherited by the new statutory body that will ultimately be privatised. On the balance of probabilities, woolgrowers will have equity in that body. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The AWRC will soon cease to exist as it has outlived its reason for existence. Wool International will sell the stockpile by a fixed reduction regime, not a fixed debt repayment schedule as is presently the case. It will treat the stockpile as an asset and one which most reflects the circumstances that will apply when the stockpile no longer exists. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the AWRC shows great responsibility in its operations between now and 30 June next year. I urge it not to sell one bale of wool more than it is obliged to. The most important thing for the future of the industry is a recovery in price. This will happen earlier if a limited amount of wool comes out of the stockpile between now and 30 June 1994. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>I wish to use the five minutes that I am allowed under Standing Orders to refer to some of the matters contained in this report. A couple of sitting weeks ago, I raised with the Minister for Transport and Communications, Senator Collins&mdash;the minister responsible for AMSA&mdash;the question of AMSA's purchase of a replacement ship for the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cape Moreton</EMPHASIS> at a cost of nearly $20 million. Senator Collins did his usual bellowing, claiming that this was best offer available, that the authority had done the right thing and everything was beyond reproach and beyond question. He still maintains that view and did so at the estimates committee hearings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Since then we have found a bit more information. I look to this report to see whether I can get any more information on how the authority went about purchasing a $20 million ship overseas without putting it out to tender in Australia. It is my understanding that in 1992 the cabinet issued guidelines for purchases by government business enterprises. AMSA was listed as one of those government business enterprises that ought to follow these guidelines on the manner in which such purchases should be handled. At this stage it is my view that the guidelines have not been appropriately followed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a $20 million purchase that Australian industry was not effectively given the chance to compete for. In response to that allegation, AMSA says, `Look, we were never going to buy a ship; we were just looking for a charter. We were roaming the world looking for a ship to charter, and what do you know? A cheap bargain came up'. It is like going to the supermarket for chops and coming home with pea soup. AMSA spotted these bankrupt hulls&mdash;I think that is what they are called&mdash;and thought, `They are cheap, so we will buy them'. And they were cheap; there is no dispute about that. AMSA came back and asked the Department of the Arts and Administrative Services and it basically said, `They might be cheap but you should give Australian industry, and Australian workers, a chance to compete for this work'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Instead of putting it out to tender, what happened? The chief executive officer hopped on a plane, whizzed around and in a matter of days had verbal consultations with four shipping companies&mdash;and, as I understand it, another company said that it could have made the ship&mdash;all of whom said that they could do it, although some said that they could not do it within the time required. One said that it could do it for $20 million to $25 million, slightly less than the average that Senator Collins referred to. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I then turn to the financial statements and see that $2.6 million was spent on redundancy payments because the authority has chosen to decommission the ship that it had. Presumably, that means the 100 or so crew&mdash;or at least a big portion of them for $2.6 million in redundancy payments&mdash;have gone off to do something else while we wait for this other ship to come from Spain. So, if the firm that said it could do it for $20 million to $25 million had been able to do it for $20 million, that could be compared with the cost of the Spanish option, which you could day has gone up to $22 million, because there might not have been redundancies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But the real point to make is that this report does not detail adequately the manner in which that purchase was made. AMSA did not originally intend to buy a ship. It badly miscalculated what the purchase price of a ship would be in Australia. I can hardly believe that Senator West is asleep listening to this; I am not that boring. If, instead of doing a quick ring around at the last minute to say, `Listen guys, could you do this at this price by this time?', AMSA had started the ball rolling in September the year before and done what it should have and issued tenders and given Australian industry a chance to compete, a few more Australian workers in the shipbuilding industry might now have a job.

<PARA>I wish to draw attention to some aspects of the operations of the Federal Airports Corporation, not necessarily those aspects for which the Federal Airports Corporation is best known; namely, the provision of the facility at airports for aircraft to take off and land in safety and to get people on and off them in some degree of comfort, I presume. I would like to concentrate on the activities of the Federal Airports Corporation which have been arrived at through the priority that the government has given to changing its philosophy from one of providing a service to one of meeting its own costs and conducting itself in a corporate style. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that this particular change in philosophy has resulted in an aggressive attitude in all aspects of the Federal Airports Corporation's activities. Some might say that it is an admirable thing for an organisation such as this to cover its costs, but I believe that it has led to some anomalies which have had an effect which was not intended. Under the heading `Commercial' on page 11, the report states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A priority was the development of commercial strategies designed to capitalise on opportunities . . .</PARA>
<PARA>The capitalisation on opportunities to which I refer relates to the operation of off-airport car hire operators&mdash;people who conduct their business of renting cars to travellers in a town or a city located near the airport. This business is typically one whereby tourist based packages are offered to people and arrangements are entered into so that a person hires a car and, upon arrival at an airport, takes delivery of that car, under a contract which has been arrived at previously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The FAC has decided that this is an opportunity for it to make a buck, because people are arriving at an airport looking for the enterprise that they have entered into an agreement with. We have all seen the usual thing that happens at an airport; we are either coming down the escalator or reaching the baggage area and we see an operator of a hire car business standing there with somebody's name on a piece of paper, or perhaps a personal identification. The client meets the operator and is directed to a car. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The FAC is seizing this opportunity to intervene to rake off a dollar. I suggest that, if some people think that is all right, the logical extension of such an attitude is that the FAC will see the opportunity to apply that philosophy to taxi and limousine drivers, tour buses&mdash;one can imagine pensioners on a <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Women's Weekly</EMPHASIS> tour being asked to pay $2 to the FAC before they are allowed to get on the bus&mdash;or journalists. Why not take it to the full extent? Any journalist who wants to conduct an interview with a politician or a person arriving would have to pay the FAC a buck on the way through. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of business transactions take place at airports. A number of meetings of people who engage in business off-site also take place at airports. If every person who had business with another person and met that person at an airport was asked to pay a rake-off to the FAC, I suggest that we would label that as protection money or a mafia-style operation. That is the extent to which the legitimate operators of car hire businesses throughout Australia are being subjected to victimisation because it is their unfortunate position to have to meet their clients at an airport. I suggest that it is time we looked at it in a proper regard. </PARA>

<PARA>This annual report, which is actually two volumes, was only made available today and I have not had time to go through it completely. Of particular interest to me is the report on the managing of OGIA&mdash;the Office of Government Information and Advertising&mdash;which comes under the jurisdiction of the Department of the Arts and Administrative Services. OGIA was associated with the marketing of the disability reform package. The marketing of this package took place under the auspices of the Office of Government Information and Advertising in conjunction with three other departments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It took some time for me to extract the information about the letting of a contract to promote the disability reform package because the Office of Government Information and Advertising was chairing the meeting that was associated with the committee that was supervising the promotion of this program with the three other departments. When I extracted information from the committees that were looking into administrative services, social security, health, housing and local government and DEET, I was able to discover that some problems were associated with the letting of this contract.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A series of names of large advertising agencies were put forward as suggested possibilities to be approached to submit tenders on a selective tender basis. There was a request for more names of organisations or businesses that could look at a more innovative rather than a mass-advertising approach. Two names were put forward. One of those names came from a list that OGIA had of people who had put their names forward who may at some stage be approached to undertake government projects. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It transpired that no checks were undertaken of the financial capabilities of the company that finally got the contract. I am not talking about a small contract; I am talking about a contract of $4.95 million of taxpayers' money. If OGIA or the committee responsible for letting the contract had carefully checked the records&mdash;in fact, the last annual return to the Australian Securities Commission&mdash;of that company, it would have been revealed that the company was trading at a loss, that its liabilities exceeded its assets, and that it possibly, or probably, was balance sheet insolvent.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was in the estimates committee that we discovered what had happened. Senator Loosley tells us that estimates committees are a waste of time. I think one of the things this demonstrates is that pursuing an issue puts departments on notice that they need to be much more accountable for the way in which they spend taxpayers' money. This contract was let to this company. We were told that two checks had been done. One check was to a department in New South Wales for which the company had undertaken a contract. The other check involved one other department. So there were two checks, but the proper checks were not undertaken. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the problems that has occurred is that the company went into liquidation in July of this year, which has resulted in a number of unspecified creditors. Some of those creditors are people with disabilities. It is sad and ironical that the program was designed to promote the employment of people with disabilities, and it appears that there are people with disabilities who are owed money. </PARA>

<PARA>The report of the Australian Electoral Commission is very large and very detailed. It points out, generally, the very good work that the commission does. It particularly makes reference to the good work that the Australian Electoral Commission did in assisting with elections in countries where Australia had an obligation under United Nations arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am, however, concerned at one aspect of the Australian Electoral Commission's work relating to its investigation into some irregularities which were reported concerning the election in the federal seat of Leichhardt, in Far North Queensland, at the last election. There were a number of allegations made on oath and supported by statutory declarations which were submitted to the returning officer at Cairns about irregularities in the seat of Leichhardt. Honourable senators will be aware of some of these allegations which I have mentioned previously. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There was an allegation that on 15 occasions the scrutineers reported that voters were placing blank ballot papers in the ballot boxes, yet when these were counted in Cairns later there were no blank ballots&mdash;suggesting that someone had interfered with them. It was alleged that ballot boxes were not sealed and were opened during the day to retrieve mistakenly placed absentee votes. There were reports of returning officers' assistants seen picking up blank ballot papers off the floor, filling them in and placing them in the ballot box. There were reports about Labor Party scrutineers and officials having undue influence. There were reports about ALP how-to-vote cards being left on officials' tables&mdash;not in the voting compartment&mdash;and referred to by officials. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These complaints were pointed out to the returning officer in Leichhardt and supported by declarations. The Australian electoral officer for Queensland said that he investigated these reports. He came to the conclusion that there was no substance in the complaints and he said he was not going to proceed further. In his letter to the people who had complained, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the outset I should say that the allegations made against the polling officials have been rejected by them. Regrettably, when opposing statements are made in such circumstances as existed in this case and there is no independent evidence, it is difficult to reach absolute conclusions.</PARA>
<PARA>I was concerned at just what investigations were conducted by the Australian electoral officer. To my mind, the people who complained and swore statutory declarations were not consulted by any officer of the AEC. It seems that all the electoral officer did was ring the people about whom these complaints had been made and say to them, `Did you do that?'. Naturally enough, because criminal offences were involved, they said, `No, we didn't do it'. So he has found that there has been no substance in the allegation. In this letter reporting back, he also said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">On the question of objectivity or bias, I believe that your scrutineers have not taken sufficient account of cultural sensitivities which affect the manner in which some electors in these areas might request assistance in casting their vote.</PARA>
<PARA>I do not know quite what that means. Either we have rules on how to vote or we do not have rules.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister's remarks cast a dark shadow over Dr Lek's reputation and credibility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We are instructed that in fact Dr Lek is a qualified medical practitioner in Cambodia. We attach a copy of a certificate dated 2 January 1990 issued by the National Medical Academy of Cambodia, certifying that Dr Lek graduated with Honours as a Doctor of Medicine. The certificate omits Dr Lek's surname. We are instructed that this is because Dr Lek chose not to use his surname at the Academy because of his fears of persecution by the Vietnamese backed Hun Sen Government then in power.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Lek graduated on 19 October 1989 and his graduation certificate was issued on 2 January 1990. Prior to commencing his full-time medical studies at the National Medical Academy in 1983, Dr Lek was an assistant nurse at the Rathgany Hospital in Cambodia. This information, together with a copy of his graduation certificate as a medical doctor, was provided to the Department shortly after his arrival in Australia in March 1990 in support of his refugee application.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dr Lek, who has taken a leading and public role in the representative proceedings in the Federal Court, is puzzled by the Minister's motives in raising at this stage the authenticity of his medical qualifications. Since 10 May 1990, when Dr Lek lodged his claim for refugee status, he has consistently described his profession as doctor. The authenticity of his medical qualifications have, to our knowledge, never been disputed by officers of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, responsible for processing and determining Dr Lek's application for refugee status.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">An appeal has been lodged on behalf of Dr Lek to the Full Court of the Federal Court against Justice Wilcox's decision dated 8 October 1993 holding that the refusal by the Minister's delegate to grant Dr Lek's application for refugee status was flawed in law. Should those appeal proceedings be successful, the likely outcome is that the Minister or his delegate would have to reconsider Dr Lek's application for refugee status. In those circumstances, the Minister's remarks as quoted above could reasonably be expected to be highly prejudicial to a future assessment of Dr Lek's claim for refugee status given that those remarks directly and unambiguously impugn the validity of his medical qualifications and his general credibility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister's remarks are also highly damaging to Dr Lek's reputation and prejudice attempts by him to persuade the Australian Government to allow him and other Cambodian boat people to remain in Australia on humanitarian grounds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We request on behalf of Dr Lek that this matter be referred to the Committee of Privileges in accordance with resolution 5.</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I refer to Hansard for the proceedings of the Senate Estimates Committee F on 12 November 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In that hearing I was referred to by name in circumstances which adversely affect my professional reputation. Senator Bolkus at Senate Hansard F211, 212 made the following statements, allegations and imputations relating to me:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian taxpayers are funding fruitless litigation on behalf of Dr Lek and other Cambodian refugees. This is not correct. Neither I personally nor the firm of which I am a partner have received any funding in respect of the litigation in which I am acting for Dr Lek and other Cambodian boat people. My firm is acting pro bono publico in the litigation, as are other law firms representing Cambodian boat people in separate litigation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That I and other lawyers are pursuing fruitless court cases. This is also incorrect. In the very proceedings to which Senator Bolkus refers involving Dr Lek as the representative, the appellants were successful in establishing that, contrary to the previous Minister's position, the Minister had the power under the Migration Act to consider allowing the Cambodians to stay on humanitarian grounds. In addition, 3 of the 48 individuals in those representative proceedings were successful in establishing that the Minister's delegates had committed errors of law and the Court ordered that their claims for refugee status be reconsidered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Furthermore, on the same day that Senator Bolkus made these remarks about lawyers pursuing "fruitless court cases", Justice Keely delivered judgment in Melbourne Federal Court proceedings involving a Cambodian boat person who arrived on the same boat as Dr Lek. His Honour set aside the decision of the Minister's delegate in that case, having found that the decision refusing refugee status was wrong in law on numerous grounds, some of which should apply to other Cambodian boat people. Justice Keely ordered that the refugee status application be reconsidered.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would, of course, be wrong of the Minister to prejudge the possible outcome of any such reconsideration resulting from successful judicial review proceedings and I assume that he was not purporting to do so in suggesting that the court cases are "fruitless".</PARA>

For the reasons set out in relation to the preceding point, this is also incorrect. In addition, as an experienced and responsible legal practitioner, I am very conscious of the interests of my clients and always seek to further them in a reasonable and proper way.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That Cambodian refugees "are basically entrapped by the legal advice that is provided to them", with the imputation that this legal advice is inadequate, in that it induces Cambodian refugees to pursue litigation without full knowledge of the likely or possible outcomes. This is incorrect as I have taken care to ensure that my clients are fully aware of the likely consequences of particular courses of action, and they exercise their independent judgment in their instructions to me.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That Cambodian refugees have had a "bondage" imposed on them by "Dr Griffiths and others" and do not appreciate the alternatives available to them. This is also incorrect. The Cambodian refugees for whom I act have at all times been aware of the alternatives available to them. As mature adults they are well able to make their own considered decisions on matters affecting them and their dependents.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the document.</PARA>
<PARA>Last week in this place I spoke to the annual report of the Department of Employment, Education and Training and drew to the attention of the Senate a number of the shortcomings of DEET in relation to the way it is managing the higher education process in this country. I spoke about the deficiencies of the open learning system, deficiencies in quality assurance, deficiencies in how it is managing research in this country and deficiencies in the way it is managing its own financial affairs. The Auditor-General in the last three years has heavily qualified his report into DEET. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The report we have before us today reveals a number of other glaring anomalies in the way in which DEET manages the university sector. We have in this report particular mention of the profiles process which would have to be one of the greatest wastes of universities' time and money developed in this country. Under `Key Points' in the report it is stated that research and evaluation of higher education issues could be better focused and managed properly, that institutions should be encouraged to allocate resources to facilitate their best use, and that universities should be able to identify and pursue national priorities better. In addition, it is stated that the transfer of school leavers to higher education should be better targeted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Basically, the report is being fairly polite about a process which DEET is managing fairly poorly. It is particularly bad news for the universities. With profiling, which is one of the main subjects targeted in this report, the universities are actually getting the worst of both worlds. They have to spend an enormous amount of time and effort in putting the material together for the Department of Employment, Education and Training. Yet, as this report reveals, when DEET gets hold of this material, it does not use it very effectively. As a matter of fact, it does not feed back to the universities vital information that is needed for their growth and development. Indeed, a number of the universities have stated to me that the whole process has wasted a considerable amount of the time of senior staff and a considerable amount of money. All the information that goes in could be useful if it is fed back to them in some form that they can use for guidance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In many universities, this is not the case. The paperwork goes into this great bureaucratic bin, the department does not process it and the universities receive no feedback. So, as I say, they have the worst of both worlds. If profiling is going to be done, it should be done properly and information fed back. Otherwise, the universities should be left alone to get on with what they are supposed to do best, which is teaching and research. They say that it should be better focused. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is amazing, given the amount of intrusion, that DEET is not more effective in directing and guiding the universities. One would have thought that one of the things that would come out of the profile process at an early stage would be the fact that there is an increasing emphasis on postgraduate enrolment to the detriment of undergraduate enrolment. This is a trend that has been going on for many years, yet DEET has suddenly discovered the problem and suddenly tried to pull the universities up with a halt by saying, `Well, we will cut down the number of postgraduate students by pushing up fees'&mdash;as a matter of fact it is proposing to double them in one year&mdash;` and we will put a sudden brake on the expansion that has been going on for several years and that will then free up places in undergraduate education'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">DEET has been undertaking this profile process for quite a number of years so why has it not identified the problem earlier and why has it not used it for guidance at an earlier point in time. I think the particular example I just used shows the failure of profiling. In the case of the University of Melbourne, 1.6 kilograms of profiled documents were sent in to DEET, yet the university was not given the guidance that it needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Auditor-General's report has once again revealed the shortcomings of this department and I would urge it to stop being so intrusive in the university process, to give the universities back the freedom that they originally had and to leave the locus of decision making and the development of the universities in their teaching and research functions to the people who know best how to run these institutions&mdash;and that is not the bureaucrats in Canberra who sit there with these huge lumps of paper, effectively do not do anything with them, put up the costs of the university and slow down the whole process of development in higher education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would hope that this year the department does take notice of this report and does try to increase its effectiveness, as the Auditor-General indicates, but does it in a way that means the whole process is decentralised and not run from a central, remote bureaucracy. </PARA>

<PARA>The Joint House Department has come under some scrutiny in the last couple of weeks in relation to the preferences of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that have been expressed as to how the Joint House Department should expend some of its money or, should I say, some of the taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report covers 1992-93 and therefore presumably, since we have only just been able to get a copy of it, will not make reference to this matter. What I would hope it does make reference to are some sorts of guidelines that Joint House could use as to when it can say to a prime minister, `Look, we do not care what your preference is. The matters relating to Joint House are matters for us to decide. We will decide them according to the guidelines we have got' and not come under some sort of executive pressure to purchase things, whatever they be&mdash;artworks, furniture or whatever&mdash;that suit a prime minister. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The particular case which I have some knowledge of, but not complete knowledge of, is the preference of the Prime Minister to have the cabinet room redecorated and an indication that he would prefer to have some Gould prints&mdash;and not just some Gould prints, but some particular ones. Taxpayers' money has purchased more than 3,000 artworks for this building's art bank&mdash;none of them were suitable, of course, except, I think, one. Such is the preference of this Prime Minister in this difficult economic climate that none of those artworks was good enough; he had an idea of what he wanted and he ended up getting it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With the department's probably quite proper policy that artworks on paper need to be rested for a certain period, instead of needing only eight prints to decorate the cabinet room, the department needed 16, and through one of its own bungles it ended up purchasing one more than it needed. So now we have 17 Gould prints, only eight of which will be hung up at any particular time. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These plates were not lying around individually; these prints were not done to be individual prints.

If one were a collector and had one of these books, and knew that someone really wanted one of the plates in it and that government/taxpayers' money was behind it, one might be inclined to break up the book. I particularly would like to know whether prime ministerial preference with $66,000 worth of taxpayers' money on these prints has not only occasioned us to buy 17 of them, but also whether, as a consequence, any of the books have been disaggregated&mdash;whether one more of these whole collections has been busted up on the whim of the Prime Minister. That is what I would really like to know.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It went further than the $66,000. The Prime Minister expressed a preference for what sort of frames these prints ought to have.

So he is not happy with the artwork he wants; he wants the frame that he wants as well. As I recall, more than $13,000 was spent in purchasing handmade frames. Let us not be the working man's framer here; let us go for handmade gilt frames for the cabinet room&mdash;never mind the expense, it is only the taxpayers who are paying, not you and I out of our private money, this is taxpayers' money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we come to the famous mount board around the outside. The Prime Minister apparently is not happy to have a plain cardboard mount&mdash;lots of people have these&mdash;oh no, he wants a French line and wash put on them. For those who do not understand what that means, it is an additional band of colour on the inside of the mount board primarily from water colours, but it does not matter which type of paint. There might be one or two additional bands of colour, bordered with specific lines to define where those extra bands of colour go&mdash;black might be used; frequently gold is used.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> What is more disgraceful to me, being a South Australian, is what came off the cabinet walls. Guess what came off the cabinet walls and what was not good enough for this Prime Minister?&mdash;a couple of John Olsen prints. Let me explain something for the edification of Senator Crowley. Senator Crowley obviously does not have a strong interest in the visual arts because she does not understand the difference between a painting and a print. She is confused about the terminology `print', which is commonly used to describe the reproduction of a painting, and the terminology used by those more informed who, when referring to a `print', are referring to a lithograph, etching, silk-screen, linocut or whatever. When I said that something is a painting, Senator Crowley interjected, `Is it an original?'. That clearly demonstrates her lack of understanding of what a painting is. I hope that I have elucidated some of the information for her in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One might say, `Well, so what? You are just a parochial South Australian. John Olsen is not that hot stuff. So why would you expect that to be on the cabinet wall?'. I would expect them to be on the cabinet walls because John Olsen received one of these Keatings; that is, one of the arts grants of $65,000 a year for five years that were originally intended to encourage artists. It was assumed that these grants would go to the younger and middle-aged artists. I have no doubt as to Olsen's capacity at all; I am making no criticism of him in that respect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that the Joint House Department, in the conduct of its duties in selecting John Olsen's works, would have selected artworks from an artist that this government has decided is of such importance that he is worth some $300,000-odd of taxpayers' money. Despite the fact that the government has decided he is worth that much, guess what?  The prints do not suit the Prime Minister's taste. The works of a very good South Australian artist have been taken off the walls in the cabinet room. Let us not pretend, as Senator Crowley is trying to do, that it was simply because they had to be rested. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The situation is that this Prime Minister has a dislike of things royal and mimics those people who are monarchists&mdash;there is quite a degree of division in the community as to whether we ought to remain a constitutional monarchy or become a republic. He ridicules all these people. I am coming to the point, Mr Acting Deputy President, because I can see what you are going to say. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister treats himself as the king, the emperor and the royal family of this place. The king or the emperor says to the Joint House Department, `Don't worry about how you're meant to allocate your money; don't worry about parliamentary scrutiny. Listen: I want some Gould prints and I want to indicate the ones I want. I do not just want them framed but I want to indicate the frames I want. I do not just want them mounted but I want to indicate the mounts I want'. The cost will be $85,000 to $90,000&mdash;some people have said $100,000. There was a bit of fussiness about the lighting in the cabinet room for which the taxpayers had spent a lot of money. All of the lighting had to be taken out and a whole lot of new stuff put in over each of the spaces where these prints will go. Why? Because the Prime Minister expressed a preference that each print should be individually lit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When those opposite go out and walk past a CES or a Department of Social Security office and see people looking for a job, and wonder whether this country has got enough money to fund the services it ought to, they should just reflect on spending $100,000 worth of these people's money&mdash;my money, your money, taxpayers' money&mdash;on a prime ministerial preference; on prints that could have been put somewhere where the public could see them. But, no, this is for the galahs in the cabinet. There is to be very limited access to this artwork at a cost of $100,000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make two points. First, the Joint House Department should not be subject to prime ministerial preference. It is a disgrace. We have to find a way to stop this. Whoever is Prime Minister should not be able to walk around here like the emperor of heaven knows where announcing what he would like all over the place and have the Joint House Department go along with it. That is a disgrace; it should be fixed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, if John Olsen is good enough to get one of the Keatings&mdash;although there seems to be some doubt about how one does get these in at least one case&mdash;surely he should be good enough to grace the walls of the cabinet. He is a very good South Australian artist of which South Australia is very proud. I am very sad that those lithographs, or prints in any event&mdash;that is, original prints for the edification of Senator Crowley&mdash;have been taken off the cabinet walls. I look forward to the next annual report detailing this sorry saga and detailing a way that has been devised to stop it happening again. </PARA>

<PARA>This reference was referred to us on 30 September. We had a reporting date of 1 December, and we have come in before time. The reference of this matter arose from complaints that had been made to the department, the Ombudsman and to some members of parliament and senators. In looking at this reference, we received four submissions plus other correspondence and we have held six private meetings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to realise when looking at nursing home areas that several inquiries and studies in the early 1980s, including one by a Senate select committee, indicated that there were serious problems both with the care provided to some nursing home residents and with the costs involved with the program and the infrastructure. While costs varied between the states, there was little incentive to be efficient and there were opportunities for inflated expenditure and fraudulent practices. Reports also found that the standard of care in some instances was low, with consequent effects on the wellbeing of residents. Several changes have been introduced into the residential care program, including hostel care, since 1986, with the aim of improving the quality of care and lifestyle of residents and ensuring effective accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I say, we had four submissions and some other correspondence. It has come to our attention that a number of organisations and individuals are actually involved in following up these complaints. A number have gone to the Ombudsman and have been investigated there, and I understand that there more are going to him. I understand also&mdash;it is believed by us, anyway&mdash;that some of the problems identified may also be handled by the Australian Federal Police. It is possible that the Australian National Audit Office may wish to examine, as part of its work on the aged care program, the validation aspects of this as part of its report. That the committee would certainly welcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee reports that it will maintain a watching brief on all validation matters referred to it and will report again to the Senate during the last week of the first sittings in 1994. The committee accepts that the validation process is a crucial part of the restructuring of nursing home funding and is not prepared to recommend that the process itself be interrupted while these investigations, or those of other bodies, are carried out. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The report before the Senate is the preliminary report of the Senate Standing Committee on Community Affairs into the validation of what has come to be known as CAM and SAM funding of nursing homes. Honourable senators will recall that this reference resulted from the Senate agreeing to my motion on 30 September. During the Senate debate on this motion I pointed out that the coalition was not questioning the appropriateness of conducting validations of public funding of nursing homes. As I said at that time:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, every nursing home proprietor must have an undeniable right to a timely validation that is prospectively applied in accordance with a consistently defined and interpreted set of guidelines by validation teams acting in a professional manner.</PARA>
<PARA>Although the terms of reference for the preliminary inquiry include five subparagraphs, this sentence neatly sums up the underlying objective of the Senate's reference. In its preliminary report, the committee concludes that the validation process is a crucial part of the restructuring of nursing home funding and that it is not prepared to recommend its interruption while investigations are being carried out. The coalition agrees with this conclusion. I contend that the interruption of the validation process would be more likely to exacerbate some of the problems that have been raised with me and the committee, particularly those relating to timeliness and the prospective application of funding criteria. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee concludes that it will, `maintain a watching brief on all validation matters referred to it and will report again to the Senate during the last week of the first sittings in 1994'. This means, I presume, that the committee intends to make a further report in April 1994. Given the relatively short time frame the committee has had to conduct the preliminary inquiry and the range of issues that are entailed in this reference, this is a sensible recommendation. My reading of it&mdash;and I would very much like to be corrected if it is an inaccurate reading&mdash;is that it allows those who wish to express concerns about the validation process to do so during the period up until the first period of sitting, or April of 1994. I hope Senator West or another committee member will be able to enlighten me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the committee indicates in its report, recent legislative amendments are closely related to the validation process. The mode of consideration outlined in the committee's report will allow it to take account of the impact of relevant legislation that is currently before the parliament. It is also worth pointing out that the Ombudsman is currently conducting an investigation as a result of receiving a number of complaints about nursing home validations. In addition, and as is indicated in the report, the Audit Office has also indicated that it may wish to consider validations in its audit of the aged care program. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In its preliminary report, the committee has made what it describes as preliminary comments about a number of issues relating to the specific terms of reference given to it. It is recognised in the preface to these preliminary comments that, `currently available evidence is often incomplete'. While the committee does not recommend a more detailed inquiry overall, it does, in relation to a number of issues that are referred to in its preliminary comments, state that it may wish to consider a number of matters in more detail. Rather than take the Senate's time with the detail of these preliminary comments, I urge those who are interested in this preliminary report to be become acquainted with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, it does need to be pointed out that the committee has seen fit to make one specific recommendation in this report. It has recommended that the documentation required for the substantiation of CAM and SAM funding in respect of periods when the nursing home was owned by another person be made available. This is an important recommendation which demands a response from the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of nursing home proprietors and their industry representatives have expressed concerns to me about the impact of the National Health Act secrecy provisions on verifying the accuracy of decisions made by the department. To an extent this problem emanates from the department's tardiness in validating expenditure from 1986-87 onwards. However, it must also be recognised that the legislative amendments initiated in 1992 and in 1993 will do much to overcome this problem. In the meantime it is important that the rights to natural justice of proprietors are not unnecessarily fettered by the secrecy provisions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, I wish to take this opportunity to thank the members of the committee and the staff of the committee for their efforts in relation to this preliminary inquiry. I urge the industry to continue to express its concerns in relation to nursing home validation to the Senate committee during the five months until April 1994. Finally, I urge the committee to ensure that it communicates its preliminary conclusions to the aged care industry and, in particular, the fact that it will maintain a watching brief on the matters referred to it and report during the last week of the first sittings in 1994. </PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Committee Exchange with the New Zealand Parliament</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This report deals with the visit of the Joint Committee on Corporations and Securities to New Zealand in July this year. The Committee was invited to travel to New Zealand by the New Zealand Parliament as a part of the program of regular committee exchanges between the two countries. The overall aim of the visit was to discuss the harmonisation of law between the countries, with a particular focus on corporations law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee was hosted by the New Zealand Parliament's Justice and Law Reform Select Committee and Commerce Select Committee. The Committee also took the opportunity to meet with government agencies business organisations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The discussions we held in New Zealand were very valuable. New Zealand has taken a much different approach to Australia in reforming its company law and in some ways has made more progress than Australia. I was particularly impressed by the commitment to a simplified, principled, drafting style that New Zealand has adopted and their apparently well founded confidence in the ability of the courts to understand and act upon the principles set out in legislation. In developing its new legislation New Zealand has also review many of the basic, and outdated, concepts which entered company law in the last century and whose value has never been properly re-assessed. This is a matter which we in Australia are only now addressing.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The discussions the Committee held extended far beyond company law issues. The report briefly outlines those discussion and I draw the attention of honourable senators to the report for more detail on the range of issues examined. Of course the harmonisation of business laws between different countries should extend beyond the already significant progress that has been made by Australia and New Zealand. But the success of the visit and the progress that has already been made between these two countries indicates the potential benefits to Australia of extending this process to include our trading partners in Asia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The success of a visit like this depends, to a great extent, on the organisation by the host country and the enthusiasm of the people the Committee meets. I must say that on this occasion the organisation by the Committee's hosts in New Zealand was excellent. We were able to meet with everyone we wished to and all of the arrangements went like clockwork. Everyone with whom we met extended the utmost courtesy to the Committee and the discussions we had were invariably wide ranging and interesting. I would therefore like to place on record the Committee's thanks to everyone we met in New Zealand.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I would particularly like to thank; the Honourable Robin Gray, Speaker of the House of Representatives; Mr Rob Munro and the other members and staff of the Justice and Law Reform Select Committee; Mr Wayne Kimber and the other members and staff of the Commerce Select Committee; Professor Richard Sutton of the New Zealand Law Commission; and Mr Max Simmons from the Distinguished Visitors Branch of the Department of Internal Affairs.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Securities Commission has produced a marvellously glossy annual report. If honourable senators read this annual report they would think that there was nothing wrong with corporate regulation in this country. How mistaken they would be! In this annual report the ASC seeks to trumpet some of its great achievements&mdash;for example, the regulation of corporate matters and bringing people who have defrauded the public or acted improperly to heel. On page 30 of the annual report, for example, it lists as one of its successes the prosecution of one Mr David Howe, a director of a company called Farndale Ltd. It says that he was:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . sentenced to two years imprisonment, minimum term of eight months, on charges relating to the improper use of his position to gain an advantage for Howe Corporation Pty Ltd. Solicitor, Nigel Smith, was sentenced to two years imprisonment, minimum term of nine months, for being knowingly concerned in the commission of an offence. John Campbell was fined $17,500 and ordered to perform 240 hours of community service after pleading guilty to improperly using his position as a director of the company.</PARA>
<PARA>What this annual report does not tell us is that Farndale and the Howe Corporation collapsed in 1987 and 1988 respectively; that these matters are over five years old; that the offences in question occurred before the collapse of the companies&mdash;and this is one of the great achievements of the Australian Securities Commission and, before it, the Corporate Affairs Commission!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we have here is a joke. This is not proper corporate regulation. Anybody can take a charge that relates to a matter over five years old and say it is a success because they finally got it resolved this year. The real test of the success of the Australian Securities Commission is how well it is regulating corporate misconduct at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, six months ago the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs was forced to come to this chamber and seek a reference to look into the manner in which the ASC exercises its investigative powers. We have received over 108 submissions on that inquiry and the submissions continue to come in to this day. Every week we get more submissions from people who have been aggrieved by the Australian Securities Commission. Most of those submissions are not from the crooks and the villains and the scoundrels trying to cover up what they have done; many of those submissions come from the victims of corporate misconduct whom the ASC has attacked when it should have been attacking the perpetrators of these offences in the first place. Many of those submissions come from people who had ASC officers knock on their door at 7.30 or 8 o'clock at night to deliver documents that related to their being required to appear in court the very next day to defend their own private assets from applications by the ASC to have those assets frozen. These were the victims of the rip-offs, not the perpetrators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We were supposed to have our first hearing next week in Brisbane&mdash;because of the work load of the committee this was six months after the legal and constitutional affairs committee received this reference&mdash;but it was suggested that this hearing be cancelled while we go off and have a hearing on another matter which has been referred to us at short notice. That makes me angry enough as it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But what makes me really angry is the fact that the Australian Securities Commission recently approached the secretary and other staff of our committee and sought to have a private meeting with them, not with the committee. It was told, quite correctly, that if it wanted to meet with anybody it would meet with the committee, and it would do so in public. It declined that offer. The really sad thing is that those officers of the ASC who sought to do that made the approach after having just attended a conference on the privileges of the Senate committee system, which they were forced to go to because of their previous misconduct. What did they have to say to the committee secretariat that they cannot say to the members of the committee themselves? What do they want to say about us that they do not want to say in public? The ASC is rotten right the way through. Unless I see something to the contrary, I will have to believe that. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There is a reference before the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs relating to the Australian Securities Commission. As Senator O'Chee said, the committee is still receiving submissions relating to that inquiry. As a member of that committee, I still have an open mind on the reference that the parliament has directed to that committee. I am not so certain, after hearing Senator O'Chee's comments, that the same could be said for him. On reading the submissions, I do not think all of them have come from, as he said, victims of the ASC. Most definitely not all of them have. I have not read each and every submission yet as there are over 100.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should be a little more careful when we rise in this place before we pre-empt the decisions of committees. If we are going to do that, why bother giving committees references of this nature in the first place? The Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs is one of the busiest committees in this parliament&mdash;not only in the Senate, but in the parliament itself. Senator O'Chee well knows that as a member of the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier this year the committee got involved in the budget debate which, on one particular occasion, involved four full days of hearings on matters that the Senate chose to refer to the committee. As I recall&mdash;and I may be corrected on this&mdash;the committee has six other specific references; they are not minor references. Off the top of my head, I recall the very large inquiry into the cost of justice; the inquiry into gender bias in the judiciary&mdash;another one which has evoked a lot of media and public attention; and the inquiry into the rights and obligations of the media. There are but three references, all of which are very extensive and all of which have attracted a great deal of attention and a great deal of submissions from the public generally and from interested organisations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I heard Senator O'Chee say that the meeting the committee was to have next week in Brisbane has been put off because of other matters. I do not know as yet whether a decision has been made; I know that there is some speculation that the native title legislation may be referred to this committee. The native title bill has attracted some controversy, not only in my home state of Western Australia but also in other parts of Australia. It is right and proper that standing committees of the parliament look at legislation which is attracting some attention; certainly nobody can say that the native title bill is not attracting attention. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How many sitting days are left in the rest of the year? This chamber is having a week's break followed by two weeks of sitting. This Senate standing committee has to fit in references given to it by the parliament. If that means that next week&mdash;instead of being at home looking with admiration on my new granddaughter&mdash;I will be in Brisbane or Darwin or Perth or Melbourne or somewhere else, that is the obligation I have as a member of parliament, and every other member of that committee has that obligation. That is unfortunate, but we know those things when we apply for the jobs that we have. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I rose only out of concern about the manner in which Senator O'Chee spoke. He has reached conclusions on this inquiry when we have not&mdash;as he said from his own mouth&mdash;started the public investigation. We all have our biases and our prejudices, but we should contain those to some degree prior to formulating final conclusions in a public manner such as Senator O'Chee has done. If there is truth in what he alleges, I have great confidence that this committee, which has acted in a very bipartisan manner in the past, will reach the correct conclusions and will make the right and proper recommendations to the parliament in order to correct any wrongs that may be there. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Carr's childish interjections sometimes really leave me flabbergasted. Today he has done it yet again. Having worked in the insolvency profession, I can say that most of the people who work in that profession have creditors' best interests at heart. That might be something Senator Carr has difficulty understanding, but that is a reflection on him rather than anything else. What surprises me, however, is that a very small number of liquidators seem to be bringing the profession into disrepute.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recently referred a matter to the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch), which I hope has been actioned in the interim; I am yet to hear back, but I am trying to be patient about the matter. It was a partnership dispute in Brisbane in relation to a company which was put into liquidation. At the time at which the company was put into liquidation, it had very few assets other than cash in the bank and a few debtors; that was about it. The business itself had already been sold as a going concern. There was an estimated $80,000 surplus after paying out all of the creditors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The provisional liquidators and liquidators ran rampant with the funds in this company; they acted in a very unsatisfactory fashion. For example, they spent in the vicinity of $11,000 chasing a $3,000 debt. Over 60 per cent of the money declared as debts owed to the company went in legal fees and expenses. Not only will the creditors not receive 100c in the dollar, but the provisional liquidators and liquidators together have taken $80,000 to $100,000 in fees, plus legal expenses. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When queried by a journalist in Brisbane, they said that the more the creditors fought the price of the liquidation, the less they would get. That seemed to indicate that they were going to use the funds still remaining in the administration to pay their costs in fighting the committee of inspection and the creditors of the company. That is something they are not entitled to do, but these gentlemen in question seem to have taken it upon themselves to do it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that two other insolvency professionals, both of them official liquidators, were on the committee of inspection for this company. They both thought that the costs that had been incurred in the administration were excessive and unwarranted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the good liquidators of this company were appointed, they immediately proceeded to carry out an investigation into whether there had been any voidable dispositions during the relating back period. The voidable dispositions or, rather, the undue preferences which they sought to find could not exist if the company paid 100c in the dollar to its creditors, which it was expected to do. The only way the company was not going to pay 100c in the dollar to its creditors was if the liquidators chewed up all the money themselves. It was a totally unnecessary investigation and a waste of the creditors' money. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, most of the liquidators and insolvency professionals in this country are good people who work hard and who frequently write off many of their costs and fees in order to get a good result. I am concerned that a tiny number of people are not playing by the rules. Unfortunately, the firm in question&mdash;I have not named the firm and I have not named the company; I want to highlight the size of the problem&mdash;has been referred to me on other matters with similar allegations. In those cases, I did not think it was appropriate to contact the Attorney-General, per se, about the level of costs, but I hope that the Attorney-General's Department is going to read this <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> or will be listening to this broadcast, so that it will be aware of the concerns that I am raising, and so that it will recognise that this is a serious issue. The creditors' money is at stake and this matter should not be allowed to continue in this fashion. I seek leave to continue my remarks later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to speak on treaty Nos. 14 and 15 together. They refer to exchange of notes constituting an implementing arrangement concerning plutonium transfers to the agreement with the European Atomic Energy Community&mdash;EURATOM; and, exchange of notes consisting an implementing arrangement concerning international obligation exchanges to the agreement with the European Atomic Energy Community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The two agreements between Australia and the European Atomic Energy Community, or EURATOM, relate to safety and safeguard measures associated with Australian sourced radioactive material. The agreement associated with plutonium appears to tighten up deficiencies concerning arrangements associated with the retransfer of plutonium. This plutonium is recovered from spent fuel reprocessed at La Hague and Sellafield in England. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would appear that the plutonium agreement changes the concept of advanced generic consent to advanced consent on the retransfer of consignments of plutonium from Europe to Japan. The agreement now makes it necessary for advance consent to be given for specific shipments of plutonium. Previous plutonium could be simply retransferred, based on arrangements contained within earlier agreements. The lack of consent over specific shipments technically prevented Australia from stepping in at any particular point and stopping the retransfer of plutonium to Japan unless it had good cause to suspect that the safeguard obligations were not being fulfilled. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Whilst the agreement tightens up certain aspects of plutonium transfers, it does nothing to stop this trade. I understand that the Japanese are currently storing the last shipment of plutonium that they took receipt of. It has not gone for immediate use in the Minju fast breeder reactor. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact that Japan has moved into the plutonium economy and that it is currently storing its plutonium creates alarming signals within the region. This is creating significant regional instability. The accumulation of plutonium by Japan is being used in part as an excuse by north Korea not to allow full safeguard inspections. North Korea appears to be saying that it is hypocritical to concentrate on its facilities whilst at the same time condoning Japan's plutonium accumulation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would appear that the plutonium agreement has been precipitated by the possibility that the next shipment to Japan will contain plutonium originated from the use of Australian uranium. Australia supplies 15 per cent of Japan's uranium. In essence, this means that Australian uranium may well end up as plutonium stockpiled in Japan. We are, in effect, contributing to the instability of northern Asia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On top of the security risk, the movement of highly radioactive spent fuel from Japan to Europe and back again as plutonium puts a large percentage of the world at risk from a serious accident. No agreement will eliminate the enormous risk to regional security or eliminate the hazards associated with the shipment of highly radioactive material. The best way that Australia can contribute to reducing these risks is to stop selling uranium and to encourage other nations to develop a future based on renewable and environmentally benign sources of energy. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will speak to treaties Nos 16 and 21. Firstly, I will deal with the convention for the conservation of southern bluefin tuna. The Western Australian Greens acknowledges the need to develop urgent measures to conserve viable populations of the southern bluefin tuna. Unfortunately, we do not believe that this convention will fulfil that need or that the current government has any intention of honouring it.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The current southern bluefin tuna stock is drastically depleted. Sadly, this reflects the state of all of Australia's major commercial fisheries. The recently tabled report of the Australian, Japanese and New Zealand scientists on southern bluefin tuna found:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The continued very low abundance of the parental biomass is cause for serious biological concern.</PARA>
<PARA>It continues:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The new biological information indicates that recruitment declined during the early 1980's to about 50% of the 1980 level by 1985, and this low level has continued for at least 2 more years to 1987.</PARA>
<PARA>We should take serious notice when scientists make this type of statement. Regrettably, we believe that this convention will do very little to protect this species from a further decline in numbers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The language of the convention still contains the outmoded terminology found in the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea. Clause 3 of this convention refers to the term `optimum utilisation'. Senators may remember that Senator Coulter and I drew attention to this outmoded term in our statements relating to the Maritime Legislation Amendment Bill that was passed in the Senate last week. The term `optimum utilisation' has been used by countries throughout the world to justify the over-utilisation of fish stocks. Unless multi-species assessments are made and incorporated in management plans which are based upon an ecosystem approach, the southern bluefin tuna has a pretty grim future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Further, the convention does very little to ensure that methods used to catch southern bluefin tuna do not adversely affect other species. A recent documentary on the ABC graphically depicted the tragic effects of long-line fishing on bird species, particularly rare species of the albatross. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, these conventions are only as good as the government's will to implement them. Less than a month after this convention was signed by the Australian government, the Minister for Resources, Michael Lee, granted an additional 100 tonnes of tuna to the Australian fishing industry over and above the agreed quota established by the parties to this convention. This is an appalling act of hypocrisy by the Labor government as it totally contravenes the intent of this convention. It certainly does not auger well for the tuna. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also wish to refer to treaty No. 21, which is the agreement establishing the south pacific regional environment program. The WA Greens welcome the signing of the agreement, which establishes the south pacific regional environment program as an organisation in its own right. During the 10-year period of its operation, SPREP has been a most effective regional organisation at working towards protecting the environment in the south pacific. Its newfound independence should give it greater scope to develop further measures to protect the environment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a member of SPREP, Australia has a key role to play in the region. It is the most industrialised nation in the region and, among other things, has a special role in developing strategies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Australia should work closely with the OECD members of SPREP, the US, UK and France to ensure that they develop strict measures to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">South pacific nations have the most to fear from sea level rise and increased weather disturbance caused by the greenhouse effect. The south pacific nations have made repeated calls for a timetable for reductions starting immediately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the most recent intergovernmental negotiating session on the climate convention, Australia's stance on reducing greenhouse gases appeared to slip behind the initiatives of other nations. The Auditor-General's report, tabled in parliament this year, highlighted the lack of action being undertaken by the Australian government on this issue. This must be extremely worrying for our pacific island neighbours. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Earlier this year, Papua New Guinea tabled a proposal to prohibit hazardous waste imports into the region. The Australian government has lobbied for a much weaker position. The WA Greens believe that this is totally unacceptable. Pacific nations should not become the dumping ground for the industrialised world. Already we have seen the pacific used for nuclear testing by the French and toxic waste incineration by the US. It is time that countries like Australia take a strong stand towards protecting this unique corner of the world. Hopefully, the signing of the south pacific regional environment program agreement signals a more responsible approach by the Australian government in the future. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to the last two treaties on the list, which deal with two of the three committees on human rights. As a result of a decision by the Keating government, these committees have the right to hear Australian domestic disputes. I am on the record on a number of occasions as pointing out that it was a bad decision to overturn the philosophy of the Australia Act and to allow Australian domestic disputes to go to UN committees. If we happen to not feel that the independence and sovereignty of our nation is a key issue and believe that it is appropriate for UN committees to involve themselves in Australian domestic activities, we have to make sure that those UN committees are appropriately structured to deal with Australian disputes. These two treaties mention two of the three committees to which Australians can now take domestic disputes after going through the various internal arrangements.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the reasons for raising this point is that I do not believe these committees are appropriately structured to play any role in the Australian legal system. I am given some comfort for that view by another report which is currently on the agenda&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">World conference on human rights</EMPHASIS>. This report was written after the Vienna conference which was held on 14 to 25 June this year. It is a very interesting report in which Senator Gareth Evans gives an extensive summary of his view of activities. There are also various reports filed by individual members of parliament, including Senator Harradine and Mr Ruddock. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the points to come out of that conference was the divergence of views in the world on human rights. There were differences of opinion on how particular rights should be interpreted and which rights were more important than others. That is a very important debate. In some countries some rights are considered to be more culturally determined. A lot of countries at that conference were said to be very unhappy with the sorts of views that western societies like Australia were putting forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These committees contain the nominees of a wide variety of countries, many of which, unfortunately, are either not free or only partly free. The human rights cases which emerge from Australia will be interpreted by people whose particular views of human rights are nowhere in line with the views of mainstream Australia or even the views of Senator Evans. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This report demonstrates that concern. For example, on page 5 of the report that Senator Evans tabled today, it states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . civil and political rights, and that at the national level governments have a responsibility to implement effective development policies.</PARA>
<PARA>The report goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, there are still wide differences, even among Western countries, on the relative importance, definition and implementation of economic, social and cultural rights, and it is clear that this area will be a major focus of the human rights debate in future years.</PARA>
<PARA>What the government has done is to throw open the Australian legal system in a significant area to committees which are bitterly divided on how we define human rights, how particular rights have preference over other rights and how we strike a balance between those rights. That is why I say it was a very bad decision by the Keating government to overturn the philosophy of the Australia Act. If members of the government believe that it is appropriate for UN committees to involve themselves in Australian activities, then they have to focus on how these particular committees are composed. <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

I believe it is good that Australia at times subjects itself to international scrutiny. If this scrutiny is from established international bodies, I think that would serve us well.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the criticism about the matter to which I have referred was made to my committee it was said that Australia was constantly being criticised by international forums because of the way we reacted and treated people in this area. When we followed this matter through with questioning we were not able to get evidence of which nations were criticising Australia. We were also unable to find out which conferences were criticising Australia. The recent human rights conference would have been the ideal forum at which to raise this matter but it did not make the agenda. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Through further investigation and questioning, we found that criticisms of this country had been made at international levels. Much to my horror&mdash;and we will talk about this in more detail at a later time&mdash;we found that that criticism was actually being made by Australian non-government organisations abroad. It saddens me somewhat to think that people, many of whom are being financed by the Australian taxpayer to participate in human rights forums, would go overseas and seek to make a name for themselves and elevate themselves in the community by criticising their own country. </PARA>

I will read the report from the human rights conference and I hope that Senator Bourne, who was an adviser to the conference, will give the Senate more information about what went on in Vienna earlier this year. I think they are very useful forums. As I said earlier, I think it is good that Australia from time to time subjects itself, within limitations, to international scrutiny so that we can have a better measurement of how we are performing. </PARA>

The reluctance that I feel about it, whilst it is uncommon here, is not uncommon in the community, particularly in the wool industry itself. I think there are a lot of growers who look with great trepidation at what is about to happen to their industry. A lot of growers say, `Look, this is the return that we need just to break even.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I was a parliamentary adviser at the UN World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna this year. I found it an immensely valuable learning experience. We see the workings of this parliament as being complicated, intricate and convoluted, as indeed they are, but they are absolutely straightforward when compared with the United Nations. Sitting at the conference watching the way the United Nations works and the way different people reacted to other people at a personal and country level was absolutely fascinating. I must say that I would not have missed it for the world.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before this conference started, the fear of many human rights organisations was that it could be hijacked by the least enlightened countries and that the basic tenets of human rights could be eroded. We all feared a diminution of the impact of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and of the associated covenants. That is only possible, of course, because at conferences such as this everything has to be done by consensus. If one single government in the world does not agree with any statement, that statement is not included in the final conference declaration. The pressure on governments&mdash;some governments&mdash;to at least look as though they believe human rights must be upheld has to be immense and it has to be constant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There were four preparatory conferences in which officials of all the governments involved attempted to write a draft of what would become the final statement of this conference. By all accounts, these four preparatory conferences were extremely difficult, as would be expected with a subject such as this. The document which was argued over at the UN world conference itself was full of statements which had not yet been agreed on, and many of them were contradictory. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We ended up with a declaration which is not too bad. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights has been totally upheld, as have the associated covenants. The universality of human rights was acknowledged. The push by some countries to declare the rights of the community to be paramount over the rights of the individual was successfully averted. The rights of women and the rights of children were declared to be equal in every way to the rights of men. This may seem self-evident to us here in Australia, but it most certainly is not in much of the world. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The use of rape as a deliberate act of war has now been condemned in no uncertain terms by the international community. The rights of indigenous peoples have been acknowledged, even though only in a preliminary manner. The issue of peoples&mdash;with the `s' on the end&mdash;was the item at the conference which caused the most controversy. Australia, I am proud to say, was one of the countries which supported most strongly that it should be `peoples' with an `s'&mdash;taken by other countries to mean races&mdash;and not just individual indigenous people. We pushed that very hard. We lost it this time, but that is just one of the battles, not the war. I hope we will continue to be one of the countries in strongest support of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This document includes the three speeches that were given on behalf of Australia at the conference. The first was given by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Senator Gareth Evans). I have to say that I do not think it is too exciting, but it is not too bad. I always tend to look at our foreign ministers' speeches in the way that I look at all other foreign ministers' speeches. I thought that in this one he came a bit closer to my point of view, and I was pleased to see that. To give him credit, he was the only one who actually offered a significant amount of money&mdash;$300,000&mdash;for strengthening the domestic infrastructures which support human rights in other countries. Nobody else, not one other government at that conference, offered any money to do anything. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second speech included in the report is by our Ambassador to the UN in Geneva, Penny Wensley. It is very strong on women's rights and the rights of all vulnerable groups in the world. I recommend it. It is an excellent speech. Ms Wensley was an excellent leader of the delegation when the foreign minister left. He was a very energetic leader and a very good leader while he was there. Penny was also very good. The third speech is by Mrs Lois O'Donoghue of ATSIC. It is a very strong statement of what we have got wrong and what we have got right in indigenous people's rights. It is balanced and it is fair. I certainly recommend that one to everyone. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, I congratulate all the members of the Australian delegation for their very hard work in achieving the result we did. The hours were long, the pressure on everyone was strong and constant, and the whole thing was very difficult, but they did a magnificent job. They are all listed in the report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This conference was not the disaster many of us feared it could be.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak to this report for two reasons&mdash;to commend the report and also to draw to honourable senators' notice some of the material in regard to the Genetic Manipulation Advisory Committee, which I have spoken on in previous debates. In terms of new developments in genetic research and its application, there are significant advances in research in Australia and some early experimentation overseas which indicate that proposals for gene therapy on humans&mdash;that is, the introduction of genetic material into humans after birth which does not affect the germline&mdash;may come in the very near future.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This committee will be looking at the challenges of the coming year, which will see continuing changes in technology and an increasing interest in human gene therapy proposals. I commend the Genetic Manipulation Advisory Committee, which is composed of a large number of people. Besides scientists, the committee includes members from the wider non-scientific community with backgrounds in fields such as law, philosophy and environmental issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I commend to honourable senators a book which was published earlier this year called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Predicting </EMPHASIS><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">the Future</EMPHASIS> because, in the part dealing with medicine, it mentions that the big challenges that lie ahead of us really are in relation to the ethics of genetic manipulation. The deliberate insertion of DNA&mdash;deoxyribonucleic acid&mdash;into human germline cells whence it could be passed on into children is banned in Australia. One compelling reason for this is that there is no logical use for such an approach in the treatment of human diseases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The primary issue with the insertion of foreign DNA into a human subject is the effect upon the patient. Other applications include the insertion of DNA as a marker of the fate of certain classes of cells in the bodies of patients with cancer, the insertion of cloned genes into white blood cells to increase the vigour of their attack upon cancer cells, and the insertion of RNA&mdash;ribonucleic acid&mdash;into cells to break down genes causing cancer or to attack viruses causing diseases such as AIDS. The ethics of this is, properly, a part of the considerations of the Australian Health Ethics Committee, which takes into account these additional applications of nucleic acid insertion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I rise tonight to bring that to the attention of honourable senators. Part of that is also part of the human genome project, where all the genes on the human cell are being documented around the world. It is a huge effort, primarily on behalf of the Americans, the British and the French. Something like $15,000 million is being spent on this. It will affect everybody in this chamber and every Australian. It is approaching us with a rapidity that is not appreciated by the community at large. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to record these comments within the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of the Senate, at least to draw this situation to the attention of people outside the scientific community, so that some thought can be given to the actual ethical aspects of these things that are going on around us. I think that science is outstripping the community at large in its consideration of the issues as they will affect the average person. I commend the Genetic Manipulation Advisory Committee&mdash;both its chairman, Emeritus Professor Millis, and the members of the committee itself&mdash;for the great work it is doing in this regard. I am sure that the government will continue its funding in the future. </PARA>

I do not want to repeat what Senator Herron has said because I agree with him very strongly, having spent five and a half years on the Queensland University of Technology ethics committee with a growing apprehension about the use of genetic material, particularly that obtained, for instance, through procedures such as in-vitro fertilisation, embryo transplants and spare embryos. I attended some conferences whilst I was on that ethics committee and saw the technology which is now so far ahead not only of the ethical debate but also of the legal debate.

The Greens WA are deeply concerned by this. The potential harm to humans and Australia's biological diversity from an unregulated release of a genetically modified organism is too great a risk to be bound by voluntary guidelines.

<PARA>My motion concerns the rather silly decision of the government to close HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS>, HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Encounter</EMPHASIS> and HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Moreton</EMPHASIS>, whilst Senator Calvert's deals specifically with HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS> and raises the same protest. Apart from general comments on the three bases, my comments will particularly relate to the base in South Australia, HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Encounter</EMPHASIS>, and also the base in Tasmania, HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS>, and I think my colleague Senator MacGibbon, from Queensland, will make some specific comments in relation to HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Moreton</EMPHASIS> in Brisbane, with which he is very familiar. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This decision was announced by the government some little time ago and came as something of a surprise to us because the navy in each of the three states&mdash;South Australia, Tasmania and Queensland&mdash;has had a long and proud history. These bases have served Australia's interests well and they seem to still be serving worthwhile functions. Just to mention a few, those with which we are very familiar: to conduct the representational functions of the navy; to support naval reserves and naval cadet reserve forces; to provide personnel and family services; and to administer the RAN and allied ship visits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also an aspect that I think is very much underestimated by this government, and that relates to the place of these bases in terms of naval traditions and culture, something which is very meaningful to naval people. Certainly I know it from the many dozens of South Australian ex-servicemen and women who have spoken to me in relation to HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Encounter</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I suppose in some ways I should declare an interest in that it was at that base, in the old drill hall that this government is planning to sell off, that my father signed up in the Second World War, as did so many of his mates, many of whom did not return. It is just an example of how that particular base in South Australia means a great deal not only to the ex-service personnel but also their families. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I witnessed it personally in attending a memorial service there a couple of months ago. I was surprised by the literally hundreds of ex-service personnel who were present representing many different naval groupings. They demonstrated by their presence and what they said to me how important it is to them, particularly in terms of the memories of lost mates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So important was it in fact that some years ago they set up a memorial garden in HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Encounter</EMPHASIS> and there are plaques there representing each of the ships from which they served out of Adelaide, and from time to time people go back there for services to remember the dead. So it really does have a place in the hearts and minds of people who have been associated with the navy in South Australia. The thought of demolition of the old drill hall, or even removal of their memorial garden, is something that distresses them greatly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think the government, as I said, has properly appreciated that fact and our bringing this motion on tonight gives the minister an opportunity, I hope, to give it further consideration. I witnessed it when I went down to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS> in Tasmania a few weeks ago and again talked to former naval personnel about that particular rather beautiful site and facility. I received expressions of the same sentiment of how it is associated with the naval tradition that has been so much a part of Hobart and how disappointed people would be if in fact that tradition disappeared. That spirit becomes relevant to the issue of the naval reserves and the naval cadet reserve forces because if these functions are transferred to what will simply be regarded as a central military establishment away from the sea or the rivers, it simply does not seem to attract the same interest for those who want to serve in a naval function. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the government's decision to transfer these reserve and cadet facilities to what it refers to as `defence centrals' in each of the states will have the effect of providing a disincentive to young and older people who want to contribute service in this voluntary way. I have little doubt that that will be the case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having seen these bases operating and noting that they seem to be making a worthwhile contribution, let me turn to the reasons given by the government for the decision to close them. The primary reason given seemed to be a financial one. There also were some vague reasons and the minister might attempt to respond to them tonight. We are told that, out of this process of moving the navy into a non-naval base, greater efficiencies will result. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, Mr Deputy President, I put to you that both those arguments simply do not seem to stand analysis. Firstly, in relation to costs, it was suggested in the first instance before the estimates hearings that the gross costs in relation to the bases would in fact be savings. I specifically refer to the evidence of Commodore Ritchie, given before Estimates Committee B on 3 September. On page B67, he is reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I referred to the annual cost for <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Moreton</EMPHASIS> as approximately $1.3 million, $700,000 for <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS> and roughly the same for <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Encounter</EMPHASIS>. Those costs do not include the salaries of personnel located at those bases. The savings we hope to accrue are those costs because they are the operating costs of the bases. We will not accrue savings from the salaries . . . </PARA>
<PARA>When one started to do an analysis of this, the position was found to be quite blurred. The government, in relation to each base, was abandoning certain functions&mdash;and that is admitted; particularly the use of a patrol boat for reserve training. But those functions were to go whether the bases were retained or not. So any savings associated with that change of function are not savings that can be attributed to the closure of the bases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we looked at what other functions might be included within the savings figure, we found that the other principal functions in relation to the bases were to be transferred to amorphous bodies known as `defence central'. So, if a recruiting officer is transferred from one of the naval bases to defence central, again there is no saving being made. It was said again that, with real effort, it was found there was some duplication and that perhaps some of the positions could be dispensed with. But they could be dispensed with in any event without closing the base. So that is not really a valid saving either. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we were told that there are savings that would be associated with the cost of keeping the bases. But that is now in a state of some confusion also because <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS>, as we understand from the subsequent estimates committee, is now not to be sold by the government. So, at Commonwealth expense, it still has to be maintained. I think it was suggested that it might be put out for DEET to occupy. Whether it is Defence Force or another government administration, there will not be a saving in costs associated with maintenance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So where are the savings? As I have said, when we start to analyse the figures that were blandly put in the first estimates committee, the savings quickly become illusory. In fact, when we got to the subsequent estimates committee hearing on 10 November, the supplementary hearings, on page B197 Commodore Ritchie is reported as saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I cannot tell you what the dollar savings would be.</PARA>
<PARA>So we started off some months before when it was suggested that something like $2.7 million might be saved&mdash;and let us put that in the context of a Defence budget of about $10 billion; but, anyway, $2.7 million is nevertheless a significant sum of money. But, by the time we got to the supplementary estimates, that seemed to have disappeared. We have the astonishing situation that neither the navy nor the government could tell the committee what savings would be achieved at all. As I said, when we start to look at the functions that are being transferred, what the government is intending to do with the specific bases, it is hard to find the answer anywhere. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;In response to the resolution of the Senate relating to the return to order, I table an index of and documents in relation to the resolution of the Senate concerning the Australian Artists' Creative Fellowships. They are pretty self-explanatory. We have had a substantial debate about it; I do not want to have another.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will speak briefly to this matter. Firstly, with regard to the question of the applications, honourable senators would know that I had some concern about that resolution. Nevertheless, I acknowledge that it was carried over my opposition and I have sought to act in accordance with the spirit of it. I do not pretend to be the world's expert on all the details of information privacy principle 11 but I understand, on advice, that it does have this aspect concerning what can be disclosed with the agreement of the individual concerned. I will seek the leave of the Senate to respond in accordance with that letter later, but I table the letter. It seems to me to comply with the information privacy principle and the spirit of the Senate's request, and probably enables the concerns which I have to be met. We will see what the answer is, but I think it will. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I table all the other documents that are listed there. For the sake of completeness, I advise the Senate that there are two cabinet minutes which, in accordance with the normal procedures, are not tabled. But I assure the Senate that there are no additional facts or information in those. There are merely reiterations of information in the documents which I have tabled. I have decided, on examination of the particular circumstances of this case, to table the addresses of the people concerned given the nature of that information. I do not think it causes any privacy problems or any problems to those individuals. That is not an indication that in the normal course I would wish to do that for the reasons I have previously outlined. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are some additional documents relating to the appointments. They do not add any new information but they are reiterations of and an outline of the process. I confirm what I said in the debate about the resolution itself that there are no minutes. The report of the meeting is in the form of a report by the meeting to the Australia Council, but it has all the information necessary for the Senate to be able to assess the decisions of that panel. So I cannot literally comply with that resolution because it relates to a document that does not exist. It provides the information that was sought but in a different form. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only thing is for me&mdash;and this is probably the easiest way to do it but I am open to advice about process&mdash;to seek the leave of the Senate to respond further to part 1 of the resolution relating to the applications by Mr Tozer on the next sitting day, when I will have had the chance to have a response from Mr Tozer to the letter which I have written to him seeking his agreement to table such documents. If there is another process for me to do that in a way that does not literally comply but is consistent with the Senate's wishes, I will be happy to go through it, but if I could have the leave of the Senate to comply on the next sitting day, I would greatly appreciate it. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That the Senate take note of the documents.</PARA>
<PARA>It was on Monday of this week that I gave notice of a motion in this place which asked for the same documents mentioned in the motion that we are discussing now. In that motion I asked for information that Mr Tozer had given in his application for his first fellowship and the second fellowship. Subsequently, I think I am correct in saying that we amended that motion to address the privacy concerns that Senator McMullan had expressed. When he found himself unable to or unwilling to table the documents we had asked for, we had an order of the Senate for this afternoon. That is because I would like to see this cleared up. I think it ought to be cleared up for everyone concerned, including all those people who served on the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate, and I will keep reiterating, that I am not in any way casting aspersions on Mr Tozer's ability as a pianist or his qualifications to earn or to be awarded a scholarship. Nor am I casting aspersions on the people who accepted the invitation from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). What I am saying is that it is a little odd that the then Treasurer nominated seven people and recommended them to the minister for the arts, and then the minister for the arts recommended them to the Prime Minister. It seems to me that it would have been more appropriate for the minister for the arts, in discussion with the arts community, to have nominated people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may well have been that we came up with the same list. I am not casting aspersions on those people. I have had letters from those people. I want to put on the public record that there was concern in the arts community that there were personal associations between one awardee in particular and some of the people on the committee. Whenever a group of people from the arts community gets together, it is highly likely that some of the people on the committee will know some of the applicants. It is almost unavoidable. We would expect that those people would declare their association&mdash;whether it be personal, professional or whatever else&mdash;to the committee. The committee would make a judgment about whether that level of association causes it to question whether that person should participate in the awarding of the particular scholarship associated with the person that the committee member knows. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the people who has written to me said that they actually did that, but we do not know that because there are no minutes. I take on good faith that that was done. But, as Senator McMullan told us earlier today, there were no minutes of that first meeting where $1.4 million was expended. I do not understand why there are no minutes. I do not know whether it was because of the timing, and the Australia Council had not taken over the full responsibility of that committee or whether it had not come fully under the umbrella and therefore it did not have a secretariat. It is of great concern to the arts community and to the rest of the community when $1.4 million of taxpayers' money is expended and we do not have any minutes. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;At the meeting at which it was made, the Australia Council meeting, it was minuted, and you have got that. That is where the money was spent.

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="LI4">Senator PATTERSON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The concerns that I have expressed need to be resolved. Recommendations were made at a meeting and yet there are no minutes of that meeting where recommendations are made. We ought to be able to see the process whereby those recommendations were made to the Australia Council. But minutes were not made; I do not know why, but they were not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Had the minister come in here when I asked the question and said to me, `I do not have the details', as some ministers do, `I will go away and find out', had he come in here and said, `This is how the committee was appointed'&mdash;which would have stunned and surprised me, but anyway&mdash;had he said, `This is what happened; I have checked with the people who are involved and they have indicated to me that any possible conflict of interest had been expressed', this matter would have been resolved. But as it drags on because the minister does not seem to be able to comply with the order of the Senate, it makes it difficult for me, it makes it difficult for the artists concerned&mdash;all of whom had grants&mdash;and it makes it difficult for the people on the committee, and I know they are voluntary people who have given up enormous amounts of time and who have expertise in their particular areas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Tozer got a second fellowship of a considerable amount of money. Irrespective of what Senator McMullan said, it is a significant amount of money&mdash;for many artists a large amount of money. Many artists would like $65,000 a year. Mr Tozer got a second award. The terms and conditions and guidelines of the fellowships indicate that the awards will be given under exceptional circumstances. Given the prestige of these awards and given the nature of the awards and the amount of money involved, we ought to know what those exceptional circumstances were. If the minister can tell us what those exceptional circumstances were, that might put our concerns to rest. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot see any reason why the minister cannot comply; it is an order of the Senate. To write to Mr Tozer and say to him, `To assist me in this matter I would appreciate your advice as to any objections you may have to the disclosure of any information contained in your applications of 1989 and 1993 for the grant of the creative fellowships' does not indicate to Mr Tozer that I have asked for all personal information to be eliminated from that application. What I have asked for is the purpose for which he applied for the two grants. That is the detail I wanted. Instead of complying with the order of the Senate, the minister seeks advice from Mr Tozer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Citizens have a right not to have their personal business exposed publicly, but I am not asking to expose anything in public; I am asking for the reasons Mr Tozer gave. One of the reasons he gave is that he was going to start up a music school in the long run, he said, or `in the distant future' it tells us in the report of the decision to give the first award. The music school has not eventuated. He may have achieved the first part, doing recordings of little known composers, which was one of the aims, if I remember correctly, and the other aims he set out, but he did not achieve the aims of the first fellowship. One would query the giving of a second one. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But, short of suspending standing orders and short of pursuing this and appearing unreasonable&mdash;I do not think it is unreasonable to ask for it&mdash;I guess one would say that we will wait until 6 December. I would like to have had it over and done with tonight, cleared up, so I could actually talk to the people involved and this issue would be finished, possibly. But Senator McMullan obviously does not feel that is the appropriate way to go. I think it is&mdash;for us to see the documents and to get it over and done with. I ask Senator McMullan to reconsider the request that the documents be presented, in order for him to comply. I will not force that issue, but I think it would be appropriate to get it cleared up and over and done with and not have it hanging around for another week until we sit again. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS>, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Encounter</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Moreton</EMPHASIS>. Notice of motion No. 429, which was mine, refers to the closure of three bases; 440, which was Senator Calvert's, deals specifically with HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS>. I was saying that the case had to be made out by the government and that the case was going to be cost savings and/or improvement in the efficiency of the defence force. I was dealing specifically with the issue of what savings would result from the closures. I had said that not even the Navy in the estimates hearings was able to indicate that savings would actually flow; it was certainly not able to indicate the quantum of savings that would flow. I had just gone through the fact that by the time one transfers functions to another base&mdash;and in some instances the Commonwealth continues to hold the property, in any event&mdash;the savings are largely illusory.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So if the case is not going to be made out on the basis of cost savings, then presumably the government is going to say that the efficiencies that occur out of the closure, that the improvement in some way of the Australian Defence Force as a result of the closure, other than cost savings, is the basis for its decision. I would be interested to hear the minister's argument, but I have not heard an argument to date that I find at all convincing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of the wharves demonstrates the fallacy of this argument that if one removes the Navy to a central defence centre then in some ways it operates more effectively or more efficiently. To do that one takes the Navy away from its wharves. It was interesting in relation to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Encounter</EMPHASIS> in Adelaide that the view of the Navy in Adelaide was that the decision of the government was that, although the administration part of the base would be sold, the wharf would not be sold because it was essential to Navy's operations. The Navy understood that from it was to be based HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Protector</EMPHASIS>, which was going to be used in the working up trials of the new Collins class submarine used by the reserves and by the cadets. So the Navy informed us that the decision was that the wharf would be kept as essential for its purposes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then when we get to the estimates committee we find from the minister that the decision of the government was that the wharf would be sold as well. One of the advantages of an estimates committee is that one can then move from the minister to the senior naval officer present. When an explanation was sought from him as to the contradictory advice that we were now receiving from the minister and from Navy, we got the somewhat unusual answer, `The Navy is actually making a submission to the minister that we keep the wharf because we, the Navy, see it as'&mdash;I am paraphrasing&mdash;`basically of great value'. When I went down to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS> in Tasmania I got the distinct impression that the Navy again sees the wharf facility as of particular value. It should not come as a surprise to hear that the Navy regards its access to the sea as important to its operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think there may well be submissions from the Navy to the Minister for Defence (Senator Robert Ray) in relation to the wharf at Huon in Hobart. Where is the advantage in efficiency or effectiveness of the Defence Force that flows from this change? There is certainly no advantage or efficiency to the Navy. So far, with respect, the government has failed to make out grounds for such an advantage or efficiency in terms of the Defence Force as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will conclude my remarks as I know my colleagues also wish to speak on this issue, namely, Senator MacGibbon in relation to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Moreton</EMPHASIS> and Senator Calvert in relation to <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS>. I wanted to conclude by mentioning my concern about the memorial garden at <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Encounter</EMPHASIS> in Adelaide. I put to the minister at the estimates committee that the local federal Labor member, Mr Sawford, had given certain undertakings to the naval community in Adelaide that if it was not able to secure another place for its memorial, the government had made a decision that it would be protected in its current location. Specifically, in a press release, he said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If agreement cannot be reached on a suitable location to secure the garden future, the Navy is committed to ensuring that appropriate provisions are incorporated into the conditions of sale of the property.</PARA>
<PARA>He said that he had the minister's authority to say that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we questioned the minister in the estimates committee on that&mdash;I am paraphrasing the minister, but I think correctly&mdash;he basically said that no such undertaking had been given. The local naval community&mdash;I hesitate to use the word `heavy'&mdash;has been almost heavy to accept relocation of the site. It is certainly against its wishes, but it has been told that it has no other choice and it has to accept it. Now there is further distress in that it was told from the start that if it had to be relocated, the Commonwealth government, through Navy, would be prepared to bear the total cost of that relocation. It is now told that it has to be moved but it has to share the cost of the relocation. Again, it feels let down. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not the way to build the morale of a defence community in any city. It is typical of what seems to have been the muddle of this whole decision making process. Announcements were made on the basis of savings. The savings proved to be illusory&mdash;the work had not been done to calculate and demonstrate such savings. Now it looks as though they do not exist at all. There has been confusion over how the functions of Navy would operate if the base functions were moved to the administrative centres, so much so that we have disputes between Navy and the minister as to what will happen to the wharves. The whole thing appears to have been an almighty shambles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bottom line is that the government can do what it likes. If it announces that it will close the bases, it can close the bases. Nevertheless, the Australian people and the parliament are entitled to hear a convincing case from the government for the course of action it has chosen to adopt. So far we have heard no such convincing case. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am only talking about general business; I am not saying that we have had no defence debates in this chamber. I would be very foolish if I said that. Instead of picking one of the bigger issues about the important destiny of defence, the opposition has picked an issue in which it believes an unpopular decision of government can milk out a fair deal of electoral mileage. There is no running away from that; there is good electoral mileage in this for the opposition and for other minor parties.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not unusual that one would receive representations when it involves a base closure. It would not surprise anyone to learn that the honourable member for Denison, Mr Duncan Kerr, has on several occasions made representations about this issue to me, as one of the bases is in his electorate. When people accuse us of political bias, I think&mdash;I stand to be corrected by honourable senators here&mdash;that all three base closures are in Labor electorates. People accuse us of in some ways skewing defence priorities for political purposes. This is hardly a stand out example of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say at the beginning that I agree with one aspect of Senator Hill's contribution&mdash;when he said that the traditions of the Navy and the defence forces are important. The decision to close these bases is not a reflection by this government on those serving servicemen and women who have served in these bases in the past. I do not think it has been asserted in a direct sense that it is, but for the record's sake, let me say that I believe many who served in these particular bases served their country well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I recall receiving a letter recently from the Premier of Tasmania wondering whether a Tasmanian town could adopt <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Anzac</EMPHASIS>, the first Anzac ship. Whilst that matter has yet to be progressed, I did not remember his pointing out that of the six Collins class submarines, three are named after Tasmanians, which does honour in one way the traditions of the contribution that Tasmania has made in a naval sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This decision is essentially about what I regard as the effective use of the defence dollar. In all of Senator Hill's contribution tonight, in which he nitpicked around the edges, he did not put forward to my satisfaction any reason why these bases should continue, what vital purpose they serve or what vital contribution they make to the modern Navy. That is not in any way seeking to derogate from what they may have done in the past. That aspect was notably absent from Senator Hill's speech. He talked about traditions, he questioned savings and made all these other points, but he did not say what massive useful purpose or real purpose the three bases that are to close will have for the future effectiveness of the Navy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Why was the decision made to chose HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon, Encounter </EMPHASIS>and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Moreton</EMPHASIS>? Essentially, no defence force remains static. We are investing in new bases and new facilities around Australia. The implication of that, given the strategic priorities in the north and west, does not mean that we retain every existing defence facility that we have had for decades. I wonder what the local members would think if I had to ring them up and say, `We weren't going to invest some money in Stirling, Scherger, Tindal or in redoing the barracks at Townsville, et cetera. I am sorry, we can't do that because bases in other electorates are saying they have to be funded or continue to be funded at a current level and we can't redirect resources at all'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am certain that if the other solution is simply to do that but spend some extra money out of government revenue, the Democrats would not take such a benign attitude to this issue. They have often said that they want defence expenditure reduced by $1 billion to $2 billion, which is very much in line with what the Greens would like. I will come back to that later. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The real rub of this matter and the real hypocrisy in this chamber is with the Liberal-National party coalition. It says time and again in the budget debate, `We don't want you to put up any revenue measures. We believe that the debt reduction strategy that this government has undertaken is a question of reducing expenditure. We really believe that you should be reducing government outlays by $8 billion a year'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This may seem passing strange, especially to my colleague Senator Carr who has heard Senator Tierney get up here on many occasions saying that he wants more money for university libraries and more money for university places; the other day it was more money for Aboriginal things. Those sorts of statements are replicated across the board by most of those who sit opposite. They want extra funding in individual cases, but they want some massive macro cut. Here is the rub: where should the cut occur? The Liberals are very much in favour of macro reduction of expenditure. Every time we put forward a micro suggestion as to where it should occur, they say that it is not in the public interest; or that it is against the states' interests; and, that we really should not be cutting that particular area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we really press them, the only squawk I have heard out of those opposite is that we should not build the new foreign affairs building at Barton. They are not taking into account the cost of refurbishment of existing buildings and the cost of building other new buildings if something is not done about it. That is the one white elephant they can point at. They pointed out that it was going to cost $190 million; it has come down $40 million in the meantime, but let that go through to the keeper. That is basically the opposition's position. It does not believe in any of the micro cuts one has to make to reach a macro target. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The fact is that from 1987 to 1993 the defence budget has been kept in real terms. As a result of this year's budget, which I regard as somewhat regrettable, defence expenditure will be reduced by two per cent over the next four years. Therefore, and anticipating in 1991 that we could not expect a real increase in defence expenditure, the Department of Defence has undertaken some of the most radical reforms of any government department in this country: the force structure review, the logistic review, the regional review, and the ready reserves. We have put these efficiencies in so that we can generate sufficient savings to keep our capital equipment program going and not only to maintain capability but to enhance capability overall.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some people will say, as Senator Hill said today, `What is $2 1/2 million in $10 billion?' Not much. Even over 20 years, $25 million does not sound much in a budget of $70 billion. But every time one applies that $2 1/2 million across the board and starts multiplying it, it then becomes an almost life and death issue for the defence forces. That is what we are involved in and this is part of that process.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was announced prior to the decision to close <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS>, for instance, that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Ardent</EMPHASIS> would be retired, as most fast attack boats are, and that there would be a different approach to training reserves which would involve them in a much higher level of activity on capital ships. What we are really arguing in this case is to keep a naval base that does not have a boat, for a start. This also argues in the face&mdash;Senator Hill argued this way today and I do not agree with him&mdash;of moving against tri-service locations. That is something we have done right around Australia. It is something that air force has done in Tasmania already, with no objection from those opposite. The air force is not located at an aerodrome at the moment, yet Senator Hill says that any navy administration should be by the sea because the navy goes to sea; what absolute nonsense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me go back to the attitude of navy to this. If navy had a money tree, an unlimited expenditure, there is no doubt it would like to keep these three bases open. But, during the expenditure review committee process, it is required, like every other unit in the defence force, to put up a priority list, a hurt list, so that in the case of defence expenditure being lessened it will know which will be the first to go. Not for the first time, these three bases were put up. This is not the first year they were put up, nor will it be the last. It was not as though accurate costings had been done at that stage; estimated costings had been made. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am under a misapprehension here, and Senator Hill quite rightly corrected me. I was given a message that we were debating <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS> tonight, not two motions together, so I may skew my remarks a little more towards <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS>; but that is my fault, no-one else's. I got a letter from the premier of Tasmania saying that this decision indicates that this government is not interested in defence in Tasmania. I have written back to him. I am not going to release that letter&mdash;not that there is any problem with it, but I think it is probably his privilege rather than mine to release it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I pointed out&mdash;we will open them in January&mdash;that we have spent $1.3 million refurbishing Anglesea barracks. We have spent a further million dollars on refurbishment for the recruiting centre. We have spent a further million dollars on other refurbishments in Tasmania. There was no opposition to that expenditure from those opposite. This is a strong indicator that we in defence do not regard Tasmania as irrelevant or as somewhere that should be ignored. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that, coming out of the force structure review, there was a decision to look at closing Scottsdale in Tasmania. My colleague Mr Bilney put that in place. People in Tasmania raised objections to that. I intervened and looked at the matter. Because I regarded the case as being sufficient, we intervened and changed that decision. So far, I have had no reason&mdash;no reason whatsoever&mdash;to intervene in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS> decision. No case has been made out by Senator Hill. Regrettably, I will have to read in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> tomorrow the speeches of the three Tasmanians to see whether they can put forward views that can convince me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true&mdash;I think Senator Calvert will refer to this&mdash;that 12,000 people in Tasmania signed a petition saying that they would like us to reverse our decision on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS>. The person who led that particular campaign was one Mr Michael Hodgman MLA. Mr Hodgman has been extremely active on this issue. I thank him for his service in the navy which he has just terminated. He was a reservist for many years. I did speak to him on the phone on one or two occasions. As a result of that, he wrote me a letter setting out 10 great reasons why we should not close <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His first reason has already been alluded to: that the savings will amount to a miserly $250,000 a year. That is his figure, no-one else's. Yet he had that confirmed when Commodore Ritchie wrote back to him indicating that the savings would be more than $250,000&mdash;referring to the amount which Mr Hodgman took as being the actual amount. Let us clear up that particular area right away. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Hill is right when he says that he could not get an accurate answer in the estimates committee on the actual savings as the navy was still working on it. The indicative figure that was given there&mdash;and this is still stood by as more research is done&mdash;is $700,000 a year and there is a figure of between $2.7 million and $3 million per year for the closure of the three bases. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second reason given by Mr Hodgman is that if HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS> is closed, visiting personnel will be disembarked into a situation which could be embarrassing and physically threatening. In other words, if the US fleet comes to Hobart, we need to sneak the personnel in through the back door of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS>, otherwise a few of the green demonstrators will upset them. We do not have to do that in any other city in Australia. Having had our last three national conferences&mdash;and, I am pleased to say, our next national conference&mdash;in Hobart, I have always found it to be one of the most hospitable towns I have ever visited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His third argument is that if HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS> is closed down and the integrated reserves are transferred to the defence centre at Anglesea barracks, the reserves will drop by 30 or 40 within a couple of years. There is no evidence at all to support this assertion. Integration of reserves into overall naval activity would result in greater job satisfaction and sense of belonging to the reserves, which is precisely why we have taken that action with the reserves. It also encourages those reservists who have seen the organisation as too much of a social event to resign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">His next argument says that we cannot fit the 20 permanent naval force and defence personnel, 80 reservists and six reserve cadet headquarter staff into the defence centre at Anglesea barracks. There is no need to provide permanent accommodation for all those groups mentioned by Mr Hodgman. The majority of reservists are assigned to operational activities that occur outside the defence area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Hodgman's next assertion is that it has been strongly suggested that the Tasmanian naval band&mdash;comprising 20 members&mdash;will be disbanded. We have no current plans to dissolve the band, but I notice&mdash;even with the great facilities at <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS>&mdash;that we have only 11 of the 21 billets filled. This is another nonsense argument. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Hodgman's next point is that the navy will not therefore be represented by a commander in Tasmania if we move out of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS>. Again, that is a nonsense and it will almost certainly be retained at that rank. He goes on to say that it would be devastating to the morale of the navy in Tasmania. I have seen no such evidence of that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Hodgman also states that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS> has national trust status. It does at a state level, not at a federal level. But we will try to respect Tasmania's laws in that way. He asserts that Tasmania will be the only state in Australia without a designated naval base. Senator Hill has corrected the record very strongly on that today by mentioning <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Encounter</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Moreton</EMPHASIS>, although a base at Cairns in Queensland will remain. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final argument given is that defence assistance is being sought to make HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS> the base for the eradication of the North Pacific Sea Star. Mr Hodgman seeks the posting of a naval diving unit to Hobart to combat the problem. Other arguments are mounted, such as our not being able to have a proper military funeral without <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS>, et cetera. There is a string of fairly wild claims about it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The most important thing to discount in this matter is Mr Hodgman's well-asserted claims over the costs. We all know that he cannot count. After all, he was the individual who bought the speaker's regalia not so long ago. He got the TV cameras in and got filmed in the speaker's regalia. Unfortunately, he anticipated a majority vote in the state parliament. Two of his colleagues ratted, and the regalia has now become a collector's piece. So I do not think I will take his opinion about adding up figures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, I still have a very great soft spot for Michael Hodgman. I was one of those senators in a committee room in the old parliament house who saw Michael Hodgman, along with Mrs Kelly, confront someone who had a bomb strapped to him and talk him out of that situation. Whilst I am certainly combative about this issue with Mr Hodgman, I do not doubt his courage and the courage that he showed that day. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But I think he is innumerate&mdash;except for one aspect. He was very numerate the other day when arguing for a 40 per cent pay rise for a state politician who will represent an electorate the same as a federal member for the same pay, even though there are seven of them. If the Tasmanian government is looking at micro-economic reform, it might consider looking at that decision again and changing it. </PARA>

They thought that they had better jump on the bandwagon because one or two people might be roped in. They saw the politics of the matter. They took a little political opportunistic jump-in to find what they could milk out of it, even though they basically have too much contempt for the Defence Force. They do not have a universal contempt, because I know of some individual areas where Senator Woodley and his colleagues take a real interest. But on the whole, in the macro sense, they have no conception of what is required for the defence forces of this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will now deal with a more confusing attitude in Senator Calvert's motion. He talks about memorials. I hope that he explains which memorial he is talking about at <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS> because I do not know of one. If he is talking about memorabilia, which is a quite separate thing, he can have my assurance that the memorabilia that are associated with <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS> will remain within Tasmania and would almost certainly be relocated to Anglesea Barracks. But if it is thought appropriate by the navy that some of the memorabilia should be left in the existing <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS> for whatever future purposes, I will certainly listen to those arguments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In summary, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS> will have no reserve patrol boat after January 1994. Reserves will be trained with fleet units. The naval reserve cadets do not reside at <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS>. They are only dependent on it for administrative support. Large naval vessels are unable to berth at <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS>. The duplication of administrative and support activities at smaller single service establishments does not represent the efficient use of resources or personnel. Naval staff can be accommodated in the Anglesea Barracks and, contrary to some claims, reservists by the nature of their activities do not require dedicated facilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not think one needs to be a QC to understand that HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS> no longer has a future as a defence base. In my view, it has another future which will be an ongoing benefit to the community, particularly for young Australians. In conjunction with the Minister for Employment, Education and Training, the Hon. Kim Beazley, it has been proposed to establish a youth training and hospitality centre at <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS>. This may include some state agencies where that is practicable. The proposal will be further developed by the state director of DEET over the next few months. I think that there is a lot of potential in this proposal.

But so far in this debate, in the discussions at estimates committee, the correspondence that I have received, the conversations with Mr Michael Hodgman and others and the letters from the premier, a convincing case for the retention of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS> and, in turn, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Encounter</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Moreton</EMPHASIS> has not been established, other than that we need a naval presence because that is important or that we are in some way ignoring the traditions of the defence forces. In these times, considering the configuration of our defence forces, sometimes we have to make hard decisions. I really think that the opposition is trying to work both sides of the street. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will conclude with an anecdote about making cuts, even though it is not directly relevant to this issue. When Mr Downer was the shadow minister for defence he put out a press release in which he said `Coalition slams $19m army music bill'. That was a nice opportunistic press release saying that basically the government was spending too much money on bands. Mr Downer drew all sorts of illogical conclusions from that. He already knew that the matter was under review. The government then announced the decision to cut back army bands. We cut them back in specific locations, moved them to reservists and amalgamated them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Hill, as his successor, put out some advice to all coalition senators and members on army bands. He did not actually send a copy of this advice to us. I am happy to table this document or have it incorporated in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS>. This is a good example of weasel words because his predecessor had already attacked expenditure on army bands. When the government did something about it, the opposition tried to work both sides of the street. Senator Hill's document said, `We believe Senator Ray is out of step with community attitudes and has gone too far.'</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Hill did not send that advice to me but, nevertheless, I got a copy of it. The document went on to say that cost savings could be `more effectively achieved by streamlining where possible.' Senator Hill used all the usual weasel words. The facts are: the government did something hard a few months after the opposition said that it should do it. After the government had done it, the opposition jumped in like a big brown dog of political opportunism. It said, `Let's get in there and stir it up; let's stir up parochial thinking. We'll pick off Western Australia because the permanent band has gone there; then we will pick off South Australia and so on.' The opposition agrees with the policy in principle and in the macro, but it never agrees with it in the micro. If it can work both sides of the street and not get caught doing it, that is what it will do.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This debate tonight is a microcosm of the general political debate in this country.

The government cannot do that. We, as a tough, efficient and united opposition, demand cuts to government expenditure.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we put the acid on the opposition and ask it where it is going to cut expenditure, it says, `I am sorry we have jumped Fightback. We are in a holding pattern until we establish who is going to lead us in the next election. We will announce our policy when we are good and ready. Maybe then we will announce where we will cut expenditure.' But the opposition will not do that because it has adopted the Petro Georgio tactic of hit and not be hit.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting to see that Senator Ray gave 20 minutes of his very important time to come in here and debate this matter which, in Tasmania's case, involves a very small amount of money. The Minister for Defence spent 20 minutes pouring scorn on this side of politics and the Democrats over our concerns about HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS> in Hobart. As Senator Hill pointed out, he does not even know the amount of money that will be saved. It could be anything between $200,000 and $700,000 a year. No doubt we will find out at some future date. Senator Ray accused both the coalition and the Democrats of trying to make cheap electoral mileage out of this particular matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very interesting to note that there was no mention made of this proposed closure in Tasmania before the last election. Not one word was said about this. We talk about being cautious about what we say to voters, but I can assure Senator Ray that he does not live in Hobart so he does not know the impact that the proposed closure&mdash;and he confirmed tonight that it is definitely on&mdash;has had on the community. It is not just the closure of HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS> or the money that is saved, it is the attitude of the government towards Tasmania and particularly Hobart. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that Mr Kerr holds the seat of Denison by a large majority. I wonder what that majority would have been if the government had told the people of Tasmania before the election&mdash;when it lied to the Tasmanians, just as it did to all Australians&mdash;that Senator Schacht was going to come to Tasmania and attempt to scrap CSIRO or change it so much that it was unworkable. The government did not tell the Tasmanian electorate that it was going to come down and cut $1 million off the Antarctic division budget this year and more next year and cut the number of ships from two to one. The government certainly did not mention the closure of HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS>. Those three matters would have made things rather difficult for Mr Kerr. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Ray ought to think again when he comes into this chamber and accuses us of cheap political mileage and hypocrisy. He also needs to understand that the announcement in the budget that the government was going to close HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS> has caused tremendous outrage in the community. He mentioned that there were 12,000 signatures on a petition. That might not sound a lot if one lives in Sydney or Melbourne, but I can assure him that if one lives in Hobart it is a pretty good effort to get 12,000 signatures on a petition. These people are outraged at the decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What he did not mention is that HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS> is home for 25 permanent Royal Australian Navy staff, 108 active reservists and 40 inactive reservists. In terms of the overall defence budget it is a very small item. But as far as Hobart is concerned it is rather important. I am pleased that my colleagues from Tasmania Senator Bell and Senator Harradine, who also know how the people in Hobart feel, are supporting my motion tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee that was set up to save HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS> has been successful in gaining a tremendous amount of support, both from the community and also from the RSL. The new RSL national President, Major General William `Digger' James, announced that the RSL will oppose the closure of the base. He has been supported by the Tasmanian RSL President. Those people know the feeling that is generated in the community. They know that naval ex-servicemen in Tasmania are outraged by this decision. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history of HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS> goes back to 1 July 1911 when it was drafted into service. It was originally known as <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cerberus</EMPHASIS> VI. There are quite a few other <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Cerberus</EMPHASIS> bases around the world. I suppose the most action that <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS> saw in those days was deciding what to call the base. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The beautiful site where the base is situated is part of the Queens Domain that was given to the people of Tasmania in the last century by Queen Victoria. As anybody who has visited Tasmanian knows, Tasmanians are very proud of their heritage and very proud of their old buildings and important sites. HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS> is one of those sites. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As Senator Robert Ray said, it is listed under the state National Trust. It is not listed under the National Trust of Australia&mdash;so what? We see it as a very important building. It contains a number of priceless naval memorabilia and artefacts that have been collected over the years. At one stage it was named HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Derwent</EMPHASIS> after the river. It was renamed HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS> in only 1942. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The naval history of Tasmania goes way back. In fact, if I remember correctly, the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Lady Nelson</EMPHASIS>, a replica of which has been built in Tasmania, served in Tasmania; it was an exploring ship in Tasmanian waters and later went around Australia; I think it was recognised as probably the first Australian navy ship; and it was based in Hobart in its early days. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We all know that Admiral Collins, a Tasmanian and one of our naval war heroes, was one of the many Tasmanians who had been recruited over the years. I believe that it was no accident. Money is just not everything. Because of our tradition of being an island state, our maritime history and partly because of HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS>, it is no accident that Tasmania has the highest per capita enlistment in the Royal Australian Navy and has very strong historical associations with the proud record of our navy in battle. Admiral Collins was one of those naval people who was proudly a Tasmanian. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What price can one put on recruitment? As Senator Hill pointed out, I would have thought a naval establishment would have to be near the water. It seems now that the navy will be moved to Anglesea Barracks along with the air force and the army. Senator Robert Ray made light of the air force at the barracks. The air force has a very minor role in Tasmania. It never was situated at the airport. It has always had its own premises elsewhere in Hobart. But comparing the navy with the air force is quite a furphy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last time this particular matter came up and it was floated that the base was going to be closed the federal member for Denison, Mr Duncan Kerr, at the time lobbied the then Minister for Defence, Mr Beazley. He was successful. It seems that Senator Robert Ray is taking a much more hard-nosed approach. I would like to know why the government has decided to pick on Tasmania first. As I said earlier, Senator Schacht decided to try to disband CSIRO and then the Antarctic division. In 1989 Mr Beazley gave a commitment that the base would remain open. This decision certainly was not made known to the Tasmanian people before the last election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that the Labor members and senators in Tasmania have been very quiet about this matter; we have not heard a peep out of them, not one word. Not one of them has come forward to support the committee that has been set up to try to save HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS>; not one has been prepared to support the wishes of the Tasmanian community. I think this will be remembered by the Tasmanian electors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wonder how practical this move to Anglesea Barracks will be. Anglesea Barracks itself is not a large area. I think it is highly unlikely that Anglesea Barracks has the room, and without a vessel or a naval base on the water Tasmania's association with the Royal Australian Navy will become a laughing stock. Therefore, the once proud record of recruitment in Tasmania will drop off. What price can we put on recruitment?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A nephew of mine was recruited in the navy in Hobart. He studied in the UK and is now a Lieutenant-Surgeon in the navy. There are many more like him who come out of Hobart. If the young people know that they will have to spend their time at Anglesea Barracks, that they will have no training, or very little, on the water and that they will be jumbled in with the other two forces, I would be very surprised if they will be all that interested in coming forward. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> I know that there has been a lot of speculation, but this will leave Tasmania worse off than the other states because at least the other states will have some naval bases left. The closure of the other two bases will not mean that those two states affected will not have a naval base on the water. I note a particular letter that was written to the Hobart <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Mercury</EMPHASIS> by a mother of a young sailor, who unfortunately is no longer with us. It is rather a long letter. I do not wish to read it all out tonight, but I feel that she expressed the feeling of people in Hobart. She said:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To give you a brief background of my involvement with HMAS Huon, my son at 12 years of age wanted to join the reserve cadets but being too young was told to come back when he turned 14, however he was told he could attend every Tuesday night until a petty-officer at HMAS Huon said he was sick of seeing him and issued him with a uniform 12 months before his official age. He joined the RAN as a junior recruit at 15 1/2 years and trained at HMAS Leeuwin, completed his term and was accepted to HMAS Nirimba where he graduated at the top of his class. He was further honoured with the position of right hand marker at his graduation ceremony.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For a saving of $250,000 I am surprised that the Federal Government would remove the only permanent naval presence in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA>I think Tasmania receives only about $20 million of the total $9 billion defence budget. I presume that with the intended closure of <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS> that will be even less. I know that the powers that be have their eyes on the north, but I think it is most important that the defence forces have a significant presence in each state, if for no other reason than to encourage young people to become part of the service. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, Tasmania has always played its part, particularly through the navy. But after all the heat had gone out of this and we found that it may go ahead&mdash;with the reason expounded being to save money&mdash;I found it most unusual to find that the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS> will now not be disposed of; it will be kept and, as Senator Robert Ray said tonight, may be picked up by DEET to be used as a place for training in catering and the like. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But we already have a very successful catering establishment in Hobart. We have plenty of space for training young people. In fact, the Commonwealth centre in Hobart has about six or seven floors that have nobody in them; they are vacant&mdash;very valuable space doing nothing. If we are going to keep this building, why would we turn around and use <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS> for training purposes, which will probably cost about as much money as it would cost to keep it open and be run by naval personnel? It just does not make sense. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will be up for an expense, whichever department it is. Just because Senator Ray wants to make some microcuts at the edge of the defence budget of a few hundred thousand dollars, the morale and the association with the navy in Hobart will be severed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that the federal government has an obligation to the state of Tasmania, which, after all, is part of the Commonwealth&mdash;although sometimes I wonder whether it is or not. The people in the state pay taxes and I think it is important that the government ensure that the state has an active naval presence and a base which is applicable to the needs of such a presence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government talks about money. I took a bit of time this afternoon to look back through some of my public works reports. I note that this year, just on the navy&mdash;and these are the bigger projects&mdash;the government spent $9.9 million at Nowra on stage two of the HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Albatross</EMPHASIS>; it relocated the Naval Support Command Headquarters in New South Wales at a cost of another $13.4 million; then, again in New South Wales, it spent $73 million on HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Waterhen</EMPHASIS>. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Last, but not least, of course, it relocated the Australian Hydrographic Office to Wollongong at a cost of $12 1/2 million. That hydrographic office was up for grabs by every politician in the Labor Party. It could have gone anywhere. In fact, it could have gone to Hobart. If the government is talking about saving money, I remind it that it already had a facility in Hobart that perhaps was underutilised. The Australian Hydrographic Office could have gone to Hobart. But no, it went into a very good area&mdash;an area that was politically favourable to the government. It is the same old story of playing favourites, just like Mrs Kelly has with the sports grants. Again the $12.5 million was spent in New South Wales. It seems that unless people live in New South Wales or Victoria they will not have any money spent for defence or for any other reason because it is not politically expedient. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Ray said tonight that he has not heard any good reason why HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS> should be kept. All I am saying is that it has been established there since 1911; it has been proved to be the most productive recruiting area for naval personnel in Australia&mdash;that in itself must have some value; it is something that Tasmanians are very proud of; and at present it is catering for almost 200 naval personnel. If it is going to be kept and money is going to be spent on it from another government department, what is the difference? Why get the Tasmanian people offside and run the risk of reducing the intake of naval recruits just to save a few hundred thousand dollars?</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to say to him that, in fact, the Democrat position is based on a policy formulation which is both dynamic and realistic. I would even have been prepared to agree with the minister, to a certain extent. I place on the record, in case he reads it, that I do agree with the government's deficit reduction strategy; I do agree with the minister about the budget constraints which he faces; and I certainly agree with him that the Democrats have projected budget cuts, particularly in the area of defence, in previous years. But I would like to say to him that we have carefully costed those cuts and that the cuts are made very specifically and certainly not necessarily in the areas in which the present minister would make those cuts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I was interested that he spoke about Mr Hodgman as not being able to add up. I am sorry that the minister did not accept my interjection, because by continuing&mdash;and he has done it at least twice in this place since I have been here&mdash;to speak of the Democrat policy as cutting $2 billion off the defence budget, he is simply inaccurate. I am sorry but I do not accept his explanation that somewhere or other he has added up what we were going to do and has come to the figure of $2 billion. In fact, our figure, which was nearer to $1 billion, was very carefully worked out. I do not think the minister ought to talk about the ability of other people to add up. Perhaps he might be prepared in another debate to admit his mistake in that regard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question I have to ask the minister is why it is that we continue to concentrate our naval forces in Sydney. I do acknowledge, of course, the development of Stirling in Western Australia. It seems to me that, whenever cuts are to be made, it is always to the peripheral bases. Certainly, in terms of regional development, the Democrats would place the emphasis on spreading our defence forces into regional areas rather than concentrating on places such as Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister talked about making hard decisions. He knows as well as I do that the really hard decision that some government will have to make in the future is to remove the fleet base from Sydney, along with ECAC, the East Coast Armaments Complex, and the dockyard. This is the hard decision that he will not take. So, in fact, his accusation that the opposition or the Democrats will not make hard decisions is really a furphy. I challenge the minister, with regard to the strategic review that is being done from which Australia's defence white paper is being prepared, to allow that process to happen before he begins to make the kinds of cuts that we are dealing with here tonight. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I agree very much with Senator Ray's contention that defence is a dynamic thing and things change. In a sense, defence facilities around Australia are very much a prisoner of history&mdash;of what has developed in the past. There is need for change, and there is change that has to be made. I think the army is probably the worst in this, with its drill halls around the place; particularly in relation to the reserve, there is a real need to relocate a number of those. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Ray made a great deal about the fact that Senator Hill did not have time in his speech to develop the reason for the retention of these bases. The retention is really quite simple and self-evident. Navy has to be represented in all the Australian states, and it does need a shop window in the capital cities. It does recruit in all states. We simply cannot have a defence force that is based on Queensland recruitment alone, even though it might provide the majority of enlistees in all three services, we have to have a national effort. There are naval administration matters within the Commonwealth that have to be administered through the state and, of course, there is the matter of ship visits to capitals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we had at the estimates committee which led to this situation was a total lack of any justification for the decision. We had some very unfortunate naval people having to defend the indefensible. To be very kind to them, they had a really romantic view on the savings. What they did was pure Keatingesque economics. They came up with a figure for the cost of the three bases and said, `Well, if we close the bases we can pull all that money into our hip pocket and we're going to be that much better off'. Then they went ahead and admitted that they were going to keep pretty well all the personnel&mdash;they would get rid of some of the civilian ones, but the rest of the naval uniformed personnel would be redeployed around the navy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was really as silly a decision as the decision of a former CNS when he was in the position of being told by this government that he had to cut $X million from the RAN budget. He closed the amphibious squadron in Brisbane when it consisted of HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tobruk</EMPHASIS> and all the LCHs and when 6th Brigade in Brisbane was tasked with training in amphibious warfare. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We had a very good facility set up at HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Moreton</EMPHASIS> with the roll-on, roll-off facilities. They had all been developed under the brilliance of Captain Bill Owen, who was then the senior naval officer in Queensland. But it went without any thought or any analysis, purely to satisfy a requirement in the budget preparation at the last minute. It is crystal clear from the evidence given to the Senate estimates committees that history has repeated itself at the last minute in the preparation of this budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to talk about <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Moreton</EMPHASIS>. We have heard a bit about <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS> and we have heard a bit about <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Encounter</EMPHASIS>. I accept that HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Moreton</EMPHASIS> is a facility that is run down. I deplore the speed with which the government ran it down. It has done nothing to encourage the RAN reserve in Queensland&mdash;a body that had about 180 operationally efficient reservists for many years. The figure today would be something like nine or 10. There may be considerably more than that on the books as reservists, but operationally efficient numbers are minuscule. We once had, when that amphibious squadron was going, probably 1,000 regulars at the place. But the decision was taken in the budget and almost overnight the equipment and furniture and a lot of things were auctioned off. The government moved with remarkable speed to get out of it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point I want to develop is the need for a naval basing facility within southern Queensland. One of the great requirements for the RAN is not the Indian Ocean and the shift to HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Stirling</EMPHASIS> in the west, which has been driven by parochial considerations of the Labor Party to hold seats in Western Australia. The navy has a great requirement to be active amongst the Pacific island states. It is more logical that that be supported out of Queensland than out of Sydney. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Ultimately, of course, the east coast base of the navy must be Gladstone, as I have said for many years, where there will be very considerable cost savings, in ship steaming time and the rest of it, getting into exercise and deployment areas. Having a facility on the east coast able to operate with the army, particularly if the government goes ahead with what has been in the papers recently of buying two of the Newport class landing ships to replace <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Tobruk</EMPHASIS> and <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Jervis Bay</EMPHASIS>, becomes paramount. That cannot be done in the south; it has to be done in Queensland, and preferably in Brisbane with 6th Brigade. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The evidence that was given to the estimates committee was that the navy would move to Bulimba. I put a plea in to the minister to get some people to think about this and think about it in some depth. Bulimba could be developed to provide a very efficient base for an amphibious squadron to service the requirements in the southern Pacific area. There is plenty of land there for vehicles and stores, even for a helicopter landing pad; there is wharfage at the present time which would accommodate these new ships if they are bought; and there are ramp facilities available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to look at the requirements not only from a military point of view but also from a civilian point of view, for example, cyclone relief and probably earthquake problems. An earthquake erupting in Rabaul might require very considerable aid to the civilian population in that part of New Guinea and the ability to support and replenish and store ships to provide that aid becomes very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am saying to the minister that he should put a bit more thought into what is being done rather than maintain the adhockery that we have clearly and demonstrably had up to the present. We are dealing with something here that really was an impromptu, last-minute decision&mdash;something to save, I understood him to say in his speech tonight, between $2.7 million to $3 million. Since <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Encounter</EMPHASIS> was about $700,000, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Huon</EMPHASIS> was again about $700,000 and HMAS <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Moreton</EMPHASIS> was $1.3 million, I do not think his mathematics are any better than the numeracy skills that he ascribed to the Hon. Michael Hodgman. I think his figures were a bit rocky on that. </PARA>

I agree that there is a case for reviewing facilities&mdash;by all means, let us run the Defence Force so that we maximise the return for the taxpayer's dollar&mdash;but we have to take the view that the defence industry is not a corporation. It does not live or die by its balance sheet. It is involved with issues that have many intangibles and unforeseeable factors. The Defence Force is here to serve the interest and the national security of this country on a basis measured in centuries, not in days or balance sheets, for a government that gets into great trouble and runs up such an appalling overseas debt as this government has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us put a little more thought and care into what we are doing with a body that is as important to Australia as the Australian Defence Force. It is not something that can be subjected to heavy funding one year when there is a good wool clip and cut back the next year when there is a drought. The national interest demands some degree of stability and, above all, it demands a degree of planning and thought. We certainly have not seen that in relation to the closure of these three facilities.</PARA>

I find it quite easy to agree with Senator MacGibbon on this occasion about the description of the romantic view of savings that was held by the officers at the estimates committee. This should be considered with a great degree of cynicism.

Perhaps they could be replaced with a fleet of 30 Tasmanian-built seacats which are devastatingly fast ships. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The letter read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">LORD MAYOR'S OFFICE</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Town Hall</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Hobart</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Tasmania</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I am writing to request that you reconsider your decision to close the Navy's establishment in Tasmania, HMAS HUON. I am aware that many others have written to you on this matter and I am also aware of the broad thrust of the responses which your office has made to their letters</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Much of the argument against closure of HMAS HUON has been founded on issues of tradition and heritage. Tasmania's contribution to the Navy has been significant&mdash;far greater than might have been expected from such a small state. I believe that tradition and heritage are important factors in the need to retain a dedicated naval presence in Tasmania, not just because of their meaning for the past but, even more importantly, because of what they mean for the future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The simple fact is that Tasmanians have a very great deal to offer the Navy. The fact that our Defence policy is focused around operations to the North and West of Australia must, of course, be balanced by the need to draw support and people&mdash;particularly reservists&mdash;from around the nation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Your own Defence policy seeks to bring about an increased reliance on Reserves. In those areas of activity for which they are capable of being trained, such as Patrol Boat operations, the Naval Reserves represent a particularly cost-effective source of manpower and there is every indication that the Navy's need for them will grow.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is the nature of Naval Reserve employment that the people involved must to a large degree be trained, led and nurtured where they live. I know that your response to others who have written has been that ". . . sea-going reservists will train and serve. . . in Fleet units operating from. . . Sydney, Perth, Darwin and Cairns" What that response misses though, is that there is more to recruiting, training and retaining skills currency than the annual continuous training periods spent away from home each year. The proposed naval staff in Hobart will be a part of delivering that training and support, but in significantly less suitable accommodation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Defence Forces make a considerable investment in the training, leadership, teambuilding and corporate ethos of their permanent personnel. A sense of identity and ownership are an important outcome of that investment. The decision to close HMAS HUON makes it clear that, despite a growing need for their services, you are not prepared to make a minimal investment in the Naval Reserve for the same outcomes. Their needs for corporate identity are not any less than those of their permanent counterparts by virtue of the part-time nature of their service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Elsewhere in Australia, the process of integration of Reserves and Permanent Naval Forces means that the Naval Reserve will share this kind of support with their permanent counterparts. The disappearance of a dedicated naval facility in the state of Tasmania, however, will have a devastating impact on Naval Reservists here.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While I don't predict an immediate mass walkout of Tasmanian Naval Reservists, it is clear that the closure of HMAS HUON will lead to a steady decline in this increasingly needed manpower resource and a consequent abandonment of your policy of increased reliance on the Reserve. There are clear messages for Naval Reservists around the nation in such a development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Implicit in your responses to other correspondents is the suggestion that the only function of HMAS HUON was to support the attached training vessel, HMAS ARDENT. This certainly was one of the functions which necessitated a waterfront location. It was also only one of a considerably wider range of functions which more than justify a dedicated Naval establishment. The benefits of HUON in terms of identity and location will not be replaced by various cramped quarters dispersed around Anglesea Barracks.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Had your office, or any of those involved in the decision to close HUON looked more closely at those functions, perhaps it might have been recognised that they justified the minimal investment directly attributable to continued use of the establishment. As I noted above, the Navy in Tasmania has a great deal to offer the Navy nationally and can make a cost effective contribution.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Returning to withdrawal of the attached training vessel, this decision in no means justifies closure of HUON and, indeed, it is not particularly relevant to closure. The other functions being performed there justify retention of the establishment. Moreover, I am advised that studies undertaken by the Naval Reserve in Hobart well before the budget decision, led to the identification of 13 of the 25 naval positions in HUON for reallocation elsewhere within Navy once HMAS ARDENT was withdrawn. In other words, the real manpower savings were already achieved and closure of HUON makes very little further difference. Its retention as a facility ideally suited to training and support of Reserves is thus at minimal cost.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The claim that the decision to close HMAS HUON was made to save money has already failed scrutiny. The fact, admitted at the recent Senate Estimates Committee hearing, that nobody knew what would be saved is relevant, although I would have thought anyone could have identified the direct salary and maintenance costs attributable to the establishment itself, rather than the functions it supports. It seems inescapable that savings, if any, will be minimal and they will be at least partly replaced by new costs in respect of whatever new premises are occupied.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Given the paltry sum of money involved, it seems to me that, far from being about savings, the decision was an attempt to `cry poor' at the budget table. Indeed the comments, reported in the local media, of the Chief of Naval Staff during his visit to Tasmania, that the decision demonstrated that Defence was being `cut to the bone' reinforce this assessment.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Similarly, the recent decision to retain HUON in Commonwealth hands for use as a "Youth Training and Hospitality Centre" is open to question. Duplicating existing State facilities and expenditure, this decision, too, appears to have been made without the benefit of advice from anyone who knows what is happening in Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Along with media coverage of the training centre proposal was a report that the memorabilia presently held in HUON would be retained there after closure. This proposal is gratuitously offensive to those who have been evicted and are now faced with deprivation of their `family heirlooms'. Many of the items involved are not Commonwealth property, but belong to the various messes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This issue will not `go away'. As Lord Mayor of Hobart, I have given my full support to the campaign to save HMAS HUON. I have also given my full support to those Tasmanian Senators who will vote on the matter in the Senate this week.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In summary. I ask you to reverse a decision which:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">saves virtually no money,</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">flies in the face of a policy of increased reliance on the Naval Reserve,</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">will significantly diminish support to, motivation of and, ultimately, availability of Naval Reservists, </PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">has every appearance of being motivated by political posturing rather than savings,</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">is being followed by further politically inept decision making (the Youth Training Centre proposal); and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">will be a continuing and escalating political problem for your government and for its elected representatives in Tasmania.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Minister, the state of Tasmania and its naval personnel are worth considerably more than to be treated as a political football. I strongly doubt that the point has really been reached where it is beyond the Navy's management to find real savings which would allow it to operate within budgetary guidance&mdash;rather than close down support for those who take a growing part in keeping `the sharp end' operating.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The decision to close HUON makes no meaningful contribution to the achievement of savings. Rather it diminishes the Navy's ability to make the best use of a cost effective manpower resource, in return for minimal investment. I can assure you that more and more people here are coming to see this fact, and increasingly, to resent this easily reversible decision</PARA>

<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Having regard to the article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> of 25 November 1993, headed `MPs to press for softer detention rules for refugees', whether there was a disclosure of a document that is confidential to the Joint Standing Committee on Migration, or of proceedings in private session of that Committee, without the authorisation of the Committee, and, if so, whether a contempt was committed by that disclosure.</PARA>
<PARA>The committee viewed this matter very seriously when it came to its attention this morning. The article in question appeared on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Canberra Times</EMPHASIS> which, of course, is readily available in this building. An urgent meeting of the committee was organised after the deputy chair of the committee, Senator Short, and I conferred in the chamber at 12.45 p.m. today, that being the earliest possible opportunity. At that meeting there was a large attendance of committee members, all of whom treated the matter very seriously. As a result of the committee's decision at that meeting, I wrote a letter to the President drawing the attention of the Senate to the matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Because it is a joint committee, a similar letter was also written to the Speaker of the House of Representatives. The committee was somewhat uncertain what to do, and the matter has been raised in the House of Representatives. That means that perhaps the matter could be referred to two privileges committees of the parliament. In relation to that I would suggest that either the presiding officers confer and make recommendations or suggestions or give a direction as to which committee ought to look at it or, alternatively, that the two privileges committees themselves might give a consideration as to which of them should consider the matter and further examine it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the seriousness of the matter, there is just one further explanation I would care to make at this point in time. This is serious because the confidentiality of committee proceedings has been intruded upon and interfered with. The committee is far from making final decisions on this matter. The members of the committee have given this inquiry a great deal of attention, and we hope to report to the parliament when we have finally completed our deliberations in a matter of three weeks or so. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is concern about the seriousness of intrusion and interference in parliamentary processes.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A second and perhaps much more serious matter is how the material that appeared in the newspaper today could be treated by some people who have a big interest in the matter. You would be aware, Mr Acting Deputy President, that there are a number of people, who are not the subject matter of the committee's inquiry, who are detained in immigration detention centres in different parts of Australia&mdash;quite a substantial number of people. We know that in the past incorrect advice has been given and distortions made of public statements to those people. I have a great concern, which, indeed, is shared by some of the committee members, about how this matter might be reported to those individuals who are held in detention centres, perhaps creating for them a further air of false hope that they might be allowed to remain in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of course, that is not the case and cannot be the case because the committee is not examining the applications made by those people who are currently in detention&mdash;omitting those 53 people who arrived on our shores by boat last evening. But there are over 200 other people in detention. I personally have some knowledge that in the past newspaper articles, television reports and radio commentary have been distorted and given those people false hopes that they might be allowed to remain in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee is aware that, despite the fact that we have tried to allay their expectations, many of those people are waiting with some expectation that there might be some outcome for them in the joint standing committee's deliberations. That is not the case&mdash;and I have to say that with some vigour here tonight. The committee is examining and making recommendations on future detention policies and practices of the Australian government. I hope that my short statement here tonight will help in stopping or ceasing to commence any form of propaganda that may be used with those people who are currently in detention and who are awaiting legal decisions on whether or not they will be allowed to remain in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak in support of the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training on aspects of the Industrial Relations Reform Bill 1993. I would like to reiterate Senator Zakharov's thanks to the committee secretariat for the effort that they put in to ensure that this report was brought into the chamber within the time set down. The report contains a dissenting report, which I can do no other than condemn as an inaccurate and factually wrong statement. The inquiry was conducted within a limited time frame. Therefore, the report is not definitive in respect of the technical detail of the Industrial Relations Reform Bill 1993. Rather, as has been said by Senator Zakharov, the chair of the committee, the report addresses the key themes of the proposed legislation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee received 32 submissions from various parties. We had three public hearings and received evidence from all key organisations. There were three terms of reference for the committee to analyse. Those terms of reference were:</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(b) non-unionised workplaces; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">2The implications for the States of the proposals in the Bill with respect to the States' rights and responsibilities; and</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Other related implications arising from the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA>In summary, the report supports the general thrust of the government's proposed legislation. We heard evidence from a number of employer organisations that the bill was a negative rather than a positive approach to enhancing industrial relations, but no evidence was really presented to support these claims. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said at the outset, there is also a dissenting report. It is appropriate that I redress some of the spurious claims contained within that. Firstly, I would like to go to the question of consultation. The opposition members on the committee made great play about the consultation process, specifically as it related to employers and Liberal state governments. They have promoted a view in their dissenting report that there was little or no consultation with these parties. The facts simply do not support their claim. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to the states, the process began back in December 1992. The issues likely to form the legislation were discussed at a meeting of state premiers in Perth in December of that year. The then Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook, convened a special meeting of Labor ministers on 16 December 1992, where the states were provided with further information. The legislation was again discussed with the states in Brisbane in April of this year. State officials were fully briefed in September of this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new minister, Minister Brereton, wrote to state ministers in early October 1993, providing a copy of the draft legislation as it stood at that time to ensure that the states had sufficient time to examine the legislation before the next meeting which was held at the end of October. The minister also advised the states in writing of progressive changes that occurred before that date. In addition to all of these meetings, the minister had individual meetings with all state ministers, plus further exchanges of correspondence during the development of the government's legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As for consultation with other major players in the game, this also commenced in a comprehensive way from April of this year. By way of comparison&mdash;opposition members would have us believe otherwise&mdash;the minister met with the ACTU some 25 times, and at least 32 times with employer groups around the country. I do not need to name them all, but over 100 meetings took place with the various interest groups. So on the matter of consultation, the government's record speaks for itself; unlike, I must say, that of the Victorian and Western Australian governments when they were bringing in their own industrial relations legislation. To my knowledge, in Victoria there was no consultation with the federal government. As for Western Australia&mdash;it seemed to be the one that wanted to whinge most about this&mdash;it sent a copy of its legislation to Minister Brereton after it had been introduced into state parliament. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In going to the terms of reference of the committee and looking at the issue of whether or not the government bill improves relationships between employers and employees and enhances the enterprise bargaining process, as can be seen from the evidence, there are varying views about this. If we look at the proposed bill objectively and the current legislation that is in place, we can really draw no other conclusion than that the proposed legislation can achieve both of these objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill does not, as is claimed, put in place more restrictions. What it does do is provide flexibility and an opportunity to enhance the enterprise bargaining process. What it also does, and what the three states under Liberal governments have not done, is provide protection for workers against unscrupulous employers. If we compare state and federal legislation as they currently stand and take note of reports that have been conducted by both the Department of Industrial Relations at a federal level and independent analysts, it is quite evident that the current federal legislation has been far more successful than that of any of the states in areas of flexibility and workplace change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As at 10 November this year, over 1,320 enterprise agreements were registered under the federal system, which came into effect in October 1991. Those agreements cover some 800,000 workers or about 12 per cent of the nation's work force. By comparison, in the states of New South Wales and Victoria where legislation has been in place for similar periods of time, there are only some 386 agreements registered in New South Wales and about only 155 in Victoria. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FX5">Senator MURPHY</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. Again, by way of comparison, the studies found that agreements under federal legislation adopted a broader agenda concerning enterprise performance, whereas agreements in the state jurisdictions focused on a narrow range of issues such as wages and conditions.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">By way of example, I would like to refer to the Victorian approach. It is quite evident from work contracts that have been either drawn up collectively or individually, which the Victorian government would certainly deny&mdash;it certainly did in answer to questions from Senator Carr from Victoria about protections it provides&mdash;that if one was employed and working under a state award prior to March this year, one would not lose any of the conditions contained within those awards. Workers at Fancy Fingers, Alexanders, Nandos Chicken Land, Bed Bath n'Table, Australian Pacific Supermarkets, Westco Jeans, Copperart, Speeds Shoes, et cetera would certainly contradict that. The copies of the contracts of employment that I have show that those employees lost substantial conditions that they had working under awards prior to March 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second term of reference relates to the implications for the states and how the federal legislation might impact on states rights. It should be noted that the legislation proposed will have no impact over state legislation where the states are meeting the obligations of international conventions, such as those of the ILO, to which we are a signatory. There is a claim by Western Australia that it is meeting the obligations of ILO conventions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to point out that as far as setting minimum rates of pay and minimum conditions are concerned, it is a ministerial decision in Western Australia. Although it has a mechanism whereby the minister can make that decision arising out of a recommendation from the Western Australian Industrial Relations Commission, there is no requirement for that commission to use any basis for making that recommendation&mdash;that is, they do not have to assess the wages and conditions of workers around that state. There is no obligation. So it is not meeting the requirements of a number of the conventions. Therefore, the legislation may have an impact in some of those areas but for others, such as Queensland and South Australia, the legislation will have no impact whatsoever. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish briefly to contribute to the discussion on the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. I endorse the recommendations of the committee, as contained in the report. Obviously I do so because I signed it. I want to address the way in which the report was compiled and the process that was engaged in. In particular, I want to spend a short period addressing and continuing my little campaign in this regard.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The public hearing which was conducted last Friday was conducted while the Senate was sitting. It provided particular embarrassment for me because at that time in this chamber we were considering two bills on industrial relations and education on which I was required to speak on behalf of the Democrats. I was therefore unable to attend and participate in the public inquiry, except for very short periods. I had a set of questions which I was unable to address. The chair of the committee, Senator Zakharov, was kind enough to ask some of those questions on my behalf but it was far from a satisfactory position. Perhaps if I had approached Senator Murphy, he would have been keen to ask questions on that occasion. Shuffling backwards and forwards from this chamber to the committee hearing was not a satisfactory situation to be in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Luckily, the facility to review the proceedings of the committee was available to me and I was able to participate in the final compilation of the report. That process is certainly not conducive to either the proper conduct of the business of this chamber or the proper conduct of the committee acting on behalf of this chamber. I want to register that protest loud and strong. I was not satisfied with it and it was less than satisfactory to the committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, that does not mean that the criticism which was addressed first by Senator Murphy is a criticism which holds. Senator Murphy dismissed the criticism that the committee did not have time to do its work properly, and I wish to address it as well. Although I have criticised the holding of the hearing on that day, it did not detract from the opportunity that the rest of the committee had to pursue the matters they wished to, nor did it detract from the opportunity that the witnesses had to present their case. I said earlier in debate in this place on another matter that the debate which was rehearsed was one which had been heard previously, perhaps even ad nauseam. The subject matter which was brought to the committee was little different to the subject matter which was brought to the committee over the previous year in the inquiry into sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from addressing that criticism and agreeing with Senator Murphy in the way in which it was dismissed, I would also like to say that I agree with much of what Senator Murphy has just said.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I welcome the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs entitled, <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">A National Drought Policy&mdash;Appropriate Government Responses to the Recommendations of the Drought Policy Review Task Force</EMPHASIS>. It has been a little slow in coming, as has the end of the drought in a lot of places. For example, in southern Queensland at the moment we have a horrific drought which has been going on for a couple of years or more. In the eastern and northern parts of the New England region of New South Wales drought is still occurring. Drought is also occurring on the north coast and in other isolated pockets.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The history of an appropriate drought strategy for Australia is very long and protracted. In 1990 the drought review task force published a report but by 1992 most of the recommendations in that report had not been acted upon. It was for that reason that the Senate Standing Committee on Rural and Regional Affairs embarked upon an inquiry. It took us to many and varied places, as evidenced by the pictorial records in the report. I remember saying at the time, after we published our report in July 1992&mdash;that is quite a long time ago when one thinks about it&mdash;that we thought it was almost too late to be of any use for the current drought. Fifteen months later, we have a government response.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At that time I said in a press release:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government has to be responsible for providing comprehensive assistance for drought-stricken farmers, even though farmers want to become self-sufficient to survive drought.</PARA>
<PARA>I went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . they can't do this without the support of Government&mdash;including the provision of appropriate financial incentives to store funds, fodder and water. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Expenditure relating specifically to preparations for drought need to be fully tax-deductible in the year of expenditure, and a more attractive and effective IED scheme needs to be implemented.</PARA>
<PARA>We suggested the implementation of tax credits, et cetera. I said in my press release that the federal government could not abandon primary producers and that becoming responsible for drought survival is a process that will take many years and we could not expect farmers to achieve self-sufficiency overnight. I went on to say that within the national disaster relief arrangements, the federal government had to realise its obligation when drought becomes severe. I suggested that the trigger mechanisms to activate Commonwealth involvement in severe drought could include an application from the shire concerned, the use of objective measuring of soil moisture readings, and an overriding subjective assessment by a tripartite drought committee involving the cooperation of federal and state governments. That would have taken the matter out of politics. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very concerned that the reply from the government to some of our areas of concern is that we should encourage a self-reliant approach to drought. The government has said that the national drought policy does encourage self-reliant approaches to drought by treating it as one of the risks for which managers of farm business must prepare. It says that the policy seeks to address the past approach of reliance on government assistance during drought periods by removing the emphasis on transaction based subsidies and drought declarations. I wish to take up that point. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of the transaction based subsidy, stock can get out of a drought affected area on to better pastures that are available around Australia. That is good for numerous reasons. It is good for animal welfare as it is getting the stock on to better pastures. It is good for maintaining the breeding herd or the breeding flock, which is most important in times of a severe drought in Australia. That has really been forgotten about by removing the emphasis on transaction based subsidies and drought declarations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Severe droughts will continue to occur in Australia into any century we like to think about. The fact that we said we would take drought out of the natural disaster arena still did not mean there was not an obligation on the federal government to take it into account when it got beyond the ability of somebody to handle it. Our suggestion was that the one in 20 drought be determined by an objective measurement and there should be a trigger for the government to immediately come in and help out. A fair bit of export income is produced by the rural communities and they deserve some help. We should make sure that we keep the flock and the herd surviving for future years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government response mentioned a number of problems with the rural adjustment scheme. A comprehensive review of the rural adjustment scheme has been undertaken. The government response states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In particular its recommendations focused on the mechanisms for achieving structural adjustment in the rural sector.</PARA>
<PARA>On 29 July the Agriculture and Resource Management Council of Australia and New Zealand met and discussed, amongst other things, the uncertainty in application of the RAS guidelines for triggering exceptional circumstances; and the application of income support provisions in circumstances where a reasonable valuation of farm assets is difficult because few sales occur. Lots of problems occur with the rural adjustment scheme. I still do not think that is the real answer that we require in Australia to handle drought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The response also addressed income equalisation deposits. The committee suggested that an effective IED scheme should be introduced. We used to have a very effective income equalisation deposit scheme. In a good year, people could put money away&mdash;not at a high rate of interest&mdash;and they could get a total deduction from their income in that particular year. They could bring it back in a year of drought at the ruling rate of tax they were paying in that particular year. That was a good scheme. When the Rt Hon. Ian Sinclair from the other place was the minister, he was one of the instigators of that scheme. The money that went into the primary industries bank was of great help and assistance to the rural communities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly, the income equalisation deposit scheme has been emasculated. Even though it has come back into being with the government now, a lot of questions can be asked about it. What interests rates are going to be charged? Is it going to be the bond rate? Are there going to be severe penalties if incorrect self-assessment is done? The scheme could be a lot more flexible than what the government is proposing, without fear of any rorting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the things that disturb me about this government is that, if one person rorts something&mdash;maybe some people have rorted that scheme&mdash;the government cancels it for all the people it could help. That is a sad thing for us. Just look at the paper today. People have had wonderful wheat crops in the Walgett area. It is the first time they have had decent wheat crops and a decent income for a long time. Surely, they could have a really good income equalisation deposit scheme whereby they could put money away that they have got from their crop which they have grown this year, and when they get their bad seasons in the future&mdash;they get a lot of not so good seasons in the Walgett area&mdash;they could bring back that money. That would allow those people to put away money for self-sufficiency, to look after themselves in times of a drought. Self-reliance is very important and it is one area of recommendation in the committee's report. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In reply to our report, the government said that there has to be more education. I can assure people who have&mdash;and those who have not&mdash;had anything to do with the land that it does not matter how well one is educated; it is very hard to educate and to train people to know when a drought starts. It is all very well for the government to say that people should destock for drought&mdash;they know that it is going to come the next week, they have to destock for it. That is all very well. Without transaction based subsidies and assistance in that respect, it will be very difficult for people to say, `I will get my stock away to better pastures and prepare myself for the drought that may be coming up'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new arrangements for drought will definitely be tested over time. In future, the federal government should show more flexibility in response to calls for help. The long drawn out process for each of the present arrangements should not be repeated. I welcome the response but I do not think it has really gone all the way to making sure that we retain our herds and our flocks and to making sure that we keep our people on the land for the future benefit of Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Democrats have been urged to respond to the SIS bills by amending them. We have received a large number of complaints from disaffected public servants in Victoria who allege that the Kennett government is meddling in their super fund arrangements with a view to reducing benefits substantially. The number of complaints is very large and should not go without notice. In fact, the number of these complaints has been exceeded only by the correspondence which has been received by us on the introduction of the super guarantee charge.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This level of concern is not surprising. Victorian public servants, like their New South Wales counterparts earlier this year, have had their superannuation scheme gutted by mean-fisted state governments. What is concerning us is that they have been able to thwart the basic employment contract law by ready access to legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the transfer arrangements between the old and the new Victorian superannuation schemes, I understand that existing members stand to lose up to 20 per cent of their accrued entitlements. The `voluntary' transfer to the new scheme is made compulsory by possible punitive increases in contributions of up to 160 per cent. This will have a serious impact on particular age groups. New employees, like those in New South Wales, will be entitled to only the minimum superannuation provided by the superannuation guarantee levy system. We are told that this has been done as part of an effort to reduce state indebtedness and unfunded liabilities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Senate Select Committee on Superannuation has taken an active interest in the goings on in public sector superannuation. The third report of the committee, entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Super and the financial system</EMPHASIS>, resulted in the production of a seminal report on public sector superannuation across Australia highlighting two key areas: firstly, that the level of unfunded liabilities for public sector superannuation was increasing and in the near future would present government with severe funding problems; and, secondly, that there are differences in the level of employer contributions from one state to the next. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will give an example. The Rolls Royce of the scheme was the Defence Force retirement and death benefits scheme, which had a level of employer support of about 26 per cent. The FJ Holden of the scheme was found to be the new Victorian scheme, which is funded at 11.3 per cent. The report showed that the reorganisation of the Victorian scheme has already resulted in the reduction of the level of employer support from 21.5 per cent to 11.3 per cent. The New South Wales scheme was also reduced from 21.5 per cent to 14 per cent under the Wran government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having regard to the seemingly low level of employer support in the Victorian scheme, we were somewhat surprised to hear that attempts were being made to further whittle away these benefits. I understand that the government is reducing benefits to rein in its public sector debt. The letters which I have received call on my party to legislate by way of amendments to the SIS bills to prevent a state government from reducing benefits by fiat. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can understand the concerns of those whose benefits have been, or will be, reduced. However, this parliament and the Commonwealth are not well placed to become involved in that dispute, in a legislative sense at least. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Until the High Court decides otherwise, states are recognised as having a constitutional right to legislate on industrial relations matters affecting their employees. Whether they could reduce the level of benefits below the SGC minimum, however, is another matter. Our advice is that, as the SGC is a tax on employers who do not meet their minimum superannuation contributions, the Commonwealth could insist that states meet their obligations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The High Court decision last year in South Australia v. the Commonwealth provides some guidance as to the degree of protection that the states have over their employee superannuation fund arrangements. In that case, the Commonwealth was prohibited from imposing a tax on that state's superannuation funds as, under section 114 of the constitution, the tax was seen as a tax on state property. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Commonwealth intervention to dictate to states that certain conditions above and beyond the SGC be maintained would be likely to suffer a similar fate. That is not to say that the Commonwealth should stand idly by while two of the country's largest employers restructure their superannuation arrangements to the detriment of hundreds of thousands of workers. The issue of Australia's $34.4 billion worth of unfunded public sector superannuation liabilities is a national problem, if only because more than half of that amount is, at present, part of the Commonwealth schemes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When the Senate superannuation committee looked at the issue, it recognised that a great deal more information was needed. It unanimously recommended that the Minister for Finance convene a national meeting of state finance ministers or treasurers to develop a plan of action for addressing the problem of unfunded liabilities. Unfortunately, since then, the Commonwealth has done nothing while two states have now reduced the superannuation entitlements of their employees, particularly their new employees. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A coordinated approach to the problem of unfunded liabilities could at least ensure that unfortunate employees who find themselves subject to a capricious state government are not picked off and made to experience the unilateral withdrawal of hard-earned benefits. The problem of unfunded superannuation is also a part of a bigger state debt problem, which my colleague Senator Coulter has been investigating in the Australian Loans Council committee. </PARA>

For example, there was one instance where it did not need to be an emergency and as a result of amendments suggested by Darryl Williams QC that situation was remedied. These amendments provide a check on the circumstances when warrants are not required in that the relevant agency needs to seek a warrant `as soon as practicable'. If the circumstances for the tap do not comply with the requirements outlined in the act then obviously the warrant will not be granted and therefore the tap will have to come off. But that does not alter the legality of the tap until that time.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is another amendment that the government is seeking and with which the coalition agrees. That amendment deals with how the judicial officer should categorise the circumstances when the agency seeks a warrant. The amendment basically says that irrespective of whether or not those circumstances fit into a class under which the judicial officer can now issue a warrant&mdash;that is, a class one or two offence&mdash;those circumstances will be treated as though they are within that category for the purposes of that warrant. We agree with that extension. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I indicated earlier that the opposition is concerned about extending the capacity of police forces to intercept telephone lines. However, I also outlined earlier that these powers are suitably limited. One might say that this amendment extends the powers of police further, and to an extent it does. As I understand the situation, if one went to seek a warrant to tap a phone today under the circumstances which exist under this bill, one would not get it. The circumstances would not be considered to come under class one or two offences.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, the opposition says that that is fair enough. The circumstances outlined in the bill under which the government imagines one ought to be able to put a tap on without warrant are so limited that we do not believe it is worth not allowing the amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that my colleague Senator Spindler wants to move a few amendments. I hope I will not be misrepresenting the gist of them when I say they are as follows. Firstly, Senator Spindler is saying that if we are so worried about the difficulty police might have in getting hold of a Federal Court judge to issue the warrant and we want to allow these taps to go ahead in emergency situations, why not solve the problem another way and allow other judges to issue warrants, particularly Supreme Court judges. The opposition does not agree with that amendment. We are quite happy with the circumstances as they exist at the moment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Federal Court judges are available. There may have been occasions when there has been a huge difficulty in getting hold of a judge. We believe the purpose of this amendment is to solve that problem. We prefer the solution the government is offering to the one that the Democrats are offering. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats go further. They ask us to accept some fall back positions. They have asked us to consider whether we will accept a further amendment to the amendments already proposed. The Democrats are suggesting that where a warrant is required within the time defined as being `as soon as practicable', we should accept the addition of the words `but not later than 24 hours or as soon as practicable whichever comes sooner.'</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition says no to that amendment as well, the reason being that we believe that `as soon as practicable' is understood by the courts and it is terminology that they can easily use. The Democrats' proposal to allow an option of 24 hours does not help the situation much. It may encourage a situation in which the warrant is not sought as soon as it should be. This is not because the police forces are relying on any ambiguity but because the `as soon as practicable or not later than 24 hours' may be an incentive to go a bit slower. The opposition believes that `as soon as practicable' means just that and does not need any further definition. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats want to move a further amendment which requires that when a warrant is sought under these circumstances the police must report it to the ombudsman within seven days. At this stage, the opposition is not inclined to accept that proposal either. These matters have to be reported in any event, so we do not necessarily see that there is much to be gained by changing the time for reporting. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The upshot of the Democrats' proposals are that we do not like, and I do not imagine the government necessarily likes, an extension of the powers to tap telephones. We acknowledge that this extension is limited to where either a party or private citizen agrees or one party to the communication is a police officer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is further limited in the sense that where one party to the communication is a police officer there is a whole list of things that need to happen. As a consequence of one of our amendments, it has to be an emergency situation or there has to be a serious threat of injury to a party involved or a serious threat to property. In any event, as soon as practicable after the tap is put on a warrant needs to be sought. If the tap is not in accordance with the legislation it will not be able to be continued because the warrant will not be granted. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are talking about a very limited circumstance. It covers what is potentially a serious gap in the powers of the police at the moment. The opposition believes that by adding the requirement that a warrant be sought as soon as practicable, the civil liberties concerns are catered for. We do not believe that the Democrats' proposed amendments, while being in line with the general sentiment of concern about extra tapping, necessarily add anything to the legislation on a day-to-day basis. We support their sentiments, but we think that in practice the amendments at the coalface will not add up to much. So we are not inclined to support them. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Interceptions are currently permitted only under warrant in the following circumstances: firstly, by ASIO for national security purposes; secondly, in the case of narcotics offences such as drug importations under the Customs Act; and, thirdly, for law enforcement purposes for serious offences such as murder, kidnapping and serious fraud. It should be noted that state agencies can only obtain warrants to intercept telecommunication services in their own state.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the act stands, the responsibility for executing warrants lies with the Telecommunications Interception Division of the Federal Police. All intercepted signals are routed from the exchange identified in the warrant to the TID's facility in Canberra where the signal is recorded. This signal is then rerouted to the law enforcement agency which applied for the warrant. This arrangement has been criticised as being impractical and costly. This brings me to the first change that this bill seeks to make. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill proposes to replace the present system of routing interceptions through TID in Canberra with a new system which allows the intercepted signal to be received directly by the agency, but the TID maintains control of interceptions by a switch computer link. The claimed advantages of the system include increased signal quality and reliability and come with a greatly reduced cost of approximately $2 million for all agencies. We consider that first amendment uncontroversial and the Australian Democrats will certainly support it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second group of amendments, which we also consider to be uncontroversial, relate to the removal of the territorial limitation in the phone tapping process. A loophole appears to have arisen in the provisions of the act as a result of the restriction on state law enforcement agencies when they use warrants for interception. The restriction has apparently been exploited by those involved in criminal activities by simply moving from state to state. The bill therefore proposes to remove this territorial limitation provided that the agency can show a nexus between the investigation of an offence for which it has responsibility and the outside service it wishes to intercept. The Democrats will also support this amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a number of other relatively minor amendments. The bill also proposes to extend interceptions to include computer related offences under part VIA of the Crimes Act and the addition of the Queensland Criminal Justice Commission in the list of state agencies which are entitled to apply for warrants. The bill requires under section 99 the minister's annual report to parliament to include details of the use of the new powers to intercept calls without a warrant and details of the total costs of interception for law enforcement purposes. The Democrats see nothing controversial in those. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, a range of amendments in the bill causes us considerable concern from a civil liberties point of view. It is proposed to enable Federal Police or state police to intercept telecommunications without a warrant in two circumstances: firstly, to monitor or record telephone conversations to which the agencies are party, involving actual or threatened loss of life or threat of serious injury or of serious damage to property where there is urgency which does not permit application for a warrant to be made; and, secondly, to monitor or record telephone conversations of a likely recipient of kidnapping or extortion demands where they have that recipient's consent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Some amendments to these provisions were moved in the House of Representatives by the coalition and they have certainly improved these provisions. However, we still have considerable concern about the way in which the government seeks to overcome what could well be a shortcoming in the procedure. The first amendment which I will deal with is not likely to be accepted by either the coalition, as we have heard, or the government, as I have been advised. However, I have not been conclusively advised by the government whether it will accept my fall back amendments as foreshadowed, which I have discussed with the Minister representing the Attorney-General (Senator Bolkus) in the Senate. I look forward to the minister advising me. I trust that the government will see fit to mitigate some of the dangers to the rights of individuals that these measures entail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendments moved by the coalition in the House of Representatives resulted in the insertion of subclauses (6) and (7). These amendments make the emergency provisions less open ended in that they require, firstly, a warrant to be sought `as soon as practicable' after an interception occurs in an emergency situation without a warrant and, secondly, an interception to cease should the judge refuse the application for the warrant. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats do not believe that these amendments go far enough in addressing the civil liberties concerns associated with the use of interceptions without a warrant. We have received representations from numerous law societies and civil liberty organisations including the Law Council of Australia, the New South Wales Council of Civil Liberties, the Law Institute of Victoria, the Queensland Council of Civil Liberties, the New South Wales Law Society and the Victorian Council of Civil Liberties, all of whom are totally opposed to granting police the power to intercept without a warrant even in such emergency situations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as those organisations are concerned, all the coalition amendments do is shut the gate after the horse has bolted. The coalition amendments leave it open for the police to buy time to continue with an illegal interception because they need only bring an application for a warrant before a judge `as soon as practicable'. If there is an illegal interception, there is no recourse. The judge will simply direct that the interception shall cease. A further concern is that the police can use illegally obtained evidence in court. Under the rule in Bunning v. Cross, illegally obtained evidence is not prima facie inadmissible. Rather, the court has a discretion to exclude it on public policy grounds. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats believe that the provisions under the principal act are sufficient&mdash;that is before these amendments are introduced&mdash;to deal with emergency situations because, firstly, section 30 of the act already provides for interceptions by the carrier for tracing calls in an emergency situation without a warrant and, secondly, it is already possible under section 40 to apply for a warrant by making a telephone application. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The police have apparently expressed concerns about the difficulty of locating an `eligible judge', currently defined under the legislation as Federal Court judges only, to grant a telephone application in circumstances of emergency. It would seem that these amendments are a response to this concern. However, we think that these amendments are an overkill. Hence, the Australian Democrats will be voting against clause 10&mdash;that is my first amendment&mdash;and will be moving alternative amendments to address this concern of delay in emergency situations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The main amendment that we suggest, after rejecting section 10, is to increase the number of judges defined under the legislation as eligible to receive telephone applications. We do not believe that it is necessary to solve the problem that is obviously there&mdash;namely, to find a sufficient number of judges to make telephone applications quickly&mdash;simply by giving the power to the police. This was the burden of the complaints and submissions that we received from the various organisations, including the law councils and civil liberties councils, which I have enumerated. Rather than give this power to the police, they would like to see more judges appointed. There is really no reason why we cannot extend the power to receive telephone applications beyond Federal Court judges to include state and territory supreme court judges. To us this appears to be a much more sensible way to address this problem, which we do not deny. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition&mdash;and in particular&mdash;if, as seems likely, the amendment to remove clause 10 and to add the judges of state and territory supreme courts to the definition is not accepted, I will foreshadow two additional amendments. One of them would be to ensure that, if the police have moved to intercept telephone communications without a warrant in emergency situations, they should seek a warrant, certainly as soon as practicable&mdash;which was one of the amendments of the coalition&mdash;but no later than 24 hours after the interception has occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot agree with the argument that was put forward by Senator Vanstone that `as soon as practicable' is adequately defined in usage in our courts. It seems to me to be an extremely rubbery concept. I have come across the use of this term, for instance, in the anti-dumping legislation, under the customs legislation, where `as soon as practicable', in terms of making public a report submitted to the minister, extended not only beyond 24 hours but beyond two days, beyond four days and, in some cases, up to a week or more. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not accept, therefore, that there is a generally accepted time span which is defined by the term `as soon as practicable'. I would have thought that it was very worth while to introduce a safeguard by saying, `Certainly do it as soon as practicable, but no later than 24 hours', because every additional hour, every additional day, means that people are having their private telephone conversations intercepted without warrant. I would suggest that this is a practice that we should not condone. While we realise that there could be pressing circumstances in which this must be done, or should be done, if the additional judges are not appointed, then at least we should try to limit that period as much as we can. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second amendment that I am foreshadowing requires notification within seven days to the Ombudsman's office when interceptions have been commenced by police without a warrant. That is not as revolutionary a provision as one might think. At the moment, a report of interceptions must be provided to the Ombudsman twice a year. We are now dealing with a circumstance in which the interception is being carried out without a warrant&mdash;in other words, without judicial protection of a citizen. It seems very reasonable that this should be reported to the Ombudsman, not only to keep a record of it, but to investigate if the circumstances of the incident justify it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that the amendments that have been proposed by the government are of great concern. We believe that, to some extent at least, the dangers could be minimised by more regular and thorough reporting to the Ombudsman in situations in which interceptions will be carried out without warrants and in which the civil liberties of citizens are at risk. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Telecommunications (Interception) Amendment Bill 1993 is a very important piece of legislation. It is important because it relates to the privacy which we all enjoy as Australian citizens. The coalition recognises that we need to have a balance between that privacy and the powers which our law enforcement agencies require in order to ensure that they are able to control criminal activities. It is a difficult subject. In many ways, whatever action is taken is likely to offend one group or another, as Senator Spindler could attest to from the number of representations he has had. The coalition's position has always been consistent. We have repeatedly taken the view, in this chamber and in the other place, that crime cannot be tolerated and that we must make every endeavour to assure, by any means, that it is removed from our society. We would all be aware that there have been many recent technological advances. In fact, as senators, we have benefited greatly from those technological advances in the operation of our offices. However, any new advances create new opportunities for the criminal element and, therefore, may require amendments to the powers afforded to our law enforcement officers.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill before us today amends the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979 by introducing a new range of powers under the act. It will make available a new procedure by which warrants issued to state police forces and agencies may be executed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In line with the new technological advances which I outlined previously, there will be a new computer-controlled system known as the TIRAC which will allow state agencies to receive the intercepted signal without its being routed through Canberra. In the past, the procedure was extremely time consuming and there was a loss of signal quality. It is important to understand that the Federal Police will still be the responsible authority in this matter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will also introduce a central register of warrants, showing the particulars of all warrants under the act, and it will allow emergency interception by state and federal police authorities in a range of emergency situations. In the past, criminal elements have sought to evade aspects of the act by moving around the country. These amendments will also allow warrants of interception to be issued outside the state boundaries where necessary. As I have said before, the coalition has supported the general thrust of this bill, and I believe it will be supported by the Australian community in the main. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am also pleased that the government, and in particular my Tasmanian colleague the Minister for Justice, the honourable member for Denison (Mr Kerr), saw fit to incorporate into the bill the amendments proposed by the opposition in the other place. I add my congratulations to those of Senator Spindler and others to the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) on his success in having those amendments adopted by the government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A number of concerns have been expressed by the Privacy Law Committee and the criminal law section of the Law Council of Australia, amongst others, in relation to the introduction of interceptions without a warrant in crisis situations. Many legal and civil libertarian groups contacted the coalition to express the view that such new powers went beyond an acceptable limit of checks and balances. It seems that they also spent a fair amount of time talking to Senator Spindler about this. The coalition supports those concerns, but at the same time we need to accept that law enforcement agencies must be able to respond immediately to a crisis such as a kidnapping, an extortion attempt or a siege. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the government's original proposal, in the situation of exceptional circumstances such as a siege where it is impossible to apply for a warrant, it is possible for an interception to be initiated without a warrant. We believe that under those circumstances it should be a requirement that a warrant for interception be sought as soon as is possible and should that warrant be refused the interception must cease immediately. I am sure that most people would consider these to have been reasonable safeguards. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other case in which the government was prepared to allow an interception to occur without a warrant was in relation to a kidnapping or an attempted extortion. Again, whilst the coalition accepted that in such cases an interception should be allowed without a warrant, we nevertheless maintained that it should be a requirement that a warrant be applied for as soon as possible. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that one of the most important amendments contained in this bill is the provision for warrants of interception to be issued outside the boundaries of a state. Under subsection 39(3) of the old act, it was impossible to obtain such a warrant and it was widely recognised that this defect acted as an advantage in encouraging those involved in criminal activities to move from state to state. Such a restriction was unacceptable and the new provision will allow state authorities to exercise greater control over those who have sought to abuse the system. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many Australians would be concerned, I believe, about the interception of telecommunications without added safeguards. As I mentioned before, it is essentially a privacy issue and a matter of obtaining a balance between privacy and law enforcement. I believe it is important to place on record the comments of the Australian Law Reform Commission 1993 report on privacy which sought to provide a theoretical basis for a definition of privacy. That report claimed:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . an individual's claim to personal autonomy involves a claim to have some control over the way in which he interacts with others. This implies the ability to exclude others from conversations or communications into which he enters and the ability to prevent . . . other people spying on his activities.</PARA>
<PARA>Last week in this place I brought to the attention of the Senate the case of Mr Geoffrey Marr. Honourable senators who were here at the time and took notice of what I had to say&mdash;I suppose there are one or two&mdash;would probably be familiar by now with the fact that Mr Marr is a former Telstra employee who had been the subject of a most unacceptable investigation by Telstra. The activities of Telstra in intercepting telecommunications are also covered by this act. I am concerned, and I believe the Marr case highlights this fact, that we need to place greater controls over the interception capacities of Telstra. I have already stated that the bill before us today requires law enforcement authorities to obtain an interception warrant, but currently no such provision applies to Telstra. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Mr Marr's case, both his private telephone and his work telephone were connected to Telstra's CCAE recording equipment for up to two months without obtaining a warrant. I consider this to be a gross invasion of his privacy. Telstra has claimed that such action was necessary because of concerns it had regarding the activities of Mr Marr, but, as it turned out, such concerns were unsubstantiated and were later rejected. I believe that if Telstra is to be empowered to monitor telecommunications then it needs to have a much better case than just a gut feeling, which it appears was all that was required in the Marr case. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other issue which the Marr case raised was the failure of Telstra to retain records relating to its interception. It is a requirement for Telstra to maintain its records for three years, but in the Marr case the tape appears to have been mysteriously corrupted and the records destroyed. This was in direct contravention of Telstra's own guidelines and, in addition, creates great uncertainty about the ability of Telstra to adequately manage such wide-ranging powers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I mentioned initially, this is a very difficult issue. No-one would deny the right of law enforcement officers to take whatever means are necessary to adequately investigate criminal matters. At the same time, the Marr case indicates that under some sections of this act there are not adequate requirements in relation to the activities of Telstra and I believe it is a matter which we should examine in the near future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have spoken to Mr Marr and I know that he feels very disturbed that his privacy should be encroached on in this manner and I believe anyone here in this chamber would share that view. I would also argue that, as elected representatives, when the balance tips too far we have a moral obligation to act to ensure that the right of privacy for the individual is adequately safeguarded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a postscript to what I have just said, I would like to share an experience my office was involved in only last week. I will let honourable senators draw their own conclusions, but it certainly disturbed me. I do not know whether other senators have had similar sorts of experiences. My office was endeavouring to send a fax to a solicitor in Sydney who was acting, coincidentally, on behalf of a former Telecom employee who had raised doubts about certain management practices. My staff tried several times without success. They checked the number and found that it was the correct number. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, they thought it may have been a telephone number so they dialled it. The phone was answered and the voice at the other end said, `Australian Federal Police, major crime investigation'. My staff were very concerned; they immediately hung up. After they had calmed down a bit, they tried the fax again and&mdash;surprise, surprise&mdash;it was transmitted successfully. I do not know whether it was just a crossed line or a coincidence, but it seems very much of a coincidence to me. I just wonder whether any other senators in this place have had those sorts of experiences from time to time. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To deal with this problem, the government amendment provides that where an act does not constitute a class 1 or class 2 offence, it is to be taken to constitute a class 2 offence for the purpose of attracting the warranting provisions. The effect is that the accountability mechanisms which are associated with the issue of warrants, such as regular inspections by the Ombudsman, will be incorporated. The amendment will also remove any uncertainty where the act which has given rise to the emergency is a generalised threat to kill someone, as in some siege situation, or a threat to kill oneself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Speaking to the number of amendments which were moved by Senator Spindler on behalf of the Australian Democrats, my first advice here deals with three of them. Those three amendments would do three things: firstly, broaden the pool of eligible judges to include state supreme court judges; secondly, remove the Attorney-General's discretion to nominate judges; and, thirdly, omit the provisions that will enable police to engage in participant monitoring in emergencies. They are in clauses 1 and 2 of the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the first point, at present only judges of a court created by parliament may be nominated as eligible judges. While the inclusion of state supreme court judges within the category of judges who may be nominated to issue warrants may have some practical advantages, the government is not convinced that those advantages would outweigh the disadvantages of the proposal. In particular, the proposal could be seen as placing at risk the current Commonwealth control arrangements which contribute to the maintenance of an appropriate system of accountability. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the second point, the removal of the Attorney-General's discretion to nominate judges for the purpose of dealing with warrant applications would mean that a warrant application could be made to any judge of the High Court, the Federal Court, the Family Court or of a state supreme court who had consented to being nominated. This amendment would considerably increase the number of judges vested with this power. As a matter of practice, nominations to date have been restricted to judges of the Federal Court. The removal of the discretion to nominate particular judges may also place at risk the constitutional validity of the scheme for judicial supervision of telecommunications interception. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of Hilton v. Wells 1985, 157 CLR, page 57, the High Court rejected a challenge to the power to issue warrants which was based on the characterisation of the power as non-judicial. The court held that the power was not conferred on the Federal Court but on the judges individually as designated persons. These provisions were strengthened in 1987 following the court's decision. But the proposed amendment may give rise to an argument that the parliament was conferring a warrant issuing power on all federal courts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In relation to the third point, which is clause 2, removal of the provisions relating to emergencies would mean that unacceptable delays in dealing with emergencies would continue to occur. Increasing the number of judges who may issue warrants might alleviate the problem of finding a judge at short notice. But, even if more judges were to become available, it would still take time to prepare warrant applications, affidavits and the like, and to meet the carrier's requirements for the connection of intercepts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sieges, hostage taking and kidnapping, thankfully, are not common in Australia, but when they occur it is imperative that they be dealt with effectively and as quickly as possible. The longer any delay, the greater the likelihood of lives being lost. The government believes that the scheme embodied in the bill represents an appropriate balance between the needs of law enforcement in such situations and privacy concerns. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So, for those reasons, the government opposes those three amendments proposed by the Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are a further two amendments which I understand the Democrats have put up as a fall back position. One requires police to seek a warrant within 24 hours of commencing their participant monitoring, and the other requires police to report certain matters to the ombudsman within seven days of the emergency. The first amendment is unexceptionable but unnecessary. The proposed provision already requires police to seek a warrant as soon as practicable after the event. Their diligence in doing so is subject to inspection by the ombudsman. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second amendment is, in some ways, redundant and is open to a number of objections. It would suggest that the ombudsman would have power to comment on the exercise of the judge's discretion in issuing a warrant. This would be unacceptable to judges. It would need to be redrafted to take account of the scheme of the act, which provides for actions of the Australian Federal Police to be inspected by the Commonwealth Ombudsman and actions of state police to be inspected by state agencies, usually the state ombudsman under state legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The amendment would be superimposed on the accountability scheme which already exists in the act. It appears to be based on a misconception that the ombudsman has a power to report on the propriety of individual warrants. All that he could do with the information would be to include it in his regular report to the Attorney-General. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may be useful to argue for a greater role for the ombudsman generally under the act than was considered appropriate by the joint select committee which considered telecommunications interception in 1986. As a result, the government will also oppose the Democrats' two fall back amendments. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Today is a milestone.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A response to another milestone:  the High Court's decision in the Mabo case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The High Court has determined that Australian law should not, as Justice Brennan said, be "frozen in an era of racial discrimination". Its decision in the Mabo case ended the pernicious legal deceit of terra nullius for all of Australia&mdash;and for all time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Court described the situation faced by Aboriginal people after European settlement. The Court saw a "conflagration of oppression and conflict which was, over the following century, to spread across the continent to dispossess, degrade and devastate the Aboriginal people". They faced "deprivation of the religious, cultural and economic sustenance which the land provides" and were left as "intruders in their own homes".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To deny these basic facts would be to deny history&mdash;and no self-respecting democracy can deny its history. To deny these facts would be to deny part of ourselves as Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is not guilt:  it is recognising the truth. The truth about the past and, equally, the truth about our contemporary reality. It is not a symptom of guilt to look reality in the eye&mdash;it is a symptom of guilt to look away, to deny what is there.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But what is worse than guilt, surely, is irresponsibility. To see what is there and not act upon it&mdash;that is a symptom of weakness. That is failure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, some seem to see the High Court as having just handed Australia a problem. The fact is that the High Court has handed this nation an opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">When the Prime Minister spoke last December in Redfern at the Australian launch of the International Year for the World's Indigenous People, he said we could make the Mabo decision an historic turning point:  the basis of a new relationship between indigenous and other Australians.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For the seventeen months since the High Court handed down its decision, the Government has worked to meet this challenge.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Consultations and Objectives</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Prime Minister has made our response to the Mabo decision a personal priority. The Mabo Committee of Ministers has worked tirelessly. A team of officials has provided continuous support.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Right from the start, the Government recognised the national and historic importance of a proper response to the Mabo decision, and put in place a year-long process of consultation and detailed policy development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Also right from the start, we made our twin goals clear:  to do justice to the Mabo decision in protecting native title and to ensure workable, certain, land management.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We held extensive talks with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations, State and Territory Governments and the mining and pastoral industries. Our processes were open. We kept on talking&mdash;always on the basis of accepting the Mabo decision and wanting to make it work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One year after the decision, as part of our community consultations, we released a public Discussion Paper setting out the complex legal and other issues frankly and clearly, as well as examining possible ways to respond to them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Continuing this deliberate and open approach, on 2 September we released a detailed draft Outline of possible Commonwealth native title legislation as a focus for public comment and for discussions with Aboriginal and industry representatives and with the States and Territories.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These were positive, detailed talks. They raised many important matters which have been taken up in the legislation I am presenting here today.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I won't say it was easy. Good policy rarely is. And the result will not&mdash;and could never&mdash;satisfy everyone. If it is to be good legislation it shouldn't even try.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This legislation is principled and workable, the product of a sustained and thorough policy process.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this has been a huge undertaking on a subject of immense complexity. The rewards for the nation of getting it right are also immense. To retreat from this challenge, to say that this opportunity is beyond our reach as a nation, beyond the limits of our collective intellect and goodwill, would be to betray not just the indigenous people of Australia but ourselves, our traditions and our future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is to be hoped, Mr President, that those who have so far confined their role in Mabo to spoiling and over-simplification will now bring a constructive approach to their examination of this proposal.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The process has already seen much goodwill in the community, not least from people and groups whose interests and points of view are very different.  Let us  carry  that  goodwill  into  this Parliament.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Key Aspects of the Legislation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill has four key aspects:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">ungrudging and unambiguous recognition and protection of native title;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">provision for clear and certain validation of past acts&mdash;including grants and laws&mdash;if they have been invalidated because of the existence of native title;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a just and practical regime governing future grants and acts affecting native title; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">rigorous, specialised and accessible tribunal and court processes for determining claims to native title and for negotiation and decisions on proposed grants over native title land.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, this is a comprehensive and detailed Bill&mdash;as it has to be. Honourable Senators will find that Part A of the Explanatory Memorandum provides a useful overview.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Let me now address a number of key points.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The International Convention and the RDA</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The legislation complies with Australia's international obligations, in particular under the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As indicated in the preamble, the legislation constitutes a special measure under the Racial Discrimination Act for the benefit of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people&mdash;providing as it does significant benefits such as special processes for determining native title; protection of native title rights; just terms compensation for any extinguishment of native title; a special right of negotiation on grants affecting native title land; designation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations to assist claimants; and establishment of a national Land Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">State and Territory Governments</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the Bill recognises that the bulk of dealings in land are done by the States and Territories. The Bill does not seek to change this situation&mdash;on the contrary it is properly sensitive to the prerogatives of the States. The Commonwealth is, however, playing its proper role in setting national standards and establishing a national framework  for dealing with native title.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will enable State and Territory governments to validate their past grants with certainty provided they adhere to the standards set out in the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill specifically provides for States and Territories to propose their own tribunals and arrangements for, firstly, determining native title claims and, secondly, deciding whether proposed grants affecting native title may be made. Provision is made for Commonwealth recognition of these State arrangements, and the criteria for this are set out clearly in the Bill.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Determination of native title claims may be in the Federal Court or a recognised State or Territory body. Appeals must, however, be in the same stream in which the case was initiated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In regard to decisions on land use, where we have recognised State and Territory processes the Commonwealth will step back. State bodies, not the Commonwealth tribunal, will decide whether grants should proceed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such States and Territories will also be able to over-ride tribunal decisions in the State interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">States and Territories who wish to see a national system with proper recognition of their land management responsibilities, and with fairness for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, will find it in this Bill. We will be happy to cooperate with them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">But we cannot accept West Australian style legislation involving:</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">compulsory, wholesale extinguishment of native title&mdash;a title embodied in the common law, and the inherent right of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders who meet the criteria</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the mandatory replacement of this by a statutory title&mdash;a title only conferred at the pleasure of government, and which can be extinguished in particular cases virtually at a Minister's whim</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">a land management regime which provides only the flimsiest protections for Aboriginal people&mdash;protections far less than other land holders enjoy.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If a government wishes to introduce a Bill permitting the voluntary conversion of native title to a statutory title it may do so under clause 20 of our Bill. But let Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people choose for themselves whether they want the native title affirmed by the High Court or some statutory alternative.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">The Commonwealth's Approach to Native Title</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, native title is derived from the traditional laws and customs of indigenous people. These may vary considerably across Australia. This Bill does not codify native title rights. Rather it provides that, in determining native title claims, the Federal or State bodies involved will ascertain the rights in each particular case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because the foundation of our position is acceptance of the High Court's decision, the Bill protects native title to the maximum extent practicable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the Bill, native title, once determined, will be held by a body corporate representing the native title holders' concerned. This will facilitate dealings in relation to the land and will endure over time.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Validation and Security for Existing Grants</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Equally, it is essential to safeguard the rights of those who hold existing grants of interests in land.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill sets out a regime for the States to validate grants with certainty. It does not prevent States and Territories from attempting to validate on their own terms. But they would do so at their own legal risk. And the Commonwealth would obviously not, in that case, help meet any resulting costs.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Validation covers not only past invalid grants&mdash;made before 31 December 1993&mdash;but renewals and extensions as defined in the Bill. It also covers invalid actions of government. And it covers laws made before 30 June 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Validation by the Commonwealth, or in line with the Commonwealth regime, limits the extinguishment of native title. Only validated freehold grants, residential, commercial and pastoral or agricultural leases, and validated Crown actions basically involving permanent public works, will extinguish native title.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Naturally, existing reservations for the benefit of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people will be preserved. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I draw attention also to the recording in the preamble of the Bill of the Government's view that under the common law past valid freehold and leasehold grants extinguish native title.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is therefore no obstacle or hindrance to renewal of pastoral leases in the future, whether validated or already valid.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Validation of mining leases will not extinguish native title rights, which can again be exercised in full after the grant, and any legitimate renewals, have expired.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is not discrimination against the mining industry, or some radical departure from existing practice. Let me quote, for example, section 113 of the Western Australian Mining Act:  "When a mining tenement expires or is surrendered or forfeited, the owner of the land to which the mining tenement related may take possession of the land forthwith . . . ". Mr President, how can we offer native title holders any less?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Future Regime</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, as well as clearing up the uncertainties of the past, this Bill provides for the future&mdash;it delivers justice and certainty for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, industry, and the whole community. It provides for the determination of native title and for dealings over native title land.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Generally, governments may make grants over native title land only if those grants could be made over freehold title.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This test is founded directly on a principle of non-discrimination. A government may not make a freehold or leasehold grant to somebody else over your or my freehold. If our title is to be extinguished, a government must acquire it and only for the purposes set down in compulsory acquisition legislation, and you or I must be given the protections involved. By contrast, a mining grant can generally be made over your or my freehold.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It will be exactly the same for native title. This is a clear, fair test which land managers in all jurisdictions can use. It does not mean that native title will amount to the equivalent of freehold in all cases.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where native title has been established, or where there is a registered claimant in the Federal or State systems, the Bill provides a process of negotiation and, if necessary, determination by the tribunal on whether a proposed grant should proceed. The relevant Minister will be able to override tribunal decisions in the State or national interest.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This emphasis on Aboriginal people having a right to be asked about actions affecting their land accords with their deeply felt attachment to land. But it is also squarely in line with any principle of fair play. It is not a veto.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The time frames set for notification, negotiation and arbitration are tight but fair. Provision is made for expedited processes where a particular grant would not involve major disturbance to land or interference with the life of Aboriginal communities. Moreover, classes of grant can be excluded from the negotiation process altogether where they would have minimal effect on any native title. Certain prospecting and exploration permits would be likely to fall within this category.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where native title has not yet been determined, Governments will be able to ascertain whether there is a credible native title interest in land over which they wish to make a grant.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Also, for example, a mining company operating on what has been assumed to be vacant Crown land will be able to seek a determination whether native title exists.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Normal compulsory acquisition procedures, including a right to compensation, will apply to native title land. This means that Governments can acquire land from native title holders, just as they can from other land holders, for public purposes such as infrastructure development.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The integrity of the land management system will thus be maintained. But we insist this be achieved in a way which respects the profound Aboriginal connection to the land and provides appropriate protections.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill explicitly recognises that native title holders may choose to surrender inalienable native title on terms acceptable to them, for example to exchange it for a statutory title. For example, native title holders may wish to lease their land for a tourism or other commercial venture.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill recognises further, that there may be cases where regional negotiation is the most efficient way to avoid or resolve conflicts over land use for large areas. Where we judge this to be a promising approach, the Commonwealth is prepared to facilitate such negotiation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Access to Tribunal and Court Processes</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Much of the Bill concerns detailed arrangements to establish a National Native Title Tribunal and to develop a capacity in the Federal Court to determine native title and compensation claims. The Tribunal will conciliate and determine proposed uses of native title land where there are no recognised State or Territory bodies. The Bill sets out criteria for Commonwealth recognition of State bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">However, beyond this, the Government takes the view that a right cannot be said fully to exist unless people are empowered to pursue it. This is especially true for Aboriginal people, who are, as a group, the most disadvantaged Australians. Claimants for native title will need assistance to pursue their claims.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will therefore, under the Bill, determine representative Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations to assist claimants. They will not have a monopoly on representing native title claimants:  individual claimants or groups of claimants can go elsewhere if they wish.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Representative organisations will also assist in coordinating claims:  it is important that claims come forward in a sensible, organised way. They will also be a channel for notification of proposed actions affecting native title as provided for in the Bill. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The organisations will, of course, be fully accountable for any funds provided.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Where third parties are engaged in litigation involving native title, the Attorney-General will have a capacity to provide funding for legal assistance, should he consider it appropriate. The Government will be consulting key stakeholders&mdash;such as Aboriginal representatives and the NFF in establishing the guidelines that the Attorney-General will rely on in taking decisions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Industry Interests</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, industry gains a very great deal from this Bill because it imposes clear, statutory rules for land use where the Mabo decision left uncertainty.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill does not lock land away. On the contrary, as I have explained we are not setting up complicated barriers to mining exploration or operations. Where State processes, for example Mining Warden's courts, are suitably supplemented to take sensitive account of native title interests and are recognised by the Commonwealth, they&mdash;not the Commonwealth tribunal&mdash;will make decisions on mining applications. In our negotiations with the States, some constructive proposals have already been made in this regard, which are acceptable in principle to the Government.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Moreover, there is specific provision for matters decided at the exploration stage not to be re-opened when mining is being considered. Protections in State and Territory laws against over-bidding by another company remain. And existing mining operations will not face additional conditions or costs, for example for land rehabilitation, because of native title.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill will ensure the validity of legislative regimes governing economic activities offshore&mdash;those relating to commercial fisheries and petroleum extraction operations being of particular note. However, recognising the different circumstances applying offshore, while any future grants or interests will have to be issued in a non-discriminatory manner, they will not be subject to the freehold test or to the associated negotiation and arbitration procedures.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In general the Bill provides that governments can confirm any existing ownership of natural resources, including forests and minerals. But any future acquisition of natural resources from native title holders must&mdash;properly&mdash;be on a non-discriminatory basis.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides that Aboriginal people who own or acquire a pastoral lease, and who also would satisfy native title criteria but for the prior extinguishment of their rights, may choose to claim native title.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This is no back door:  to get native title, the same criterion of continuing connection with the land will need to be satisfied. And the Bill provides that the pastoral lease may be maintained, so that the land need not be lost to pastoral use. The Government remains totally committed to a strong, viable pastoral industry:  and to Aboriginal people's participation in it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill therefore offers clear provisions for dealings in native title land and certainty to our great resource-based industries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Application of Laws to Native Title</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides that laws and regulations applying generally in the community also apply to native title land provided they are consistent with this Bill. This covers such matters as heritage protection, environmental and health controls and fishery regulation. Native title land is thus kept fully within the reach of Australian law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill allows existing access to beaches, waterways and other recreation areas to be confirmed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Many specific laws affecting use and management of land are likely to need review to take account of native title. For example, the Commonwealth will, over the next two years, review our laws to better recognise native title hunting, fishing and gathering rights. We will be asking the States and Territories to do the same. I note too that the Bill does not affect rights under Commonwealth land rights legislation. We will be looking at a range of Commonwealth legislation, including Commonwealth land rights laws in light of the native title regime.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Compensation</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, in the interests of fairness for existing grant holders, where compensation is owed to native title holders for validation of past grants, it will  be  government,  not  the  grant  holder,  who pays.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We recognise that the Commonwealth should make a proper contribution towards compensation costs. We will have further discussions with the States and Territories who are willing to join with us in this national approach, as well as on cost sharing for the legal and administrative regime.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Just terms will be payable for extinguishment of native title. We take the view that any special attachment to the land will be taken into account in determining just terms. Compensation for impairment, for instance for surface disturbance caused by mining, will be on the basis of existing State and Territory regimes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Importantly, the Bill makes provision that compensation may be non-monetary, for example, the granting to native title holders of alternative land. It permits such issues to be raised in compensation negotiations, including where existing grants have been validated.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Land Acquisition</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has always recognised that despite its historic significance, the Mabo decision gives little more than a sense of justice to those Aboriginal communities whose native title has been extinguished or lost without consultation, negotiation or compensation. Their dispossession has been total, their loss has been complete.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government shares the view of ATSIC, Aboriginal organisations and the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, that justice, equality and fairness demand that the social and economic needs of these communities must be addressed as an essential step towards reconciliation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">While these communities remain dispossessed of land, their economic marginalisation and their sense of injury continues.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As a first step, we are establishing a land fund. It will enable indigenous people to acquire land and to manage and maintain it in a sustainable way in order to provide economic, social and cultural benefits for future generations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Addressing dispossession is essential but will not be enough to overcome the legacy of the past and achieve reconciliation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In a further stage, we will, in consultation and negotiation with ATSIC and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations, look at ways to increase the participation of Aboriginal people in Australian economic life and to safeguard and develop Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We will invite ATSIC and the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, in consultation with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander organisations, to develop proposals and to provide formal advice following the important National Reconciliation Convention to be held in October 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What we will be looking for is constructive, realistic proposals, which will develop a positive community consensus and contribute to a lasting reconciliation. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Implementation</EMPHASIS> </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the Government will establish a Task Force of officials within the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet, to oversee the practical implementation of this legislation. We are also providing the necessary funding this financial year for the Task Force to carry out its work.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">No one should doubt our willingness to commit the effort and resources to make the scheme work, and work efficiently.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the Bill is approved by Parliament, by 1 January 1994 most major aspects of the future regime will come into force. Aspects which depend on the establishment of new institutions will come into effect as soon as possible on a date to be prescribed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2"><EMPHASIS FONT-WEIGHT="BOLD">Conclusion</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, the land management challenges posed by Mabo are hugely important and they are comprehensively dealt with in the Bill. But let me conclude, as I started, on the wider significance of the Mabo case.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For today, as a nation, we take a major step towards a new and better relationship between Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal Australians. We give the indigenous people of Australia, at last, the standing they are owed as the original occupants of this continent. The standing they are owed as seminal contributors to our national life and culture: as workers, soldiers, explorers, artists, sportsmen and women&mdash;as a defining element in the character of this nation. The standing they are owed as victims of grave injustices, as people who have survived the loss of their land and the shattering of their culture.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Mr President, who can say that we would have survived these experiences as well as they have?  Today we offer a modicum of justice to indigenous Australians because we have reached an understanding of their experience&mdash;and our responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Today we move that much closer to a united Australia which respects this land of ours, values the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander heritage and provides justice and equity for all.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For already in the process of developing the Bill we have learned a great deal about each other and how to work together. We have extended the frontier of our mutual understanding.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Perhaps the most outstanding, but by no means the only, example of this has been the participation of representatives of the combined Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Organisation Working Party in the unprecedented negotiations leading to this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In hailing what she termed "a remarkable settlement and historic agreement", Lois O'Donoghue, the Chairperson of ATSIC&mdash;said, and I quote, "indigenous affairs will never be the same again in our nation".</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is for that reason above all, Mr President, that I commend this Bill to the Senate.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate has before it two bills, the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1993 and the Income Tax (Franking Deficit) Amendment Bill 1993. The latter bill, the Income Tax (Franking Deficit) Amendment Bill, formally imposes what is known as a franking deficit tax. The majority of the changes introduced by Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 3), including the amendments to be introduced during the committee stage, are indeed welcomed by the opposition.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, much to my dismay, there are two major changes in this bill which will cause some perhaps unintended consequences and some difficulties for the respective industries, namely, the petroleum mining industry and the life assurance industry. I refer in particular to the amendments concerned with the calculation of apportionment of tax deductions for life assurance companies and also the proposed abhorrent retrospective amendment disallowing deductions involved in certain overseas petroleum operations. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from these two issues, the amendment bill (No. 3) contains amendments which are largely of a technical nature and involve minor changes introducing a degree of flexibility to the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Assessment Act 1987 as a result of the report to parliament on the operations of the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Assessment Act at the end of 1992. These amendments enable exploration expenditure to be offset against receipts from other projects. There are minor changes to sales tax and also to insolvency legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Arising from the budget 1993-94 announcements, there are provisions for relief for small businesses by deferring the initial payment of company tax in respect of the 1993-94 year, a move also welcomed by the opposition, and the exempting from income tax of income derived by non-profit organisations established for the purpose of promoting the development of tourism. There is also provision for sales tax exemption for goods used in various activities of the RSPCA. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also makes changes to the imputation system as a result of the reduction in company tax for the year 1993-94 and later years of income, whereby the corporate tax rate is dropped from 39 to 33 per cent. A single franking account currently in existence will be replaced by dual franking accounts. This will allow companies to frank dividends with either the 39 per cent or the 33 per cent imputation credits tax, depending on the rate of tax which gave rise to the imputation for which credit was paid. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This new dual franking regime is indeed welcome because it avoids the loss of a franking credit which may otherwise have arisen from the drop in the corporate tax rate from 39 to 33 per cent. Previously, corporations did suffer a loss of a franking credit, particularly the last time that the rate dropped from 39 to 33 per cent. So this new dual approach is indeed welcome. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I call upon the tax authorities and professional bodies to make all corporations aware of the need to establish these new structures because, whether or not the mistake is intentional, these severe penalties are attached when errors are made. So I think it is incumbent upon government as well as the professional bodies to make well known throughout the corporate community the need for the establishment of these new structures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Two accounts will be required&mdash;to be known as class A and class B franking accounts. The franking debits and credits arising in relation to the tax paid for 1992-93 and earlier years of income, including a credit that arises because of a franking surplus at the end of the 1993-94 year, will be posted as a class A franking account, and franking debits and credits arising in relation to the tax paid for 1993-94 in latter years on income will be posted to the class B franking account. The company rate for these years is the new lower rate of 33 per cent. The 39 per cent rate is for franking accounts A and the 33 per cent rate is for franking accounts B. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The substantial percentage drop in the corporate rate has caused other consequential changes which have been debated in this place previously, giving rise particularly to many legislative changes to the fringe benefits tax legislation because of the substantial gap that is in place between the corporate rate and the maximum personal rate plus the Medicare levy. This substantial gap gives rise to certain ingenious tax planning involving tax minimisation schemes which the government has yet to pick up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also proposes amendments to capital gains provisions so that they do not apply to capital gains and losses realised on the disposal of policies of life assurance or rights under policies of life assurance by complying superannuation funds, complying approved deposit funds and pooled superannuation funds or trusts. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition, once again, the provisional tax provisions of the tax law have been amended to maintain the current uplift factor. It is now eight per cent for the calculation of provisional tax for the 1993-94 income year. In fact, the Senate would be well aware of my concerns about the operations of the provisional tax. Firstly, the eight per cent uplift factor is unrealistic, unjust and unduly harsh, considering that we are in a recession, considering the low rates of interest and considering the low inflation factor. The bill makes changes to fringe benefits tax and the superannuation guarantee. These are largely of a technical nature and I will not address them in my speech. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the proposed retrospective tax measures. The Income Tax Assessment Act will be retrospectively amended from 20 August 1990 to ensure that deductions are not available in Australia for expenditures incurred in carrying out mining, quarrying or exploration activities associated with petroleum which do not generate assessable income in Australia. These changes refer particularly to the petroleum industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw to the attention of the Senate, in particular that of the Australian Democrats who can have a significant say in this outcome, that the professional bodies&mdash;the Taxation Institute of Australia, the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants, the Institute of Chartered Accountants and the Law Council of Australia&mdash;have all expressed grave concerns about the amendments as the government has decided to overcome an apparently defective drafting passed into law by amending the existing law retrospectively. The law was quite clear in terms of the statute passed by this parliament. This is the worry. It will be back-dated to 1990. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The joint submission of these bodies to the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) refers to a press release issued by him which indicates that under a technical defect in the law a mining company could claim a deduction in Australia for expenditure incurred offshore, notwithstanding that the income from the offshore operation was not taxable in Australia. I was rather disturbed at the role that some of my colleagues on the scrutiny of bills committee played in relation to this very important issue. They did not inquire as to the other side of the picture; they just took advice from one side. They put so much emphasis on a technical defect that they were led to a wrong conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The submission that I have referred to states that unfortunately amendments made by the 1991 measures actually deleted the words `in Australia' from the relevant provisions. That is black letter law. It resulted in a change to the Income Tax Assessment Act permitting taxpayers to claim a deduction whether or not the expenditure incurred outside Australia was carried out for the purpose of gaining or producing assessable income. The submission points out that the explanatory memorandum at the time did not make clear what the full intention of the change was to be. The law clearly needs to be amended. We and this community at large know that the government has the right to amend the law. That is not in dispute. However, the law should not be retrospectively changed where it will adversely affect taxpayers who acted on the law as it stood at the relevant time. The general principle as to retrospective taxation legislation cannot be swept aside by a government merely because of a technical defect so as to significantly disadvantage those taxpayers who have relied on the law as its stands. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My other concern is the length of time that it took the tax office and the government to bring about this change&mdash;two years. The apparent effect of the 1991 amendments was raised on two separate occasions by the professional bodies during regular consultations with the tax office. The first occasion was through the foreign income measures subcommittee of the National Taxation Liaison Group on 26 September 1991 when the industry and its agents brought it to the attention of the tax office. The second occasion was at a subsequent meeting in February 1992. The tax office merely noted at the first meeting that the matter would be examined and at the latter meeting that it was still being examined. There was no concern, no indication and no signal of change. It has all the hallmarks of a delay and an indifference similar to that which was adopted by the office during the horrendous days of the bottom of the harbour schemes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has to be some sort of sanction by this parliament for inaction by the government, particularly in circumstances when it is going to take away a black letter law entitlement that was previously in place. Where the law is clear, people do not have to go back and read what is said in the budget, the second reading speeches and all of those sorts of things, because businesses do not have access to the sort of information that we assume that they have. The tax office and the government assume&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;We just assume that they have. We live in this ivory tower and we assume that everybody has this collection of records whereby they can have access to the inner feelings, emotions and meanings of the tax office. That just is not so in the real world. They are out there to earn a bob and arrange their affairs according to the law as it is made from time to time. They should be entitled to apply that until the law is prospectively&mdash;and not retrospectively&mdash;changed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the period of time that has elapsed since those meetings, it is not unreasonable for tax advisers to take the view that the tax office perhaps has accepted that the relevant provisions operate according to its black letter tenor, particularly given the absence of any timely response. Why not a press release? Why not a note in the subsequent minutes? The silence is really deafening and worrying in relation to this issue, or a decision to amend. A crucial point that we have to note&mdash;I think this is just as serious as the retrospective law&mdash;is that the proper administration of law depends on the cooperation and goodwill of the professional bodies. They get invited to these meetings to make these submissions. They put the case to the tax office, not the other way around. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In good faith, they put the cards on the table and they got no response, apart from its being looked at&mdash;it was under examination, et cetera. This goodwill will surely break down if the tax office and the government act retrospectively to the detriment of the professional bodies and their clients as a result of issues which they raise. This is the serious part. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A further complication arises because we understand that at least one private ruling&mdash;and maybe others&mdash;to particular persons acknowledges these expenses were properly deductible. However, I am aware of one circumstance where a claim was denied. These circumstances raise a very difficult situation. How can a party, having received a private ruling, get on in terms of a retrospective law? All taxpayers have to be treated in the same way on the same issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It needs to be stated that retrospective legislation has really been used as an instrument freely to deprive citizens of their right, but usually only by repressive and non-representative or non-democratic governments. Once we see it used in this way in a democratic and free society, as the Law Council and others say, it undermines the confidence of the community in the fairness and certainty of our laws. This change has caused queries from other major companies in this country about other possible retrospective legislation. I give notice that the opposition will be moving an amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is regrettable that this amendment will lack support from the Democrats and the Greens. Where are their democratic principles? Earlier, we heard Senator Spindler praising the Law Council for its various pronouncements and recommendations. On this occasion, it has issued a pronouncement. It has written a letter to the government expressing its concern, but it thumbs its nose when it suits. There needs to be a degree of consistency in terms of justice. That is what we were looking at in the previous issue where the Democrats were at pains to point out the position as put forward by the Law Council.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Explanatory Memorandum describing the changes to the relevant sections indicated that the effect of the amendments, for example, s.25 of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Taxation Laws Amendment Act 1991</EMPHASIS>, amending s.124AH, was to extend the exploration and prospecting provisions by allowing a deduction in respect of operations carried on both in and out of Australia as long as those operations were carried out for the purposes of gaining or producing assessable income.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Unfortunately, the amendments made by the 1991 measure by deleting the words "in Australia" from the relevant provisions resulted in a change to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Income Tax Assessment Act</EMPHASIS> permitting taxpayers to claim a deduction whether or not the expenditure incurred outside Australia was carried out for the purposes of gaining or producing assessable income. Whilst an explanatory memorandum may be of assistance in resolving ambiguity in a legislative provision or confirming its ordinary meaning, (see <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Acts Interpretation Act 1901</EMPHASIS>, s.15AB) it is the Acts of Parliament that taxpayers must ultimately rely upon when determining their legal rights and obligations. This is clearly acknowledged by the decision to amend the law. If the Explanatory Memorandum could determine the meaning of the section, no amendment would be necessary.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The professional bodies are, therefore, most concerned that you have decided to amend the existing law retrospectively to seek to overcome the apparently defective drafting passed into law by the Parliament. The professional bodies clearly recognise the right of the Government to amend the law from time to time. However, amendments should not be given retrospective effect where they will adversely affect taxpayers who have acted on the law as it stood at the relevant time. There is, of course, a general principle against retrospective taxing legislation. This cannot be swept aside merely to deal with a "technical" amendment if the effect of the retrospective change is to significantly disadvantage those taxpayers who have relied on the law as it stands.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are two further major aspects of concern here. First, the professional bodies in the course of their regular consultative processes with the Australian Taxation Office twice raised the question as to the apparent effect of the 1991 amendments. The first occasion was at the National Taxation Liaison Group, Foreign Income Measures Sub-Committee meeting held on 26 September 1991. It was indicated at that meeting by ATO representatives that the issue would be examined. At a subsequent NTLG Foreign Income Measures Sub-Committee meeting held on 2 February 1992, the ATO representatives advised that the matter was still being examined. Minutes of these meetings, issued by the ATO, are widely published, and tax advisers are well aware that in the absence of a timely response to an issue having been raised with the ATO, it may reasonably be taken that ATO accepts that the relevant provisions operate according to their tenor.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is fundamental to the consultative process with the ATO that where issues of concern are raised with the ATO, clients of members of the professional bodies should not be retrospectively disadvantaged as a result of issues of concern being raised.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the ATO or the Government were to act retrospectively to the detriment of the professional bodies and/or their clients in relation to matters raised by the professional bodies with the ATO, not only would matters of substance not be drawn to the ATO's and the Government's attention but ultimately the consultative processes would break down. Ultimately, the proper administration of tax law depends upon the co-operation and goodwill of the professional bodies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The professional bodies understand that in this particular case the proposal to retrospectively amend the relevant provisions was raised with you by the ATO without informing you (through oversight) that representations by the professional bodies made to the ATO seeking clarification of the provisions had not been acted upon by the ATO previously. In these circumstances, we consider it is imperative that you review the decision to retrospectively amend the relevant provisions and reverse it.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Secondly, it may be possible, though we do not know whether it is so, that the ATO may have issued private rulings to particular taxpayers acknowledging that these expenses were properly deductible. How you would propose to identify whether this has occurred and to deal with that situation with retrospective legislation we do not know. Clearly, we consider that all taxpayers have to be treated in the same way on this issue.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Retrospective legislation has generally been an instrument used only by repressive and non-democratic governments to deprive citizens of their rights. Once it is used in a democratic and free society such as ours, it undermines the confidence of the community in the fairness and certainty of our laws. Since your announcement we have already had queries from major companies in this country about other possible retrospective legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Such a destabilising result can not, in our view, be justified, particularly where it arises from an attempt to overcome a technical deficiency of the nature of that involved here.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The professional bodies look forward to your early decision on this matter.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I now turn to the problems being faced by the insurance industry in relation to the calculation and apportionment of tax deductions for life insurance companies. The proposed amendments were first announced by the Treasurer in a press release dated 31 May 1993. The first of the government's amendments, which aim to ensure that the formulas do not treat as assessable income the taxable superannuation components transferred by superannuation funds to life companies, was designed to correct a longstanding anomaly with transferred superannuation contributions. We and the industry are in complete agreement with this amendment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of recent discussions, the minister will introduce an amendment that will remove the difficulty whereby essentially annuities operated through life assurance companies were in a negative position. It provided a discrimination against life company offered annuities compared with other providers of such products. The reason for this amendment is that the CSRA, a class of assessable income, is a combination of both life insurance policies which are vested in the trustee of a complying superannuation fund and life insurance policies in relation to rollover annuities&mdash;`RA' relates to the rollover annuities&mdash;which do not vest in the trustee of the complying superannuation fund. As initially submitted, the amendment dealt only with the CS policies which needed to include the rollover elements as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The coalition was concerned that if the bill passed into law in its original form, the rollover annuities would be at a considerable commercial disadvantage. It is essential that there is a level playing field for the various providers of superannuation products. I regret that it took so long to get what was apparently a very simple amendment introduced into this place. A further problem is that the industry believes it contains a very fundamental flaw. We had an amendment which we were prepared to put on behalf of the industry to remove a distortion, because the amendment the government puts in will create a further distortion in excess of the one it seeks to rectify. Again, this is related to the calculation and apportioning of tax deductions of life insurance companies, which treats as assessable income super premiums and the investment component of life policies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem is that the amendments go well beyond what was originally discussed with Treasury. The original discussions centred on the correcting of deficiencies in subsection 116CF(2), the expense apportionment formula, caused by the inclusion of taxable contributions transferred from superannuation to life insurance funds under section 275. The industry believes that it would be preferable for life insurance companies to use the existing basis for apportioning deductions until agreement is reached on the use of accepted&mdash;<EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">(Time expired)</EMPHASIS></PARA>

The bill before us is a mixed bag of measures. On the one hand, it contains a range of long awaited exemptions from tax liabilities. I would like to tell Senator McMullan that I am looking forward to getting up to the RSPCA in my notes. I remember that debate last year very well. Child-care providers and non-profit tourism operators are also included. These measures have been much delayed and are welcomed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, the bill contains a range of other amendments to fix various drafting faults that have emerged in the tax laws. It is not much fun having a mopping up arrangement. In one case the government is wanting us to fix an unclear tax law on overseas petroleum development deductions going back to August 1990. I think it is incredible that the Australian Taxation Office has taken three years to sort this out. I give praise where praise is due, but this is not one of those occasions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Then we have to consider the quality of the drafting. Following representations from professional bodies such as the life industry and the taxation institute, a number of technical amendments have been needed because the bill, as passed in the other place, will create more problems than it solves in some areas, particularly in relation to life assurance companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Joint Committee on Public Accounts report on the tax office issued last week&mdash;not the dissenting report, but the body of the report&mdash;was extremely critical of the state of taxation legislation in Australia and urged a comprehensive rewrite of the legislation.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The committee went on to note that the tax office's thinking on how to fix the problems was not very advanced. It also criticised the process the tax office uses for amending its legislation, commenting that the process has resulted in a body of unintelligible law.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is argued that, if the Taxation Office were able to take more seriously its consultative arrangements with industry and the taxpayer, messy pieces of omnibus legislation like this would perhaps no longer be necessary. The bill has a number of main purposes. These include amending the imputation arrangements of company tax and dividend franking deficit tax to take into account the reduction in the tax rate from 39 per cent to 33 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Secondly, the bill amends various tax laws governing the deductibility of petroleum mining companies' overseas exploration expenses and corrects a drafting flaw in Taxation Laws Amendment Act (No. 6) 1990. Thirdly, it modifies tax arrangements for life assurance companies and policies held by complying superannuation funds, approved deposit funds or pooled superannuation trusts. Fourthly, it reduces the provisional tax uplift factor from 10 per cent to eight per cent for 1993-94. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Fifthly, it implements a 1993 budget decision to again defer by two months the initial payment of company tax instalments by small business. Sixthly, it allows the deductibility of the capital cost of establishing grapevines in Australia to be evenly deductible over four years. Seventhly, it amends the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987, the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Act 1992 and the Superannuation Industry Supervision Act 1993, which we have just passed, to allow complying approved deposit funds to accept superannuation guarantee shortfall components. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation also makes technical changes to the Fringe Benefits Tax Assessment Act 1986, the deductible donation provisions and the Petroleum Resource Rent Tax Assessment Act 1987. I wish to speak on only a few of these matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats cautiously support the introduction of tax deductibility on the capital costs of developing vineyards. This measure, introduced as part of the budget discussions on the wine tax, is probably the most controversial part of the budget package of industry support measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My colleague Senator Meg Lees has been closely involved in these three-way discussions with government and industry. It is a very generous deduction. It has left grape growers concerned about speculators coming into the industry simply to gain the benefits of tax deductibility. They believe that this, combined with possible new planting by existing producers, could cause a major increase in grape production and a fall in prices in an industry which is already struggling. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is vital that the effect of this tax measure and the assurance of the Winemakers Federation on new plantings be closely monitored in the development of the wine industry plan. Should wine production explode in an unsustainable way, this provision may need to be revisited. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to turn now to the extension of the sales tax exemption to child-care providers and the RSPCA. The Democrats are pleased to support these measures; they are measures which we have been advocating for a long time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sales tax exemption for various child-care providers, including for long day care, outside school hours care, vacation care, occasional care and family day care coordination, reflects the needs of those using child care in the 1990s. The proposal was included in the Democrats 1993 child care action plan, which we launched in the lead-up to the federal election. The provision of this exemption will result in the containment of child-care costs for many Australian families. We commend the federal government for taking this move which, as we say, is also reflected in the Democrats' policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The long-awaited decision to grant sales tax exemption for the RSPCA is another amendment that has finally come about. This amendment seeks to exempt the RSPCA, an Australian institution, from paying sales tax. Sales tax law has always recognised that public benevolent institutions should be exempt. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need for this provision, as we visited last year in this debate, dates back to a 1931 High Court decision which held that the term `public benevolent institution' in the tax act is limited to those bodies which promote the relief of poverty, suffering, distress or misfortune. That extremely narrow test excludes the RSPCA, because the decision does not include bodies that promote the relief of suffering and distress of animals or the environment, only humans. We heard about the history of this last year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The RSPCA has a branch in every state and territory in Australia. Its work is well known and supported. In October 1992, I moved an amendment to the sales tax law to establish an exemption for the activities of the RSPCA. On that occasion the government and the opposition combined to defeat that amendment. Senator McMullan gave a stirring speech about the bowerbird tendencies of the Australian Democrats and the way in which we were very prone&mdash;it is etched indelibly in my memory&mdash;to fly over and see glinting objects and dart down and pick them up. He was very disparaging. I notice that in this bill the bowerbird has come home to roost, only this time it is called the Labor bowerbird. </PARA>

What has the RSPCA done to Senator McMullan in one year to make him drop his objection to this bower bird theory mentality and embrace the RSPCA's arguments?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill also amends the treatment of deductions for exploration and development expenses incurred in petroleum mining activities. This amendment will seek to correct a drafting error with the legislation introduced as part of the 1990 budget which modified the foreign income legislation to extend the deductions on certain capital expenditure on particular activities in Australia to similar offshore activities that generate income to be taxed here. The difficulty for the government arises because the Taxation Laws Amendment Act (No. 6) 1990, which implemented the budget initiative, did not expressly make clear that deductions allowable for offshore exploration and development expenditure incurred in petroleum mining should only be allowed if it produced assessable income; that is, income generated in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The result is that the current legislation allows the expenditure used to generate tax exempt income to be offset against assessable income for petroleum companies. I have listened carefully to Senator Watson's case, and I will hear from Senator McMullan on this. I do not like retrospective tax legislation, and I know, Senator Watson, that the professional bodies&mdash;the law council, the tax institute and both accounting bodies&mdash;are appalled that it has taken three years for the tax office and the government to clarify this provision. Yes, we do have evidence that the industry, through the taxation liaison group foreign income measures sub-committee, asked the tax office twice&mdash;on 25 February 1992 and again on 21 May 1992&mdash;to clarify the issue. The tax office promised to look into it and, as I understand it, only finally determined its position in a press release from the Assistant Treasurer, Mr George Gear, on 4 August 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand that between May 1992 and August 1993 one claim was lodged by one of the smaller companies and rejected by the tax office. But I do not think we can support Senator Watson's amendment because we think that, prior to 1990, companies were not allowed a deduction for expenditure incurred offshore. The 1990 budget decision lifted this restriction as part of a package of measures covering foreign income and allowed a deduction, but only where the expenditure was used to produce assessable income. If the income was exempt&mdash;that is, tax was paid in other comparable countries&mdash;then the restriction would remain in place. I guess it all comes down to this: because the vast majority of taxpayers affected have not applied, it appears this restriction was understood by the industry, despite the worst efforts of the tax office. We are not talking about taking something away by this retrospective provision, but clarifying a concession granted. Reluctantly, unless I hear something to the contrary, I will have to oppose Senator Watson's amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to make it very clear to the government that it will face a heavy onus to persuade us in relation to future retrospectivity.

<PARA>I acknowledge that the committee stage of the debate will not be finished this evening but I welcome the opportunity to put the government's amendments on the record. The amendments involve changes to deductions allowable to life assurance companies and credits for sales tax paid in respect of parts used in certain repair activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first amendment is required to ensure that the formula in section 116CF, which allocates current year non-exclusive deductions between classes of income of a life assurance company, operates to allocate all of the relevant deductions. The bill as presently drafted includes certain amounts in the denominator of the section 116CF formula. However, it does not include all of these amounts in the numerators used to apportion non-exclusive deductions to the various classes of taxable income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The rollover annuity&mdash;RA&mdash;factor has not been included. The result may well be that in some cases not all of the allowable deductions relevant to the complying superannuation rollover annuity class can be allocated to that class of income. The CS/RA component is taxed at 15 per cent. The position is to be remedied by this amendment to the bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Amendments (2), (3), (4) and (5) will provide a sales tax credit for tax paid on parts used in the repair of goods that are, at a later date, sold or transferred by the repairer to another person for use as business inputs in the primary production, mining and manufacturing industries. Under the current sales tax law, goods producers&mdash;such as farmers, miners and manufacturers&mdash;are entitled to exemption on parts purchased by them for use in the repair of their goods producing machinery. Similarly, if a goods producer contracts for such repairs to be carried out by another person and parts are supplied in the course of the repair, exemption applies to those parts. However, there is no exemption for parts used in the repair of machinery owned by a machinery dealer or repairer if the machinery is later for sale or transfer by the repairer or dealer to a goods producer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The credit will apply from 1 January 1993&mdash;the commencement date of the streamlined sales tax legislation&mdash;and will cost approximately $25 million per annum. Full details are contained in the supplementary explanatory memorandum that I now present to the Senate. I commend the amendments to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The federal Liberal-National party coalition welcomes the amendments. They are in two parts. With regard to the deductions allowable to life assurance companies&mdash;the first heading&mdash;we will not proceed with two amendments that have been circulated which would have corrected the deficiency in the original bill, giving some degree of justice, particularly in the area of rollover annuities.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there is one further issue that has not been addressed, and that concerns the basis of apportioning deductible items. It is my understanding that there is a continuing dialogue between the industry and the tax office in the hope that an agreement on apportionment on a factual basis can be arrived at. I seek, therefore, a confirmation of this from the government because I regard this continuing dialogue to move to a more factual basis of apportionment as particularly important, particularly as what we have just enacted really exacerbates a situation that disadvantages the industry in relation to a disproportionate weighting to the 15 per cent superannuation class. As we all know, the policies being issued at present are weighted more heavily in terms of superannuation type products, of which the life companies have something like 30 per cent. That side of their life business, of course, has been affected quite considerably. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other amendment is to provide a tax credit for parts used in the repair of business inputs. I must remind the chamber that this was an unfortunate omission from the streamlined sales tax, which commenced on 1 January 1993, despite assurances given in response to the questioning by the Liberal-National party. I ask: how will companies be able to recoup the lost sales tax in terms of its being applied as from 1 January? The amendment, of course, will be of considerable benefit to farmers, miners and manufacturers, especially in circumstances where the repairs are carried out by other people on their behalf. But a question which I am particularly concerned about is: will there be a lost credit in respect of past transactions, or will people be able to claim that credit, because the amendments ostensibly relate back to 1 January?</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I would like to take this opportunity to address the present situation in the sugar industry, a major industry in Queensland. The Queensland raw sugar industry has just had a most productive year. It is a very important industry for Australian employment and export earnings. The industry is on the verge of entering a new export phase in refined white sugar. It will provide a whole new dimension to the sugar industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has just been announced that a joint venture between CSR, Mackay Sugar Co-operative and the British based trading company E.D. and F. Mann is under threat by the refusal of the Trade Practices Commission to give the refinery the go-ahead. Australia has an opportunity to become a major player in the growing international white sugar market through a new refinery being built in Mackay. The joint venture refinery is a $200 million project. For the first time Australia will be in the position of having a refining capacity surplus to domestic requirements and will have the chance to become a major exporter of refined sugar. The joint venture is set to yield 160,000 tonnes of refined sugar for export a year compared with 20,000 tonnes currently exported. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new Mackay refinery would be a world ranking, low cost refinery with associated storage facilities. It would also run a high-tech bulk carrier that can bag sugar en route to overseas markets. It would be a state-of-the-art refinery and would allow Australia to enter the white sugar market with the advantage of a highly efficient and world competitive refinery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sugar industry is the economic lifeblood of many communities along the 2,100 kilometres of coastline of Queensland and northern New South Wales. The industry employs 19,000 people in growing, milling, storage and marketing and benefits another 26,000 indirectly. Sugar contributes about $3.3 billion to the Queensland economy each year. Every dollar earned by the industry creates a further $1.55 in other sectors of the economy. Ninety-five per cent of all cane farms are owned by 6,700 cane farmers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian raw sugar industry is a world leader with a reputation for technical innovation, product quality, reliability and customer service. Over the last five years the industry has made an enormous investment in its continued future. Growers have expanded the area under cultivation by 33 per cent; mills have rationalised and expanded; and a new refinery has entered the market increasing competitiveness in the refining industry. Despite massive subsidies provided to sugar producers in the US, EC and Thailand, which lower the world price and compete unfairly in the world markets, Australia remains internationally competitive. This year, Australia was the world's largest exporter. Domestic sales represent the industry's largest single outlet&mdash;800,000 tonnes&mdash;and Australian consumers pay the lowest sugar prices in all OECD countries and lower than in many developing countries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All in all, the industry forms an important mainstay to many regional economies. It is a growing industry and a major export earner. It is also an industry in which growers have traditionally been involved in downstream and value adding processing of their product through involvement in the milling process. The sugar industry has been a model industry for this government's policy of Australian farmers investing and becoming involved in downstream processing and value adding. It is why it makes sense for growers to be involved in the next step of processing of their raw sugar&mdash;that of refining. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian raw sugar industry is a leading exporter, being the world's largest exporter this year. Last year, exports of raw sugar increased by 14 per cent to Japan with Japan taking 50 per cent of all imports from Queensland. There were record sales to Korea, Malaysia, Singapore, Taiwan and New Zealand. Unfortunately, the US reduced its quota by approximately 16,000 tonnes, and the NAFTA agreement will have long-term effects on Australia's imports into the US with Mexico eventually receiving tariff free access to the lucrative US market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The raw sugar export market is a stagnant market. In contrast, the white or refined sugar market is an expanding market. The government's own agricultural research organisation, ABARE, has just released a paper on the effect of Australia entering the refined sugar export market. ABARE has concluded that Australian farmers will gain from such a move, with increased revenue of around $2,500 a year for each grower. ABARE has predicted that, as a result of Australia entering the refined sugar export market&mdash;a market currently worth about $5 billion a year&mdash;the Australian raw sugar industry will receive increased returns of $23 million a year. Yet, despite the many acknowledged benefits from involvement in the white sugar export market, the Trade Practices Commission has indicated that it intends to block the joint venture establishing the new refinery. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="YE4">Senator BOSWELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If the honourable senator would allow me to develop my argument, I will come to that. I think that Professor Fels and the commission should reassess the decision to stop the merger because it will prevent Australia's entry into a new export market&mdash;the refined sugar market. Such a decision will be a great blow to development of the sugar industry&mdash;a future successful, guaranteed export earner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the moment, there are three refiners&mdash;CSR, Bundaberg Sugar and Manildra. Manildra, in New South Wales, only became operational a few years ago. Before that, Australia had only two refineries. After the entry of the joint venture there will still be three refineries&mdash;but three refineries that would produce sufficient surplus for Australia to enter the more stable white sugar market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have always been a supporter of more competition in the marketplace. I was a most forceful proponent of the change to section 50 of the Trade Practices Act to allow more competition through changes to the mergers provisions. I have continually campaigned over the last three years to raise this issue&mdash;in parliament, within my own party and in the press&mdash;to point out the problems that Australia's competition policy was causing the business community. In a speech in parliament last December, I said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It must be recognised that with a small population of 17 million people, with most competing countries using world class technology, there must be room to buy or amalgamate, but there must be balance.</PARA>
<PARA>I have always argued that balance must be maintained, and balance is what I am calling for now. I am calling for Professor Fels and the Trade Practices Commission to acknowledge that we must have balance. Australia is down to two breweries, and that is excessive market power. When we get to three refineries, that will be all that Australia can adequately handle. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Yet, on a long-term view, with the establishment of the new joint venture refinery in Mackay, there will be no loss of competition in the market. Instead, as an added bonus, there will be development of a new export industry and grower involvement in value adding and downstream processing. When one considers the current plight of many rural industries and producers&mdash;negative incomes and the struggle to hold on to properties&mdash;involvement in processing beyond the farm gate provides a sensible course for farmers by which to increase their returns and maintain their independence. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Crean, and the government have been telling farmers continually that they must become involved in downstream processing. No-one on this side of politics&mdash;and I include the Democrats&mdash;would disagree, but we should not put hurdles in the way when the opportunity arises. The refinery at Mackay would have given canegrowers a 25 per cent share in CSR's sugar refining business in Australia and New Zealand through its equity in Mackay Refined Sugars. It would be a very positive way for Queensland's sugar industry to maximise the downstream effect of value adding, as has been strongly advocated by state and federal Labor governments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the Trade Practices Commission refuses to give the go-ahead for the joint venture, as it has indicated, there may be a short period when a price war reduces the domestic price for sugar. But there are many uncertainties about any permanent price reduction. It is certain that there would be a destructive price war which could not be sustained for long before one refiner would have to go out of business. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It may just be that the new refinery, owned by the farmers, would fail as it would not have a well-developed domestic market. Most sugar sold in Australia&mdash;in fact, 80 per cent of domestic sugar&mdash;is used by a few large food processors. There are certainly no guarantees or means within the Australian system that ensure that any savings in costs to processors will be passed on to the consumer. Consumers in the past have certainly not benefited from any reductions in sugar prices when they have occurred. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The domestic price of sugar in Australia is one of the lowest in the OECD, and it is lower than in many developing countries. There is also a scheme whereby exporting food manufacturers receive assistance on their exports. It is a rebate scheme paid for by the industry and is currently around 10 per cent ad valorem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a very important restraint on the domestic price of sugar. I have often spoken in this place about the massive subsidies given to our competitors in the US, the EC and Thailand, which in turn reduce the world price of sugar. This very same artificially lowered world price acts as a price restraint on the domestic price. It is the import parity price that sets the Australian domestic price, not the number of refineries in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Trade Practices Commission seems to think that if it refuses the new refinery permission to set up, we will end up with a permanent situation of four refineries. A domestic market of 17 million people is not large enough for four refineries. After much pain and damage to the industry, the market will demand that there be only three refineries, but the process gone through to arrive at this stage will be at a huge and unnecessary cost to the industry. It will involve a tremendous waste of resources to the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has seen a similar situation and a similar tussle with the motor vehicle industry. Eventually a government plan was needed to bring the industry back to the three local manufacturers that the Australian population could support. Let us not go through all the pain, suffering and bankruptcies to reach this decision which can be made now: Australia can maintain only three refineries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned that the refusal of the Trade Practices Commission will result in the loss of a new export market in refined sugar and that an excellent opportunity will be lost for farmers to involve themselves in further downstream processing of their industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Stabilising benefits would be returned to the industry from an involvement in both the raw sugar and refined sugar export markets. It would help the industry to be involved in the more stable and expanding white sugar market. ABARE has confirmed this, and the only way it will achieve this is by the development of the Mackay refinery by the joint venture, combining the marketing skills and personnel of CSR and the state-of-the-art facility in the new Mackay refinery. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It would be a great shame to lose this opportunity to develop a new export industry when the economy is crying out for increased export earnings to lower our deficit and create jobs. A successful and secure new refinery in Mackay would not only provide new jobs and investment to the Mackay region but also give growers and the Australian economy a boost. The sugar industry would be on a secure path to a new venture in the white sugar export market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I call on the government to consider the wider benefits that would flow to both the sugar industry and the whole Australian economy from the new joint venture. The government cannot turn its back on a new project and ensuing export industry that will lead the sugar industry into a new era; replace old technology with the latest technology; create jobs and investment in regional Australia; involve farmers in value adding beyond the farm gate in line with their own policy; and create new opportunities in the growing white sugar market beyond the present stagnant raw sugar market, particularly in view of certain market losses from the new NAFTA agreement. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australian rural producers are internationally competitive and world leaders in their field. This new refinery represents an opportunity that must not be lost for Australian sugar producers to extend their export markets and increase their returns through investment in their own industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak briefly during the adjournment debate to raise a very serious matter concerning what has become known as the sports rort affair. I want particularly to emphasise its impact on my own area in the Hunter Valley. The Senate is aware that the Auditor-General has found very serious problems with the community cultural, recreation and sporting facilities program and its administration by the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories, Mrs Ros Kelly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today in the House of Representatives the minister was questioned about the program, and one grant in particular to the Eastern Suburbs Maitland Cricket Club. Maitland is my home area in the Hunter and, therefore, the questions asked of the minister are of great concern to me. I believe they were of great concern also to the people in the electorate of Patterson which, before the last federal election, was the most marginal seat in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Today in the House of Representatives the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories was questioned by the shadow minister for youth sport and recreation, Mr Ronaldson, on the disgraceful sports rort affair and the granting of $49,000 to the Eastern Suburbs Maitland Cricket Club. Mr Ronaldson asked the minister whether she knew or approved of a grant to a club that had no ground, for which no development or building application had been lodged, and whose paddock that was being used by the club as a practice ground was near an old gasworks and is now being checked out by the Environment Protection Authority for possible contamination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The minister was also asked about the role of a member of the club, Mr Tony Keating, the endorsed state Labor candidate for Maitland and now a staff member of Mr Bob Horne, the member for Patterson. The minister totally failed to answer the very important questions Mr Ronaldson was raising. The sum of $49,000 is a lot of money to be promised to an organisation without proper controls to ensure that the money is well spent. There are many other genuine community projects in our area that could have done with that money as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The disgrace is that the whole community cultural, recreational and sporting facilities program is worth $30 million and the Labor government has used it in the most outrageous pork-barrelling exercise in marginal seats that we have ever seen in this country. The money was meant to last until at least 1994 and Mrs Kelly gave almost all of it away to marginal Labor seats in the few months leading up to the last federal election. The average grant given to a marginal Labor seat was exactly double the average given to a marginal coalition seat before the election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In a condemning report the Auditor-General has stated that the minister kept inadequate documentation on the reasons for her decisions to award the grants. The Auditor-General said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . claims that decisions on the allocation of grants were politically motivated could not be put to rest.</PARA>
<PARA>That is the key point on page vii. Some very serious questions have been raised about the propriety of the ALP, including pork-barrelling in Patterson and the involvement of local ALP members. Mrs Kelly has said that she will check the details of the questions raised. I hope she does exactly that and accepts the responsibility for her actions and those of her co-conspirators in the ALP. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mrs Kelly's continued refusal to date to answer these serious questions can only lead to the conclusion that the allocations of the grants were politically motivated. The Auditor-General has raised many criticisms of the program and has been forced to leave many questions unanswered because of the lack of accountability and the lack of documentation by the minister. The minister should produce the evidence that she has not been involved in this outrageous pork-barrelling exercise or she should accept the consequences of her actions and resign. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The question of ministerial responsibility was one that came up recently before the Senate Select Committee on Pay Television Tendering, of which I was deputy chair. We looked at this whole question of ministerial responsibility. After considering Senator Collins' case, I am sure that what we found out about ministerial responsibility and why ministers should resign is certainly very much applicable to Mrs Kelly. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Often a minister is required to resign because the department does something wrong and the minister remains ignorant of these actions. Kellygate is much worse because the minister has done something wrong and the department seems not to have known about it. This is a far worse offence and she should do the proper thing and resign. </PARA>

In fact, Senator McGauran should know that some of them were actually chosen as representatives from the private child-care industry itself.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a great shame in this place when name-calling becomes a substitute for intelligent, reasoned argument. What we have seen tonight is a tirade from Senator Crowley which masquerades as intelligent debate but which is, in fact, nothing but name-calling. I was reminded, as I was sitting here listening to this barrage of abuse which has been directed at my colleague Senator McGauran, of the bad days in Australia when racism really did exist in this country, when people would be teased, taunted and jeered at and we got the sort of nastiness that we have just seen this evening. It was very sad because I do not think there is a place in this society for the bitter vindictiveness which was behind some of the name-calling to which Senator McGauran was subjected this evening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of the comments were clearly unparliamentary. I listened to Senator Crowley's speech from start to finish. I saw the first bit of it on the closed-circuit television and the rest in this chamber. When an honourable senator is accused of deliberately misleading people, that is an unparliamentary comment. It has been ruled unparliamentary in the past; it has been ruled unparliamentary recently; and nothing which has happened tonight will change the fact that that comment is unparliamentary. In being applied to Senator McGauran it is also wrong. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McGauran was smeared with all sorts of dreadful allegations. Senator Crowley said tonight&mdash;as she has said in the past and, I think, today&mdash;that people were phoning up parents and saying, `I know where your child goes to child care'. I am quite simply at a loss to find the relevance of that matter to the issue of child care, or to Senator McGauran for that matter. Unless, of course, Senator Crowley is suggesting to this chamber&mdash;and, if she is, here is her chance to affirm it&mdash;that Senator McGauran would be behind that sort of conduct. Is silence consent?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Does the minister perhaps realise that it is unsatisfactory to say those sorts of things and imply that any honourable senator in this chamber would indulge in that sort of behaviour? It is either irrelevant or the grossest slur that can be cast across this chamber. Yet that is what we have seen. I do not believe that Senator Crowley tomorrow will want to read the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> of what she has said tonight. I do not believe that Senator Crowley next week will feel that what she has said tonight has raised her in the estimation of honourable senators. I do not believe that Senator Crowley, if she remains a minister, will look on this speech tonight as one of her most learned and balanced contributions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most importantly, I do not think Senator Crowley, by her conduct in this matter, has indicated herself to be a person who is willing to accept the responsibilities of high office. After all, Senator Crowley is the minister who brought these guidelines before this parliament, tabled them in this place and put her seal of approval on them. Does Senator Crowley mean to say that she tables guidelines in this place of which she does not approve? If she does not approve, then she should say so. But she does not do that. Senator Crowley approved of those guidelines and yet, when criticism was made of those guidelines, she tried to blame it on somebody else. But what she has to understand is what we on this side of the chamber understand and what many of her colleagues on the other side of the chamber understand and that is, that in matters such as this, the principle of Westminster democracy and ministerial responsibility applies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It does not do a minister any good to attempt to say that somebody else wrote the guidelines when that minister came before this place, tabled those guidelines in this chamber and sought the approval of this Senate for the implementation of those guidelines. That is the problem that Senator Crowley has. She cannot deny that she approved of those guidelines. She cannot deny that she bears responsibility for them, even though other people were the authors. That is why we have been treated to this tirade of name calling tonight. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am reminded that during question time today Senator Crowley promised to give Senator Boswell some documents. I understand that Senator Boswell has rung Senator Crowley's office several times and not received those documents. The documents remain unforthcoming. That is the minister's responsibility. That is where the minister fails. That is why the minister is at fault in coming here and doing as she has done tonight: slurring the name of a good man, a man with integrity, a man with honesty and a man who has some passion and conviction about what he does. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can say here and now that I could not consider the people I sit with to be anything other than the finest colleagues that a person could want in this chamber.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">is a reduction over the twelve month period of 1,337 employees.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The difference between the staffing numbers identified in answers to Questions on Notice 148 and 653 arise from the inclusion in the answer to Question No. 653 of longer term temporary employees and corrections to earlier data, as well as the exclusion of certain employees not actually occupying office space. These changes were explained in the answer to Question No. 653 and in my answer to Senator Campbell's question without notice.</PARA>
