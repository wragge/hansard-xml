<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Leave granted.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The summary read as follows&mdash;</EMPHASIS></PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AUSTRALIAN DRIED FRUITS BOARD (AGM) REGULATIONS STATUTORY RULES 1993 NO.144</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These Regulations provide for procedures relating to Annual General Meetings of the Australian Dried Fruits Board.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Explanatory Statement advised that the AGM of the Board for 1991-92 must be held on or before 30 June 1993. As the Regulations were only gazetted on 23 June 1993 there may have been some difficulties in complying with them.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Regulations attempt to deal with this problem by providing that certain provisions do not apply to the first AGM. However, these exceptions may themselves have affected the rights of persons entitled to vote at the AGM.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">More significantly, there is a number of other provisions affecting rights of voters which apparently could not have been complied with and which do not appear to have been excepted. These include correcting voter details, giving notices of motion and appointing proxies.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee believes that personal rights expressed in legislation should be clear and unambiguous.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">RADIOCOMMUNICATIONS REGULATIONS STATUTORY RULES 1993 NO.177</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These Regulations, among other things, provide for a system of penalties using the infringement notice procedure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">One provision sets out the consequences which flow from the payment of a penalty under an infringement notice. In short, the liability of the person is discharged, no further proceedings may be taken and the person is not regarded as having been convicted of the alleged offence.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These safeguards emphasise the personal rights of those affected by the infringement notice scheme. However, their effectiveness is considerably reduced because there is no requirement for an infringement notice to notify people of these rights. The regulations provide for such a notice to contain a variety of information, but not these important safeguards. This is a matter which the Committee has raised in respect of a number of similar schemes. In every case the Minister has undertaken to amend the relevant instrument to provide for notification of safeguards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">PRINCIPLES NO.NHP 2/1993 UNDER S.40AA(7) OF THE NATIONAL HEALTH ACT 1953</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These Regulations amend the funding arrangements for approved nursing homes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Several of the Principles provide for the Minister or Secretary to determine certain matters. This appears to grant legislative power to those officials. The Committee has written to the Minister asking whether this subdelegation is authorised by the parent Act. If it is valid, the Committee asks why it should not be subject to tabling and disallowance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is a breach of parliamentary propriety if an instrument purports invalidly to subdelegate power which the parent Act has restricted to specified persons or organisations. On the other hand, if subdelegation is valid then its exercise should be subject to parliamentary scrutiny.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">FIFTH AMENDING DEED TO ESTABLISH AN OCCUPATIONAL SUPERANNUATION SCHEME FOR COMMONWEALTH EMPLOYEES AND OTHER PERSONS UNDER S.5 OF THE SUPERANNUATION ACT 1990</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This amending deed to a superannuation scheme for Commonwealth employees changes some of the definitions in the principal deed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amending deed grants two discretions to the Board which administers the scheme. In the first of these the Board is initially limited by reasonable criteria. However, the relevant provision then expands the criteria to include "any other matters that the Board considers relevant". There is a similar broad criterion in the second discretion, which merely refers to the opinion of the Board.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee looks closely at such unrestricted powers and always seeks an assurance that their inclusion is justified.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">IMPORTED FOOD CONTROL REGULATIONS STATUTORY RULES 1993 NO.100</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Regulations set up a Food Inspection Scheme for the inspection of imported food.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Regulation 35 provides for the Secretary to waive a fee for a chargeable service. The only criteria to limit and control this power is that the fee would be unreasonable in all the circumstances. In this case there is a variety of fees payable, up to $88 per half an hour for public officials to assess food shipments. The Committee has asked for an assurance that this discretion is covered by the review provisions in the parent Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The power to waive a fee is one of the more important administrative discretions and the Committee always ensures that its exercise is subject to appropriate safeguards.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">OCCUPATIONAL SUPERANNUATION STANDARDS REGULATIONS (AMENDMENT) STATUTORY RULES 1993 NO.189</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These Regulations amend the Principal Regulations to prohibit schemes which provide financial assistance to, or intentionally acquire assets from, members of superannuation funds or their relatives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These provisions cover the period until the commencement date of the proposed Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act, the Bill for which was introduced in the House of Representatives on 27 May 1993.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The operation of new r.18BB(3) may retrospectively prejudice funds and persons who have entered into an affected scheme before the regulations commenced on 30 June 1993. In such a case the scheme may consist of a contract which is partially performed, with part payments or deposits paid and with possible formal legal commitments.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has sought advice on the effect of this provision on contracts partially performed.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SUPERANNUATION (PSS) FEES REGULATIONS STATUTORY RULES 1993 NO.200</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">SUPERANNUATION (CSS) FEES REGULATIONS STATUTORY RULES 1993 NO.201</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These Regulations set application fees of $150 for reconsideration of decisions by the Boards of Trustees which administer the PSS and CSS superannuation schemes. The Explanatory Statements did not advise of the basis upon which the fees were set.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any power to set fees or charges is an important and sensitive exercise of executive discretion. In such cases the Committee always ensures that the level chosen is not harsh or unreasonable. In the present cases the fee is particularly important, because it relates to the initiation of a review procedure.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GREAT BARRIER REEF MARINE PARK REGULATIONS (AMENDMENT) STATUTORY RULES 1993 NO.206</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These Regulations provide for permission to enter the Park and for permits to carry out activities in the Park.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Regulations include a number of discretions, only some of which provide criteria to limit and guide their exercise. Some of these discretions appear to affect commercial operations and the livelihood of individuals. In these cases the Committee seeks confirmation of the existence of review rights.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">AUSTRALIAN SPORTS DRUG AGENCY REGULATIONS (AMENDMENT) STATUTORY RULES 1993 NO.210</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These Regulations provide safeguards for disabled and disadvantaged sporting competitors who are selected for drug testing. These safeguards seem comprehensive. However, their effectiveness may be reduced because they are voluntary, not compulsory. The Committee believes that procedural safeguards for personal rights should be enforced as strictly as practicable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">OCCUPATIONAL SUPERANNUATION STANDARDS REGULATIONS (AMENDMENT) STATUTORY RULES 1993 NO.213</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These Regulations amend the operation of private sector superannuation funds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Regulations confer a number of discretions upon the Insurance and Superannuation Commissioner. There is no indication whether these discretions, which could affect the retirement rights of working Australians, are subject to review of their merits. The Committee always seeks full information about discretions which have an effect on individuals.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">GUIDELINES UNDER S.18 OF THE TOBACCO ADVERTISING PROHIBITION ACT 1992</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Guidelines provide criteria for deciding whether a sporting or cultural event is of international significance and whether Australia is likely to lose the event because of restrictions on tobacco advertising.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee's concerns relate to the drafting of the instrument. The criteria generally appear appropriate, apart from the final criterion in each case, which is that the Minister is to take into account "any other information that the Minister believes is relevant". The Committee has sought advice on why it was necessary to include such a broad and subjective criterion following specific and detailed criteria.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">FORMULATION OF PRINCIPLES UNDER S.58CD OF THE NATIONAL HEALTH ACT 1953</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">These Principles fix a formula for a Commonwealth benefit.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Principles provide for a specified sum, or such larger amount as determined by the Minister "from time to time" under another provision of the Act. The Acts Interpretation Act 1901 restricts the categories of material, as amended from time to time, which may be incorporated by an instrument. The Committee has suggested that it may be worthwhile obtaining advice from the Attorney-General's Department on the validity of this incorporation.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I gave notice of my intention to move to disallow this amendment in response to concerns expressed by people who felt that this amendment would have a detrimental effect on them, particularly in relation to prosecutions which are pending under the Fisheries Act 1952. I am now satisfied that the disallowance of this amendment would have no effect, detrimental or otherwise, on the prosecutions and, in fact, this amendment may advantage the people concerned. Any doubts that might remain concerning the legal validity of this amendment are not a matter for the Senate and, should they be raised during any legal actions, they will be dealt with by the courts in an appropriate manner.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The move to disallow this amendment also gave me time to investigate many other concerns that have been raised by those who are most affected by the management plan and these ongoing concerns may be addressed by the standing committee's current investigation into the adequacy of the Commonwealth fisheries legislation. Finally, I would like to note that the timing of this amendment, 23 December 1992, after parliament rose, and not being tabled until May 1993, meant that the amendment could not have been disallowed before the management plan expired on 31 December 1992. Therefore, there was no possibility that a disallowance could have had any real effect prior to the expiry of the plan.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill amends the Migration Act 1958 (the Act) to simplify the operation of the "points" system provided for in the Act. The "points" system provides for the application of a competitive points test which is used to assess people of working age seeking permanent entry to Australia under the Independent Entrant and Concessional Family classes.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Presently, the "points" system sets out three marks against which an applicant's score is compared  "applicable pass mark", "applicable priority mark" and "applicable pool entrance mark". Currently the way in which the "points" system operates is that the pass mark and priority mark are set at the same level and a pool entrance mark is set at a lower level. Applicants whose score is equal to or more than the pass and priority mark proceed to further processing and applicants whose score is less than the pool entrance mark are rejected. Applicants whose score is at least equal to the pool entrance mark but less than the pass mark are placed in the pool and can be removed by meeting a subsequently gazetted pass mark. However, applications in the pool that fail to meet the pass mark after three gazettals are rejected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Variations in the pass and priority marks are one way that changes in demand for migration are managed between one program year and the next. Adjustments can be made to the level of the pass mark and priority mark to control the number of applicants who would be able to proceed to further processing. Therefore, where the number of successful applicants is inconsistent with the program planning levels the priority and pass mark can be lowered so that more applicants move to the next stage of processing or they can be raised so that fewer applicants move to the next stage of processing. The numbers in the "pool" can be increased by lowering the pool entrance mark, however the "pool" cannot be reduced by increasing the pool entrance mark.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are a number of problems with the current operation of the "pool "mechanism. First, rejection of applications in the "pool" requires three pass mark gazettals and an applicant in the "pool" must be notified on each occasion. This process is administratively cumbersome. Secondly, there is no time requirement in which the three gazettals must occur. Therefore, they could occur on consecutive days or over a number of years. This provides little certainty or security for applicants. Thirdly, the system provides little flexibility to reject those who receive lower marks in the "pool". Finally, the current system of three different marks  has confused applicants.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill will remedy these problems by replacing the three mark system with a two mark system consisting of a pass mark and a pool mark. The Bill will also simplify the operation of the "pool" mechanism by introducing a mandatory time limit of twelve months after which time an application still held in the "pool" must be rejected. This will replace the current requirement of three pass mark gazettals which, as previously stated, could have occurred over a period in excess of twelve months.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the scheme proposed in this Bill an application where the assessed points score is at least equal to the gazetted pass mark at the time of assessment would proceed directly to the next stage of processing. An application where the assessed points score is less than the gazetted pass mark but at least equal to the gazetted pool mark would be placed in the "pool". An application where the assessed points score is less than the gazetted pool mark would be rejected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill sets out the manner for dealing with applications in the "pool" and provides that an application in the "pool" must be assessed against any gazetted changes to the pass mark and pool mark during a period of twelve months from the date of the original assessment. At any time over the twelve month period an application in the "pool" could proceed to the next stage if the pass mark is lowered, or be rejected if the pool mark is raised. If an application had not been removed from the pool by either of these means at the end of the twelve month period it would have to be rejected.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Variations in the pass mark and the pool mark will be notified in the Gazette. Each time these marks are varied an application in the "pool" will have to be compared with the varied marks. The Bill makes it clear that this comparison does not allow a reassessment of the applicant's assessed score.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also makes provision for the pass mark and the pool mark to be varied independently of each other. When the pass mark and the pool mark are the same, no "pool" would exist.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The transitional provisions in the Bill ensure that applications that are held in the "pool" on commencement of the provisions will be held in that "pool" for a further period of up to twelve months. This will ensure that no applicant is disadvantaged by the operation of the new provisions.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The wine tax is a matter which is of crucial importance to my home state of Western Australia. I have a specific interest in it in that I have spent a lot of my recent years living in the Swan Valley district of Western Australia and have enjoyed many fine wines from the Swan Valley district, the Margaret River district and the rapidly expanding wineries in the south-west of the state of Western Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wine tax which was announced by the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) on budget night was, of course, an absolute shock to the industry right across Australia, particularly to the relatively young industry in Western Australia. Although it has had a very strong base in the Swan Valley since the first settlement and the planting of the first vines by John Septimus Roe and other people many years ago, the industry has rapidly expanded over the last 20 to 25 years. One needs only to look at some of the figures that have been achieved in terms of production increases in recent years to see just how important the wine industry has become to Western Australia, and how important it is when one considers that there is an enormous concentration on the importance of value adding to our primary products. This is to ensure that we do not just produce raw products and export them but we actually process those products. Wine is a classic example of how that has been done very successfully, both in Western Australia and in the wine making regions in the eastern states. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note that, in terms of value adding, wine when sold as the end product increases the value of the primary product, the bunch of grapes, by something like seven times. So it is quite a massive value adding process. The figures from Western Australia&mdash;and I will concentrate on Western Australia, being a proud and parochial Western Australian&mdash;have seen production increases even in the last few years. Going back to 1988-89, in terms of exports from Western Australia, we exported only $770,000 worth. The export figures&mdash;and these are figures provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics&mdash;have increased in the latest year, 1992-93, to in excess of $2.57 million from Western Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is a tremendous performance and it is very important to note that much of this export performance has been created on the foundations of a very solid domestic market. The Western Australian domestic market is very important to young producers and I would like to use it in what necessarily will be a brief contribution to this debate. There are enormous numbers of speakers on the list and we would like to see these bills defeated, if possible today, for the benefit of the wine industry and the employment it creates. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To get back to the line of argument, I will refer to the example of a winery that I know very well that is not so far from my home. It is a winery called Jane Brook on the Toodyay Road just out of Midland. David and Beverley Atkinson, who are friends of mine, started rebuilding the Jane Brook estate and building up their market share and building up the acreages they have under vine. They have built up a good marketing image. They have a new range of products, aggressively marketed through cellar door sales and through selected bottle shops mostly for the domestic market and the local market in Western Australia. They have increased their production year after year and they have increased the number of crushings they do. In the last three years they have gone to Japan on a number of occasions with the help of Austrade and have sold their products into the Japanese market. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is a highly competitive market and not an easy market for a small husband and wife team from Western Australia to break into, but my latest conversation with David indicated that he sold something like a container load of wine to Japan last year and I think he has doubled that export this year. He is also providing wines to some international airlines. This is a tremendous achievement. It is actually a good example that proves the government's arguments, that the tax will not affect export markets, to be quite fallacious because export markets will be developed only if we have a thriving domestic industry. If a 55 per cent increase is put on the tax it will affect domestic sales. It will decrease sales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McMullan has admitted that in answers to questions in the Senate on this matter in recent weeks. He has said it will not affect the government's revenue because if the sales of bottles of wine go down people will transfer to buying beer. He is saying there is a total sort of elasticity there; people will just move from one product to the other. It does not really matter if people stop buying wine because if they stop buying wine they will buy a bottle of beer and the government will collect the revenue from that. So Senator McMullan has admitted that the tax will potentially decrease wine sales. Of course, all of us know that if the price goes up people will either buy cheaper wines or not buy at all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This will have a devastating impact on an industry that has been one of Australia's export success stories in recent years. Only a year ago I was at a supermarket in London&mdash;I think it was Sainsburys&mdash;buying groceries to have a home-cooked meal. I was very proud to see in the wine section of Sainsburys a whole range of Australian, including Western Australian, wines for sale at very reasonable prices. The market share of Western Australian and Australian wines in England is rocketing. I visited France last year as the guest of the French government and I found that the French are extremely jealous of Australia's success in wine marketing because we are rapidly taking away their traditional markets in the United Kingdom for champagne and red and white wines. Our wine industry is a tremendous success story. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me make some other brief comments about the importance of this debate. The Green senators, my colleagues from Western Australia Senator Margetts and Senator Chamarette, initially agreed with Senator Kernot and Senator Lees on the Australian Democrats' position that this matter should be deferred for a year. I spoke to the press and suggested that Senator Margetts and Senator Chamarette would not be acting in the best interests of Western Australian wine producers and winegrowers if they were to agree to defer that tax. In fact, in a slightly flowery press release, I suggested that, if a sentence of a thousand lashes is imposed on someone, it is of little comfort if the person is told that the sentence will be delivered on him in 12 months time. It really does not help very much. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I know. I thank Senator Kernot for setting the record straight. Another interesting occurrence is that the views of a former minister for primary industry, John Kerin, were published in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper this morning. The former minister described the proposal as being based on ignorance, stupidity and prejudice. In the letter that he wrote to people, in which he was obviously responding to concerns from the industry, he described very well and very articulately the difference between taxes on beer and other spirits and taxes on the wine industry.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">He said that it takes four to seven years to create a crop that can be crushed commercially. Even after four to five or six years, when that crop has been developed, it is exposed to the vagaries of the weather and, as people like Senator Panizza who grow wheat would know, there is still an enormous risk involved. Mr Kerin said that it costs $30,000 to $35,000 per hectare to establish a crop. All that money is paid up-front and it takes at least four or five years to get any sort of commercial return. So the wine industry is very different from other industries, and Mr Kerin should be complimented for having the honesty to expose the flawed decision making that has taken place on this measure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I understand from reading the front page of today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">West Australian</EMPHASIS> newspaper that the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Crean, is now putting his hat into the ring in the leadership stakes for the prime ministership. I understand from talking to my mother earlier this morning that Randal Markey wrote that story. It does not surprise people on this side of the chamber that there is a leadership struggle going on. Clearly, Mr Keating has enormous problems with his petulance and the fact that he will not debate the Leader of the Opposition or even take him on in question time. It does not surprise us that there are rumblings on the back bench of the Australian Labor Party. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is very good to see that there are some other Labor Party speakers who have added their names to the list this morning&mdash;people like Senator McKiernan, who is a well-known supporter of Mr Keating, Senator Loosley, Senator Carr and Senator Foreman, who have all added their names to the speakers list on this bill overnight. I presume that these Labor Party speakers will be coming out to stick up for their constituents in the wine industry and, hopefully, support Mr Kerin's line. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="H15">Senator CAMPBELL</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Indeed. I conclude by saying that the negotiations that have taken place with the wine industry over the past few weeks, where the government has been offering carrots in terms of early tax write-offs, industry support mechanisms and so forth, further reinforce the argument that this tax is a very bad tax and that it will hurt the wine industry. The ameliorative measures that the government is offering the wine industry are recognition of the fact that the tax will severely hurt the industry, and further support the wisdom of the opposition's position and the wisdom of the position adopted by the Democrats, I am informed by Senator Kernot, some five weeks ago. I commend them for that wisdom and I commend the wisdom of my Western Australian colleagues from the WA Greens&mdash;Senator Chamarette and Senator Margetts.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I look forward to these bills being defeated, for the wine tax to be axed and, more importantly, for there to be certainty in the minds of those in the wine industry and those who choose to invest in it and put their hard work and hard labour into growing the grapes, crushing the grapes and marketing the products nationally and internationally. They can then be assured with the strongest message to the wine industry from the Senate&mdash;from a majority of senators, including the Democrats and the Greens&mdash;that a wine tax today, tomorrow, next year or the year after is off the agenda and that people in the industry can go ahead and invest with certainty. The message will be that if the government ever tries to bring a 55 per cent increase to a very important industry like this into this place it will be booted out as quickly as it is today. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is necessary to revisit the history of this debate while we are at the point of making a decision to increase rates of sales tax, amongst other things in these bills. We had a rejection of the GST by the Australian people. We had an obscene tax cuts auction. We have the return of a Labor government with a revenue raising problem.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has chosen to change the tax mix by increasing the rate of wholesale sales tax. The choices that have been put before the Australian people have been quite simple ones&mdash;a GST or a wholesale sales tax. The government and the opposition have rejected other, more progressive suggestions such as a jobs levy, the abolition of negative gearing, the removal of some of the exemptions from the capital gains tax or increased marginal tax rates for very high income earners. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are hoist on our own petard in this country because we all want an increased level of services, yet nobody wants to raise taxes in a progressive way. Nobody wants to pay more tax but we have ever increasing demands. Many families are affected by unemployment. They expect the members of their families who are unemployed to get unemployment benefits. We have to pay taxes to provide those unemployment benefits. We have to raise taxes somehow, and I am not afraid to say that the Democrats support some of those more progressive taxation options. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If we are given a choice, however, between a wholesale sales tax and a goods and services tax, why do we choose a wholesale sales tax? There are trade-offs all the time in politics. Although the wholesale sales tax is not as pure in terms of simplicity and efficiency, the Democrats believe its great merit is that it has the capacity to discriminate. By contrast, a consumption tax is a very blunt instrument. It offers no flexibility in terms of how heavily it falls on those least able to bear the burden of the taxation, specifically, low income earners. Although the wholesale sales tax is not perfect, it is superior if we are debating a choice&mdash;as I think we are, as a nation&mdash;between a goods and services tax or a broad based consumption tax and a wholesale sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The sales tax is imposed by four acts, namely, a duty of customs, a duty of excise, a tax on in situ swimming pools and a tax that is none of the above. Thus we have these changes in five separate bills&mdash;one for each of the four categories and one to make the consequential changes to the sales tax assessment acts to put into effect the changes to the sales tax treatment of luxury motor vehicles. The bills we are debating contain the following measures: an increase of all sales tax rates by one percentage point from budget night, a further increase of one percentage point for all sales tax rates from 1 July 1995, an increase in the rate of sales tax on wine and an increase in the rate of tax on luxury motor vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mechanically, if we put the politics aside, the increases in sales tax are quite straightforward. I would, however, like to ask the minister to address the comment that I have heard that one of the unintended consequences of the proposal to increase the rates is to lead to a complication of the calculation of the tax. Whereas 10, 20 and 30 per cent are quite simple to use, I would like to know whether it is true that 11, 21 and 31 per cent are not. That suggestion has been made to me. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The proposal will raise approximately half a billion dollars, about $1 billion from 1995 to 1996. We would like to see that revenue used for constructive and appropriate purposes, such as job creation. We do not want to see a situation where we tax the poor to fund income tax cuts for the wealthy.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wine tax proposal is a different matter. I agree with Senator Campbell that the industry has done well in the last decade, but it is on the cusp of a burgeoning export boom and now is not the time to impose a massive increase in sales tax on it. I do not just stand here and say that we are opposed to taxation increase of any kind, but I think the government has failed to make out a cohesive rationale based on industry policy. This is very clearly a question of industry policy. The wine industry is a regionalised industry; whole communities are dependent on it. It is one of our success stories. Senator Lees will be elaborating on the Democrats' position and negotiations with the wine industry in her contribution to this debate later today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final matter is the alteration of the luxury car tax. One would have to say that this area of policy has had a pretty poor record over the last few years. Firstly, in the 1990 election campaign, the government announced an increase in the rates of tax from 30 to 50 per cent. This caused a delay in the implementation of the measure, which means that purchases are simply brought forward and consequently the extra revenue from the rate increase is never collected. Then we saw that the recession battered the luxury car market. Perhaps that is one of the most benign effects of the recession! This caused the government to reverse its decision, so subsequently we had a further finetuning of the tax to try to make it operate in a less anomalous manner. Today we are looking at the further change that we now have to the structure. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax on luxury cars further demonstrates my point about the ability of a wholesale sales tax regime to be discriminatory where a consumption tax is not. Luxury vehicles in excess of a $32,486 threshold are currently taxable at 30 per cent of their total wholesale value and cars below this threshold are subject to the applicable sales tax rate, depending on their classification. This has the effect that, once a car costs $1 more than the threshold, an additional tax on the `sub-luxury' part of the car is payable. We know what effect that has on people's purchasing decisions. I think that is a legitimate function of a taxation regime. The Democrats endorse this change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said in a previous speech relating to other parcels of the budget bill, the support we give them is qualified. These are not our priorities; they are this government's priorities within the parameters of a straitjacket of its own making. Nevertheless, the final shape of the budget is its prerogative, and it will live with the consequences. The Democrats derive some satisfaction from being able to inject fairness into the original budget proposals, and I think it shows that minor parties can make a significant contribution and can achieve significant change. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Beyond that, we respect the government's right to govern and to make the tough decision on how the budget shapes up. If it were up to us, we would have done it differently. So we give our support, with all of these qualifications and with the exception of the wine tax, to the other sales tax bills that we are discussing here this morning. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The tax bills before us this morning heavily underscore the double bankruptcy of this Keating Labor government. First, it is financially bankrupt; secondly, and more importantly, it is morally bankrupt. Its moral bankruptcy is indeed more important than its financial bankruptcy, because this has destroyed the government's capacity to provide inspiring and effective national leadership. Quite simply, nobody in this country accepts the authority or legitimacy of this government anymore. That is the direct consequence of the government having lied its way to success at the last election and having broken its promises since then. And that is one reason why the Liberal and National parties are opposing these tax increases: they are the very antithesis of the Labor Party's campaign at the March election.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These tax increases also underscore the government's financial mismanagement. Its incompetence in controlling government spending frenziedly feeds an insatiable and rapacious desire for more and more revenue. The government has become a tax junkie mainlining on more and more revenue. And that is another reason for opposing these tax bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is time for this government to apply some real discipline to its spending. The government's claim to be reducing the tax burden is patently false. In the 10 years since this government came to office, the average tax rate on people earning average weekly earnings has increased from 23 per cent in 1983 to 24.4 per cent this year. On top of that, over the life of this government we have seen massive increases in sales taxes, fuel and other excises and many other taxes. This means that the tax burden on many Australians has increased. These bills seek to increase that burden even further. And that is another reason for opposing them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The taxes in this legislation reflect a poorly constructed budget and inadequate analysis, and I am sure that we will see further repercussions from them if they do pass the Senate in the coming months, as we have already seen horrified reactions from individual constituents and from industries in the six weeks since those people were betrayed by this budget. It may be that Sydney has won the 2000 Olympics, but this Keating-Dawkins budget has most certainly already won the gold medal for government greediness, botched legislation and fumbled fiscal strategy. The government remains weak and ineffective, and completely devoid of real leadership in the eyes of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many of my colleagues want to direct their attention to these bills, so I will address what I believe is the worst aspect of the government's now somewhat revised revenue raising measures, that is, the 55 per cent impost on alcoholic wine, raising the rate of sales tax on that product from 20 per cent to 31 per cent. It does not matter whether you drink wine or not, the fact is that this tax will hurt ordinary Australians&mdash;Australians who are already overburdened with taxes and, in particular, Australians who derive their income from the wine industry. It will hurt them unjustifiably and in a regionally discriminatory way. It is particularly detrimental to my home state of South Australia, and that is another reason for opposing these bills. This industry is just starting to capitalise on its vast export potential, but now the government has come along and nipped all of that in the bud. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Liberal and National parties, the Winemakers Federation of Australia, grape growers&mdash;indeed, anyone with an ounce of analytical capacity&mdash;know, even if this federal Labor government does not know, that because of this tax domestic sales of wine will drop by more than 10 per cent. The key victims of the tax will be grape growers in the Riverland areas of South Australia, in Victoria's Sunraysia district, and in the Murrumbidgee Irrigation Area in New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">How do we in the opposition know this and apparently federal Labor does not? We know because the South Australian Labor government&mdash;a government of its own political persuasion, a government that will undoubtedly soon be in opposition, not only because of its own mismanagement but also because of the direct impact of this tax on South Australia&mdash;commissioned a quarter million dollar economic research program on the wine industry. That report predicts that 15 million litres of the domestic cask wine market will be lost because of this tax. That cask wine is not exportable. The report also predicts the reduction in domestic demand by 15 million litres of premium wine. In other words, total domestic demand will be 30 million litres less than it would otherwise be. This 15 million litres of premium wine would become available for the export market. Hence, there will be lower wine production, and this in turn means that the industry will invest less in vineyards, inventory and wineries to meet its overseas market opportunities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In short, this government has done more to the wine industry than a year of bad harvests across the nation would have done to it. In fact, it is devastating the industry. This all represents a loss to Australian industry and lost opportunities for job creation&mdash;lost opportunities for Australians who want to pull themselves out of the economic malaise which surrounds them and put something back into this country and back into their own lives. Wine production throughput will be lost as a result of this tax, due to the loss of cask wine sales. This will increase production costs in Australia and will therefore increase the cost of the product they wish to export and make them less competitive on those overseas markets. This cost increase has been estimated to be around 16 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One can only wonder why this myopic Labor government cannot see that such an increase in costs will erode the international competitiveness of our wineries on highly competitive markets. But perhaps the chardonnay socialists across the aisle have failed to get out amongst their constituents, as I and my colleagues have done lately, to see what effect these ridiculous budgetary measures are having on ordinary Australians. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A continuing lack of international competitiveness is reflected in a further balance of payments deficit of $1.4 billion, or $80 per Australian last month. So as a country we are continuing to go further and further into debt. The government's commitment to Australia's international competitiveness is shown to be no more than lip service because of its high domestic tax regime. No other major wine industry anywhere in the world has to operate under such imposts. Brian Croser, the president of the Winemakers Federation of Australia, is on the record only weeks ago as saying in relation to this budget `that logic and wealth creation for Australia are the victims'; and further, that it `is now bankrupt of concern for the fate of one of Australia's most rapidly expanding export and highest value adding industries, and that is shameful'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In addition to that South Australian government report to which I referred, a further report, the so-called Sharp report, challenges the claim by the federal Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) that the government's 55 per cent tax increase will not harm wine exports. The truth is that both reports provide independent proof that the Australian wine industry cannot afford the budget's savage tax increase. Exports and potential job growth will both be harmed. There is little doubt that reduced profitability will result in investment in new vineyards and winery upgrades being abandoned and marketing budgets being reduced, affecting primarily advertising and sales support. All of that affects jobs. Indeed, as I found in a visit to the renowned Coonawarra district a couple of weeks ago, new vine plantings have already been put on hold pending the outcome of this tax bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To demonstrate the depth of feeling from those involved in the wine industry and from constituents, I presented to the Senate last Thursday over 7,700 signatures, just from South Australians, calling for this unjust tax to be defeated. These signatures were collected in only a few weeks, which proves that Australian voters have already had enough of repressive tax measures. A search of the Senate records reveals this number of signatures to be amongst the highest ever presented to the Senate on a single issue. That they were collected in just a few weeks is truly remarkable. For most petitions attracting large numbers of signatures, the collection of signatures takes many months, even a year or two. To attract such numbers of signatures in just two or three weeks demonstrates the absolute outrage of the South Australian community at this proposal. Completed petitions are still coming in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Winemakers Federation and the Winegrape Growers Council of Australia have campaigned responsibly and professionally against this tax increase. Members of those industries are more than astonished at the Treasurer's attacks on them in his attempt to defend the government's position. The industry certainly sees the threat the government has made against them as particularly shallow. There is no doubt that a 55 per cent increase in tax will most certainly damage the low end of the market, which is required to undergird the overall profitability and expansion of this industry and to undergird its export potential. It is incredible that this government comes along and does this at the very time that this industry is successfully achieving such export growth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Treasurer has claimed that tax equity between wine and other alcoholic beverages demands that we have this impost, and we have heard very fanciful claims from him in justification for it. Each and every one of those claims has been shown by the industry, in documents they have presented to the government, to be fanciful and false, yet the government still persists with these false and fanciful claims. The claim is that tax equity demands that similar industries bear similar tax levels. To say that, in taxation terms, wine should be treated at similar levels to brandy, beer and spirits begs the question as to whether they are indeed like industries. Certainly they all produce alcoholic beverages, but a logical comparison beyond that suggests that they are not the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The beer industry relies on raw materials, with short production lead times, crops sown and reaped on an annual basis, plus the addition of water. The raw materials of spirits are essentially waste products. In contrast, grape vines, the raw material source for wine, require up to seven years from planting to adequate grape production. So the supply tap cannot be turned on and off over a short period in response to government tax policy that is detrimental to the industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak very briefly on the package of sales tax bills that we have in front of us. It is not necessarily all about wine, though people could be excused for thinking it was totally about wine. The government in its election campaign promised no new taxes. To attack our situation the government promised no new taxes and no increased taxes. Now we have this package of sales tax bills to complete the package of lies perpetrated by this government during the election. These budget measures come in with increased sales tax in every direction. In fact, these bills will total $1 billion in a full financial year.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not going to spend much time on wine tax, but that tax is an attack on a growing industry. It is growing, but still small, and this attack when it could have done without it means people in that industry will be paying 55 per cent extra. The idea behind bringing in the increase in the sales tax on wine was to balance it up with beer and spirits; but if the government wanted to balance that up, I can think of an easier way to do that, and that is to reduce the sales tax on beer and spirits. That would have been much easier. It could also have looked at other measures to cut the wasting of money&mdash;something this government is good at doing&mdash;to balance the budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Increases in sales tax on any industry puts on it an impost that gets in the way of industries competing on export markets; but our wine industry also has to compete on the Australian market, so it will cause a loss in jobs. This government set out to increase job opportunities, and increasing job opportunities is what our GST package was about; yet here we have this government going in exactly the opposite direction. Last time this government put an increased tax on wine, there was a cut-down in consumption and a loss of jobs in the industry. Maybe some people reckon it is a good idea to cut down the consumption of wine. I do not know, I do not drink the stuff; but whatever the government wants to do, in this case what it is doing is bringing about the loss of jobs. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I probably cover the first two categories. Now it has turned around. It is accepted in Australia, and there is an industry; so now the government has got to tax it out of existence. That is the situation we are in. The wine tax will raise only about an extra $100 million.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">But as I said when I first started, I am more interested in the other sales tax moves. There is a general one per cent rise: one per cent now, two per cent in August 1994. Let us look at the effect that will have on transport through plant and repairs, tyres and parts. For instance, in transport, for a prime mover that is worth about $200,000 wholesale, the tax will put $2,000 on it now and add $2,000 next year. That is $4,000. Look what that will do to the cost of transport and the cost of goods, especially in those rural and remote areas. Look at that sort of situation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For the family car, there is to be a wholesale sales tax rise of one per cent this year and one per cent next year. That will be $300 there. For a set of tyres that cost, say, $200 each retail and $140 wholesale, it will put $1.40 on to each tyre this year and another $1.40 next year. What does this sort of measure do? It causes people to keep plant going longer. Plant that goes longer is not as safe, not as up-to-date and not as efficient on fuel. It is the same with cars. We are trying to get more modern cars on the road in Australia, ones that use unleaded fuel. The average car out on the road in Australia is 10 years old, a 1983 model that burns leaded fuel. So how is this measure going to help? All that increased sales taxes will do is stop or cut down the sales of new cars. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The first change in the sales tax will raise an extra $585 million. With the one per cent next year, it will raise a total of $1 billion. I have heard big noises about the sales tax on wine which will raise $100 million or less. The general rise in sales tax is the killer. It will be raising around $1 billion. We were criticised for coming out in our GST package with a balanced situation which was transparent. The government, in its package, lied about that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My time is limited so I will wind up by stating generally what these bills do. In Australia, sales tax raises $9.44 billion a year. These bills will increase that by 10.6 per cent to $10.23 billion. That is about three times what inflation is today. It is a total disgrace. Government supporters lied. They tried to shoot holes in our Fightback package. Having lied their way back into government, what are they doing now? They are breaking every rule in the book and giving us these massive rises. </PARA>

The tax will be loaded on to areas that cannot afford it, especially the export industries and farming. No-one can tell me that farmers do not pay sales tax.

Those measurements do not compare in any way with the measurements that have been made in Melbourne or in Sydney&mdash;certainly, in specific areas of those larger cities.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me go on and give some idea of the effect of this wine increase on some of the small producers. It is the small businesses and small producers which are the ones that we are looking after. I would like to read one of the many letters that I have received from wine producers over the past months since the budget was announced. This is one letter written by two very small wine producers from Eyre Peninsula. Eyre Peninsula is one of those poorer economic regions where the average household income of something like 60 per cent of the people is less than $25,000 a year. It is from the Delacolline Estate and the Boston Bay wine producers in Port Lincoln. I will read into the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> this short letter which was written to me. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Dear Sir</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">At the present time, we represent the only members of the grapegrowing and wine industry on South Australia's Eyre Peninsula. In the light of the recent savage increase in sales tax applicable to wine products, it is unlikely that we will be joined by others in the foreseeable future.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Both of our vineyards were established in 1984. The first commercial release of wine from either vineyard was in October 1988. When the first plantings were done, there was no sales tax applicable to wine products.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The first tax was introduced at a rate of 10% in 1984, throwing out all of our budget projections by a significant factor.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">By the time we reached a productive status, the tax had been doubled. Any budgetary adjustments that we made in 1984 were consequently rendered useless, even though those adjustments had been in place for four years whilst we waited for a commercially saleable product.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Neither of us is an exporter. The volumes of our production are such that we can only hope to realistically market our product on the domestic scene. Nevertheless, the real impact of this latest increase will be just as devastating as it is for larger producers who do export. We participate in a legitimate area of the wine market, namely the production of premium quality wines in small to medium volume. With others, we have evolved to meet a gap in the market place. Producers of our size must be extremely careful of the cost inputs whilst at the same time providing our products to the market place at a reasonable and acceptable price. We cannot overcome cost difficulties with increases in volume. This latest tax increase will go a long way to making it impossible for us to keep our products in a reasonable and affordable price range. The effective retail price on our products will instantly jump between $1 and $2 a bottle.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe that the wine industry on Eyre Peninsula, however small, makes its contribution to what is already a fragile local economy, providing a level of employment, a market for local suppliers and contributing to a balanced tourist economy. There is a place for other producers to follow suit, but we believe that this most recent measure will quickly discourage any expansion of the industry in this region.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We urge that tax increases be reconsidered and we support the representations made . . . by the Winemakers' Federation . . . and the Winegrape Growers' Council . . . </PARA>
<PARA>That is signed by Mr Tony Bassett of the Delacolline Estate and Graham Ford of Boston Bay Wines. I think that highlights what will happen in the wine industry. There is no future for anybody else to take on small production, as these people have done since 1984, when the government has changed the rules. Every time they get near to putting wine into production, we see an increase which throws out all of their forward projections. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to make one other brief comment, Mr Acting Deputy President, on the issue of sales tax in general&mdash;that is just sales tax, without taking into effect the fuel taxes&mdash;and in particular its effect on regional and rural people. I note that the government still has not acted to amend the anomaly in the sales tax legislation with regard to spare parts used to recondition machinery which is later sold to exempt primary producers. It will cost primary producers another $10 million a year in taxes&mdash;$10 million which, as I have pointed out several times in this chamber, our rural sector cannot afford. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has already admitted that this is an unintended consequence, and yet we have seen no legislation introduced to change that sales tax provision so that those people in rural and regional areas who are being hardest hit at present will have the benefit of tax exemption on second-hand machinery.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let us have a look at some of the effects of these sales tax rises. It is incredible that a government that is supposed to support and be representing people on lower incomes brings in such measures. The effect, particularly of measures like the wholesale sales tax, will be to put a disproportionate burden on the people who can least afford it. It has become more that way as the years have gone on. During the time of this government, we have found that the top 10 per cent of the population have become richer and the bottom 10 per cent have become a lot poorer. Now the government, with these sales tax measures, is putting the boot into this group yet again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other major reason why the coalition has chosen to oppose the government's tax increases is their effect on jobs. We have almost one million people unemployed in Australia. We now have an unemployment rate of 11.1 per cent. But the Treasurer said that the primary objective of the budget was jobs. As I will go on to prove to Senator Cook in a few moments time, the effects of these measures will be actually to reduce jobs and increase unemployment. As a matter of fact, the New South Wales Chamber of Manufactures has calculated that under the measures of the budget there will be a loss of 50,000 jobs. That is of concern across the whole country, but to people like me who are based in a regional area like the Hunter Valley it is of particular concern because our rate of unemployment is much higher than 11.1 per cent. We have an unemployment rate of 13.4 per cent in the Hunter Valley. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The measures in this bill are going to be devastating for employment in an area where seven people join the dole queue every day. I have asked in this chamber and in the media on a number of occasions that the Australia Labor Party members of parliament who represent the Hunter Valley stand up for the Hunter Valley, cross the floor and vote against these measures. Unfortunately, when the bill went through, they did not do this. I assure the Senate that we let the people of the Hunter know well and truly that their so-called representatives in the Hunter were voting for measures that put up their taxes and put their families out of work. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effect on the wine industry, not just in the Hunter but Australia-wide, has been pointed out by the South Australian Centre for Economic Studies. It was interesting to listen to what Senator Cook had to say earlier. He kept saying, `Prove it'. This is a proper research body. The study was funded by the Arnold government. I say to Senator Cook that the Labor government of South Australia thought so much of his government's measures that it spent $250,000 on funding this study. It discovered that, following this tax measure, the sales tax on wine would put prices up by nine per cent. It would displace 15 million litres of non-premium wine. Fifty per cent of the grapes grown to support this production would disappear. Exports would be constrained by the availability of premium grapes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Kerin pointed out that a lot of his colleagues did not understand how the grape growing industry worked. Producing wine from grapes is very different from forms of production of other forms of alcohol, in that there is a five- to six-year lead time when grapes are grown for wine. Constant chopping and changing of government policy creates havoc in the industry. </PARA>

<PARA>I thought that must be an aberration and the people of Australia had suddenly decided to invest in local shares rather than invest overseas. But it seems that it is not only the local people who are doing this. In the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Financial Review</EMPHASIS> the headline is `Foreign rush for Australian shares'. The article states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As foreign money poured in, the Australian sharemarket powered to its highest level in six years yesterday when the All Ordinaries index broke through the psychological 2000 mark to close at 2018.8.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It marks the present share boom as one of the most spectacular in recent history&mdash;in 11 months it has lifted the value of Australian stock and shares by $84 billion.</PARA>

<PARA>And so it goes on. Now, who is right? Should we appoint a select committee to look at the headlines on the front pages of the dailies? It seems to me that those headlines cannot be consistent with what we have been hearing today. If we ask the wine industry to pay some extra tax, will we find that the foreign people who have rushed in to buy Australian shares today will rush to sell them tomorrow because we, irresponsibly, according to others in the chamber, are going to ask people who grow wine and sell it to pay tax?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know that they are alone in paying tax. We all pay tax. We do not like paying tax. No doubt if we had more money that we did not have to pay to the government we would invest it. If we invested, the foreign rush for Australian shares might become a foreign stampede for Australian shares. If tax were simply abolished and nobody had to pay tax, things would be sensational, according to the analysis we have heard here this morning. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> in Melbourne, just to finish off, has the headline `Share dollar boom', and goes on to talk about that. By the way, I notice that on the front page of the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> there is a reference to a 16-page guide to the spring racing in Melbourne. The spring carnival in Melbourne is one of the highlights of that great city's year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The racing industry has great export potential to South-East Asia&mdash;to Hong Kong, to Japan and to Malaysia. They are all developing their racing industries. I searched this 16-page article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Herald-Sun</EMPHASIS> on the spring racing carnival. I thought that since the industry has that great potential for export, there would have to be some article saying that if taxes were put upon the sale of thoroughbreds, whether at Inglis's sales or the Dalgety sales in Melbourne, that would ruin the industry. I thought I would find an article saying that the great potential we have to expand one of the major industries in Australia will be set back, and therefore it should not pay tax; but I could not find that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conclusion I have reached from that is that the racing industry has a sense of responsibility to the rest of Australia. It probably thinks it ought to contribute to the hospitals, the schools and the roads that we have got to pay for in this country to run it well. I would have thought the racing industry would think it proper to accept some responsibility for the money we need to develop the culture we have in this country, to pay for the Olympic games, to keep our rivers clean and to reclaim land. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This great racing industry has so much potential. It has tourist potential in Australia. It attracts millions of dollars to Victoria during the spring carnival, millions of dollars to New South Wales during its season, and millions of dollars into Senator Lees's state of South Australia through institutions like Lindsay Park. That industry seems to have faced up to its responsibility to the rest of Australia. It does not engage lobbyists. It does not go around the countryside urging politicians and other people to stop it being taxed so that its members can make a proper contribution to the country in which they live. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When one looks at what the racing industry does, not only through the taxes it pays but also through the generosity of many of those associated with it in terms of contributions to charity, one can only be amazed at the stark contrast between that industry and the wine industry of this nation. Those associated with the racing industry can point to the contributions the industry makes to hospitals, to charities of all sorts, to private institutions and to private charities such as church groups. I ask those who are going to get up following me and who will be supporting the proposition that the wine industry should not contribute to this country through taxes to point out where that industry has made even half of the contributions on a voluntary basis that the racing industry has. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard statements like that made by Senator Kernot that now is not the time to put a massive increase on the wine tax, because the wine industry is a burgeoning export industry. What follows from that is that somebody else ought to pay the tax that the wine industry would otherwise have to pay. Somebody else would have to contribute to all those institutions that we look upon to make their proper contribution to this country. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Everybody in this chamber is paid out of consolidated revenue. So we take money from consolidated revenue for our wages. But, because we have got a wine industry in our particular state and because we are affected by the lobbying that has gone on in reaction to this measure, we say that the wine industry&mdash;which enjoys all the benefits of this nation, including the excellent government we give it and including the scrutiny of various pieces of legislation in this chamber which will otherwise affect it&mdash;does not have to make a contribution to that because now is not the time, because it is now going to be on a big export drive, because it should be given special attention and because it should receive discriminatory treatment in its favour. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It seems to me that the great success of the wine industry has been its very effective lobbying processes. I would like to put on the public record my admiration for the way the people in the wine industry have been able to get together a program which may well defeat the imposition on them of a proper tax. I say it is a proper tax because everybody in this nation is expected to make a contribution to the great lifestyle that we have. It must be a great lifestyle because people on the opposite benches keep saying, `We do not want to change it. We do not want to move to a republic because under the monarchy we have got the best system'. That, of course, pays great tribute to the way my party has governed for the last 10 years. People do not want to change the system. They want to stick by it. So we cannot complain about the lifestyle we have got. Yet, when people are asked to contribute to paying for that lifestyle, they object and say, `Oh, well, let somebody else pay'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would have thought that what has got the wine industry going is the quality of the wine. It is a good product and people want to buy it. But apparently I am wrong in that. On the analysis coming from the opposition, people have been buying wine because there is only a 20 per cent tax on it. But if the government puts another 11 per cent tax on it, it does not matter how good the wine is, how great the quality of it is, people are not going to buy it. They are not going to buy it for its quality; they are going to buy it because it has only a 20 per cent tax on it instead of a 31 per cent tax. It is an amazing proposition that we are building an export industry, not on the basis of the quality of our wines but on the basis of the level of taxation we are going to put on it. It is a proposition that I find very interesting. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The people who have spoken longest and loudest, and properly so, are those with wine industries in their state. I do not suggest for one minute that, when they get up to speak on behalf of the wine industry in their state, they have in any way got their eyes on the next ballot. I do not say that at all. It would not be worthy of me to think that people would be speaking about the evils that come with a wine tax because they might be looking for votes at the next election. I do not say that, but I do say that, when they make a proper assessment of how this wine tax will affect the industry, they have to realise that it is one of many industries and it is one of a whole series of income producing organisations in the country that ought to make a contribution to what they get out of this place. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If time had not been against us I would have liked to refute some of the quite spurious arguments of the previous speaker, Senator Cooney, arguments that dealt with the spring racing carnival and other ridiculous matters that not even my good friend and honest parliamentarian Senator Cooney could possibly have believed in. It is fairly obvious that the Labor Party wants to stop this from going to a vote. It wants to drag this out as long as possible. We on this side have been asked to confine our speeches to the barest minimum so that we can get on with the legislation and have it passed, in order that the uncertainty in the wine industry at this time can be overcome. It seems to be the definite ploy of the Labor Party, however, not to allow that to happen but to exacerbate the current uncertainty.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My remarks will be brief. I support wholeheartedly the arguments that my colleagues who have spoken previously have put in this debate. The arguments have been put very well. They have canvassed all aspects and they have put the case so skilfully as to convince even the densest of legislators of the correctness of our argument. I would not say that even the Labor Party is so dense that it cannot understand what it is doing with this legislation. I can only think that the Labor Party has introduced this legislation, which is to tax one of our better industries, out of sheer prejudice&mdash;not out of a desire to gain revenue or a desire to do anything in the taxing area but simply out of prejudice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The arguments have been made but the debate would not be complete without some reference to the wine industry, which has the greatest potential within the Australian industry. The Australian industry is now world renowned for its quality, its value and its consistency. The area which has the greatest potential within the Australian wine industry is the Queensland wine industry. Many of our colleagues have spoken about the wine industry in other states but not a lot of people realise that there is a substantial and increasing wine industry in Queensland. There are 31 registered winemakers and approximately 25 of these winemakers use grapes. The rest of them in Queensland use tropical fruits, for example in the Daintree area of north Queensland, and they also use dates from Surat in western Queensland. Most of the vineyards in Queensland are in the Granite Belt region; other locations include St George, Roma and Charters Towers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry has 18 operating commercial wineries with a total annual crush of 600 tonnes. This is only small when compared with production in the Hunter Valley, which has a crush of around 18,000 tonnes. The Queensland industry accounts for just 0.1 per cent of Australia's total grape production. All traditional grape varieties are grown in Queensland and they all show very great promise. Over 90 per cent of the Queensland wine sales is for the Queensland market. I understand that the balance is for the Australian market and there is very little, if any, export. That is very important in this debate. The industry in Queensland has great potential. Over the last six years the industry has grown by 50 per cent. Queensland wines are increasingly gaining national recognition, winning awards in major wine shows in the southern capitals. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is always a pleasure, when parliamentary business takes me to Stanthorpe or when I attend Stanthorpe for Liberal Party functions, to be able to get from the source some of the great Queensland wines that are now being produced in the Granite Belt area. The potential for growth is enormous. There is plenty of land available in the Granite Belt, which is in proximity to the Australian region with the fastest growing population&mdash;the south-east region of Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wine industry council of Queensland believes that prior to this wine tax announcement the Queensland industry had the potential to grow to the same size as the Hunter Valley. The Stanthorpe-Granite Belt region was starting to get real gains from the tourism activity which follows a successful wine industry. That area in the border region of Queensland, in the Granite Belt, is seeing an increase in tourist activity because of the wine industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like my colleagues, I oppose the tax on wine because it is simply brought out of prejudice by this Labor government. I am pleased to see that the Democrats and the Greens&mdash;I think&mdash;are opposing the tax. I cannot help but say what Senator Cooney was not prepared to say, that it seems to me that the attitude of the Greens and the Democrats is purely for crass political purposes. If they were concerned about the taxes on an industry affecting adversely that industry, they would be the first ones to join with us in opposing the increase in tax on petrol. But no, the Democrats are not interested in that; perhaps there are not the same sorts of votes in that in their constituencies. They seem to think that they have a real constituency in South Australia and it is to pander to that that they seem to be opposing this tax, but not opposing the petrol price increase of 7c a litre which will affect every rural industry and every other industry in Australia. That is not to say I do not welcome the Democrats' opposition to this proposal, but it does show again quite clearly the hypocrisy of this particular political party of the left. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our attitude to this bill has been consistent with our policy generally on these new taxes for which this government has no mandate whatsoever. Nowhere during the election did we see the Labor Party indicating that it was going to put an increase in tax on wine. Neither did we see it proposing an increase in petrol tax or in fact any other tax at all. All it proposed was that there be reductions in personal income taxes which it told us were fully funded and did not need any new taxes. That is what it told the Australian public about. We have consistently opposed these taxes for which it has no mandate and about which the Labor Party collectively lied before the last election. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I oppose the tax for the reasons that my colleagues have mentioned, but as well because it will set back a Queensland industry which has enormous potential for growth. Investment and expansion in the Queensland industry would vanish if this tax were to be implemented. The concessions held out by Mr Dawkins in a desperate attempt to save his position in this failing government would have mainly helped the large winemakers and disadvantaged the small companies which make up the entire Queensland industry. So Mr Dawkins was trying to buy off the big fellows but completely ignore the little fellows who comprise the total amount of the Queensland industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The tax increase means a decrease in demand for wine, an oversupply of grapes, falling grape prices and heavily discounted wine competing for a smaller domestic market. Consequently, winemakers will be absorbing the tax rather than passing it on. The government just does not seem to understand that winemakers are price takers, not price setters. As I mentioned previously, Queensland does not export wine; so this tax will fall directly upon it. I am sure Senator Burns, as a loyal Queenslander, will be joining me in opposing these taxes which will adversely affect the wine industry in Queensland. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am informed that, if this tax were to go through, there would be many wineries in Queensland that would become bankrupt. It would completely stifle this new and potent industry for Queensland&mdash;an industry which, without this tax, will make very great strides. I listened with interest to Senator Cooney's figures and his run-through of this morning's papers. I heard Senator McKiernan talking about some arithmetic and blaming us for not being able to add up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I conclude simply by again quoting Mr Kerin, the disgraced former Treasurer but well-regarded former primary industries minister. I point out to Senator Cooney that Mr Kerin&mdash;not I, not the Liberal Party, not the industry but Mr Kerin himself, one of the honourable senator's colleagues&mdash;said that the proposed wine tax increase was based on `ignorance, stupidity and prejudice'. It seems that so much of the legislation in this budget&mdash;I mention also the FBT on business travel, which according to former Labor minister Mr John Brown is in the same category&mdash;is based on prejudice by the Labor Party against others in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Kerin, in my view, has hit the nail on the head when he says that the tax is based on ignorance, stupidity and prejudice. Mr Kerin&mdash;not I&mdash;says that the government's arguments for it are dishonest. Mr Kerin has further said that it would be a massive disincentive to invest in the industry. I point out to Senator Cooney and Senator McKiernan that Mr Kerin says that the 55 per cent tax increase is a massive disincentive to invest in one of our few expanding primary industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope that the government will see sense in this matter and will join the Liberal and National parties in opposing this. I call on Queensland senators, who obviously have an interest in the wine industry in my home state, to join me in doing something to protect that industry in our state&mdash;at the same time enhancing the industry in every other state&mdash;by opposing this very iniquitous legislation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will be speaking on behalf of the Democrats on only the sections of these bills that relate to the wine tax. I begin by saying that this is consistent with the Democrats' stand on the two previous wine tax increases, in 1984 and 1986.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Perhaps I should begin also by answering some of what Senator Cooney had to say, in particular to stress that the wine industry is already paying a considerable amount of tax. This is an increase on what it is expected to pay now. More importantly, I should put in a couple of points that Senator Cooney glossed over. This industry provides more than just a tax base for the government. It also provides employment, particularly employment in rural areas of Australia, where jobs are not easy to come by, and in particular it provides this country with considerable income, thanks to its success on the export markets. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Democrats believe that winemakers have provided sufficient evidence to show that this sudden tax increase would have a negative impact on the industry&mdash;indeed, quite a disastrous impact, not just on the industry itself but also on entire rural communities. There is no doubt that winemakers feel betrayed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The winemakers believe the proposed tax increase to 31 per cent would see the retail price of wine jump somewhere between nine and 15 per cent, resulting in a $100 million fall in domestic wholesale sales. They base these figures on what has happened previously when there has been an increase in the tax on wine. The winemakers say that the proposed tax increases would have seen the displacement of 50,000 tonnes of grapes and that $126 million per year in export income would have been lost. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Most importantly, Australia's wine makers believe that the proposed tax increase will slash investment. There will be $35 million in lost investment for plant and equipment, $160 million in lost inventory investment and $250 million in lost investment for new vineyards. I had first-hand evidence of that when I recently visited the Coonawarra area of South Australia, where a number of plantings have been put on hold awaiting the outcome of this tax impost. The $445 million in lost investment is in an industry that proudly boasts that it is on target to achieve its goal of $1 billion worth of export sales by the turn of the century. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The extent of the damage that this tax could have caused is open to debate. It is open to debate primarily because the government has no industry plan for the wine industry. The government has not done its homework. It does not have the figures. Indeed, it seems from the letter from Mr Kerin leaked to the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> and published this morning that this tax came straight out of Treasury and that the Department of Primary Industries and Energy had no input whatsoever into the imposition of this additional tax on the industry. So we cannot put a precise figure on how many grape growers would have been pushed to the wall to the point where they were forced out of the industry or how many small wineries would have closed. What we do know is that some grape growers would certainly have gone, or indeed will go if we have an impost of this type, and that some wineries certainly would not have survived. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The need to develop a full industry policy for the wine industry is now urgent. The budget shows that the only industry policy that the Australian Labor Party seems to be able to come up with is one that revolves around the idea of to tax or not to tax, one with absolutely no parts that consider what this industry is able to contribute to the Australian economy. The winemakers' view is that there certainly will be severe damage, and the Democrats do not question that. Their views are supported in the findings of a detailed examination conducted by the South Australian Centre for Economic Studies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The centre found that an increase in the wholesale tax on wine from 20 per cent to 31 per cent will result in a retail price increase of at least nine per cent. At page 16 of the document it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Given the nature of the export market&mdash;the low price points on the market and the higher production costs associated with the smaller levels of production&mdash;the smaller wineries have to market their wine hard in order to compete at the higher price end in export markets. Significant costs are involved in a marketing exercise of this nature. Notwithstanding, the possibility that many small wineries will successfully export part of their volume, it is anticipated that these wineries will experience a decline in sales as a result of the increase in sales tax to the order of 3.6 per cent in the short run and up to 18 per cent in the long run . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For many small wineries, such a decline in sales may be unsustainable in the long run.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small wineries are important for the continuing tourist potential of the wine regions. It is the small wineries in the Barossa, Clare and McLaren Vale regions that attract visitors to the regions which sustain other associated businesses (restaurants, bus companies etc). No attempt has been made to quantify the impact on small wineries.</PARA>
<PARA>The claim that Australia's wine industry will suffer internationally because of the wine tax proposed was also highlighted in a study conducted by the Centre for Brand Management and Marketing Communications Research. In that document it is stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Australian wine industry has the ability to supply to the export markets of the United Kingdom and Northern America with brands with product quality and cost advantages. Unfortunately these "product-based" advantages are eroding day-by-day as the traditional suppliers to these markets improve their own winemaking . . . Now is the time for investment in marketing activities which build market-based assets . . . It is in light of this commercial reality that any change in the tax system which reduces the ability of Australian wine exporters to invest in the building of market-based assets has the potential to substantially downgrade the industry's international competitive advantage . . . Put simply, the Australian wine industry's competitive advantage is neither as secure or as strong as some would wish. One hopes it has the ability to weather the consequences of this tax increase but any drop in the investment in export marketing activities is a waste of a current, temporary opportunity.</PARA>
<PARA>Not only do the winemakers feel betrayed, they are clearly distressed about their future and the futures of their families. The Democrats have received hundreds and hundreds of letters from across Australia setting out examples of what the wineries themselves believe is going to happen if this tax goes ahead. I have selected only a handful of quotes from letters received by the Democrats. If the Senate will bear with me, I will just go through a few of those. The first is from Garry Crittenden from Dromana Estate Vineyards in Victoria. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Should the tax go through my calculations suggest the shedding of one to one and half full time positions from my labour force as well as the complete shelving of a major expansion currently being considered.</PARA>
<PARA>James Talijancich owns a small winery at Herne Hill in Western Australia, and he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Over 85 per cent of wineries in Australia are family operated. A greater majority of these are wineries who have made the tremendous effort to specialise in PREMIUM WINES. . . The main reason not being to pocket more money, but to make the absolute most of this fruit and the region in which they work and at the end of the day to be proud of what they have achieved.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">For this to occur takes years, and in most cases generations of persistence, patience and dedication to this craft.</PARA>
<PARA>I go on to a letter from Phillip Tonkin from Currency Creek winery in my home state of South Australia. He says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our small business has looked closely at the results on us should this proposal come into effect.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sadly the answers are not at all good.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Our proposal to plant more vines and employ more staff to increase our competitiveness and cost effectiveness will be shelved. . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This leaves us to consider the option of simply closing the door.</PARA>
<PARA>David Wynn, an Eden Valley winemaker, says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Having changed our export market to one based on quality and value, are we to be cobbled with a huge burden instead of getting the encouragement that other countries offer their wine industries?</PARA>
<PARA>I go on to a letter from Kym Tolley, the director of the Penley Estate winery in South Australia's Coonawarra region, who says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If our politicians really believe it is through self interest that the wine and grape growing industry have rallied together, then it may be time for a closer inspection of our history, planned future and its effect on the people of Australia in terms of employment, capital investment and export sales&mdash;all vital to Australia's future.</PARA>
<PARA>As I said before, these are just a few examples of the views of thousands of ordinary Australians who are trying to ply an honourable craft against multinational competition and government insensitivity. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The winemakers are also critical of the Treasurer's compromise package. They say the phasing-in component of the package would make no difference and would only prolong the agony, as the industry would end up with an even higher tax rate than the 31 per cent. It goes up again. The industry is also very aware that the compromise package is nothing more than a government gimmick aimed at taking the pressure off the government and placing it back onto the Australian winemakers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">A quick calculation suggests that in this new package much of the $70 million that the government was planning to receive from the wine tax in the first year would go back to industry. It is a very interesting acknowledgment that what we are seeing here is a government saying it does not really need this $70 million after all. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Much of the debate over the proposed wine tax increase has ignored the plight of Australian grape growers. Let us look at some of the statistics that have been provided for us as to what the impact will be on the grape growers. I quote here from a document that they have put out which makes the following points:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">80% of Australia's wine grapes are grown by independent grapegrowers. . . </PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">90% of these enterprises are family farms.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">85% of these farms <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">are smaller than</EMPHASIS> 50 hectares.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Sales Tax increase will ultimately see a reduction in demand for 50,000 tonnes of neutral grapes, equivalent to the loss of 300 growers and their families.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This loss of 10% of the industry's producers will be concentrated on the Riverland, Mildura and Griffith.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It takes 3 years to bring a grape vine into bearing and at least 10 years before a profit can be realised.</PARA>
<PARA>So much for those who believe that this industry can easily be compared to any other industry. Their final points are:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government has changed the ground rules for investment in grape industry 3 times in the past 10 years.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Federal Government takes $200 million from the industry but returns only a paltry $1.3 million in research grants.</PARA>
<PARA>It is clear that the 55 per cent sales tax hike on wine is simply a cynical tax grab. It is also absolutely clear the government has not taken the time to think through the ramifications for Australia's wine and grape industries. Obviously, a measure of the evidence of that can be found in that letter from Mr Kerin. The government must put aside this tax grab and institute a thorough regional development study into this industry. Indeed, the wine industry is a perfect case for such a study. We need to examine what level and type of assistance is needed to help the wine industry flourish, and we must identify the danger points and the possible impediments to the progress of this very valuable industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's offer that the Industry Commission can conduct a study is unacceptable to the Democrats. In its current form the commission, with its entrenched ideological bias towards extreme economic rationalism, is not going to be the way to proceed. It is interesting to compare the very detailed work the government was able to put into the Button car plan and, indeed, the excellent work that has also gone into a policy for the pharmaceutical industry, with the fact that it has done no work at all on the wine industry. There is no effort on the part of the government to put forward a comprehensive package for this industry to ensure its future. Hopefully, the Democrats' decision not to support the proposed tax increases on wine will help the government to get to such a point where it will acknowledge that an industry plan is required. If the government does not, then the Democrats will proceed anyway. As Senator Spindler was able to show with his successful inquiry into tariffs, we can put together an independent parliamentary inquiry. Indeed, it is urgent that we do this if the government itself is not prepared to move on the wine industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As the winemakers state, the wine industry is a model for all Australian manufacturing industries in that its competitiveness is based on sustainable, natural and technological advantages. Most importantly, the industry's competitive domestic marketplace is the main springboard for its export success. This model would have been totally undermined by the proposed tax increase. The Democrats will continue to oppose any increase in future budgets unless there has been that full and detailed study; and that examination has then led to a detailed industry policy that shows a tax as an acceptable part of the package; and that taxing the industry in such a way will not have any negative impact or repercussions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Winemakers Federation represents one of Australia's few industries clearly able to establish export goals, and feels it has been tripped at the last hurdle by the government's change of rules. The change of rules does not even represent a distribution of burden but is a straightforward, discriminatory, targeted action aimed at the one industry which is constructing an orderly solution to the Australian malaise in the international marketplace. The ultimate disappointment for the Winemakers Federation is that it will not make its full contribution to the Australian economy if it is hamstrung by this government's taxation policies&mdash;indeed, hamstrung by taxation policies here, while its international competition enjoys subsidies rather than taxes. Let us hope sanity prevails in this debate and that an industry plan can be quickly and thoroughly developed so that we will be enhancing this export industry, enhancing the employment opportunities it is able to offer and actually supporting a very valuable Australian industry. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is a pleasure for me to speak on the sales tax bills today and to support my colleagues in opposing this wine tax. I would like to reiterate what has been said before: it is another example of the utter contempt this government has shown for business and rural communities. It is just another example of the way in which they operate, without any consultation with the industry. It is another example of decisions that have been made on the run by this government that is getting so desperate to try to find some money from somewhere.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that I was rather amused at the wide-ranging contribution to the debate by Senator Cooney, who came in here with a great pile of papers and showed us today's headlines about the share market, as if that were going to save Australia. He did not mention the adjacent headline, `Former Minister brands wine tax hike dishonest'. I went out and got out the share price list, thinking that I would see how the wineries were going. The only four I could find were Penfolds, which had not moved; Petaluma, which had gone down; Peter Lehmann Wines, which had gone down; and Rothbury, which had not moved. Whilst the share market might be steaming ahead with gains of 40c and 50c by some of the major companies and the blue-chips, certainly the buyers have not fallen over themselves to buy shares in wineries. I can understand why when I look at the decision that this government has taken to impose a 55 per cent increase in sales tax on the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This industry is one that has really been a flag carrier in the last few years. Its exports have grown by 1,000 per cent in six years. It has gone from a $20 million industry in 1986 to $300 million in 1993. As Senator Tierney said earlier, it was on track to become a $1 billion wine export industry by the year 2000; but I am afraid that is not now going to happen. It has been an example of our technology and of cooperation between industry and science. It is another example of the wonderful work that the CSIRO and the Wine Research Institute have done. It is interesting to note that large winemakers such as Penfolds, Orlando and Hardys have ploughed almost $40 million a year into the industry. They have certainly been given a nice slap in the face with this 55 per cent increase in wine tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting to note also that, because of the technology that has been developed in Australia, companies overseas&mdash;particularly the French and German winemakers&mdash;are looking very closely at our industry. It came to my attention that at least two Australian industries have moved into the south of France and are actually growing wine in France. One is Hardy Brothers and the other is Global Vineyards. The interesting part is that, I believe, the French are actually advertising a French chardonnay made in the Australian way. Obviously, the effect of our wine industry on world markets is being felt even by the French. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To reiterate, the government's wine tax will, at one blow, increase retail sales prices by up to 15 per cent, reduce domestic sales by $100 million, raise sales tax from $200 million to $279 million, cut export income by $126 million each year, cut back on investment in the vineyards by $250 million, cut back on investment inventory by $160 million and slash investment on equipment by $35 million. For the government to try to gain a projected $79 million, the wine industry is going to suffer a total investment and income loss of some $445 million. What a ridiculous state of affairs that is. It will also cut the projected number of permanent jobs in the industry by up to 45 per cent. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That has been pointed out in a survey by KPMG Peat Marwick. In the few brief minutes I have left, I particularly want to put in a word for the fledgling wine industry in Tasmania because, as Senator Murphy would know, Tasmania being a small state has been relying on its high quality products to become very competitive and to make a name for itself with such things as its fish exports and its high-priced luxury goods such as cheeses. The Tasmanian wine industry has become an integral part of this as it has also become an integral part of our tourism industry. We have 100 winegrowers and 25 of those have full-scale operations. They employ about 100 people and they have 400 people on a part-time basis. So whilst these may not be huge numbers, from our point of view in a state of our size they are quite significant. In fact, this year the Tasmania winegrowers will harvest something like 1,200 tonnes of grapes which will produce more than one million bottles of very high quality Tasmanian wine.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This industry did not just happen overnight. In fact, the first experimental vineyard of any consequence was established by the CSIRO in conjunction with the local winegrowers at a property right next to mine some 20-odd years ago. I had the pleasure of watching this wine industry development. Bob Menary from the CSIRO has been mentioned in Tasmania as one of the early pioneers of the industry. Claudio Alcorso is well known to most Tasmanians. I believe he is a very good Democrat or Greens supporter at the moment, but in the early days he was a very good Labor supporter and his son was a strong Labor voter. I can tell honourable senators that they are not very pleased with what has happened with the wine industry because the Alcorsos were, really, the first major wine producers in Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">They have just invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in improving their vineyard, bringing in a restaurant and making it into a wonderful tourist attraction. We can understand the devastating effect that this increase in wine tax is going to have on them. I spoke to one of the members of the family only on Sunday and, like Senator Lees who was here earlier, he gave me the same sort of sad news that she has been receiving from her constituents. So it really is very serious; it is not something that can be scoffed at. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increase in the wine tax is going to have a devastating effect, particularly on small wineries in all sorts of areas over Australia. As I said earlier, the wine industry itself is not only producing export wines, it also has a very important role to play in the tourism aspects of each different area. As wine drinkers like Senator Murphy and Senator Loosley would know, a wine reflects the nature of a particular area and for that reason it is popular. People like to take what they see as part of an area when they are visiting and so it is very important for our tourism industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Time is short so I will conclude by reiterating that the wine industry is one of the true success stories of our recent agricultural endeavours. It has prospered because winegrowers all over Australia&mdash;like those in Tasmania&mdash;have concentrated on a quality product. I guess some of that growth of the wine industry can be attributed to our friends from overseas. It was originally commenced, in Tasmania anyway and I guess in some other places, by immigrants who brought their skills to our country. There is no doubt&mdash;as Mr Kerin said this morning&mdash;the government tax will decimate the industry. The industry itself says so, and independent financial research confirms those views. We will be opposing this tax because we believe, unlike the government, that the wine industry is very well worth preserving. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought it appropriate to begin a brief contribution in the debate this afternoon by quoting from the Treasurer on a sales tax bill. This is from the second reading speech in the House of Representatives:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">First of all, I remind the House that any taxation changes, unpopular as they inevitably are if they involve increases in taxation for any section of the community, have to be seen in their overall economic context as part of a Budget which seeks to achieve an overall economic objective. At this time, amongst other things, the economic objective is to take pressure off interest rates which is a very important cause to all Australia's families, and the entire country. Therefore, it is important to see these changes in the context of the Budget because they are clearly an integral part of the Budget and cannot be severed from it. It has been our view from the beginning that they are central to the Budget. That has been and will remain the view of the Government on this legislation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Of course, I am not quoting Treasurer Dawkins when I bring those words before the House; I am quoting Treasurer John Howard in the Fraser government in 1981. It is fascinating to see the total change that has occurred in the coalition ranks on measures such as these. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The circumstances that confront us this afternoon are well beyond those that just reflect upon the tax measures that are proposed. Senator Ian Macdonald, in his earlier contribution, actually maintained that the legitimacy of the Labor government was in some question. As coalition speakers are wont to do these days, he continually talked about whether or not the government had a mandate to legislate in the national interest. The answer to that is a resounding yes; of course, the Labor government has a mandate to govern&mdash;confirmed for the fifth successive time by the Australian people on 13 March 1993. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not only a circumstance whereby we made certain commitments to the Australian people which we are about honouring, including the tax cuts which also form an important and integral part of the current budget. We also made certain commitments not to do things. We maintained, for example, that tax would not rise overall relative to GDP. That commitment has been honoured. We also maintained that we would not do things that were being proposed opposite consistently and vehemently&mdash;slashing Medicare to pieces, up-ending the industrial relation system and introducing a goods and services tax, 15 per cent, on everything that opens and shuts. There is no question that, in terms of commitments, we committed ourselves to take certain positive steps. We are doing precisely that. We also committed ourselves not to do certain things that are still embraced by the coalition, and we have honoured that commitment as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The questions about our legitimacy ought to be rejected, ought to be dismissed, and I do that right now. Coalition members appear to be reverting to the only tactic that they believe works in opposition. The only manner in which they see a trail back from opposition to government is to endeavour to make the Senate unworkable. So we have seen the guardians of gridlock at work again today, in terms of the tax measures. The guardians of gridlock are going to be associated with the coalition right through the life of this parliament. There is no doubt about that in my mind. I listened to the unelectable Dr Hewson yesterday morning on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS>. He ran about No. 10 or 11 on the program. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of his contribution on <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">AM</EMPHASIS>, though, again Dr Hewson wanted to fight the last general election. It is like strategists for the Second AIF basing what we were doing in the 1940s on what happened between 1914 and 1918. It simply does not work. Fightback has actually become `fight backwards', looking back on how the election perhaps ought to have been fought. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We cannot have a debate on tax in the chamber without reflecting on Australia's position among Western industrial countries overall. Australia, according to the OECD, now has the lowest rate of tax applying in any Western industrial economy. That is a first-class achievement in terms of the direction in which the government has gone over the last decade. When we came to office, after the Fraser-Howard-Stone period, we had tax rates routinely going above 60 per cent. They are now, in many cases, half that, or getting towards half that. We have seen the corporate tax rate well down, we have seen the individual and personal tax rates well down and we are seeing another raft of tax cuts coming through as a consequence of this budget, when ultimately it is passed, even by the recalcitrant senators opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is no doubt, in terms of economic governance overall, that there are some first-class measures in the budget document that Mr Dawkins presented to the House of Representatives.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I say to Senator Kemp that it is important to note that his party had a major role to play in delivering security to the country's forest industry and decided to vote against it. So I think it is a very important matter for the opposition also.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Tasmanian forest industry has had a number of inquiries over a long time, the most recent of which was set up arising out of the Helsham inquiry. It was funded by the federal government and a forests and forest industry council was put in place. It was made up of bodies representing the conservation movement, industry, state and federal government, and the trade union movement. It conducted a process of seeking to develop a strategy for Tasmania's forests arising out of other inquiries and also of trying to settle disputes arising out of those matters and the use of the state's forests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The process dragged on for a long time. I think it started in about 1989 or 1990. I was a member of the Forests and Forest Industry Council, by ministerial appointment. I have to say that, although at the start we had great initiative and, I think, we set down some very clear objectives for the state's forests, many of which were very good objectives, we still failed to deal with some of the very key and important issues. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to refer to the report, which was finally called <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Secure Futures for Forests and People</EMPHASIS>, handed down in September 1990. It contains a summary of agreed recommendations for the forests and forest industry and for forest strategy for Tasmania. Although the conservation movement did not finally support the report, I think the intention and the objectives set out in the report are very good. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Essentially, the report dealt with three or four key areas. They were the people issues, the employment aspects of what we could derive from the commercial use of Tasmania's native forests, conservation and a transition strategy which would try to take it out of the debate about conservation matters and settle it in a very democratic way to ensure that we did maintain in a sustainable way all of the state's forest types and species. The report also related to the public use of forests and, last but not least, the forest industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I want to deal with the forest industry more than anything else because it is the industry that I believe has the greatest potential for Tasmania to provide employment on a sustainable basis. Unfortunately, even though we have had some 13 reports and even though we have a current strategy, we do not seem to be able to get it right in terms of the recovery and utilisation of the wood that is harvested from the state's forests. That is very sad. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have gone from being an industry that was quite a large employer to an industry where we have lost a lot of jobs in a lot of the larger manufacturing mills such as paper and pulp, mainly due to technology. I am concerned with the sawmilling industry. The state government at the moment has the opportunity to deal with the industry and actually bring about some changes, particularly in light of the recent sale to Amcor of the paper making processes that belong to North Broken Hill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will go back to make the point about how the major companies operated in this state. Some years ago they were granted concessional rights on the basis that they would undertake downstream processing. Those rights were granted in very substantial areas of forest over long periods of time. They were legislated rights, but they were mostly associated with a program that required the company or companies that had those rights to enter into downstream processing, primarily associated with pulp and paper manufacture. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Sadly, we have seen the demise of those industries to the extent that North Broken Hill has sold the APPM paper mills it owned at Burnie and Wesley Vale. The company still retains the concessional rights, and it is my view that it should not. I believe the state government ought to terminate the rights. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say that because in 1991 there was legislation passed in the House of Assembly in Tasmania&mdash;and supported by the then Liberal opposition&mdash;that concessional rights would be replaced with wood supply agreements, and that those wood supply agreements would be based on volume rather than area. It is my view that the current Liberal government ought to terminate immediately the concessional rights that still exist in Tasmania's forests today. It is the only way that we will see the industry changed in a way that will ensure greater participation from other developers and other proposers in what I hope will be better downstream and value adding processes for the wood that we take out on a commercial basis from both the public and private forests in the state. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the circumstances that exist now, we have North Broken Hill proposing a further woodchip mill. North Broken Hill initially proposed it on the basis of primarily using wood from the company's private property. It was going to be built for the primary reason of securing the future of the two paper mills at Burnie and Wesley Vale, but they are paper mills that they no longer own. As a result of that, I have some doubt as to the legitimacy of the company's claim for the building of another woodchip mill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, I think that if we are able to convince investors to build a pulp mill in Tasmania in the longer term, it will be a very worthwhile investment. In terms of the overall wood production, my concern is that because one company owns a substantial amount of private forest it has the capacity to affect significantly the harvesting of the public wood resource, and that will impact very substantially on the state's sawmilling industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the other very important areas is the utilisation of the wood. When we actually cut trees down we should try to maximise the value adding. Some people would say that if one looked at value adding on a dollar basis one would make it all into paper. It is probably true that on a dollar per tonne basis paper is the most valuable manufactured product that one can get out of trees; but it does not employ many people, and it is going to employ fewer because of the technology that is available in the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think this is a very important matter for the state government, and I hope that the federal government will be able to assist in some way. We have to encourage the Tasmanian government to allow different uses, and to be pro-active in the area of initiating programs that will ensure that the wood is utilised in such a way that it will create more employment and, simply by better utilising the trees that are cut down, reduce the necessity for the current level of harvesting native forests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is not to say&mdash;and I want to make it quite clear what I am saying&mdash;that we should have less native forest to harvest. I do not believe that should be the case. I think harvesting of forests can be done, and it can be a very valuable thing to do if it is done in a sustainable and ecologically sensible way. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Tasmanian state government has not signed the federal government's national forest policy statement; it is the only state that has not signed. The statement goes to some very important areas. One that I would like to refer to is the efficient use and value adding of the wood that is harvested from the country's forest. The statement says that we have to take it into account that:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The benefit to the community from using forests for wood production can be increased through the efficient use of wood by industry.</PARA>
<PARA>That is one of the fundamental problems we have at the moment. There is so much wood that is wasted by way of woodchips, et cetera, just being shipped out of the state and certainly from the country in the rawest possible form. This simply should not be allowed to continue. The statement says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Efficient wood production and use can also provide greenhouse benefits by reducing greenhouse gas emissions through minimising soil disturbance during harvesting, reducing milling waste and producing long-lasting products. The governments agree&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, all of the state governments which have signed this policy statement&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">that it is essential to foster a dynamic and efficient forest products industry that offers employment opportunities and economic benefits for the nation.</PARA>
<PARA>I would have to say that in Tasmania right at the moment we are sadly lacking in that area. The statement goes on:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the governments will keep regulations to a minimum. In order to attract new investment and profitable value-adding projects . . . </PARA>
<PARA>Again I would have to say that the state Liberal government has failed dismally to do that, even though it currently has proposals before it that would increase the recovery and utilisation of wood harvested from Tasmania's forest and would also increase employment in the industry. The state government has not done anything about it. In fact, one proposer who has sought my assistance has had nothing but difficulty&mdash;brick walls, almost, are put up to the projects that he has proposed. Given the state of unemployment in Tasmania, it is a sad reflection on any government that it would take that sort of position. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to the overall process in terms of where the industry goes, the industry has a great future. It is a very important industry and, given the employment opportunities in Tasmania, probably one of the best in terms of being able to provide long-term employment, providing it is managed right. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There have been 13 reports on this long-term issue. We have had many debates. Many debates about Tasmania's forests have taken place in this chamber and in the House of Representatives. Those debates may not always have been about employment.

In his speech, Mr Beazley noted that the architects of the current contents database are addressing a very real problem faced by libraries in the higher education sector. Mr Beazley acknowledged that, with the cost of journals rising annually at a rate substantially above inflation, pressure is being placed on libraries to cut serial subscriptions, especially as more and more library expenditure is taken up by serials at the expense of books. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is outrageous that this government can acknowledge the problem and then fail to come up with any sort of workable solution. It has decided to increase funding, but what a pathetic amount! At the National Library, the minister tried to boast about the measly $5 million extra he planned to spend. I must point out to the Senate that this $5 million will be spent across 36 universities. Also, he is not talking about an annual figure; he is talking about a triennial figure. Bringing that back to how much extra he is planning to spend on capital infrastructure for libraries in the next three years across Australia, it amounts to a figure of $50,000 per university per year. That will go a long way! It is really throwing cents at a problem that needs big dollars to fix it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Mr Beazley should know that the $5 million that the government has allocated for the next triennium is on top of the miserable $1.5 million over the past three years. This is creating, over the six-year period&mdash;the last three and the next three&mdash;a massive run-down in our university library system. What this minimal commitment shows is that the federal government simply does not understand the extent of the crisis it has created. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The effects of this crisis have been illustrated recently to the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training inquiry into the organisation and funding of research in higher education. The hearings of our committee have been conducted all over Australia, and at each university we are constantly hearing about the deteriorating state of university libraries. At the hearing in Perth, Mr Ellis, the librarian at the University of Western Australia, said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">. . . in recent years we have noticed a very significant decline in the purchasing power of Australian libraries, particularly academic libraries, and this has had a series of consequences.</PARA>
<PARA>The dire nature of some of these consequences was probably best illustrated at the University of Adelaide. There they have an excellent library, the Barr Smith Library, which really becomes a regional library, in a sense, for the rest of South Australia. The pressure on the Barr Smith Library was so great that it could not keep up with just restacking the shelves from use. Because the librarian did not have sufficient money, he was forced into a position where he had to bar access to that university's library by people outside the university, and that bar continued for three months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is Third World stuff if libraries are forced into a position where they are so lacking in resources&mdash;not just for books and journals, but for proper staffing&mdash;that they have to cut back to that extent. What is the minister's answer? His answer is $5 million over three years for 36 universities&mdash;$50,000 per university per year&mdash;to solve what is an absolutely massive problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is now reaching the stage in some universities where the journals, which are absolutely essential for research, are being cut back&mdash;not just fringe, marginal journals but essential journals. Journals can be very expensive and the costs are going up, but the government is not recognising this in its funding arrangement. What is happening in a number of universities is that they are saying to the various departments, `We want you to cut a number of journals out of the annual stock you subscribe to. Your choice, you can pick the journals, but you have got to cut them out'. As I said before, this is really Third World stuff. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Additionally, just as the libraries of our higher education sector are not able to keep up with updating their journals, nor are they able to keep up with the technological advances that are occurring so rapidly in the information industry. A major capital injection is needed for library infrastructure to enable them to access electronic databases in Australia and especially those now being created overseas. This is the life blood of academic research, yet because of the lack of funding by this government our academics are being denied it. Our academics and researchers cannot remain at the forefront if they do not have regular access to this information. </PARA>

<PARA>I am greatly concerned about this because I do not think enough has been done to redress the wrongs that have occurred to many human beings who, unfortunately, were sent to live in these institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I first became involved in this issue some years ago when I assisted a constituent, who happened to have been born in the same part of the world, who had just discovered&mdash;he was in his late fifties&mdash;that he had some relatives living back home. He had no travel documents and he came to me for assistance to get travel documents so that he could go back and visit his sister, who was very ill. Luckily, we were able to arrange for the travel documents to be provided quickly. He was able to jump on a plane and to meet up with his sister just before she died. Of course, he was able to attend the funeral. </PARA>

These people allege that in their childhood, while they were in these institutions, they were abused not only physically but also sexually. It was disturbing to sit and talk with people who were trying to block out memories from their childhood. It was very difficult, and I felt inadequate to the task of talking with these people about something they did not want to talk about yet did want to talk about. I have thought long and deep about what our society can do to help redress the alleged injustices that it has been put to me have occurred. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am not sure. I do not have the reference number; it is not a long article. In order not to sensationalise the matter, and these things can from time to time be sensationalised, I thought the best way of tackling the matter was to request our Western Australian government to arrange for a judicial inquiry into the matter. I felt that that was the only way the truth of this matter could finally come out. I asked for it to be a judicial inquiry because of the sensitivity of the matter not only to the brothers, to the church, but also to the victims. It is the victims I am particularly concerned with&mdash;people who want to talk but cannot talk and at the same time do not want to talk. Such an inquiry would have to be handled very sensitively.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wrote to the State Attorney-General, Mrs Cheryl Edwardes, on 28 July asking that such an inquiry be established. I got a prompt acknowledgment of that letter very shortly afterwards. I again wrote to the Attorney, Mrs Edwardes, on 1 September of this year, again calling for the establishment of the inquiry. I got a further reply from the Attorney on 14 September, which concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">You may be assured that I am cognisant of the concerns of both groups and I am confident that conciliation will result from an atmosphere of mutual cooperation.</PARA>
<PARA>Obviously the Attorney has not committed herself to a judicial inquiry. I also had come into my possession a letter from a Christian Brother which said a number of things that particularly disturbed me and which, together with this article I mentioned in opening, prompted me to rise today. I shall quote parts of the letter. I will not use the name of the brother, but if any honourable senators want to look at it they are more than welcome to do so. By way of introduction, he says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Senator McKiernan . . . are entitled to your view on the matter of the public inquiry over the child migration/Christian Brothers orphanages controversy, but there is another view, and the other view is not merely . . . a sort of cretinous self-interest. The Brothers officially, and myself too, feel that a public inquiry is unreasonable in the circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA>He went on to outline the reasons why it seemed to be unreasonable:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the Brothers side many of the main accused, the Principals of Institutions, and the Brothers' executive tend to be dead and their capacity to contribute to the inquiry is limited.</PARA>
<PARA>That is pretty obvious. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Surviving brothers from the 40s and 50s are old and cannot present themselves properly or at all at an inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore the Brothers cannot present properly at such an inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The VOICES organisation&mdash;</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">wants an inquiry but many past students of the Homes do not want their childhood and adolescence paraded before their wives, work mates, friends.</PARA>
<PARA>I empathise with that but, nonetheless, we do have to press on. What really concerned me was the next dot point:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There WAS a grotty underworld in the Homes and some of the lads were into unpleasant activities with one another. All this muck would have to come out in an inquiry.</PARA>
<PARA>He concludes:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do have good reasons for not agreeing with Senator McKiernan and I understand that the government agrees with us&mdash;or so I am told.</PARA>
<PARA>I hope that the government does not agree with the writer of that particular letter, because the Brothers organisations themselves have conducted their own inquiry into this matter. They have been motivated, from the results of that inquiry, to publish an apology and a form of explanation in the media. They have publicly admitted that some form of sexual abuse and physical abuse has occurred in institutions which they were in charge of. That report, the result of their investigations, remains secret to the Brothers organisations. Whilst they would argue that they have a right for it to remain secret, it is a matter for the community. And it is a matter, I believe, not only for the current Western Australian state government, but also for this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The VOICES organisation which was mentioned in the Brothers letter is an acronym for the Victims of Institutionalised Cruelty, Exploitation and Supporters. Mr Bruce Blyth, who is quoted in the article I opened up with, describes the panel as `a sick joke`. I am not going to go that far. But if the panel is going to be the only investigative action into this area, I would be really concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am going to await a further reply from Mrs Edwardes to see whether she can be convinced to organise a judicial inquiry. I think a judicial inquiry can be very useful, not only to the victims but also to the Brothers and the Brothers organisations themselves. Unfortunately, when accusations like this are made in our community, all people get tarred with the same brush; and nowhere are the VOICES organisation, the victims or I saying that all Brothers are abusers. We have never said that. Neither has Mr Blyth and neither have any of the spokespersons and, to the best of my knowledge, neither have any of the victims made that accusation. Nonetheless, it does happen that it is spread around. So it can help to clear up the name of the Brothers organisation and, to a certain extent, the church as well. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will await Mrs Edwardes's response to the calls from myself, from the VOICES organisation, and from other members in the community as to whether or not a judicial inquiry can be established. However, I would give notice now that, if the requests for a judicial inquiry in Western Australia are not acceded to, I will in a month or so take whatever action and use whatever procedures and processes are available to me as a member of this Senate&mdash;be it through the chamber itself or the parliamentary committee system&mdash;to expand, open up and delve into this. I do not think a parliamentary inquiry would be the right way to investigate the various allegations that have been made on this issue&mdash;I really do not think that is the right way to go&mdash;but, if it is the last course open to us, that might be a road that we will have to go down.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to very briefly comment on the points that Senator McKiernan has brought up today. I am very happy that he has brought this subject up at this stage, because I have been involved with this situation since 1987. Senator McKiernan might remember that there was quite a toing-and-froing between former Senator Jenkins, who used to sit in this place, and me on this matter, going back quite some time. Unfortunately, she overdramatised the situation and threw accusations at members of this parliament as being part of the use of child and migrant slave labour&mdash;if I could so describe her words at the time. With the overdramatisation then, it got out of hand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, I am glad that Senator McKiernan has raised this matter today. Over the years I have spoken about this situation to Brother Faulkner, who is in charge of the Christian Brothers in Western Australia. The people involved in VOICES have been in constant contact with me, because I came to the conclusion quite a few years ago that an inquiry was needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am a product of the Christian Brothers education system, and I must say this in their defence: if it were not for the Christian Brothers movement, a lot of people in a lot of places today would not have had the opportunity to gain a secondary education. The Brothers provided boarding schools that were cheaper than the normal private schools around the place. They were probably a third of the price of the normal boarding high schools that were available. It was through these cheaper schools that people were provided with an education, and it was a good education. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For that reason, with the other reasons that Senator McKiernan has mentioned, I want to see an inquiry. From what I have seen, there could have been a few rotten apples in the barrel. The brothers who are still alive will now be quite old. But it does not matter how old they are; I do not accept the excuse that an inquiry should not be held because they are too old. I do not want the whole Christian Brothers movement brought down or discredited because of those few rotten apples. The brothers did provide for the education of a lot of people. There are a lot of good Christian brothers who are still alive, and I still have contact with them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I welcome an inquiry. I have made inquiries, too. Christian brothers, just like sisters, do not stay in the orders for ever. I took the opportunity of speaking to a former Christian brother whose opinions I trust. I knew he was a former Christian brother, but he did not know that I knew. I rang him up one day and broached the subject. I asked him to tell me what went on, and whether there was any need for an inquiry or whatever. I wanted to know. I will defend the innocent, but I will not defend anyone who is guilty of some of these alleged crimes. Having that in mind, and having spoken to Brother Faulkner, I am of the opinion that we need an inquiry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Only last week I wrote to Brother Faulkner telling him my view that it is time that we held an inquiry. Four or five years ago he was rather reticent about having an inquiry. I also wrote to the Catholic Archbishop of Perth, encouraging him to have an inquiry. I thought that as head of the church in Western Australia he should be involved, but to date he has been backward in being involved. The inquiry will show whether there was right or wrong, and I believe the head of the Roman Catholic Church in Western Australia should be involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McKiernan will probably be interested to know that I have written to Cheryl Edwardes, acknowledging what she has said&mdash;what Senator McKiernan read out to the chamber. I suggested to her, and in fact I implored her, to have a judicial inquiry. Like Senator McKiernan, I do not think a parliamentary inquiry is really the way to go, but if we were to be denied a judicial inquiry then I would support it. I think we have got a bipartisan approach on this. I will certainly keep encouraging Cheryl Edwardes, the Attorney-General in Western Australia, to have an inquiry, and I hope that over the ensuing weeks or months we will get some result. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak about a matter concerning Senator Richardson answering a dorothy dixer in question time. I will quote his reply to the question, which was in relation to the medical benefits schedule:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The AMA has been claiming that the latest increases can be defended on the basis that the MBS fee has not kept pace with doctors' costs. Between 1984 and 1992 the average medical benefits schedule fee went up 62 per cent. At the same time the CPI went up 59.8 per cent and full time average weekly earnings went up 54.5 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA>I probably should entitle my few words `Lies, damned lies and medical economic statistics' because that was the gist of what Senator Richardson was talking about. I have done an analysis since the reply and I am appalled that a minister of the crown should manipulate statistics to suit his own purposes in an attack that has gone on for two days now. On the one hand, he has spent the time since he was appointed Minister for Health going around the country telling everybody what they wanted to hear because that is how he functions, I know from past activity; on the other hand, he has been giving them a slap over the face when it suits his political purposes. Ultimately, as I mentioned previously, they will wake up to it and understand how he does function. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would like to revert to the statistics. The first point to make is that there have been dramatic changes in medical services between 1984 and 1992. The actual explosion in technology has been phenomenal, far exceeding any of the other explosions in technology that have occurred, say, in telecommunications, the developments in fax machines, mobile telephones, et cetera. In that time we have seen, for example, the use of laparoscopic cholecystectomy&mdash;removal of the gall bladder&mdash;through the use of video cameras and instruments, allowing the patient to be discharged from hospital within 48 hours but often 24 hours, as opposed to the situation in 1984 where a patient was in hospital for about a week and then unable to return to work for at least four weeks, sometimes six weeks. That time is now a week. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">So the first point I want to make is that there have been dramatic changes in relation to medical services. To come back to Senator Richardson's answer, to equate an average medical service in 1984 to an average medical service in 1992 is comparing apples with pears or something of that nature. There is no such thing. It is like comparing a motor vehicle that you bought in 1984 with the improvements that have occurred in the average motor vehicle that you can buy now. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point in relation to those statistics is that some of those procedures, of course, take a lot longer in time to perform&mdash;to use that same operation again, the removal of a gall bladder using video cameras to do those procedures. As Senator Kemp would know, it is like using chopsticks as a lot of us do sometimes in eating Chinese food; surgeons have to learn those procedures using chopsticks through small holes in the abdominal wall to remove internal organs. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VW4">Senator HERRON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Not at all. It is very successful, as Senator Schacht would know from his knowledge of these procedures. The other comparison that puts the lie to the figures that were produced is, as I mentioned, not only the sort of technology but the introduction of technology. One of the most dramatic increases has been in the insertion of ocular lenses, and there have been coronary bypass procedures, diagnostic imaging, organ replacement&mdash;all those things. So to draw a comparison, as I mentioned, between 1984 and 1992 in relation to medical procedures is also fallacious.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The next point I want to make is in relation to the bulk-billing of services. Again he claims that something like 80 per cent of procedures are bulk-billed. But what he does not tell us is that most pathology and most radiology is bulk-billed. Of the specialty procedures, less than 10 per cent are actually bulk-billed. The bulk-billing is heavily weighted by 24-hour clinics, the very group that he is looking at in relation to overservicing and the other matters in relation to that. He has ignored practice costs. On the one hand, he is saying that is immaterial and, on the other hand, he is introducing tax bills that will considerably send up the cost of petrol, when a major feature of medical practices is driving between hospitals and seeing patients in their homes. That is not acknowledged on his part. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Using the CPI as a reference guide, I can produce a table for him which quite clearly demonstrates that the CPI has accelerated far in advance of medical benefits schedule fees, which is the true measure, rather than actual medical costs. It has exceeded them by over 20 per cent in that time. He did not acknowledge that the Auditor-General in his report in 1991 clearly stated that the medical benefits schedule fee is regarded, for audit purposes, as the fee that the government is prepared to subsidise a patient for his medical costs. It has no relation whatsoever to the costs of practice or the fees charged by doctors. That is conveniently forgotten. The Auditor-General said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is no longer a single well established and commonly understood basis for the schedule fee. Reductions in schedule fees have generally resulted in reduced observance of schedule fees by medical practitioners and increased costs to patients.</PARA>
<PARA>The very man who, when he was minister, introduced the concept of co-payment in relation to pharmaceutical benefits and claimed that it was an important feature in restricting the cost of the pharmaceutical benefits scheme&mdash;and it has successfully done so&mdash;is now claiming that that is not acceptable in relation to medical services. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, he instanced the top 25 per cent&mdash;`quartile' was the word he used&mdash;of medical specialists who earned incomes. His figures were, for the ophthalmologists, obstetricians and ENT surgeons, between $400,000 and $500,000. Senator Patterson interjected with the previous point about ignoring practice costs. I have done an interesting exercise&mdash;I have not completed it, so I cannot give the figures&mdash;on the top quartile of politicians. It is very interesting.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Which possibly opens up a loophole to allow the duty-free importation of vehicles by people who do not hold a determination under the export facilitation scheme. If we needed any evidence of the inadequacies of the drafting I could quote Mr Holloway, from the minister's department:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">In this particular case one would have to say that the particular by-law in question&mdash;if not the item, certainly the by-law&mdash;could have been drafted better than it was.</PARA>
<PARA>He repeated later:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It could have been drafted better than it was.</PARA>
<PARA>The amendment will remove a potential liability by the Commonwealth to refund duty paid in respect of motor vehicle importations since 1 January 1991, which this government claims could be as high as $500 million. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science, Technology, Transport, Communications and Infrastructure, which conducted a hearing into this matter last Monday, I think it has to be asked how a mistake of this magnitude could occur. I suppose it is not surprising when one considers that this amendment bill arises out of an error in previous amendments which were overseen by the former minister for customs, now the Minister for Communications, Mr Beddall. As we have seen, the former minister has moved to bigger and better mistakes over pay TV. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, with regard to this particular mistake, it has recently been contended that under paragraph 41 of the Customs Tariff Act and the accompanying customs administrative by-law, the duty-free importation of all passenger motor vehicles, including by those companies which are not participants in the car plan&mdash;that is, which are not domestic manufacturers&mdash;is allowed. It is as a result of this that at least two companies which are not domestic manufacturers have now submitted claims to the Australian Customs Service for a refund of duty paid on all vehicles imported in the last 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is obviously contrary to the original intention of the car plan, to support only those importers which manufacture in Australia. Duty is paid on a motor vehicle at the time it is imported. The duty is subsequently claimed back from the Australian Customs Service, if export credits are available. Importers who are eligible for a refund of duty using export facilitation credits obtain a determination from the Australian Customs Service which waives payment of duty on vehicle and components when they land on the dock. This has obvious cash flow and administrative benefits because the businesses do not have to pay duty and then claim back a refund. Importers who do not have these facilitation credits simply pay the duty and obtain the cargo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With regard to these two companies that I have mentioned, claims for a rebate of duty have been submitted, but without the offsetting export credits having been accrued. If this duty was successfully claimed from customs, it could provide a windfall for the companies concerned because the duty has already been paid, and it has already been built into the sale price of the vehicles. Moreover, as the claim is for a rebate of duty paid over the past 12 months, many of these vehicles would have already been sold. So it is for these reasons that the consumers presumably would not gain any benefit at all from refunding duty to non-exporting companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to note that the two companies that I have mentioned did not apply for a duty exemption. I guess that is because they had already paid the levy before they found out there was this possible loophole, and only then did they decide to take advantage of what might be construed as a drafting error in the legislation. I note that other car importers have not tried to take advantage of this error, because they want to see stability in the car plan. But I wonder how long these companies would have held out in the face of their competitors getting an unfair advantage. I cannot imagine it would have been too long. How long would it take them to join the line to claim a refund? For all the reasons that I have outlined so far, the coalition obviously supports the original intent of the export facilitation scheme. Therefore, we will be supporting this amendment bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Having said that, I have several serious reservations. The first concerns the right of all Australians to rely on the law as it is written. The two companies involved have relied on the law as it is written, and they have applied for a refund of duty paid, even though they have not earned export credit points. They believed, and they had advice that the law, as it stands, allows them to do this. I also have a concern with the retrospective nature of the bill because we are always loath to support retrospective legislation, and for very good reason. I would like to quote one small passage from the evidence that was given to the committee by Mr Carlsson from Volvo Australia in which he said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also like to point out that we are very concerned about the retrospectivity of the proposed legislation. What industry wants is to have stable conditions and a legal framework within which to work that does not alter and does not change. We have in this country experienced quite a lot of uncertainty and changes to legislation without proper notice being given. We find it difficult to operate under such conditions.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">May I just call to your attention that not even at the present time do we know what sales tax is to apply to the sales we are making and have to make. The luxury car tax has been going up and down with very little prior notice. It makes it very difficult for us to plan and it causes losses to our company and then, in the long run, also to the consumers of Australia. We would very much resent it if the legislation were to be passed retroactively.</PARA>
<PARA>He says `retroactively', but I think he means `retrospectively'. We have a particular concern about the retrospectivity, and have a belief that we should not be agreeing to retrospective legislation. It is our view that taxpayers must be confident in the legislation so that they can plan accordingly for the future. They must be certain that a government cannot levy extra taxes and charges which are retrospective, and hence certain that they will not face a backdated fiscal responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, there are some places where the coalition may feel that there are compelling reasons to support retrospective legislation. It was with this in mind, and because of the retrospectivity of the nature of this legislation&mdash;Volvo in particular having applied for a refund of the duty paid because it believed it was entitled to that under the current legislation&mdash;that the matter was raised at the committee hearing. The rules have been changed after Volvo had made application for the refund of duty that was already paid. Had this legislation been changed 12 months ago, or at the time of its making that application, I am quite sure the company would have never made that application. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With this in mind, the committee in its deliberations believed that as there was no provision for a refund of the lodgement fees, the government should make an ex gratia payment to those who lodged applications under the legislation that was in force at the time. This was communicated to the minister, and I compliment him on the speed with which a reply was given to the committee. In a letter to the finance minister he has asked that those application fees that were paid under the original legislation, which will now be superseded by this retrospective legislation, should be refunded to those companies&mdash;including Volvo. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I note that in the letter he has requested that from the finance minister. I am hoping that perhaps the minister, if he speaks later, will be able to tell us whether or not those fees will be refunded. I am quite sure that he would have had an answer by now, but I think it would not be right for us to proceed under the belief that these fees will be refunded and then find at some later stage that they are not to be refunded. As I understand it, it is only a request from the minister. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In considering the retrospective element of the amendment bill currently before us, the coalition has examined what would happen if we did not allow the amendment to go through. We have considered the likely impact on industry and consumers and the original intentions of the legislation. Accordingly, and after considerable deliberation, the coalition will not be opposing this bill. The amendments proposed are obviously in line with the original car plan, and to oppose the amendments would give car companies which do not manufacture in Australia an unintended advantage. We have, I believe, made a responsible choice, but one we would not have had to make if the legislation had been right in the first place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, Mr Acting Deputy President, I would like to make it perfectly clear that the coalition does not like retrospective legislation. The support for the legislation on this occasion is strictly a one-off. In no way does it set a precedent for future support to any retrospective legislation, especially in matters of taxation. As I said before, we will be supporting this amendment bill. </PARA>

When there is a doubt on an industry policy of such size and importance to Australia, the government is not willing to take even that slight risk.

For the next 12 months or two years the whole of the program would have been at risk. A program that has taken Australian exports for motor cars and components from under $50 million in 1983 to $1.3 billion last year is a magnificent achievement in policy terms and a magnificent achievement for the car industry in Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate and the Minister representing the Prime Minister.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do stand by what I said back in August on this subject. Indeed, I agree with what Mr Kerin has said in this respect because the selective quoting of Mr Kerin's private correspondence omits to include a couple of really rather crucial sentences where, at the outset of his letters to a small number of people in the industry, he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There are no reasons in tax equity why wine should not be taxed at a higher rate.</PARA>
<PARA>More specifically, in response to what Senator Tierney has just said, the second sentence states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I don't believe the dire results projected by the wine industry with a 31 per cent tax will necessarily occur.</PARA>
<PARA>Certainly, as I say, the government agrees with Mr Kerin's judgment in this latter respect for a number of reasons. The first is that wine exports will continue to be wholly exempt from WST, given the nature of that taxation; but, secondly, and more specifically, because there are indications that there is still very strong investor support for the industry, particularly given its present buoyant state with exports at record levels and the long term future is very bright.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind Senator Tierney&mdash;he might not be aware of the facts&mdash;that since the budget BRL Hardy, for example, has announced a $75 million vineyard development program. Again, South Australia Brewing has announced additional capital expenditure of $100 million to $150 million over the next few years. This is not the response of an industry that feels itself subject to some kind of knockout blow as a result of what was contained in the budget in this respect.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another thing to bear in mind about what we have said in the budget, because I think these have been insufficiently emphasised in the debate, is that wine will be permanently excluded from the imposition of excise. That is something the wine industry has sought for a very long time&mdash;a guarantee of exclusion in that respect&mdash;and that is exactly what it got.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wine does remain lightly taxed and the increase in wholesale sales tax applying to wine has reduced a longstanding anomaly that did place wine at a very significant tax advantage over beer and spirits. That tax anomaly was a legitimate concern, given that wine and beer are substitutable alcoholic beverages. Prior to the changes, beer and spirits were taxed around four times more heavily than wine. That gap has been a little reduced as a result of the changes and certainly it is not an intention, I repeat, to impose an excise on wine, which would close the gap completely.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The remaining point to be made is that the tax we are proposing will also be progressive because the price impact will be lowest on the cheapest wine. The price of a four litre cask of wine is estimated to increase from only around $7 to $7.50 and there will be similar orders of magnitude on bottled wine. Mr President, that is the response. I do not think we have anything to be remotely apologetic about in terms of the way that this issue has been handled and certainly not in terms of the basic core proposition about the impact of these proposals on the industry as a whole.</PARA>

It was interesting for me to see the origin of the advice and, having seen the nature of it, I had to go back and make sure it was the same Ian Viner I had heard of elsewhere and met previously. But it is, in fact, the Mr Viner who used to be a Liberal Party federal Minister for Industrial Relations and, more recently, was the President of the Western Australian branch of the Liberal Party; it is, in fact, that same person.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">3.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation does not protect employees, in circumstances where their employer threatens to dismiss them from their employment by notice, in accordance with their contract of employment, for the purpose of compelling them to accept the terms and conditions of employment in a workplace agreement proposed by the employer, except in the situation where an employer has not previously entered into a workplace agreement. Whether the employee is actually protected will depend upon the particular circumstances.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">4.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The legislation does not protect employees, if their employer dismisses all its workforce by notice, advertises their jobs and then employs only those persons, including the former employees, who are willing to enter into a workplace agreement on the terms and conditions specified by the employer.</PARA>
<PARA>Quite clearly, we have a package of legislation which was rammed through the Western Australian Legislative Assembly. Although the minister, Mr Kierath, claimed that his legislation was similar to this government's proposal, it is significantly different in a number of ways, but most importantly because it does not have a no disadvantage test. That is the crucial difference.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only constraint on flexibility which our proposal provides is a no disadvantage test. That means that employers can have all the flexibility in the world, except to cut the conditions of workers. People who do not like it are complaining only because they cannot pursue their preferred policy, which is to cut the wages and conditions of working men and women. We do not accept that, we will not accept that and that will not be the basis of any package which we introduce. That is what is fundamentally flawed about the proposal in Western Australia. It is why Mr Viner's advice is such good advice. It leaves individual workers unprotected in negotiating their wages and conditions and it stands in very stark contrast to the more reasonable, humane and consistent with Australian tradition policy of industrial relations which we are putting forward.</PARA>

This action is being taken in recognition of the Defence Force's duty of care as an employer of service members involved in areas where there are substantial and demonstrable safety concerns.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The introduction of random drug testing into the Defence Force working environment is an initiative with which I, as Minister for Defence Science and Personnel, and Senator Ray, the Minister for Defence, are in complete agreement. I firmly believe that all possible protection needs to be provided to service personnel who are performing tasks such as flying or servicing aircraft or helicopters, handling explosives ordnance, operating heavy equipment such as armoured vehicles or trucks, or being responsible for the safe manoeuvre of warships.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In introducing the program, a balance has had to be struck between occupational health and safety and civil liberties.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I stress the point that the introduction of this measure does not in any way indicate that the ADF believes that there is an unusual problem with drug usage by ADF members. Because of the nature of service life, I think it is more likely that drug usage in the ADF will be more apparent to service authorities and that the testing proposal will assist service authorities in fulfilling their occupational health and safety duty of care.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Although the testing program will be random in the selection of individuals, it will place emphasis on important and high risk areas, such as operational units and basic training establishments.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To ensure that ADF members' careers are not adversely affected by false screen test indications, no disciplinary or administrative action will be taken against a member before a confirmatory laboratory test is carried out and that will be analysed using gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The government welcomes the draft report on the legal profession of the Trade Practices Commission that was conducted by Professor Fels and was part of the Trade Practices Commission's study of the professions. We believe that the report, which was released this morning, is an important contribution to the debate about how to reform the structure of Australia's legal profession and make it more responsive to the economic needs of the 21st century, but not just to economic needs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is little doubt&mdash;it is recognised very widely in this place&mdash;that the legal process has become inaccessible and remote for many Australians. We recognise that governments have a responsibility to increase access to justice for all citizens. One way of doing that is to establish procedures which are simple, cheap and fair. In this context, the Trade Practices Commission report is one important source of information to facilitate the changes that are necessary in this profession. This report, together with the report of the Hilmer inquiry and the very eminent Senator Cooney Senate inquiry into the costs of justice, provide cogent arguments about the urgent need for state and territory governments to look at the structure of their legal systems and to identify anti-competitive practices.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In respect of certain aspects of the report, the government supports the argument of the Trade Practices Commission that restrictive trade practices which cannot be justified in the public interest should be eliminated. That point was also made by the Chief Justice of the High Court, Sir Anthony Mason, in a recent speech. We also believe that the draft report makes a persuasive argument for the need for an integrated national profession, a goal which both the Attorney-General and the Minister for Justice have been pursuing with some vigour.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is also little doubt about the costs of our legal system and the fact that those costs have the potential to impact on our international competitiveness. For instance, the legal profession has an annual turnover in excess of $3 billion and employs some 55,000 people. The current situation, where there are some 17 representative bodies spread over eight jurisdictions, indicates that the profession is over-regulated and in need of reform.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also note that regulation of the private legal profession is very much in the hands of the state and territory governments. There has already been significant cooperation between those governments and the federal government in respect of the mutual recognition scheme. We anticipate that we can build on that cooperation to achieve some changes that are highlighted in the Trade Practices Commission report.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that the approach of the Trade Practices Commission to remove restrictive practices and to increase the scope of the profession by allowing lawyers to advertise and engage in multi-disciplinary practices is something which the government will seriously examine as part of our law reform agenda. We welcome the debate and discussions that the draft report will generate. We welcome constructive input by the profession and the community. We hope that the legal profession embraces the spirit of this draft report as an opportunity to examine its structures and to increase access to justice for all Australians.</PARA>

We understand that all Australians in Somalia are currently safe, but, of course, we are keeping in very close touch with the situation as it evolves.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The acute policy dilemmas and difficulties now facing the UN in Somalia should not, I think, conceal the extent of the UN's achievement to date in that country. The humanitarian crisis threatening the lives of hundreds of thousands of people has been averted through a combination of civil relief and military</PARA>
<PARA>support action. The situation throughout the country as a whole remains more peaceful and stable than has been the case for a long time. There is an obvious danger that any precipitate withdrawal by UN forces would cause a rapid deterioration in that situation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Any UN peace operation&mdash;whether it is in support of humanitarian objectives, as is the situation here, or otherwise&mdash;does need, in order to be fully effective, clear and achievable goals, widespread international support and maximum possible local support, adequate total resources, complementary peace making initiatives&mdash;where those are relevant&mdash;and clearly designated criteria for termination. It has to be acknowledged that by no means all those conditions have been clearly satisfied at every stage of the Somali operation to date. So far as the future is concerned, the UN is now working to a mandate spelt out in two Security Council resolutions&mdash;814 of 26 March, which mandates UNOSOM to disarm the Somali factions to facilitate national reconciliation and rehabilitation, and 865 of 22 September, which strongly endorses UNOSOM's performance to date while, at the same time, urging renewed efforts to achieve national reconciliation and further develop the Somali police, judicial and penal systems.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What has to happen now is the finalisation and implementation of a comprehensive and internally consistent plan to address the full range of Somalia's needs. This is a continuing need in the short term for security for humanitarian purposes, but the greater need is for a peace building process which will enable governing institutions to be recreated and a political process of reconciliation commenced.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The security dilemma posed by the recent action of Aideed's supporters is an acute one, and the temptation for the UN, and especially the US forces, to engage now in a massive military action is obviously very strong. I have to say, however, for my own part, that I continue to believe that peace enforcement action in Somalia should remain firmly fixed on the basic objectives of enabling peace keepers to carry out their protective and humanitarian relief mandates, should avoid using disproportionate force and, so far as humanly possible, should avoid becoming involved in an escalating cycle of retaliation.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Finally, the government can fully understand the decision of the US to reinforce its quick reaction force as a short term response to the recent surge of violence in Mogadishu. But we also very strongly support President Clinton's recent call at the UN to place greater emphasis on national reconciliation in Somalia to enable UNOSOM to eventually be brought to a successful conclusion with the withdrawal of all US and other, including Australian, peace keepers by March 1995, as was envisaged in Security Council resolution 865.</PARA>

The article by Mr Cribb drew attention to the fact that, in his estimation, there had been declining attendances at recent ANZAAS congresses and this was for him a disturbing trend. I think the evidence that he puts in the article is true. Compared with ANZAAS congresses of a decade or more ago when 2,000 delegates turned up to a congress, there has been a decline in attendance at the congress.

In the present environment, where we are talking about deficit reduction as an overwhelming necessity for the economic health of this country over the medium term, of course it is necessary for tax rearrangements of this kind to be essentially revenue neutral, unless we want to go down the path of massive government expenditure reduction, which is the path the opposition wanted to go down with its Fightback proposal.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The statement read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The thrust of the recommendations of this report tabled in the Senate today by the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training is that industrial disputes must be settled within the framework of industrial relations legislation and sections 45D&amp;E of the Trade Practices Act should not be invoked to deal with them. The report is a majority report, and contains a dissenting report by Senators Crane and Tierney.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Trade Practices Act has a legitimate and important role in dealing with activity which deliberately sets out to corrupt fair trading operations, to manipulate prices, or to undermine free competition in the market. When it comes to industrial action, however, the use of sections 45D&amp;E are entirely inappropriate. The vast majority of occasions on which 45D&amp;E are either threatened or used involve disputes of an industrial nature&mdash;that is, they involve workers undertaking an action to achieve ends which they regard as being in the economic or social interests of themselves or fellow workers, and employers or businesses who are seeking to protect themselves from any economic harm which results from that action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The sorts of actions which have typically drawn 45D-type responses are essentially industrial issues rather than trade or competition issues. This is not to say that there is no overlap between these two arenas, but to point out that such disputes and their resolution lie most appropriately and conveniently with the practice of industrial relations rather than the practice of corporate affairs. The Committee acknowledges that it is secondary boycotts which are the focus of attention here, but sections 45D&amp;E have much wider ramifications. In order to deal with such actions, modifications to industrial relations legislation will be required. There must be an efficient mechanism established which will deal effectively with these matters by negotiation rather than penal action.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has found that sections 45D&amp;E are in breach of ILO conventions and are not a satisfactory means of settling disputes. The Committee asserts that the legitimate rights of businesses to trade in a fair and competitive market should be properly secured by trade practices legislation, but that sections 45D&amp;E are an unacceptable mechanism for achieving this because of their impact on the legitimate rights of others to take industrial, protest or other social action. The Trade Practices Act should be amended to recognise the distinction between the competition and non-competition aspects of sections 45D&amp;E, and to deal with boycotts involving competitors where they have the purpose of restricting trade or reducing competition in a given market.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report affirms the principle of a right to withdraw labour, and that any qualifications attached to that right should be spelled out in industrial relations legislation, and not in trade practices legislation. The Committee has also recommended that industrial disputes should be dealt with in the first instance under modified industrial relations legislation, but where a dispute cannot be speedily resolved by negotiation, then a certificate should be issued enabling the matter to be dealt with in a civil jurisdiction.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The report comes at a time when major industrial reforms are the subject of intense discussion between the government, employers and unions. It is important that Australia takes this opportunity to simplify and rationalise what has become a complex web of statute and common law surrounding how we run industrial relations in this country. The report sets out some clear principles for dealing with dispute resolution. We have identified in an unequivocal way the regulatory frameworks for dealing with industrial and competition matters respectively. It is up to the government and the parliament to ensure that the legislative details attached to those frameworks protect the legitimate interests of all industrial parties and contain mechanisms which can quickly and effectively deal with any problems which arise.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sections 45D&amp;E of the Trade Practices Act have been a controversial part of industrial relations in Australia. The submissions to the Committee from business and employer associations have argued strongly for the retention of 45D&amp;E, which they regard as a vital legislative mechanism enabling them to prevent industrial disputation or to obtain damages for losses incurred as a result. The union movement and many others in the community regard 45D&amp;E as a harsh piece of legislation, arguing that it works against the democratic right to take industrial and other social action, and that its provisions are contrary to ILO Conventions. Conservationists are unhappy with 45D&amp;E because it exposes them to the risks of being sued as a consequence of protest action. They believe that peaceful protest action against companies involved in environmentally risky activity is a fundamental right which should not be impeded by legislation such as 45D&amp;E.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has sought to identify clearly the legislative frameworks in which the competing, legitimate interests of various groups should be dealt with. The mechanisms established within those legislative frameworks must be consistent with the traditions of justice and fair play which our community regards as important. The community must have confidence that regulatory mechanisms will achieve what they are intended to achieve, and that they are both responsive and equitable in their operation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Committee has heard from a wide range of interest groups. We believe our recommendations establish clear guidelines for revised industrial relations legislation and trade practices legislation. It is imperative that the complexity and confusion which has dominated the operation of sections 45D&amp;E be resolved once and for all by the repeal of these sections of the Trade Practices Act.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The massive 55 per cent rise in sales tax on the wine industry strikes at the very heart of the Hunter region from where I come. The former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, Mr Kerin, agrees. In Today's <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> he said:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">"The 55 per cent tax increase is a massive disincentive to invest in one of our few expanding primary industries.</PARA>
<PARA>A Hunter Valley grower said to me last night that if something is doing well, the government kicks the proverbial out of it. That sums it up. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The stability and economic growth of the Hunter Valley is under attack by this Labor government. It is an attack that the National Party of Australia will not wear. The Hunter Valley relies heavily on both its wine and tourist industries. Both are intertwined; tax one industry and they both suffer. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Hunter Valley, boasting picturesque landscapes with rows of grapevines and dotted with boutique wineries, attracted 1 1/2 million people to the area last year. Approximately 60,000 overseas tourists are attracted to the Hunter Valley because of its superb wine, superb hospitality and its proximity to Sydney. It is also a very convenient staging point for tourists venturing further into New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This insidious wine tax will strike at the very heart of the tourist infrastructure that has been built up so effectively over the last 15 or so years. It will wipe out small vineyards. We will be left with a region bereft of economic stability, which is built very much on tourism. These industries are of immense importance to the Hunter Valley. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Hunter Valley is the sixth most popular domestic tourist destination in Australia. The increased cost of wine, combined with the increase in fuel prices and the wholesale sales tax, will make this wine growing area a much less viable tourist destination. This will impact on not only the wineries but also the tourist facilities and the infrastructure that has been built up around it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Small wineries, which in reality are small businesses, will be particularly disadvantaged by the increase in their sales tax bill, which has to be paid for up-front. Sales tax billed in the current month must be remitted to the government by the 21st of the following month. If average credit is 60 days, the increase in sales tax will be a very heavy extra burden on the working capital of these wineries. One Hunter Valley grower said to me last night that under the present tax regime he presently owes $480,000 in sales tax. If the tax increase is to be introduced, that will increase to $750,000; he will owe $0.75 million dollars in sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The New South Wales wine industry is one of the few agricultural industries that presently has stability, growth and potential, especially in the export area. This new burden will stifle it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It must be remembered that wine is a 7 1/2 times value adding primary product. By the year 2000 the industry believes it will be a $1 billion export industry. But that will require approximately $1.2 billion in expenditure. It has been explained to me that at least half of that $1.2 billion will be spent on wages. The other part of that equation is jobs, jobs and more jobs. They will not be created if this wine tax is increased. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Wine is a rural based industry contributing to regional economies in the towns of Cessnock, Muswellbrook, Singleton and neighbouring Mudgee and Orange. These towns rely on servicing the grape growers. These service towns also feed off the tourist and downstream industries such as packaging, the very important transport industry in the Hunter Valley and, of course, marketing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This viable domestic market provides the necessary cash flow and profitability to support our much needed export growth. For every bottle of wine sold overseas, we have to have 1 1/2 bottles in the cellar because wine needs to mature over a period of two or three years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The last thing the people of the Hunter Valley need at this time is increased taxation on their livelihoods. Each day this government drives another seven people in the Hunter Valley onto the dole queue. Enough is enough. On 18 August Senator Gareth Evans, in an answer to a question, said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The nature of the projections I have seen suggest that there will be no difference in consumption patterns and no impact at all on jobs in this industry.</PARA>
<PARA>There might not be much change in consumption amongst the white wine trendies whom the minister knows, but how can he maintain that there will be no impact at all on jobs when the Winemakers Federation estimates that $445 million in investment will be lost as a result of the wine tax increase. The government is on a loser here&mdash;both in what is right for growth and employment and what is good politics. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;To indicate where the Greens WA stand on this set of bills, I make the point that the government's budget was framed to set out a four year strategy for reducing the budget deficit to around one per cent of gross domestic product, while delivering the first round of income tax cuts for middle income earners legislated in last year's budget, as well as the reduced company tax rates promised in the lead up to the election. Of course, this led to an unaffordable situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The cut in company tax was put through parliament between the election and the swearing in of the new Senate, in order to be placed at the beginning of the current financial year and avoid any difficulties in getting it through the Senate. Whilst we understand that any action of the Greens WA and other parties in the Senate may affect the government's strategy for deficit reduction, I would like to remind the government that we have made suggestions, the most recent of which was last evening, about alternative revenue collection measures. We have suggested that there are alternatives available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Therefore, while we are likely to flag opposition to some aspects of these taxes in an effort to decrease the level of wholesale sales tax and wine tax, I point out that we make these suggestions within the perspective of fiscal responsibility. The fact that the government is not currently taking up this level of fiscal responsibility is its responsibility. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent times there has been a lot of talk about certainty, the passage of bills and the role of the Senate. We have been criticised for not making commitments to pass the budget long before the bills were on the table and were able to be examined in detail. We agree that certainty is important, although it is  by  no  means  the  only  thing  which  is important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One thing that everyone can be certain of is that the Greens WA will not support a grossly regressive budget. We have always said that we would support an equitable strategy to reduce the government's deficit in the medium term in a way that does not undermine the government's revenue base. The current package of bills fails in these two tests. The combined impact is highly regressive as it takes from the poor and gives to the rich. Furthermore, a shift from income taxes to indirect tax measures is a dead alley in terms of providing the revenue required to govern effectively and promote equity in the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Therefore, we foreshadow our amendments to this set of sales tax (deficit reduction) bills 1993. We intend to support the deferral of the second round of wholesale sales tax increases. This would be more than offset by delaying upper levels of tax cuts. There is no reason for the top one-fifth of wage earners to cream off that extra $1.3 billion in tax cuts. Like all taxpayers earning over $20,000 they, too, would get the basic $612 per annum tax rebate.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is a popular myth that lower income earners do not spend enough to be really hurt by an increase in wholesale sales tax. In fact, they spend all their money on consumables. It is those people on higher incomes who have the luxury to save and invest. It reminds me of the wealthy man who believed he could help a poor man. The wealthy man asked, `How much do you spend on groceries?'. The poor man responded, `About a third of my wage'. The wealthy man said, `Ah, that's your problem. You need to manage your money better. I spend only two per cent on mine'. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Targeting the second increase in wholesale sales tax serves four purposes. It reduces the regressive impact that is the result of the shift from income taxes to indirect taxes, and that is not compensated for by the tax cuts or rebate for low income earners. It confronts the government with the need to find more equitable ways of raising the additional revenue required to provide important public services and reduce public debt as part of its medium term deficit reduction strategy. Not legislating to increase wholesale sales tax by a second one per cent in 1995 simply reinforces the need arising from the lack of funds to deal with Mabo legislation and labour market programs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It allows the government adequate time to investigate and implement these revenue measures. It also reduces the inflationary impact of the budget in years to come. This reduces the need to rely on monetary policy and increased interest rates for economic management. Over-reliance on high interest rates hurts consumers and small business and should be avoided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also foreshadow our opposition to the sales tax on wine. The good point about the wine industry is that in Western Australia and many other parts of Australia it is locally owned, it has a high number of local employees and provides indirect employment in the hospitality, tourism and service sectors. These are specifically associated with the domestic market rather than the export market. Providing some sort of compensation for those parts of the industry simply for export does not deal with this kind of indirect employment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Beer and spirits, on the other hand, are almost completely transnationally owned, high profit and centralised. The profits are repatriated overseas. The industry is currently retrenching employees at a vast rate of knots because it can mechanise and go for chemical production which allows for fewer employees. Much equipment is imported, as well as some materials, including hops. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It could be said that alcohol is alcohol is alcohol, but that overlooks all the details and the vast differences between these industries. In WA alone there are 500-plus wineries, mostly locally owned. In WA a number of the smaller wineries are working to establish minimum input viticulture. If they were forced by the nature of the industry to cut down costs, some of those wineries would be swallowed up by the larger operators which, generally, are not able to be as careful with their inputs as the smaller wineries can be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The net effect of the proposed tax would concentrate the industry and make it go towards a more mechanised form of agriculture, one leaning heavily on pesticides and herbicides. Any fall-off in domestic sales would create pressure for amalgamation by those wineries going for export markets. A well-founded rumour has it that some of the bigger eastern states wineries, the transnational ones, do not in fact mind the tax; it is their chance to increase holdings here and they can mark down profits and pay less company tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Concern over the proposed Industry Commission study is based on the fact that the Industry Commission, in our estimation, has not shown itself capable of giving a wider picture in an industry study. The commission tends to be very narrow in its focus and does not look at the spread effects, negative or positive, of any particular aspect of industry to be studied. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">An example that springs to mind is the Industry Commission's study on the greenhouse effect. Most of the first part of the study said how important it was for Australia to look carefully at reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but finally came to the conclusion that it was not possible because it would adversely affect the coal industry. The report ignored totally the number of jobs that could be created by energy efficiency, energy management and energy conservation, and also ignored any prospect of a cost efficient, revenue neutral cutback in greenhouse gas production. It did not look at those matters at all. So I do not have great faith in any government proposals for Industry Commission studies into the wine industry. If the government is serious about promoting regionally based development, it should find out which industries are relatively successful in regional development. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is left with a number of options. First, and best, is that it can accept our suggestions and majority suggestions of other parties in this place and support the budget bills in their amended form. This would result in an increase in revenue in the current and the next financial year and the development of more equitable means of raising revenue in the following years to offset the loss of the second increase in the wholesale sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second, more simple, option would see the government either accepting that the 1995 increase in wholesale sales tax will not go ahead or proposing additional measures to compensate low income households for the impact of the budget package in the 1995-96 and 1996-97 financial years. Should this latter path prove too difficult, we would be happy to leave the second round of wholesale sales tax increases until next year's budget, where they might be discussed as a possible part of a larger package of measures. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The third, and least desirable, option facing the government is to persist in attempting to push through this ill-conceived and regressive future increase, together with an increase to be backdated to 17 August this year. If the amended legislation returns from the House of Representatives with the 1995 increase reinserted, we will not support the bills. This would cast grave doubts over the additional tax revenue currently being collected in the expectation of the legislation successfully passing into law. </PARA>

I think it is appropriate at this time to draw the attention of the Senate to some of the real measures that are actually being proposed here rather than to dwell on fear and hysteria, as honourable senators opposite have been doing.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These propositions are essentially very simple. They involve three measures: an increase by one per cent of general rates of sales tax, increases in wine tax and changes in the tax regime for luxury cars. While these proposals are modest and involve only small increases in the existing wholesale sales tax rates, they will make a major contribution towards the government's fiscal objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">These measures will have a very small impact on prices. For example, the rise in the rate from 10 per cent rate to 11 per cent will increase the retail price of goods taxable at that rate by less than one per cent, and it will increase the price of a good currently taxable at 30 per cent by less than three-quarters of one per cent. These measures will have no effect on goods which are currently exempt from sales tax such as food and clothing. There has been no decision to extend indirect taxation to services. Passenger motor vehicles will continue to be taxed on a concessional basis. Although the concessional rate of 15 per cent introduced in One Nation will increase to 16 per cent and then 17 per cent in line with other rates, it will still be five percentage points below the general rate of sales taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In view of what is being said by the doom and gloom merchants opposite, it is important to bear in mind what we are actually talking about. The merchants of doom are attempting to undermine the budget wherever they can and to frustrate the work of this government. We have heard a great deal from those opposite about how people were robbed at the last election and how promises were broken. What they do not say is that as political parties they went into that election with totally unacceptable political policies and as a result were rejected by the people of this country. They do not say that they went in with industrial relations policies which were totally unacceptable to most people in this country; which were against the traditions of this country; and which would have led this country into a period of profound confrontation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Those opposite do not say that they went to the election with education policies which were designed to increase the levels of disadvantage and inequality in this country. They do not say that they went in with a policy to massively increase the levels of indirect taxation far above those that we have today. They do not say that they went in with policies which were alien to the people of this country. That is the real reason why they lost the last election. It was not because they were robbed; it was essentially because they went in with policies which were unacceptable. As John Howard has indicated many times, they were politically outclassed in the last election so their talk about their loss at the last election as if it was something strange surprises me no end. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have heard a great deal about wine taxes. What we have not heard is the simple fact that the wine industry is booming and it is booming, essentially, because it has benefited directly from government policy. It has benefited directly from government support and favourable taxation policies over a long period of time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">When we talk about wine, we should make sure we understand the full implication of what is actually being said. The industry itself states that exports of Australian wine have increased dramatically in recent years from about 40.4 million litres in 1988-89 to 103.2 million litres in 1992-93. This represents an increase of 155 per cent in export sales over that period in volume terms alone. So it is a bit hard to talk about the effect of taxation on exports because we all know that those taxes do not apply to exports. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In real terms, wine exports have increased by 130 per cent over the period I have just indicated. The value of Australian wine exports in 1992-93 was $289 million. The major markets for Australian wine are the United Kingdom, the United States, New Zealand, Canada and Japan. If we look at international comparisons we can see that the Australian wine industry is doing extremely well. The wine industry has a very enviable record. There is high recognition of the quality of its produce. It has made excellent inroads into international markets as a result of its quality, not just its price. It has a major level of value adding in this country which has to be recognised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It also has to be understood that in terms of other beverages, other competitors, the wine industry is treated very favourably indeed. Australian beer, which is the main rival of wine, is produced by Australian breweries which make this point very clearly: the favourable treatment of Australian wine is inequitable. They say that rather than the yeoman farmer image that those opposite are so keen on&mdash;the notion of the peasant farmer, the poor little battler out in the sticks&mdash;the fact is that the Australian wine industry is run by four major companies. Ninety per cent of its output is controlled by four major companies. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are talking about is the way in which the conservative parties once again come to the aid of big capital. What we see again and again in this place is their concern to protect privilege and vested interest. We do not see any concern for what the taxation will be spent on. We do not see from them any concern about the way in which people should express their social responsibilities to the economy and to society as a whole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I must say that I am not too keen on either wine or beer, so I find the preoccupation with alcohol on the other side quite a strange thing, but if we compare beer and wine we see that wine incurs only about half the federal tax collected on beer. We see that 17.5 per cent of the purchase price of a four-litre wine cask goes in federal tax while 32 per cent of the purchase price of a similar quantity of beer is taken in federal tax. That does not include the state licence fees, which make that gap even greater. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to remember that 90 per cent of the output of the wine industry is controlled by four major companies. When those opposite come in here bleating on behalf of wine interests they should bear that in mind. Who are they talking for? They should make it very clear that the economic interest is dominated by so few. That approach to vested interests runs consistently throughout the Liberal and National parties' policies. I am surprised that the Greens have not clearly understood just what are the economic relationships in this industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is not surprising, in a sense, that people will try to go for the cheap shot. As Senator Cooney indicated this morning, it is a bit hard not to accuse people of trying to develop a constituency from within a vested interest that occurs from time to time. I guess that that is the nature of opposition. But it is a bit hard for the opposition to then turn around and say that it is behaving in an economically responsible manner. It has to get its position clear. Is the opposition seeking out new constituencies&mdash;as I believe the Greens are doing&mdash;or is it talking about the genuine economic benefit of this country? It is saying that this budget has to be undermined, but what is it saying about where the revenue is actually going to come from to pay for social programs? One does presume that there is some measure of economic responsibility on the other side of the chamber. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;An heroic assumption.</PARA></TALK.START>
</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="AW5">Senator CARR</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps that presumption is, in itself, wrong, as Senator Richardson has indicated. No industry really does like taxation. It is not surprising that industries should come to political opportunists and seek their support and seek an opportunity, a populist cause, to try to undermine the budget strategy of the Labor government.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have to appreciate that in the context of the political situation in this country at the moment.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conservative opposition in this chamber is taking every opportunity to undermine the work of government. It is essentially trying to cut the sinews of government. That is the same strategy that Jeff Kennett undertook in Victoria. It does not surprise me that the same personnel have appeared here. Petro Georgiou is now on the staff of the opposition. It would follow that the same sorts of tactics which were followed in Victoria would be followed here. The only difference is that the federal opposition does not have nationally the same control over the media that was exercised in the run up to the Victorian election by the Liberal Party and the conservatives. Over a two-year period every action of the Victorian Labor government was held up to public ridicule and, of course, public confidence was undermined in the key institutions of society. That same sort of political advantage does not occur at a national level, so the opposition will find the task a lot tougher. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other factor is that, at a national level, the Australian Labor Party is more coherent, more cohesive, much stronger in its attitude and much clearer in its determination to turn back the conservative tide. We all understand what the last election really was about, with the clear ideological divide that occurred. We understand just where the people of this country stand, because they rejected the opposition so completely. I do not suppose one can expect the opposition to understand this, but the Labor government is not about attacking the wine industry; it is about continuing to support it. It is about saying, however, that a fair level of taxation has to be applied to all industries. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to luxury motor vehicles. Once again, we can see the point: the conservatives have to defend vested interests. Attacking the tax on luxury motor vehicles is a popular cause. The changes in taxation rates would see vehicles costing over $300,000, in some cases, being taxed more heavily than vehicles at a base rate of about $53,000. The concessions to the passenger vehicle industry will continue. However, there will be changes to ensure that the greatest share of taxation is paid on the larger, more expensive vehicles. I find that a very worthwhile proposition and I would find it difficult for anyone to suggest that that should be rejected. However, in voting on the matter today, that could happen. But I am sure that the Greens will be able to explain that in terms of the great social justice principles that are involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The obstructionism in this Senate will continue, but it will be resisted. As we have seen in recent times, the Labor Party in this chamber will fight vigorously for the principles that it believes in and for the defence of the Labor government. It will fight to ensure that proper policies are pursued in this country and that we get some lasting changes in this country to allow a much better and stronger society to develop. Proposals that seek to undermine the government's budget strategy, that seek to rip away at the government's right to govern in the way this chamber has been operating in recent times, will ultimately fail. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While people might enjoy momentary popularity in opposing taxation measures&mdash;as they are doing on this occasion&mdash;in the long haul they will be judged for their obstructionism. As the polls are turning&mdash;as they did in 1975&mdash;on the question of Senate obstructionism, there reaches a point when the electorate at large says that it is not good enough for minority senators to become the real opposition for a short time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">People will say there is clearly a responsibility on all senators here to allow the government to govern and to ensure that proper measures are undertaken to protect the fiscal position of this country. However, if opposition senators come into this chamber, after going to an election arguing for a GST, and say that a one per cent increase in some sales taxes&mdash;which protects the necessities of life and which means that basic, essential items of food and clothing that ordinary people need are exempt&mdash;is not good enough, they will stand condemned for being the hypocrites that they are. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will direct some of my remarks to the impact that the changes in these sales tax bills will have on the wine industry in Australia. It was very interesting to listen to the comments of the senator opposite about the industry and about how it is run by a few big winemakers and that the increases will not have any effect on the little people. I do not think he has the facts right whatsoever. The wine industry is a rising star in the rural portfolio area because it employs so many people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Despite an economy that Senator Carr's government has been ruling over&mdash;an economy that has been poorly mismanaged for a decade now&mdash;and despite the unfair imposts which this and other small industries, particularly in the rural sector, have had to endure, the wine industry has not done too badly. In fact, it has actually expanded. The Australian wine market&mdash;and this has been said before&mdash;is worth over $1 billion. It is one of our most successful domestic and export industries. There are about 5,000 wine grape growers and about 600 winemakers in Australia. They have a turnover of in excess of $1.5 billion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To say, as Senator Carr said a moment ago, that the industry is just run by a few of the big boys is absolutely incorrect. There are a lot of people in the industry. There are people in the industry, for example, at Cowra&mdash;a new wine growing area&mdash;and at Orange in the foothills of Mount Canobola in the new wine growing areas of the cold country grapes. Wine has really burgeoned at Mudgee, although it has been produced there for a long time. The industry has really increased dramatically in the Hunter, and even out where I am, on the Liverpool plains just north of the Hunter Valley and south-west of Tamworth, wine is now being grown by Murray Tyrrell. He is one of the people who have advanced the industry, along with Brian McGuigan, Murray Robson and all the rest of them. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was interesting to listen to Senator Carr say a moment ago that the government is looking after the wine industry. It is interesting&mdash;and I think Senator Tierney mentioned it&mdash;that some of the Labor Party members of the House of Representatives from the Hunter Valley voted in favour of this increased wine tax, which absolutely astounds me. For example, Mr Fitzgibbon, Mr Morris, Mr Brown, Mr Horne and the other Mr Morris all voted in favour of a wine tax, and they all represent wine growing areas. </PARA>

They lied their way through the election and did not, at any stage, say they were going to hit the wine industry with increased taxes. I think that somebody who can sit in this place with a smile on his face while putting a tax on the wine industry is absolutely despicable.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Richardson had better not smile again because he might crack the mirror. Honestly, it behoves him very little to be talking about the wine industry the way he is, and denigrating it by saying that his party members from that area actually told the winegrowers during the election campaign that there would be a wine tax. They did not say they were going to put a wine tax on, but now they have.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wine industry has a very high value added product, which is something I understand the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has been harping on about to rural industry for quite some time. I add here that it is quite interesting to see what a former minister for primary industries said about this wine tax. An article in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> on Thursday, 7 October states:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Former Labor treasurer and primary industries minister Mr John Kerin yesterday claimed the proposed wine tax increase was based on "ignorance, stupidity and prejudice", and described the Government's arguments for it as dishonest.</PARA>
<PARA>That is exactly what I have said&mdash;dishonest, because there was no mention of it during the election campaign. This was said in a letter in response to the winemakers' complaints about the tax increase. An embittered Mr Kerin said it would be a `massive disincentive' to invest in the industry, and so it will be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wine industry has done a great marketing job and consumption of Australian wines has increased here and overseas. In the UK, for example, it has done an outstanding job. It has taken five per cent of the United Kingdom market and Australian wine is much envied for its quality by the French winemakers. In fact, the French winemakers are making a direct drive to try to get back what the Australian winemakers have taken from them. In the face of all that success, the federal government has now decided to milk this industry&mdash;an industry that has been doing so well&mdash;and milk it for all its worth. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Like the fuel tax that will cripple some industries and make others even more uncompetitive, this tax has been assessed as costing the industry hundreds of millions of dollars in lost sales between now and the year 2000. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The week before last I visited some of the small winegrowers in the central west who do not have their own crushing facilities. The cost of transport to those people because of the fuel tax will slug them even before they get slugged producing the wine. The Winemakers Federation has predicted that its overseas sales target to the year 2000 will have to be revised downward from $1 billion to $500 million&mdash;a cut of 50 per cent simply because of the imposition of the tax. That is the impact it will have on our export sales. Surely this government must understand that and understand the reasons why we are against this extra tax on wine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Exports are largely&mdash;and I agree with Senator Carr here&mdash;the domain of the big four winemakers who produce 90 per cent of the total Australian wine production. I agree with that, but what about all the other smaller ones that are keeping people in jobs and actually starting to expand? In addition to those, there are the ones that I am talking about, the approximately 500 or 600 small wineries that have recently formed themselves into the Independent Wineries Association. They are responsible for about 10 per cent of total production. The 55 per cent increase is particularly unacceptable to them because they have not enjoyed the export boom and they rely entirely on domestic sales to remain profitable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is interesting that earlier today in this debate Senator McKiernan said that it was not that big an increase anyway because it was only increasing from 20 per cent to 31 per cent. I was sitting next to Senator Panizza at the time and we could not quite understand how he worked out his mathematics when he said that was not a 55 per cent increase. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> Those small winegrowers have to pay sales tax on all their promotional and tasting stocks, which can be a large part of their production. Those small winemakers would simply go out of business if they were forced to pay that extra 55 per cent on all of their stock as a tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another group that has been left out of this equation is the wine sellers who, for the past six weeks, have been in a dilemma trying to determine whether or not they should apply the sales tax to stocks in hand. A letter from a constituent just the other day points out the dilemma he faces as a wine merchant. The letter is from Mr Frank White from Riverina Cellars and states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Wine accounts for approximately 33% of the total sales from my store. With fierce price competition in the retail liquor market the margin on wine products is essential if my business is to be profitable.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .   . . .   . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Any tax increase affects all wine purchased by me since the budget announcement. I urgently need to know what the level of the tax on wine is to be so that I may make accurate decisions on the prices of the products I sell.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Sales tax has a direct effect on the amount of State licence fee I have to pay and therefore has a multiplication effect on the calculation of my retail prices . . . If I make the wrong judgment now about what the sales tax will be I may not be able to pay the licence fee and will therefore risk losing my business.</PARA>
<PARA>So it affects everyone at all levels all the time. It is people such as this wine merchant who are pawns in the games this Labor government is playing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would also draw the Senate's attention to a paper prepared by Byron Sharp from the Elton Mayo School of Management of the University of South Australia. The paper states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">It is now well accepted that domestic market conditions can have a substantial impact on the international competitiveness of an industry . . . The effect then, of an increase in the wholesale sales tax on wine has the potential to harm the international competitiveness of the Australian wine industry.</PARA>
<PARA>The paper goes on to state:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is little doubt that reduced profitability and potential for profitability will result in scaled down investments in new vineyards and winery up-grades, with such action already foreshadowed by a number of wine industry spokespeople in post-budget commentaries. It is also highly likely that reduced revenue and profitability will result in reduced marketing budgets affecting, primarily, advertising and sales support spending, market research, the recruitment of marketing qualified staff and new product development budgets.</PARA>
<PARA>So this government, this anti-business government&mdash;and, frankly, it is becoming more anti-business by the day&mdash;has given another slug to an industry which is getting up and having a go. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has brought in a budget which it knows is not acceptable to the Senate&mdash;and it knows it does not control the Senate. The government consults the ACTU about everything, but it never actually comes and talks too much to the Senate about things. However, the coalition, the Greens and the Democrats have all been asked by the government to capitulate, to keep the peace and keep the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) happy. Well, tough luck, fellas! This time we will actually look after an industry which is on the way up and having a go at looking after itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I cannot believe that the Labor Party is not receiving the sorts of letters that we are all receiving on this side of the chamber. We are receiving letters from builders, bankers, bakers, candlestick makers and self-funded retirees. Everyone is having a go about this budget. It worries me&mdash;as much as it does Senator Burns opposite, judging from the frown and the worry on his face&mdash;that it is hurting all those people for whom I know he has a bit of feeling. No-one has written to support the budget, and I bet the Labor Party has not received any fan mail about it either. The Labor Party, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and the Prime Minister are irresponsible in their efforts to cajole, beguile and wheedle their way around this chamber, trying to get through legislation that they know is flawed and will hurt an industry that is trying to help itself. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not need prima donnas running the country. We want a government which will get out there and help industries that are trying to come up with export programs. Why always knock somebody who is having a go? Why always knock an industry which is getting up off its feet, getting out and giving us an export income? Give Australia a fair go, let this extra tax that those opposite are talking about be defeated, and let them admit that they made a mistake in the first instance. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Margetts, as economics spokesperson, has already introduced the Greens (WA) assessment of the budget; I will be commenting on the social justice aspects. The government has proposed to achieve its twin objectives of reducing the deficit and cutting income taxes by increasing indirect taxes principally through increases to wholesale sales tax, which are covered by these bills, and excise rates on fuel and tobacco, which will be debated later.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is highly regressive because indirect taxes have a far greater impact on low income earners who consume a greater proportion of their income and are less able to respond to price increases. In addition, low income earners are more likely to own cars that require leaded petrol and live in outer suburbs, exacerbating the impact of fuel price increases. The hardest hit group is low income households which pay little or no tax and do not receive social security benefits, as these people will not benefit from the new tax rebate or the indexation of benefits. Therefore, this budget has proven to be very unpopular. The people of Australia feel abandoned by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I give just a sample of the letters that are flooding into our office. They are personal letters, so I will quote from them rather than stating which people they come from. In part, a letter from New South Wales states:</PARA>

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2" JUSTIFICATION="CENTERJUST">. . .   . . .   . . .</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I believe that Australia has lived for far too long, from exploitation of our natural resources with no thought for our future. Where economic models are discussed without considering the effects on people.</PARA>
<PARA>A second letter, also from New South Wales&mdash;and I did select these at random&mdash;states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The preoccupation of the last decade with economic rationalism at the expense of social, ethical and environmental factors has served this country of ours very badly. An even sadder aspect has been the fact that the brunt of the dislocating effects of these policies are being borne by those who are already disadvantaged compared to the norm whereas those bureaucrats and businesspeople who have pushed these inappropriate policies have probably been promoted and/or rewarded themselves with massive remuneration increases.</PARA>
<PARA>This budget is clearly regressive. Independent analysis suggests that low income households will generally suffer the losses. The worst hit group, as I mentioned earlier, is people on low incomes who are not on social security benefits and who have little or no tax liability. These people receive neither the income tax rebate paid in the following financial year nor the lagged CPI indexation of benefits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will quote here from the Women's Economic Thinktank.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">They were right in their general strategy, they needed to do something about the budget deficit but they missed the plot completely in the way they tackled it.

Secondly, we attempted yesterday to introduce a top-up tax of five per cent on incomes above $100,000 at the same time as the other income tax cuts were introduced&mdash;and, once again, it was the Greens and the Democrats against the rest. Thirdly, we would like to support the dropping of the proposed taxation of credit unions. That will be debated later. Fourthly, we supported the dropping of the link between the passage of the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 3) 1993 and the other so-called deficit reduction bills, which was referred to the other place yesterday as an indication of its lack of support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">None of these amendments would reduce government revenue or increase government expenditure commencing this financial year or next financial year. The second amendment, if we had succeeded in passing it into law, would actually have provided additional revenue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We targeted the second increase in wholesale sales tax for four reasons. The first reason was to reduce the regressive impact that is the result of the shift from income taxes to indirect taxes and that is not compensated for by the tax cuts or rebate for low income earners. It confronts the government with the need to find more equitable ways of raising the additional revenue required to provide important public services and reduce public debt as part of its medium term deficit reduction strategy, such as it is. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Not legislating to increase wholesale sales tax a second one per cent in 1995 simply reinforces the need arising from the lack of funds to deal with the Mabo legislation and the labour market programs. It allows the government adequate time to investigate and implement these revenue measures. It also reduces the inflationary impact of the budget in years to come. This reduces the need to rely on monetary policy and increased interest rates for economic management. Over-reliance on high interest rates hurts consumers and small business and should be avoided. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Honourable senators will notice that there has been no mention of a wine tax. This is because it did not figure in a major way in our approach to the budget, partly because we knew it was being opposed by the opposition and the Democrats. The wine tax was a complex matter for the Greens. We received varying lobbies. I will again summarise the two aspects that are of concern to us that would have led us to support an increase in wine tax if we had responded to them. Those views deserve consideration, even though I will later tell honourable senators our reasons for not following them. In a letter from Kalamunda in Western Australia we were told:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I don't agree with you on revoking the proposed sales tax on wine. The proposed increase from 20 to 31 per cent is not enough and should at least be doubled because of the long term cost of alcohol usage associated with social problems plus the short term financial cost of $6 billion a year nationally to Australian taxpayers. As a Greens Senator you should also be aware that the wine industry is a type of land developer, acquiring valuable land for the production of wine, especially clay-soil based wetlands which were and I am sure are still filled in for vineyard developments.</PARA>
<PARA>We will respond to the environmental concerns later. They represent one genuine concern about the wine industry. A second concern&mdash;which, I am sure, has also been referred to earlier&mdash;is the health impact of alcohol in our society. A letter from the WA branch of the Public Health Association of Australia states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">We believe that alcoholic beverages should be taxed according to their alcoholic content so favouring the substitution of lower alcohol variants for higher alcohol variants.</PARA>
<PARA>I would have to agree with this point. One of the pleasing aspects of opposing the wine tax is that we will also be opposing the increase in the tax on low alcohol wines at the same time. The letter further states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This issue has raised the need for a comprehensive examination of taxation on alcoholic beverages, with a view to reducing overall alcohol related harm. Until such an examination can take place we believe that the current, highly favoured tax position enjoyed by wine producers would justify support of the proposed increased sales tax on wine.</PARA>
<PARA>That is another aspect of this quite complex debate. It was because of that complexity that, when we initially challenged this budget, we wanted to defer the wine sales tax pending an inquiry, with a result coming down in one year's time. We did this because of the impact of the proposed increase and the importance of the wine industry in terms of local employment and tourism. We wanted consideration of any increase deferred at least a year to enable a full inquiry and to allow opportunity for those people who expressed the concerns that I mentioned earlier on environmental, health grounds and social behaviour costs to be heard and responded to appropriately. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I said, we proposed an inquiry but because that has not been raised as an amendment to this bill we are planning to support a request for an amendment opposing the increase in wine tax that will be raised later in this place. Our reasons are as follows. We did not believe the government's claim that an increase in tax would actually help the industry to expand overseas, and we certainly knew that it would not help it locally. The claim was based on anecdotal evidence of what happened after the last increase in tax on wine from 10 per cent to 20 per cent, and I think the argument is tenuous. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We believe that the wine industry is significantly different from the rest of the alcoholic beverage industry, firstly, because it is largely Australian owned. There is some multinational and foreign ownership in the industry but this is significantly lower than in the beer industry, which is largely foreign owned, and the spirit industry, which is almost entirely import oriented. Secondly, it is regionally based, it is rurally based and provides significant employment and industry in the towns that service the wine growing areas. Thirdly, it is relatively labour intensive&mdash;people friendly, in fact. The industry provides high levels of employment on a seasonal basis and cannot become as automated as other sectors of agricultural industry, such as wheat farming. Fourthly, it has higher levels of stock holdings. The industry maintains stocks of wine for around 17 months, whereas the beer industry has a turnaround time of 43 days. This has a significant impact on the cash flow and capital investment required. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">While we have some significant concerns about environmental problems in the industry, such as the use of herbicides and pesticides, these are not uncommon in any agricultural based industry and an increasing number of wine makers are modifying their practices to make them more environmentally sustainable. The wine industry is far more sustainable in terms of its use of land and the effects on the soil than most other agricultural pursuits. It is a high value added use of an agricultural product which draws in a wide variety of other industries to support it. The multiplier effect of the wine industry is possibly more significant to many regions of this country than any other. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many tourism based enterprises throughout regional Australia rely on the wine industry. The Barossa Valley in South Australia, the Hunter Valley in New South Wales and the Margaret River region in Western Australia are three obvious and successful examples of this. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are concerned about the public health aspects of increasing levels of consumption of wine, particularly by teenage girls, but we are concerned that an increase in revenue is not necessarily an ethical way of addressing that; neither is it effective in this case. The government needs to do more to stop this. However, a percentage increase in wine has less overall effect on the price of cheap wine bought in casks&mdash;that being the wine consumed by teenage girls&mdash;than higher priced wine. Therefore, a percentage increase in the price of wine is less of a deterrent to teenage drinkers than to other consumers. We need to avoid the double standard of condemning the detrimental effects of alcohol in our community, and then taxing it and gaining revenue from something we have condemned, without actually putting into place genuine preventive, educative and treatment oriented approaches to the problem. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There has been a lot of talk, as my colleague Senator Margetts remarked earlier, about certainty, the passage of bills and the role of the Senate. We have been criticised for not making commitments to pass the budget&mdash;lock, stock and barrel&mdash;long before the bills were on the table and able to be examined in detail. We agree that certainty is important, although it is by no means the only thing which is important. The one thing that everyone can be certain of is that we will not be supporting a grossly regressive budget&mdash;ever. A fax we received from Victoria pointed out some of the underlying concepts of the Senate that are being picked up by ordinary people in the community. It states:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Like many Australians, I believe there was great wisdom in our "founding fathers" who created a States house&mdash;the Senate&mdash;and could foresee that without the natural controls imposed by honesty and propriety, a single house system of parliament would only represent one party, or perhaps only one strong and wrong leader.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Even if it is only coincidental that our Senate and our Senators were given such a powerful role, surely there has seldom been a more important time, for those who believe in personal and political integrity, to have legislation amended or rejected, providing it sends a clear signal to the government, and even if there is a double dissolution of Parliament as a consequence?</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">None of us really want a de-stabilised government or more political and economic uncertainty, (particularly when it has the potential to further distress the already disadvantaged, or delay economic recovery), but as every good doctor knows, sometimes the patient has to lose a limb to save a life. If making our elected governments more honest, accountable, and equitable falls on two Senators&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>that is, with the support of the majority, seeing we cannot do anything on our own&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">who act in the national interest, so be it, and so much the better will be our political system.</PARA>
<PARA>We have always said that we would support an equitable strategy to reduce the government deficit in the medium term in a way that does not undermine the government's revenue base. The current package of budget bills fails these two tests. We acknowledge the government's attempts to lessen the regressive impact of this financial year's increases in fuel excise and wholesale sales tax. While these are not perfect, they are acceptable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are not willing, however, to accept the second increase in wholesale sales tax because of its regressive impact. That is why, as we have foreshadowed, we will make a request for the legislation to be amended in the committee stage of this debate. Why should we vote now to increase wholesale sales tax rates from July 1995 when the government does not intend to legislate to ameliorate the gross negative effect of those increases on particular sectors of our community at the same time?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If the government wants our support in respect of legislating to increase any tax, it must at the same time introduce measures to reduce the impact on those sectors of our community which can least afford it. Unless this regressive impact is reduced, the government can be certain that we will not vote for any bill containing increases in wholesale sales tax beyond the one per cent rate increase that is already being collected but is not yet law. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My comments will only be brief, as I realise there are other speakers to come, and it is most important that this matter is resolved today. I rise to speak on behalf of the wine industry in Western Australia and to voice my opposition to the increase in the tax on wine. Much has been said about the national situation, so I will not traverse that ground again.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many small wine producers in Western Australia will suffer disastrous effects should this increase come into effect. The industry in Western Australia is a fledgling industry and, as Senator Margetts pointed out, it is largely locally owned. I will not go over the positive aspects of the industry, as mentioned by Senator Chamarette some time ago, other than to say that a winegrower has to wait some five to seven years before realising a vintage and some 15 years before breaking even. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During my visit to the south-west region of Western Australia, in particular the Margaret River region, it was demonstrated to me that the wine industry is quite a tough rural industry. What concerns me about the industry is not so much the price of wine; it is the effect that the increase in price will have on that industry which, in turn, will affect unemployment. Mr Bruce Tomlinson, the President of the Margaret River Wine Industry Association, in a recent letter to me, wrote:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . bottled wine produced by the regional boutique slice of the wine industry as a whole has created employment out of all proportion to volume produced.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Not only the permanent jobs and seasonal picking, pruning and cellar sale jobs, but the consequential jobs in tourism and transport, in schools reopened through the rejuvenation of our region, through chalets and restaurants and the service industry&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>There we have the full flow-on of this most beneficial industry. The Margaret River area has become a showcase for tourism in Western Australia and has demonstrated how development can be environmentally sustained. The wine industry employs a youth work force. Some 80 per cent of its employees are young people. Any cutback in the industry could leave them unemployed. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9X5">Senator ELLISON</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. As Senator Panizza pointed out, there is already very high youth unemployment and this would only exacerbate the situation. It was therefore disappointing to see in an editorial in the <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Australian</EMPHASIS> of 5 October this year a case put for the increase in the tax on wine. The editorial stated that the impact on exports would be minimal.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The case was put to me by the small winegrowers of Western Australia that 15 to 20 per cent of their produce is exported and that the remainder is consumed by the domestic market. We cannot export unless we have shored up ourselves at home and unless we have increased our domestic production; then we can go offshore. That is the problem that these small winegrowers will face. In order for the industry to become a large exporter, it firstly has to consolidate at home. At present, the annual production of wine in Western Australia is worth some $60 million a year. I urge the Senate to oppose this increase in the tax on wine so that that industry can be left alone to develop and, in the future, to bring home to Australia hundreds of millions of dollars of export earnings. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also advise the Senate that, since this measure was talked about on 17 August this year, there has been some feedback. Mr Tomlinson, whom I mentioned previously, has advised that sales in the Margaret River area alone are already down by 20 to 25 per cent. Winegrowers are discovering that restaurateurs are not buying wine; they are holding on to present stocks and they want to see what exactly will happen with this increase in the tax on wine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Market research in Western Australia has shown that there are two psychological barriers in price: one is $10 and one is $15. The majority of the market tends to buy bottled wine under the value of $10. This increase in tax will push those prices up so that a bottle of wine, which was previously under the value of $10, would then go over that psychological barrier and a share of the market will be lost. The small wine producers do not have the economy of scale that the larger ones have and they have overheads which could force them into the higher brackets of the market price and thereby cause them loss in the market share. The flow-on from that is obvious: a loss of jobs, as I have mentioned, and a loss of support to tourism in the areas which I have mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The increase in the tax on wine will be disastrous for Western Australian winegrowers. They cannot be compared with multinational brewers or distillers. They are only small businessmen who are trying to make a go of things and who are in the process of bringing some great benefits not only to their state but also the country at large. There is absolutely no comparison between the money that we will get by increasing the tax on wine and the benefit. By increasing the tax on wine we will be kicking an industry whilst it is still growing, and that is just untenable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">With those points in mind, I urge fellow senators to oppose this increase in the tax on wine. I endorse the comments made by the Green senators in relation to this matter as it pertains to Western Australia. I reiterate that this will have a disastrous effect on winegrowers in the state which I represent. </PARA>

They are not just a tax increase but part of a comprehensive approach to the obvious need to reduce the deficit and provide services to the people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australians have been continually told by the opposition and its friends in the media that this budget is purely about increasing taxation. This is not the case. This budget is not just about reducing the deficit. It is also about maintaining the standards of education and further improving them; providing training places and furthering our attack on unemployment; and continuing our support for the underprivileged in society and our commitment to social justice. All of this is set in place, yet all those in the opposition can talk about is an increase in the price of wine. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The five sales tax bills that make up this package which is before the Senate represent the government's belief that there needs to be a small general increase in the level of sales tax. There will be tax cuts and support given to low income earners. Under the legislation, there will be a modest general increase in sales tax of one per cent and a later increase of one per cent. There will also be other targeted increases in sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bills before us increase the tax on wine and cider as well as on in situ pools. There is also a further bill which will provide for a split rate in the tax on luxury vehicles. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will deal first with the wine tax. I am sick of being told that, as a South Australian, I must oppose the increase in the sales tax on wine. I am very proud of the South Australian wine industry; I patronise the industry and promote it whenever I can. There is no doubt that my state produces the best wines in Australia and in the world. The industry has gone from strength to strength&mdash;not because of the low tax regime but because it is a quality product that has been marketed well. The key to success is a good product. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wine industry has been very lucky not to have borne a higher sales tax level earlier. Wine is an alcoholic beverage, and we must maintain standards and consistency in our taxation of such products. Even under the changes, beer and spirits will be taxed much more than wine because of the excise on beer and spirits. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There must be a balance. The government recognises the importance of the wine industry at domestic and export levels. But there cannot be such a large disparity. Wine will only be taxed at the domestic level. This taxation increase of 11 per cent will only be imposed on sales in Australia. There will be no excise on wine. This should not affect the price overseas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Anyone would think from the propaganda that the wine industry will be destroyed by the increases in price at the domestic level. I believe that if there is a drop in sales it will be because the wine industry has publicised the increases so well. The extra cost of a bottle of wine would be around 50c for a $10 bottle. The different prices at different bottle shops, pubs and restaurants means that people pay a wide variety of prices for wine anyway. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I know that if I go out to a modestly priced restaurant in Canberra I will pay twice as much for a certain bottle of wine than I would pay at my local pub. A glass of wine at a nightclub costs much more than a glass of wine at a hotel. And after 9 p.m. it costs even more. Would ordinary Australians who have the occasional bottle or cask notice this increase? I very much doubt it. I certainly would not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also disappointing to see the massive campaign being organised by the wine industry. A number of constituents have said to me that the wine industry cannot be too broke if it can spend all that money on a campaign. This seems like even more of a waste when one considers that the government has put proposals to it which would stagger the tax increase and other compensation. These proposals have been rejected out of hand. The government is still willing to sit down and discuss these issues with the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition continually refers to the 55 per cent increase in the rate of sales tax on wine. Talk about twisting the use of statistics! This is like saying that if a lolly goes up from 1c to 2c it represents an increase of 100 per cent. Of course it is mathematically correct, but it gives the impression that the increase is more severe than it is in reality. This is sensationalising the issue. The overall increase in the price of wine and cider will be 12 per cent by 1995. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also interesting to note that the Greens have become opponents of the wine tax. Surely some balancing of the taxes on alcohol would be seen as fair by those honourable senators. Or is this an indication of their personal drinking preferences? Perhaps self-interest is involved. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also wish to mention my support for the changes to sales tax on luxury vehicles. The Sales Tax Assessment Amendment (Deficit Reduction) Bill 1993 aims to provide for a reduction in the taxable value of luxury vehicles by a proportion of the motor vehicle depreciation limit. This will have the effect of having split sales tax rates on luxury cars. Currently, when a vehicle exceeds the depreciation limit by a small amount it is taxed at the higher rate of 30 per cent. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The new regime will see that the component of a passenger luxury vehicle less than the depreciation limit will be taxed at 16 per cent, and 17 per cent in 1995. For other luxury vehicles, this rate will be 21 per cent, and 22 per cent in 1995. The part of the price of the vehicle that exceeds the depreciation limit will be taxed at the new rate of 45 per cent, with no change in 1995. This will see those with particularly expensive cars paying more and those who were marginally over the limit paying a more reasonable amount. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The budget must be passed by this Senate. In another place, government ministers sit on treasury benches for a reason. They are responsible to the people. We have the mandate and we must be able to use it. The government has to worry about the big picture. It must be able to provide the services that it is committed to providing. We have our constituency and we must work towards achieving the goals of our party in the interests of our nation. The environment, sport, health, social security, support for the elderly, employment, education, training and a whole range of other areas need the financial support of government. We have a responsibility to raise revenue to fund our initiatives in the way that we see fit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Australian Democrats have shown over the years that they will be reasonable about most matters. I only hope that the Greens also will come to their senses. I understand that the Greens want to be famous. But there are more important issues with which we must contend. Opposition members must also stop playing games and try to act like members of an alternative government rather than as spoilers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The conventions broken by the opposition, in its opposing major sections of this budget package, and its bitterness because it lost the election, has created much unnecessary bad blood in this place. People in the community are getting the idea that the Senate is where the problems of the parliamentary process lie. It is very difficult to tell the good people of South Australia that this is not the case. I commend the bills to the Senate and I hope that the measures contained within them are allowed to proceed. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I point out that in New Zealand, despite excellent export potential, there has been no new investment for the last five years. That is because the government there has imposed regressive tax measures. Today, New Zealand is Australia's second largest market for wine exports as New Zealand simply cannot produce sufficient wine to meet its domestic and export requirements. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I particularly wish to speak about the impact on rural and regional Australia, where the imposition of this tax would be another body blow for the battlers in small businesses and rural enterprises. There are 600 small winemakers in rural and regional Australia and every single one of them will be affected by the imposition of this tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is more than just an increase in the price of a bottle of wine. This tax is not only an attack on the export industry but it will also impact on rural and regional economies, particularly regarding the seasonal employment of rural workers, especially women. There are very few other sources of seasonal employment for people who live in the vineyard areas and there are very few other opportunities to augment the family income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will mention two vineyards in Victoria of which I have had particular experience, namely, the Drumborg vineyard near Heywood, which employs between 70 and 80 pickers, mainly female, during the season, and the Crawford River vineyard, located slightly to the north of that in Condah, which employs between 20 and 30 pickers, also mainly women. This scenario is repeated across rural Victoria and Australia, especially in the areas of the Pyrenees and the Yarra Valley. Most smaller wineries tend to be labour intensive&mdash;that is, they use less machinery&mdash;and any fall in volume from this type of vineyard will have a disproportionately high effect on employment. The South Australian Centre for Economic Studies has estimated that the effect of the sales tax will be a 3.6 per cent decline in sales in the short term for smaller wineries and up to 11.8 per cent in the long term. Such a decline may make their operations unsustainable and therefore they will all lose their jobs. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is important to realise that other industry sectors in rural and regional Australia also contribute to the momentum of the wine industry. I am thinking particularly of timber and forestry industries, which contribute such things as posts and trellises. Sawmills are also associated with that sort of activity. The machinery and equipment suppliers of bore and irrigation equipment are already suffering from the rural recession. They do not need another body blow like this. The fabricated metal manufacturers and, as my colleague Senator Sandy Macdonald pointed out, the tourism industry, in which the vineyards play an integral part, are also affected. The construction industry generally is also concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During the last couple of months Senator Kemp and I visited the Mitchelton winery near Nagambie. They assured us that if this tax goes ahead they will be contracting a very large amount of their investment potential that they had hoped to put into new areas over the next year. We would not want to have this happen across the rest of Victoria and the rest of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">All the industries I have mentioned have significant inputs to the wine industry and they are all part of the interlocking employment-production-investment network so typical of rural and regional Australia. The wine industry is a rural based, high value adding, technologically superior, sustainably internationally competitive and well organised industry. I would have thought that this was exactly what we were trying to encourage. I believe that the government should abandon this regressive measure and that it should treat the wine industry as a national treasure, as other civilised countries do, and not as a tax cow.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let us have a look at the economics of the implications of the Senate failing to act responsibly and pass these measures. In the September 1993 edition of its <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">World Economic Outlook</EMPHASIS> document the International Monetary Fund made some comments that were not particularly related to Australia, but related to western economies as a whole. I will refer to only two sections of that document. Firstly it stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">A failure to reduce substantially these imbalances&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>by that it means budget imbalances&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">over the medium term would likely cause renewed upward pressure on long term interest rates, reduce capital formation and the scope for new job creation in the private sector, lower the rate of growth of a potential output and income, and continue to impede the flexibility of fiscal policy in the event of adverse cyclical developments.</PARA>
<PARA>What that is essentially saying is that it is all very well to take a nitpicking little sectional responsibility and say, `There are a few people in this suburb, a few people who live near that town, who might vote for me if I oppose this tax bill'. Tax bills are always unpopular. There has never been a popular tax increase. Everybody thinks the government needs to fund services, but nobody welcomes the fact that the taxes on them will be increased. That is hardly surprising. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Nevertheless, what the IMF is saying is that if we take that nitpicking industry-by-industry, town-by-town, vote-by-vote, opinion-poll-driven approach, we will in the long term significantly adversely affect the people whom, as the rhetoric would have it, we are seeking to assist. We are talking about the pressure on interest rates, which is much worse for any of the industries than a very small increase in sales tax. We are talking about the reduced capacity for job creation which is much more fundamental in the overall economic situation. The overall job possibility for the unemployed, those coming into the labour market and those seeking to re-enter the labour market is much more fundamental than the impact of any particular regional or industry measure. It has significant long-term effects in lowering the rate of growth in output. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point the IMF made was this:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">As recent experience in several countries shows, early announcement and legislation of credible medium term deficit reduction measures have immediate beneficial effects on long term interest rates and on economic confidence, even when recessionary conditions make it difficult to undertake significant deficit cuts in the short run.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . postponing action to deal with the fiscal imbalances would continue to impede a recovery of confidence.</PARA>
<PARA>That describes exactly the situation in which Australia finds itself. Even though, as we recover all too slowly from the recession, we need to increase the deficit this year to provide more stimulus, to generate more jobs, at the same time we need to announce that over the medium term we will be reducing the deficit so that the long-term job potential is generated, the potential for growth is maximised and the long-term advantage of Australia is enhanced. That is what we are sent here to do. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is all very well to make populist appeals to an industry in a particular state or electorate. It is all very well to make simple populist appeals against any tax increase. That is exactly what led the United States into the budget gridlock it now has. There was an interesting sentence in an <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Economist</EMPHASIS> editorial recently. It said that the hardest thing for anybody in government to do was to be tough on taxes, particularly to raise taxes to cut the budget deficit. That is the test of one's mettle. That is the test of whether one has what it takes to be a responsible government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Do we recognise that it is necessary to do something because it is right, even if it is unpopular? The Senate is being put to the test with regard to that matter right now. That is probably why Malcolm Fraser, of all people, said:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The present course&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA>he is talking about the Senate's present course&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">will do significant damage to the governmental and constitutional processes of Australia and will give the Senate power beyond that which was envisaged by our founding fathers. It will give minority parties an influence beyond their electoral support.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the end, it will depend on the respect that Senate members have for the institution of which they are a part. What is more important&mdash;protecting the institution, and its value to Australian democracy, or conducting a guerilla campaign against the Government's Budget?</PARA>
<PARA>That is the context in which we are dealing with this matter. I also want to deal with some questions about the equity of the tax changes. Some rhetoric that was very familiar to me came from those saying that these are not equitable measures, because that is what we were saying in the last election about the GST. They failed to appreciate the difference between the GST and the wholesale sales tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It was said correctly that all the evidence is, as logic obviously would argue, that lower income groups spend a higher proportion of their income and save less than upper income groups. That is why a GST is unfair because everything is taxed. Therefore, those who consume a higher proportion of their income pay tax on a higher proportion of their income. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In terms of the wholesale sales tax, that is very deliberately, as a matter of conscious policy, not so. The necessities of life are not subject to the wholesale sales tax. Broadly described, food and clothing are not subject to the wholesale sales tax; nor are things like electricity, water and those other basic necessities which make up a disproportionate part of the expenditure pattern of lower income groups. Senator Margetts' little anecdote was absolutely right when she spoke about the percentage of income that is spent on groceries, which is a correct description of the different pressure that is put on budgets by spending on the necessities. The difficulty for her is that those things are not subject to the wholesale sales tax, even though they would have been subject to the GST. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It does not tax food and Senator Margetts knows that it does not. As a matter of conscious policy, it distorts the pattern of imposition of wholesale sales tax on those things that are disproportionately purchased by upper income people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One of the ironies is that in the name of equity it is proposed to oppose a tax increase on swimming pools. It is very hard to argue in the interests of equity that the tax on swimming pools should not go up. One can see the poor and underprivileged in tears about the increase in tax on swimming pools, but that is what is being argued in the name of equity. What a farce!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is equally farcical to argue the case about wine. Quintessentially, wine should be subject to indirect tax because upper income people spend more of their income on it than lower income people, and they buy more expensive items than lower income people. There is a much higher level of tax paid by upper income people than lower income people, but in the interests of equity some people are proposing to oppose this increase. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is true that the wine industry is important and the government is engaged in discussions with the industry about industry assistance. But it does not make sense to use an inequitable tax measure to subsidise an industry when we could generate the revenue through an equitable tax measure and spend as much of it as is needed on industry assistance. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other thing that needs to be assessed in looking at the equity of the tax changes is the context of the government's record. Over the past 10 years the priority has been to assist lower income individuals and families. This has been achieved by the way the tax cuts have been targeted, by the way the welfare measures have been introduced and targeted and now by the introduction and&mdash;by agreement with the Democrats&mdash;the increase in the tax rebate for low income people. But on this occasion, after 10 years of focusing those measures on lower income people&mdash;properly so&mdash;this time the bulk of the personal tax cuts are quite deliberately targeted at middle Australia who have not benefited as much from the previous tax cuts. In my view, so they should be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we are faced with here is the circumstance in which honourable senators are being tested. Senators are elected to discharge national responsibilities; that is, to look beyond the short term interest and beyond the popular to what is right and appropriate in the national interest. Everybody in this chamber knows that the deficit reduction strategy is in the national interest. Some people know it and will vote against it, but the responsible people know it and will vote for it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We do not need opinion polls to tell us that people would rather not have tax increases. We know what would be popular in the short term, but we know what is right in the national interest. It will be interesting to test who will vote for it and who will vote against it. I commend the bills to the Senate. </PARA>

<PARA>We have had a very long and full second reading debate on these issues. We also had a full debate which was relevant to these bills in the context of the Taxation (Deficit Reduction) Bill (No. 3) yesterday. I do not propose to reiterate the remarks that we have made other than to say that, so far as the government's proposal to put a massive 55 per cent increase onto the sales tax on wine is concerned, I think there are few people in Australia, other than those in the government, who believe that that will not do great damage to an industry which, to use Senator Kernot's words, is on the cusp of a major development, particularly so far as exports are concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Putting this tax on wine, although it does not apply to exports, will have an enormous impact on the domestic side of the industry in terms of production and sale and consumption. That, in turn, will have a major, debilitating, very damaging effect not only on the domestic side of the industry but, just as importantly&mdash;more importantly in some respects, if one looks at our national needs in terms of exports and our balance of payments crisis with foreign debt exceeding $200,000 million&mdash;on the international side. Taking it all together, it is an impost of enormous impact which would be very devastating and very damaging to the industry. There is no way that we as a parliament should be prepared to allow through a measure which we know is going to be so devastating. It is for those reasons that I move those amendments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I will not say any more about the amendments specifically other than to pick up very briefly on a comment made by Senator McMullan when closing the second reading debate. I will just lay to rest another furphy that Senator McMullan and this government have been propounding for some considerable time&mdash;ever since the budget, indeed. It is the proposition that these taxes are absolutely integral&mdash;I think he used the word `integral'&mdash;to the government's overall macro-economic strategy. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="DJ4">Senator SHORT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is patently incorrect. What we are talking about with the totality of these bills is something approaching one and a half per cent of the government's total revenue collections for this financial year. Sure, it builds in the future, but there is every scope and every opportunity for the government to so rearrange the rest of the huge totality of its fiscal policies, both on the expenditure and on the revenue side, as to be able to cater for that very simply.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I can cite no better authority as to the non-vitalness, if you like, of these bills than the current Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Gareth Evans. In 1981, with the parties on opposite sides of the chamber, he participated in a similar debate when the then Fraser Government was attempting to pass sales tax bills. At that time, Senator Evans made it absolutely clear, in a very good second reading speech, that there is no moral, conventional or other requirement or expectation on oppositions not to oppose bills of this nature. They are non-survival bills, to use Senator Evans's words at that time. There is no reason at all why, if they are bad bills, bad law, bad policy, the Senate should not oppose them. These bills are bad law; they are bad policy; and they are very damaging. For that reason, we have no hesitation at all in requesting these amendments. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Democrats will be supporting these requests. As has already been outlined</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>by Senator Short, they are identical to th requests we had circulated yesterday. The Democrats will be supporting them because we believe, firstly, that the question of whether or not there will be damage to the wine industry has been proven beyond doubt: there will be damage. The only thing left to debate is the extent of that damage. Even some of the government speakers have acknowledged that there will indeed be damage to the wine industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">However, when we come to budget strategy, we do not believe there will be any major impact on the major thrust of this budget strategy or, indeed, on the total amount of revenue collected. It is very interesting to note that the government, in its continuing negotiations with the wine industry over the last few days&mdash;indeed, over the last couple of weeks&mdash;has basically acknowledged that it is prepared, in the short term, to live with no additional income from the wine industry. Therefore, the Democrats do not have any problem, as far as the deficit reduction strategy goes, in opposing this measure. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Along with Senator Short, I take this opportunity to lay to rest a few untruths before we finish this debate. Senator Foreman said that those on this side of the chamber spoke only on the wine tax. That is totally incorrect; I can guarantee that at least 90 per cent of my short delivery of 10- to 12-odd minutes related to the approximately $915 million&mdash;nearly $1 billion&mdash;of other sales tax that will result in the next full financial year. The wine tax accounts for only about $85 million in a full year. So let me put that to rest. Those on the other side of the chamber seem to have a bit of trouble with mathematics. Again, it might have been Senator Foreman who insisted that it was a rise of only 11 per cent.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator McKiernan also has trouble with mathematics. I thought it was simple arithmetic, because the rate in the dollar is increasing from 20 per cent to 31 per cent&mdash;the 11 per cent increase. For the simple-minded on the other side of the chamber, it is divided by 20 and multiplied by 100; without using a calculator, even without writing it down on the back of a stamp, it comes out at 55 per cent.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The minister's response confirms what I believe is general knowledge: the government did not consult the wine industry before making its announcement. On a related point, is the minister aware of statements which have been made by a number of government spokespersons that a drop in domestic wine consumption&mdash;it is forecast to be in the order of nine per cent&mdash;could not really be made up for by exports? We are talking about high premium quality wines for export and, largely, a different quality of grapes is grown for domestic consumption, although there is some overlap. I also ask the minister whether the government is prepared to institute a process to develop an industry plan for the wine industry in the months following this parliamentary session. In other words, is the government prepared to hold an industry inquiry to determine what needs to be done to establish an industry plan which will improve the position and the future of the wine industry?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Unfortunately, because of the drop off in the list of speakers I did not speak during the second reading debate, but I feel obliged to speak now to indicate to colleagues in the chamber why I propose to vote against the motion moved by Senator Short. I do so because I believe that, in the long term, this action will jeopardise the wine industry. I say that because, unlike beer and spirits, wine and cider are not subject to excise. If we adopt this motion and it is rejected by the House of Representatives, the government has indicated that the excise exemption currently applying to the wine industry will be looked at. In fact, if I understood his statement correctly, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) is considering looking at ways and means of applying the excise to the wine industry.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is about $14 excise per litre of alcohol on beer, and regular beer contains about five per cent of alcohol and light beer, say, 2.5 per cent. There is about twice the excise on a can of full strength beer as there is on a can of light beer. I had hoped this would be discussed at the committee stage, because I wanted to make the point that what the government is doing here has a number of problems. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Let me come back to the first point. I believe that adopting Senator Short's proposal does not enable the committee to get into the meat of the proposition put forward by the government. If we did get into the meat of the proposition I believe we would see that it  increases the percentage of tax on low alcohol wines to a greater extent than it increases the tax on full strength wine. That is not a good thing. As the explanatory memorandum says, the government is increasing from 20 per cent to 31 per cent the tax on wines that do not have a low alcohol content, but for those that do it is increasing the tax from 10 to 21 per cent. I do not have my calculator handy, but anybody would realise that that is a greater increase on sales tax on low alcohol wines than it is on full strength wines. </PARA>

There are other aspects of this measure that we could have discussed in the committee stage&mdash;for example, the propositions that have been put up about door sales not being subject to the increase in tax, and perhaps having a volume threshold for a particular producer below which this increase would not apply. All of those things will not now be able to be subject to propositions put forward in the committee stage because there is not much point in doing so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition has indicated that it will press ahead with its requests to the House of Representatives that there be no increase at all in sales taxes on wines. It appears that will be agreed to by the Democrats and the Greens, so there really is not much point in pursuing this. But I do ask the government to consider that in the event the whole issue is considered in the House of Representatives again, not necessarily on this occasion but on some future occasion. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I reiterate my concern that the measures that are being proposed by the opposition will, in the long term, have the effect of exposing the industry to excise action or some other action that a government in the future will impose upon the industry to redress what does appear, on the face of it, clearly to be an unfair advantage to the wine industry over, for example, the beer industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As to people being consulted, that is a valid point. I remind the committee that beer drinkers, for example, have had to cop rise after rise and very little has been said about it. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand the points that have been made in the debate, not least about the fiscal time lapse and the cash flow availability in the beer industry as compared with the wine industry, but the bottom line is: what is the consumer paying? The bottom line is that the consumer of beer, which is generally of much lesser alcohol strength than wine, is paying something like double the taxation that a wine drinker is paying. I think that is unfair. I suppose future governments will think that is unfair too.</PARA></TALK.START>

It has always been clear to those of us who have been observing it closely but not publicly.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;But Senator Short knows it is correct. He said that it would cost us up to $1.5 billion a year by 1996-97, et cetera.

That was the essence of the point made. I do not want to argue about the numbers, although the numbers are right.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The point that is now apparent publicly, which has always been apparent to me, is that the opposition's real concern is that if these revenue measures pass and the government's medium term deficit reduction strategy is put in place as a result of this legislation, we will not have to bring in the sorts of punitive taxes in the budgets close to the election that the opposition would like to see us bring in, so that it can score political points about it closer to the election.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Spindler raised some questions about a plan&mdash;an inquiry. I did not respond then because it seemed to be more of a speech to which I might respond now. The government has made its position clear: if the industry is prepared to talk to us, we are happy to talk to it. At the moment it is pursuing what I think is a very short-sighted policy that is against its own interests. I happen to share Senator Harradine's assessment&mdash;not every dot and comma of the things he said, but the broad assessment&mdash;that this is not a measure that is in the long-term interests of the wine industry. I think some people are pursuing it for whatever reasons. I am sure that they believe they are doing the right thing; I think they are not. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Harradine traversed some other interesting options. As he said, they really do not relate to the motion before us. But, broadly, they are interesting, and they are matters that the government will need to consider in the future in its taxation of this whole area. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What Senator Harradine did make clear was that we are not here talking about an equity measure at all. The equity is quite clearly in favour of this motion; the redistribution of income is quite clearly in favour of this measure. It is a tax measure that will tax the wealthy much more than lower income earners. But the people who come in here spouting equity will oppose it for reasons to do with the local politics of South Australia and Western Australia. That is fair enough, but I just wish we would not pretend that we are being pious when we are being opportunist. That is all. </PARA>

<PARA>A couple of these amendments are very minor, being consequential upon others in terms of changing the numbering and so on. Collectively, they seek to remove the first of the two one per cent increases in sales tax that are contained in the bill. I will not speak at any length on these amendments, other than to say that this increase in sales tax, this first tranche, means a 10 per cent increase in sales tax on a very wide range of goods for which the existing rate of sales tax is 10 per cent, for example, and a lesser percentage increase for those goods where the sales tax rate is higher. It is a hefty hike in sales tax on a very wide range of goods, despite the fact that the government told the electorate throughout the election campaign&mdash;including in the election policy speech&mdash;and in the months leading up to the campaign that it would not increase taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government can try to argue with that and Senator McMullan can try to argue the contrary until he is blue in the face, but the debates we have had in the parliament and elsewhere for weeks have made it absolutely clear that the government has no mandate at all to increase broadly based taxes of this nature&mdash;indeed, any taxes. For that reason alone, this measure deserves to be defeated. But there are other reasons why it deserves to be defeated. The paramount reason is that these sales tax increases are harsh, regressive and unfair, and they hurt low income earners in particular. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government will argue that it is giving tax reductions which compensate for these indirect tax increases. But when we do the arithmetic, it works out at nothing like a fair compensation. It is only a partial and inadequate compensation. For all those people who earn less than $20,700 a year&mdash;that comprises 60 per cent of the total female work force in this country and about 40 per cent of the total work force&mdash;the only compensation they will get for the very significant flow-through in price increases that will occur as a result of this increase in sales tax is a measly $2.88 a week. It will go nowhere near compensating for the price increases that are being forced on the electorate in the budget's proposals. Not only is the increase only $2.88 a week but, worse still, because it is a rebate they will not get it until they put in a tax return after the end of this financial year. It will be June or July or, in some cases, closer to Christmas next year before they get this measly, partial and inadequate compensation for a whole range of price increases that will occur as a result of the sales tax increases from now on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and other government ministers have been talking about goodies for Christmas in the sense of the income tax cut. By the way, that cut has now been put in jeopardy by the government's obduracy in the last few days. Even if some taxpayers get that tax cut before Christmas, a vast majority of low income earners will not get it for a minimum of eight or nine months, many of them closer to 12 months. They will have gone through all the price increases in the meantime. That will hit very hard. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I say to the committee as a whole and, in particular, to my friend Senator Harradine that this tax proposal is harsh, unfair and regressive, and particularly hits single low income families with children. We will not have a bar of agreeing to tax increases which do that. For that reason, I have moved the amendments standing in my name. </PARA>

The Greens will not be supporting this request for amendments, simply because in the medium term that would make it difficult for this government to keep to any reasonable deficit reduction strategy. Because we are cognisant of that desire and have obviously made requests on other aspects of the budget, we believe that in this instance we can live with this tranche. But we will, as we have foreshadowed, oppose the second tranche, which gives the government time to find alternative sources of revenue.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I made my remarks in my speech in the second reading debate. We will not be supporting this request either. The choices are not entirely up to us. The opposition proposed a GST, and because it could not have that it is now saying that the government does not have a right to propose its own agenda. I do not agree with that agenda either, but I do agree that the government was elected, however slimly, and this is the economic direction it has taken. We have had some influence on that, although nowhere near enough. We wish we could have more. When we come to speak about the second round of tax cuts I would like to say more about the cumulative effect of rejecting a whole range of government revenue-raising proposals.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I wish to add to my colleague's comments. We are not supporting these amendments. We have already spoken about the regressive impact of the wholesale sales taxes. Despite our disagreement with them, we feel that it would be regarded, with some justification, as fiscally irresponsible if we were to support these amendments. However, let that serve as a warning that, unless the government heeds the requests of the Senate, any further delay in the passage of these bills will be fiscally irresponsible; that is, if the passage is delayed and it creates a hole in the deficit right now. Whereas the cutting of the second round of wholesale sales taxes will have no impact this or next financial year, the passage of these amendments or any delay by the government in the passage of the bills because it holds up the request of the Senate will also jeopardise the legal ability, or even the moral legitimacy, of the government to collect the money that it has been collecting since 18 August.</PARA></TALK.START>

I am talking about the first tranche that we are considering here. If we were fair dinkum about it and we stuck to our guns, then the government would not have the money to continue to exercise its rights as an elected government. This would create a great problem for members of this chamber and the government. That does not worry me a great deal, but I believe that we have to look at our responsibility in respect of tax measures such as these. I do not agree with them. I do not like them for the very same reason advanced by Senator Short: they are regressive, particularly on single income families. I have made that point, both in this chamber and outside the chamber.</PARA></TALK.START>

In respect of the first tranche, there is a real argument, frankly, against allowing this measure to go through.

Amendments 1, 2 and 9 of my nine circulated amendments relate to this. Most of what I want to say in relation to this has already been said. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As far as the first tranche is concerned, I repeat that the government has no mandate for this increase. These taxes are unfair, harsh and regressive. They particularly hurt low income earners and low single income families with children. There is totally inadequate compensation for any of this in the government's budget proposals as a whole. Indeed, the impact will be very significant on a range of people, particularly low income families, as we approach this Christmas. The clauses we have just passed will have an impact this Christmas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As a result of what the Senate has now done, there will be an increase in the cost of children's toys and games, flavoured milk, soft drinks and baby foods, which for many people are necessities. We have passed an increase in sales tax for such items through the committee's failure to adopt the opposition's requests for amendment. I urge the committee very strongly to look at this second stage of sales tax increase that has been proposed by the government. It is proposed that from 1 July 1995 the sales tax be increased again by a like amount to the increase coming in this year. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In moving these amendments on behalf of the Opposition, I point out that the Greens&mdash;Senator Chamarette and Senator Margetts&mdash;have also circulated amendments that are identical to the opposition's amendments. So although I am moving them on behalf of the opposition, I publicly acknowledge and recognise that identical amendments have been proposed by the Greens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator McMullan said in relation to the last group of amendments for the first tranche that the sales tax increase for this financial year is central to the funding of the 1993 budget. There is no way in the world he can say that the second tranche being proposed to apply in 1995-96 is essential in any way, shape or form in that context. I know that this is a government of enormous incompetence, but I would have thought that even it, in the intervening period between now and 1995-96, would have been able to so adjust its fiscal policy and budgetary strategies as to be able to more than encompass the potential loss in revenue two or three years down the track which acceptance of the opposition's amendments on this occasion would incur. Therefore, there is no way in which the government can say that this second unfair, harsh, regressive, uncompensated, very damaging further tax hike for low income earners and families can be justified or required in a fiscal sense in any way. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Short correctly identified the fact that there are amendments circulated in my name which also have the same effect as the amendments requested by the opposition. We have heard that the government is beginning to realise that it is necessary in the medium term to frame budgets in a different way&mdash;to be more consultative and to involve more people in the way that budgets are framed&mdash;while still being fiscally responsible and meeting the needs of the community. This is a welcome move. There is no need to think that will necessarily throw fiscal policies out the window. I believe this is one thing that time will prove.</PARA></TALK.START>

We are also looking at the general employment aspects of government strategies, which we hope may improve with time. We certainly support these measures. </PARA>

As each piece of legislation is presented to us we have an opportunity to amend it. We have done that and will continue to do that. I think the particular situation we should be mindful of is that the Treasurer has said that he is going to bring next year's budget forward to May or June. Planning for that is going to start soon. I am sure that we will have an opportunity to have some input into the planning of that budget. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think we have learnt something from this experience.

But those opposite cannot stand here in the name of equity, in the name of commitment to a more secure economic future for Australia and in the name of certainty, and take out a wine tax, two rounds of sales tax, petrol taxes and a retrospective tax on annual leave. What are we left with? What is the government left with as the core of its budget? It is left with a luxury car tax and a few changes to the fringe benefits tax; the credit union tax has a question mark over it. That is why we ought to think long and hard about our rights and responsibilities and the role of the Senate. </PARA>

The Democrats want people to have confidence in Australia's future. We want them to feel that they want to make investment decisions.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue that Senator Kernot and her colleagues have to face up to is the mandate. Senator Kernot touched a bit on the issue of the government's mandate. I do not think there is any argument in the wider community&mdash;and I do not think there is a great deal of argument in this chamber, apart from the exchanges during question time&mdash;that the government went to the election opposing and eschewing any rise in taxes. There is no argument about that. We have produced quotation after quotation from the Prime Minister, Mr Willis and their colleagues to show that the government went to the election saying that it would not increase taxes. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What we now have, of course, are these taxes which show that the government has decided not to keep to that particular election commitment. In terms of keeping governments honest this is a very important principle. It is my view&mdash;and I think most of the Australian public share it&mdash;that the moral authority of this government has collapsed. It has collapsed essentially because, as many have said, the government lied its way into office. It is not the only issue, but it is important that we make an attempt to keep the government honest. One of the Democrats' great principles in ancient days, under former Senator Chipp, was that governments should be kept to their commitments and promises. I do not say that this is the only consideration, but it is an important consideration. There is no question that the government has comprehensively broken the commitments that it made to the Australian people. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot raised the issue of confidence in the Australian community. She said that it was important to restore confidence and that, therefore, we should pass this budget. I put a counter view to Senator Kernot. I have had the experience of sitting on the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration and looking at the evidence that came forward from a wide variety of sectors of the Australian economy. The evidence that was given to that committee about these tax rises was absolutely devastating. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">If Senator Kernot wants to increase the level of investment in the Australian community, she should not vote for taxes which severely discriminate against industry.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot also raised the question of equity. I do not think there is any argument that these taxes are regressive taxes. I have gone through the important principle of her argument, and we can debate that, but the big issue is whether the government should be kept honest and, if it fails to keep its promises, whether we should not encourage it to keep true to the mandate which it went to the election on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On equity grounds we would have to vote against these tax measures. Everybody recognises that they are regressive. If we are after restoring confidence in Australian industry, the last thing we should do is increase taxes on industry. Senator Kernot has raised some important issues which we have to consider. In conclusion, I remind honourable senators that in 1981 a whole raft of indirect tax increases were thrown out of this place.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak very briefly in support of these requests. The government provided some buffers to the introduction of the first round of wholesale sales tax, some of which were attributed to the involvement of the Australian Democrats. I refer, for example, to the $50 increase in the rebate, the lowering of the fuel excise and the dropping of the proposed change to optometry benefits available under Medicare. On that basis why, therefore, is it legitimate to support an increase in wholesale sales tax in July 1995, in 18 months time, without also legislating in advance for social equal compensation measures? That is the point I would like to put to Senator Kernot.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot says that we cannot have it both ways. Neither can she; nor the government. The Democrats and the government have shown that they are prepared to legislate in advance. As has already been detailed, they are prepared to show compassion for the regressive impact that this first round of measures will have. Why, then, are they not prepared to make available ahead of time measures that will compensate for the second round when it hits the community and those in the community least able to afford it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Kernot cited figures which indicate that 50 per cent of the people she has been hearing from do not indicate concern over this budget; they are concerned, but they simply want the budget passed. I have heard other figures which state that 67 per cent want the government to change its budget in recognition of the regressive impact of its plan. The point is: it is not the number of people who want the budget passed; it is who is asking and why. I maintain that these requests, if supported, are signals to the government that, in the eyes of the community, these budget measures do not represent equity or compassion.

One can understand the need for any institution, whether it be a home, a business or a government, to engage in deficit reduction. It is a commendable task. But what the parliament&mdash;and, indeed, the government&mdash;always needs to be aware of is whether the burdens of that effort fall fairly throughout the community; that is, whether they are shared properly. I have already mentioned that burdens are falling&mdash;unfairly, I believe&mdash;on the shoulders of the one-income family. I also believe that they are being shared unfairly by the unemployed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Many people in the community consider that we are not in a recession but in a painful transition to a situation of continuous drops in standards of living, with a permanent underclass of unemployed and underemployed. I do not think that situation should exist and I do not think we should allow it to exist. I realise that all parties and all members of the community are concerned about that. There needs to be a combined approach to see that that does not occur and that the unemployment situation improves. As elected representatives of our various states, we need to ensure that the burden is not unfairly shared. For example, we need to ensure that people in my state are not unfairly burdened by any of the deficit reduction bills. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another of the government's obligations is to rein in expenditure on rather suspect policies, particularly if the government's commitments on those policies have no legislative base and have not been approved of and discussed by the parliament. There is an obligation on the government to rein in expenditure in this instance, if for no other reason than to offset the losses in tax receipts which have been occasioned by the reaction to the budget, by the various discussions that have been taking place between members of parliament and the government, and by the actions of the Senate today. </PARA>

You can come back next year and have another go'. I am not referring to those who want us to come back next year because they want us to have to bring in a tough budget next year for their political advantage.

That is recognised, at least by 40 senators. I am concerned that some of those 40 are not recognising the short-term implications of it.

Those who are seeking to be paid workers in the low to middle income range, that is the unemployed, will be the beneficiaries of this budget overall and of this deficit reduction strategy in particular, for which this measure is so important.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The problem with relying on increases in indirect taxes and other forms of taxes&mdash;and tonight we have had the example of the wine industry&mdash;is that in many ways they reduce employment. They detract from the very proposition that Senator McMullan quite rightly put&mdash;that the way to deliver to the people who are in most need in this community is, in the end, to create job opportunities, to create employment. The wine tax, which we defeated tonight, was an example of a tax which would have affected employment within the industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In recent months, we have had examples of the sort of expenditure that does not help people in most need in Australia. The two very obvious examples were the local capital works program, which was a pork barrel operation leading up to the last election, and, in Canberra, the construction of the new headquarters for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, colourfully known as `Gareth's gazebo'. These sorts of expenditures do not help people living in the outer suburbs of suburban Australia who do not have good access to education, quality health care and income support where they really need it. Those examples help to illustrate the fact that there are expenditures of the Commonwealth, the states and local governments which can be reduced and then redirected to properly help those most in need in this society. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I do not want to unduly delay the conclusion of this debate. There are a couple of things I want to say briefly in response to Senator McMullan's remarks because, like Senator Campbell, I cannot, in honesty, in conscience, let them go uncommented on. Senator Campbell has covered the first point that I would have made relating to government expenditure. I will not go into that any further&mdash;Senator Campbell made the point very well&mdash;other than to say that Senator McMullan is totally wrong in his assertion that the Opposition's policy position is based essentially on slashing outlays. That is simply not true, and the evidence shows that quite clearly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second point I make&mdash;which relates a little to the first&mdash;centres on what Senator McMullan said about deficit reduction strategies. We all agree with the need to reduce the deficit. He omitted to point out that, over the last three years, including this financial year, the accumulated deficit resulting from the deliberate policies that this government has pursued is $40,000 million. In three years, this government has cranked up this debt; it has put the nation's savings into hock; it has put its sticky fingers into the nation's cookie jar to the tune of $40 billion. For Senator McMullan to come in here now and cry crocodile tears over deficit reduction strategies and the like is hypocritical in the extreme. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Harradine very rightly made the point that we need in our policies, in our approach to government, to ensure that burdens fall fairly throughout the community. Senator Harradine is absolutely correct. We in the opposition are so critical of the policies and performance of this government over the past few years precisely because the government has not allowed the burdens to fall fairly on the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's approach does not produce equity. So as to not prolong the debate, I ask rhetorically: where is the equity when the government adopts measures which so hurt low income earners and families, as this government has done? Where is the equity when the government pursues policies that have the result of putting one million Australians out of work, with another one million Australians unable to find full-time work or who have dropped out of the work force altogether&mdash;the underclass which Senator Harradine was referring to? What we are all about is trying to remove from our society those evils that produce the dreadful inequities and distortions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To suggest that the government is going to help any of those things by jacking up sales tax in the way that it is proposing is an absolute nonsense so far as the individuals that it hurts are concerned, so far as the investment that it talks about trying to encourage is concerned, and so far as the jobs that it talks about trying to create are concerned. On all those counts, the government has failed. I reject totally the government's suggestion that it will now have its strategy for a better Australia put at risk by the acceptance of the opposition's requests for amendment. It is a nonsense. </PARA>

Senator Short's description of the legal history of why we have this bill is accurate. I will not waste time on that, but one of the advantages of it, although it was an unfortunate decision at the time from the government's point of view, is that it exposes the weakness in the argument that increasing indirect tax is necessarily inequitable.</PARA></TALK.START>

One of the good things about the wholesale sales tax that distinguishes it from the goods and services tax is its capacity to distinguish&mdash;and here is a classic example. It is an interesting equity argument to say that there is something inequitable about putting up tax on swimming pools. </PARA>

<PARA>I have moved this second set of requests for amendment on behalf of the opposition. They relate to the second tranche, the further one per cent increase due on 1 July 1995&mdash;a tranche which we now well know the Senate has rejected in terms of the other three bills. I repeat the point I made earlier: if there had not been the High Court decision last year which produced a technicality in terms of the requirement for a separate act for the taxing of in situ pools, we would not be having this debate because we would have already acted on it as part of the preceding amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The only point I want to make in addition to those I have already made is that, given the way the Senate has decided on the first three bills that have we discussed, if the Senate does not reject this second tranche, we will have the situation where, come 1 July 1995, excluding a zero rate, we will move from a rate scale for the wholesale sales tax of five per cent to a rate scale of nine per cent&mdash;in fact, 10 per cent if we count zero. On 1 July 1995, if this second tranche is not rejected, we will have zero, 11 per cent, 12 per cent, 16 per cent, 17 per cent, 21 per cent, 22 per cent, 31 per cent, 32 per cent and 45 per cent. No rate structure could be more ridiculous, more complicated and unnecessary, in my mind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the basis of the principle that was adopted in the voting on the first two bills, for consistency and to avoid this nine per cent or 10 per cent rate scale, I urge the Senate to vote on this tranche the same way as it voted for the second tranche in relation to the other three bills&mdash;namely, to reject it.</PARA>

<PARA>There was some misunderstanding in the chamber yesterday. Yesterday I sought in similar terms to suggest that the government should withdraw and redraft both the first and the second bills in its package of eight bills, which are a division of the original single omnibus taxation bill. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I understood it, the Australian Democrats were prepared to support us in relation to the first bill, but not the second bill. The second bill was the test bill and the Democrats' argument was that, even though there was a question about the constitutionality, the government is entitled to that process. However, Senator Spindler's amendment to my amendment to withdraw the test bill was to be supported by the government but, due to some communication difficulty on the other side, the government voted the wrong way. As a result of that, Senator Spindler lost and he was then faced with the prospect of having to support our motion in full, which included the part that he did not like; therefore, he had to vote against it. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The end result of all that is that the position of the Senate yesterday was correct, in that a majority of senators apparently do not believe that both bills should go back and be redrafted, but it was wrong in that, as I understand it, a majority of senators believe that the first bill should go back and be redrafted. That is why I have moved this motion in these terms tonight. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is now considering the Commonwealth Banks Amendment Bill 1993, which fundamentally seeks to give legislative provision to the sale of a further 19 per cent of the shares currently held by the Commonwealth of Australia in the Commonwealth Bank. The shares are to be sold in a float which has already been advertised and will occur within the next few weeks.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition will be supporting this bill because we are, and have been for many years, committed to privatisation as a way of, firstly, encouraging more people to be owners of shares in Australia and to participate in the economy in that way and, secondly, getting governments out of businesses that they do not need to be involved in and ensuring that government concentrates on its core business, which is to provide a broad economic framework and support to those in need. This bill will also ensure that the government is not tied up in business enterprises that it is not really best qualified to be involved in. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The Commonwealth government has sold 30 per cent of the equity in the Commonwealth Bank so far. The opposition believes that the sale of a further 19 per cent is a measure which has purely been taken to create more revenue for the government at a time of fiscal crisis created by this government. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The opposition takes the position that, if the Commonwealth is serious about privatisation to achieve micro-economic goals, it should be moving to the sale of the full remaining 70 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank. That is our policy; it is the policy that we took to the last election. We predict that the Commonwealth government will move to a full sale of the Commonwealth Bank because of fiscal pressure and the diminishing opposition to privatisation within the government's own ranks, particularly the left wing, which has opposed privatisation for many years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In Sydney, on 9 June 1993, the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration held an inquiry into the Commonwealth Bank's annual report. We took evidence specifically from Mr Ian Payne, who is a senior director of the bank. At that hearing I asked for Mr Payne's broad views about the taxpayers of Australia having 70 per cent equity in the bank, and whether the government maintaining equity in the bank, be it 70 per cent or 51 per cent&mdash;which will be the case once the current tranche is sold&mdash;will `achieve any real public policy input'. I also asked whether government input into the policy of the bank would be any different should the Commonwealth own 70 per cent, 30 per cent or any other amount. Mr Payne agreed with my proposition that, effectively, the government could no longer, and does no longer, use the Commonwealth Bank as a vehicle for public policy. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure there are people in the chamber tonight, members of the Senate and members of this parliament broadly, who would like to see the Commonwealth Bank used for social and policy objectives. I am sure that is the quite genuine, if not misplaced, objective of members of the left in the Labor Party. I will not put words into the mouths of the Australian Democrats&mdash;I am sure that Senator Spindler will contribute his party's views on this debate&mdash;but definitely the motivation of the Democrats is to seek to ensure that this privatisation does not proceed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">My view is that public policy should not be delivered through these quasi-autonomous government institutions. It is far better for the government to develop specific programs to help those who have specific needs and to administer those programs as efficiently as possible with very clearly set out social goals and clearly measurable accountability structures, so that those social policy objectives can be measured effectively. It is very hard, if not impossible, to measure whether some public policy objectives, delivered through a 51 per cent ownership of a commercial trading operation&mdash;in this case, a very large and successful bank&mdash;can deliver public policy goals, particularly social objectives which the Democrats and the left of the Labor Party would seek. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">That is where we are coming from. I have circulated an amendment to the second reading. I hope that honourable senators have it. I move:</PARA>

<PARA>I am informed that Senator Boswell will address the second part of that motion in his contribution and I will limit my remarks to the first section. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have said, the opposition will not oppose this bill. We simply point out to the Senate and the government that the objectives of this bill are not to enhance micro-economic reform or competition within the banking sector. They go only a very little way towards assisting the Commonwealth Bank in achieving its commercial objectives and do not really assist the government that much in achieving its revenue objectives. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The other point that needs to be made in any debate on privatisation in Australia&mdash;and a number of them are coming up in future deliberations of this Senate, particularly in relation to the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation and the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories&mdash;is that one of the other fundamental differences between the government and the coalition parties on privatisation is the use to which privatisation funds are put. We have always argued that privatisation revenue should be immediately offset against long-term government debt. The benefit of this to the community and the taxpayers of Australia is that using the once-off sale proceeds to reduce government debt, reduces in out years the debt servicing requirement which has been a significant part of Commonwealth government outlays in the budgets of the past few years and which will be a part of budgets in future out years. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The policies that we took to the last election ensured that something like 90 per cent of the proceeds of sales that we had in our policy and manifesto were used to offset Commonwealth debt. They would have made a significant contribution to reducing the burden of debt servicing payments on Commonwealth taxpayers in future years. They would ensure that the proceeds of sales of Commonwealth assets, including significant assets like the Commonwealth bank, which have built up goodwill and significant business in Australia and internationally are not just squandered in one year. They would ensure that all Australian taxpayers and future generations benefit from the proceeds of a sale for many years, if not generations to come. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not sure of the Democrats' view on this, and I would be interested to hear Senator Spindler put that view. We think it is extremely important when selling great national assets like the Snowy Mountains Engineering Corporation, the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories and the Commonwealth Bank&mdash;which is before us tonight&mdash;that the benefit of the sale is not squandered on a once-off deficit program in the way that the funds from this sale will be used. To use an old cliche, you are selling the family silverware, the table cloth and the napkins to pay for&mdash;</PARA>

Each week after that you have to find something else to sell, and something else and, in the end, the cupboard will be bare and you will not be able to buy the groceries. A prudent household under fiscal stress, like many Australian households, that was unfortunately forced to sell the silverware and other valued treasured assets would use the proceeds to reduce the mortgage and outgoings so that it could afford to buy the groceries.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Australia is very much in that situation at the moment. We have an enormous debt. Proceeds from privatisation can help to reduce that debt and reduce debt servicing. This has occurred right across the globe. It is a policy that has been implemented in Western nations. The fastest privatisers are now the Eastern European countries. We see it even in China. We had the pleasure of having lunch with the President of the Republic of Chile only yesterday. The South American republics that were referred to only a few years ago by our Prime Minister (Mr Keating) as banana republics have used privatisation to reduce their debt and return growth and wealth to their citizens. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">One very important thing that privatisation can do for a country like Australia is enhance competition and, therefore, increase service and benefits to consumers. A vital objective of the opposition within our privatisation policies is to ensure that consumers receive better service for cheaper prices. There is no doubt that in the financial sector it is crucial that we have fair competition between all our financial institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is absolutely no doubt at the moment that the Commonwealth Bank is, in some ways, being held back by the dead hand of having the Commonwealth on its share register. This point was reinforced by the director of the Commonwealth Bank, Mr Payne. It restricts its capital raising ability and its ability to compete in the marketplace with the other banks&mdash;the National Australia Bank, Westpac and the ANZ&mdash;which are all desperately trying to make themselves internationally competitive, reduce their costs, deliver better services to their consumers and compete&mdash;</PARA>

That will ensure that the Commonwealth Bank can be part of that and, therefore, increase the benefits to consumers of banking and financial services in Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I have already said, the opposition expects that the Commonwealth will, over the course of the next two or three years, move to sell further tranches of the Commonwealth Bank because it will be under increasing fiscal pressure. The opposition will encourage that process. We have moved a second reading amendment to encourage the government to move to completely selling the Commonwealth Bank. The directors of the Commonwealth Bank would like to see that take place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am sure many of the current private shareholders, individual Australian citizens, who were so enthusiastic to buy shares in the Commonwealth Bank during the last sale would be happy about this. We see from reading today's newspapers that the bank was totally flooded by inquiries from members of the public before 11 o'clock yesterday morning. The bank has been rushed for prospectuses. This shows that there is a keenness by Australian people and employees of the Commonwealth Bank to buy shares in this fine institution. We think that there would now be a demand to sell the balance of the bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is one further point I should make which I overlooked when going through my notes. In any debate on privatisation in federal parliament at this time, it is pertinent to point out that the former policy of this Labor government was to encourage privatisation and micro-economic reform in the states. In the last few months the states have suffered a drawback by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister announcing that they will allow the states the proceeds from one privatisation to receive the benefits of a preferential compensation deal to compensate the states for the revenue from their financial institutions&mdash;whether a state bank or state insurance office&mdash;that they would otherwise receive. That revenue will be lost by the states and it will move to the Commonwealth in the form of taxes that will be derived from those institutions. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What was an incentive for the state governments to privatise and achieve the benefits of micro-economic reform across Australia have now been limited by the action of the Treasurer. We have made it clear that we think that is most regrettable. There are a range of privatisation ventures that need to take place in the states to ensure economic efficiency and micro-economic reform. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government is at the moment blaming the states for a lack of progress in waterfront and shipping reform. The states failing to reform their port authorities is an example of that. There are a range of privatisation ventures that need to take place in the states. Unless the Commonwealth is committed to talking to the states about sensible financial arrangements to carry out those privatisations, then the whole cause of economic efficiency and international competitiveness will be held back because of this regrettable change of policy from the federal government. I conclude my remarks on the basis that I have foreshadowed that Senator Boswell will be speaking to the second part of the amendment. </PARA>

I know that Senator Kemp probably would not mind if that were done; however, I think it is something to be considered.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Apart from not objecting in principle to the sale of assets that the Australian people as a whole own to individual Australian people, one must consider that we are giving up yet another instrument to control the financial system and financial transactions in our economy. That is a continuing trend. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our government is quite happy, aided and abetted by the opposition, to hand our financial system to foreign speculators. The bill also facilitates the announced decision to provide the Development Bank with a capital injection and to relax the legislative constraints on its lending activities. It enables a capital injection of $30 million and a subsidy of $20 million per annum. What should be said about that is that the Development Bank is a fully owned subsidiary of the Commonwealth Bank, and one wonders whether the functions that this bank has as a lender of last resort&mdash;to provide mainly small to medium businesses with loans that they cannot otherwise get&mdash;would not now be substantially affected by the further sale of the Commonwealth Bank and by the relaxation of legislative constraints on its lending activities. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In debating this bill tonight, it takes me back to December 1990 when it was legislated that the first 30 per cent of the Commonwealth Bank was to be sold to finance the acquisition of the Victorian State Bank. Even then it was possible to see that that was simply a subterfuge to start the process of privatisation. As we showed at the time, the financing of the acquisition of the Victorian State Bank could have easily been achieved by other means. Exactly as we forecast then, creeping privatisation is now taking place. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I find it somewhat amazing that we are talking about national identity and that the opposition very strongly objects to dropping the monarch from our oath of allegiance because it feels that we should hang on to what is in our past.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"> It is quite clear that when the Commonwealth Bank was established it had certain objectives. Most of those objectives are still valid today. They relate to the setting of standards in the banking system rather than simply relying on regulation. Regulation has now been done away with; we no longer have that. We could still exert some influence on the standards of services provided by private banks by having, in competition with them, a bank that is obliged to look after the interests of the nation as a whole rather than private shareholders and speculators. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We should also say that this is a profitable enterprise. Why should we deprive taxpayers and citizens of Australia of an asset that is turning a profit? It was said by the previous speaker that we should look at where the $1,500 million that the government expects to raise is going. In our view, it would be advisable to have, say, a national development fund that could be used to lend funds to enterprises that require venture capital to provide jobs. However, what will happen is that this $1,500 million will simply be part of the current account arrangements and will disappear into a big black hole. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In December 1990 I had occasion to include in <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Hansard</EMPHASIS> a history of the Commonwealth Bank. Honourable senators will be pleased to hear that, in view of the time constraints tonight, I do not propose to recount that history in detail. However, I wish to advert to just one or two points which will indicate that we are indeed selling today part of the Australian people's birthright. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The origins of the Commonwealth Bank can be traced back to the economic disasters of the 1890s. In those days, the Labor platform contained a policy of establishing a national bank, although the specific purposes of the institution were defined later in history. The legendary King O'Malley led the call within the Labor Party to establish a commonwealth bank. This culminated at the federal conference of the Labor Party in July 1908. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among the objectives of the bank that was then established was to exempt from all fees the accounts of local government bodies, friendly societies, churches, charities, non-profit associations and state and Commonwealth government accounts. This is just an example of the policy objectives that can be pursued through a national bank that belongs to the people as a whole. But at this stage we are even asking the Industry Commission to look at charities to ensure that they turn a profit. I guess, if they do not turn a profit they should not be exempted from fees in the nation's bank!</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I might also mention as another historical vignette that the bank was instrumental in Billy Hughes's acquisition of a shipping line for the Australian government. To further Australia's interests, Hughes decided to create an Australian shipping line to sever our reliance on the British controlled fleet. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I turn to a question that I think is relevant to the consideration as to whether this bank should be placed on the market in the way in which it is being done. The suggestion was made that we are selling what is the property of the Australian community as a whole to individual Australian citizens. I would like the Minister representing the Treasurer, the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services (Senator McMullan), to point to the constraints in the bill we are debating today which might prevent the sale of part of the Commonwealth Bank to foreign interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is also interesting to note that the decision to sell the bank originated in an ALP caucus resolution of 28 August 1990 which sanctioned the legislation, subject to the undertaking by the then Treasurer, Mr Keating, that no further privatisation take place and that no sales to foreign interests take place. However, even then we were able to point to loopholes in the legislation that was then passed whereby both undertakings could be circumvented by the government of the day. Ostensibly, the sale to foreign interests was prohibited by the proposed section 27K. However, subsection 11 provides:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The issue of shares is not affected by the fact that the application for the issue was made in contravention of this section.</PARA>
<PARA>So, even then, the ground was laid for further privatisation and for the sale to foreign interests. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I believe that, for the reasons outlined, this is a further step down the slippery slope of financial irresponsibility and of abdicating the government's responsibility to control the financial system for the benefit of the Australian community as a whole.

The Commonwealth Banks Amendment Bill 1993 before the Senate reduces the government's equity in the Commonwealth Bank from the current 70 per cent to a minimum of 50.1 per cent. The bill also provides for a one-off capital injection plus an on-going subsidy to the Commonwealth Development Bank to expand its lending activities to small business. The charter of the Commonwealth Development Bank is also amended to allow it to meet the full credit requirements of its small business proprietors, instead of being confined to the role of provider of supplementary finance as at present.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The aborted sale of Qantas potentially left a huge hole in the federal government's finances, which had to be filled if this deficit was not to blow out beyond the already horrendous $16 billion or more that we have been saddled with during this financial year. As a result, the sale of the Commonwealth Bank has been brought forward to fill a gap which would otherwise have been left by the failure to sell Qantas. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government's handling of this further float&mdash;this is the second we have had&mdash;of equity in the Commonwealth Bank has been botched from the outset. The government has done an appalling job in providing the market with appropriate information on the structure of the sale, which has led to under-informed, if not misinformed, trading in trading bank shares. In fact, so little information has been provided by this government that the Australian Stock Exchange took the unusual step of requesting from the Minister for Finance, Mr Willis, further details of the structure of the proposed sale so that the market could be reasonably informed. In particular, there was the issue of what rights existing shareholders would have to the new share issue, which obviously has an impact on the price of existing shares in the marketplace. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The response from the Minister for Finance was to advise that the proposed offer structure had not yet been determined and that the government would advise the Stock Exchange of its structure in due course. Further, Labor's inability to supply these and other details had led to the market for CBA shares being driven by speculation and inadequate information. The directors of the bank have been put in a very difficult situation since they are contractually obliged to immediately disclose any information that is necessary to ensure an informed market in CBA shares. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Of more pertinent concern to me, though, is the manner in which the government has decided to sell the shares. The government has opted against a firm underwritten price. This represents a gamble that could affect many people&mdash;I speak in particular on behalf of the small investors&mdash;since the government plans to make up to 65 per cent of the offer open to retail investors, with the balance allocated to a bidding process by international investors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am not saying that the percentages are wrong. I think the government has got that sort of thing right. Minimums of 35 per cent for institutional investors and 20 per cent for firm allocations to broker clients have been set aside. Existing shareholders have a guaranteed priority to an allocation of $3,000 in shares. If all shareholders exercise this right, it will account for a further 35 per cent, leaving a minimum of only 10 per cent for new public investors. I welcome the fact that the small investor has been considered in such a way, but I think an examination of the process being used is needed. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The structure adopted is unusual and groundbreaking. The government has elected not to have a floor or cap price. I can understand that the government is probably seeking to minimise the opportunity for arbitrage, but once the price has been set the arbitrager will move in and by that stage the tender will have been closed. While it is theoretically possible to issue shares in this manner, without a floor&mdash;or a cap in this case&mdash;there is no indicated pricing of any kind. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned that the obtaining of a premium price could be a remote outcome. Retail investors will bid not on price but in terms of dollars that they are prepared to commit. They will only find out how many shares they will have at the end of the process. This may be deemed a clever process because many shareholders think in terms of how much they can afford to invest rather than the value that it will bring to them. The retail investor has been encouraged to invest by being guaranteed a discount on top of any discount in terms of the market procedure by the outcome of the institutional bidding. In the case of $25,000 or more, I think the 25c discount is somewhat unfortunate. If the government were prepared to offer that arrangement to the small investors, I would be quite happy with it. In his second reading speech, the Minister for the Arts and Administrative Services (Senator McMullan) said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . the amendments contained in this bill will benefit a wide cross-section of the Australian population. Taxpayers will benefit from the proceeds of the sale, while the wider Australian public has a further opportunity to buy shares in one of Australia's premier financial institutions.</PARA>
<PARA>There is no doubt that it is one of Australia's great financial institutions. We all recognise that it is a premier institution. I acknowledge that the government is very anxious to maximise its revenue from the sale of 19 per cent of its investment in the Commonwealth Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I hope I can get a response from the minister on this matter because it is concerning a lot of small investors. In setting the price, which basically will be determined at the peak of the market&mdash;I think it has crashed through the 2,000 barrier in recent days&mdash;in terms of the small shareholders, particularly those who cannot afford to take 25,000 shares and get a 25c discount, I ask that we be assured that there will be a sufficient differential between the issue price and the market price so that in the medium term, when a market correction which will inevitably occur does take place, small investors who do not really have access to professional advice will not suffer a capital loss. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Undoubtedly, the government felt that it might have set the last price a little too low. Shareholders did quite nicely. I want to make sure that it does not go to the other extreme and set the issue price so close to the market that, in terms of a market correction, all these small investors who have been lured by the premier investment opportunities that have been stated do not make a loss in the medium term. I believe that its long term holding will be quite satisfactory and it will be a good investment, but in the long term a lot of us will be dead. I would hate to think that a lot of the small investors who do not have the opportunities to access a lot of money were being misled as a result of this activity. I would be very happy if the minister drew attention to this fact. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am concerned at the bidding process by Australian international institutions effectively determining the price of the shares because these people can adjust the market to their own advantage. The other thing that I have some concerns with is a state government denial of revenue derived from such things as stamp duties as a result of this arrangement. The minister said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">To avoid these issues the bill provides that the sale of the shares in the Commonwealth Bank and related transactions to the sale are to be exempted from state and territory taxes and charges.</PARA>
<PARA>This is an aspect that I do not think will be particularly attractive to the states. I think it is my duty as an opposition senator to express some concern about this aspect of the legislation. I think it is an unfortunate clause to be included. Nevertheless, at the end of the day I look forward to shares in the Commonwealth Bank being widely held, particularly by staff of the bank and small investors. Anything that can be done to increase the spread of Commonwealth Bank shares amongst the Australian population is to be welcomed. I again ask the minister whether in his summing-up he could respond to the issues that I have raised, particularly the setting of the price. </PARA>

The bill provides a one-off capital injection of $30 million in 1993-94 to the Commonwealth Development Bank to expand its lending to small business and also gives the bank an ongoing annual subsidy of $20 million to assist primary industry and small business. These measures are to lift the capacity of the bank to service the small business community.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Due to the government's absolute failure to provide for small business, or any type of business for that matter, there were 16,800 bankruptcies last year, which was a record on a very high base the year before, which was a record on a very high base the year before that. Those sorts of statistics used to make headlines. Now they have become part of the overall mismanagement of the government. Very few small businesses are surviving. The ones that have gone through the mill because of the government's incompetence need all the assistance they can get. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The charter of the bank is to be extended to enable it to meet the full credit requirements of its business customers rather than to provide supplementary finance. There are 48,000 farmers, fishermen and small business people using the Commonwealth Development Bank as a last line of defence or a last lending institution. My concern is that, if the bank were able to provide full banking or credit facilities, it would be fundamental that the small business people, the farmers or the fishermen who were able to offer a first mortgage would be the people to receive the bank's first loans. The others&mdash;those who have a second and a third mortgage&mdash;would have to get in line. That has never been the case before. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What guarantees can we offer those 48,000 small businessmen and fishermen who have to have their requirements for top-up loans met? What other provisions are there to ensure that primary producers will have their banking needs met? Let me put the hypothetical example of two graziers applying for loans, one having a first mortgage on his property and asking for a top-up loan or a second or third mortgage from the Commonwealth Development Bank and the other able to offer the bank a first mortgage. It is probable that the bank would lend the second grazier the money&mdash;because he can offer the first mortgage. That is why Senator Campbell has moved the amendment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second part of the amendment he has moved is to ensure that the proposed changes to the charter of the Commonwealth Development Bank will not lead to the bank's moving away from its current role as a lender of last resort. That second reading amendment was moved in the lower house and I believe it was supported in the lower house. I am not quite sure whether that is the case. I hope the Democrats will support that amendment. I listened to Senator Spindler's contribution and I know he shares the concerns I am voicing now. </PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The manager of the development bank has given me his assurance that the bank will not be moving away from its original charter and that it will stand in that market as it always has, but with the addition of the $20 million annually and the $30 million injection that this bill will offer it. In fact, he explained to me that the bank will be able to provide a better service to the small business and farming community. I wish him well in that project. I think that gentleman was very genuine in telling me that is what he intends to do. Of course, if we lived in a perfect world that would probably happen, but when credit gets tight the person who has the best proposal to offer a bank obviously will get the limited funds that are available. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am very concerned that the change of charter could lead to the removal on the part of some people who use this bank of one of their last methods of finance. As a senator who represents the primary industry areas of Queensland and the small business community, I believe that I should put these concerns on record. The only thing I can do is ask the Senate to support this amendment. I believe it will serve to keep the bank in line when it observes that the parliament of Australia through this amendment wishes to see the bank sticking to its original charter. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The development bank has proved a very useful means of finance to the community that not only provides people with a living but much of Australia's export earnings.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to speak briefly on the Commonwealth Banks Amendment Bill 1993 and to perhaps tackle a couple of issues that my colleagues did not cover. I say initially that it was most useful for Senator Spindler to draw the attention of the chamber to the history of the Commonwealth Bank. I treasure Australia's history and I was pleased that Senator Spindler enlightened us once again on the history of this bank.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This is quite an historic occasion and indeed an historic bill. Who four or five years ago would have believed that the Labor Party would be presenting such a bill to this parliament? Senator McMullan is in the chamber and may well have been present for the Chifley speech in 1987. I know that Senator McMullan is interested in Australian political history and I am sure he will recall Mr Hawke saying then:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">What in the name of reason is the justification for breaking up and selling off the great and efficient national assets, like the Commonwealth Bank, Telecom, TAA and Qantas? As the people of Australia come to realise the extent of the economic and social vandalism proposed by our opponents. . .</PARA>
<PARA>The vandalism he was talking about of course was the selling off of the Commonwealth Bank, Australian Airlines and Qantas. In the rhetoric of the Labor Party, the true believers&mdash;they all get together and get rather excited about these things&mdash;Mr Hawke continued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . it will be necessary for us, Ben Chifley's great heirs and successors, to keep fresh and green the memory, the example and experience of this great Australian.</PARA>
<PARA>As recently as 1987 we on this side of the chamber were being attacked for proposing the very policy which the government has brought before this chamber this evening. Whereas I do not agree with the conclusion of Senator Spindler, he has at least been consistent in relation to privatisation. He is one of the sole surviving Marxists in any parliament in the world. Senator Spindler has been a great constant in our life in this parliament. He has opposed the selling of assets such as Qantas and the Commonwealth Bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We on our side all through the 1980s proposed that, in the interests of the Australian people, in the interests of service to Australians, it would be better for the Commonwealth Bank and indeed some of the other commercial assets that the government holds to be sold to the Australian people. But, no, the Australian Labor Party all through the 1980s said that this was social vandalism. It is quite an historic moment that this bill is brought before this parliament, not, I regret to say, by a Liberal and National party government but by a Labor government, so soon after the rhetoric of the Chifley lecture. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="WW4">Senator KEMP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Firstly, I will speak about the people Senator Chris Evans should be concerned about&mdash;the 8,000 people being retrenched by the Commonwealth Bank and the forced redundancies in Victoria that have occurred as a result of the merge of the Commonwealth Bank and the State Bank of Victoria. I have drawn attention to the great broken promise of the Labor Party in privatising the Commonwealth Bank. I happen to support that; nonetheless, one has to acknowledge that the Labor Party, once again, has reversed its history; it has done a 180 degree turn in supporting a policy which, in recent memory, it so vigorously opposed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have said this before and I will say it again: when the Commonwealth Bank and the State Bank of Victoria merged, assurances were given by Mrs Kirner and Mr Keating to the employees of the State Bank of Victoria. In a joint press release issued by Mrs Kirner and Mr Keating on 26 August 1990, Mrs Kirner said that clear undertakings had been received from the Commonwealth Bank that there would be no compulsory staff retrenchments resulting from the sale of the bank. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have raised this matter with bank officers in a Senate standing committee hearing and we have received replies. We know that that promise to State Bank employees in Victoria was not kept. I would hope that when the minister at the table, Senator McMullan, who is here this evening, responds, he can make it clear whether the promise that Mr Keating and Mrs Kirner made to the State Bank employees in Victoria was a promise which he will acknowledge in this chamber. Can Senator McMullan explain to us why that promise was not kept? Senator McMullan has been blessed this evening in the chamber with the great advantage of very good advisers. I hope he will seek that advice and that he will be able to answer that question. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue I wish to raise with Senator McMullan relates to yet another broken promise by Mr Keating. Not so long ago Mr Keating said that the time for large-scale retrenchments in industry had come to an end. Senator McMullan would remember that speech and I remember that speech. We learnt just after the election in April how convenient it was for the Commonwealth Bank to announce that 8,000 employees would be involved in the downsizing of the bank.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The issue of why the Commonwealth Bank board happened to delay that announcement until after the election was canvassed at a hearing of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration. Answers have been received&mdash;answers which I do not regard as satisfactory. We know that the Commonwealth Bank has a major retrenchment program. I do not dispute that, in view of the Commonwealth Bank becoming more competitive, it may have to retrench people. I draw the Senate's attention to the Prime Minister's complaint about private sector organisations downsizing. I would like Senator McMullan to seek advice on whether the announcement by the Commonwealth Bank of this massive downsizing program is in line with the policy announced by Mr Keating in a speech given two or three weeks after the election at the Institute of Directors. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final point I raise with Senator McMullan relates to a complaint made to me by a constituent. I stress again that not only am I in favour of this bill and the amendments that my colleagues have moved, but I believe that we should go the whole hog and privatise the bank. I want to make it clear where I stand on this issue; although I thank Senator Spindler for giving us the history of the bank, I differ on where the bank should go from here on out. I ask Senator McMullan whether he could seek advice on the propriety of Mr Willis writing to Commonwealth Bank shareholders outlining the offer of shares which the bank was making. A constituent of mine saw this as a politicisation of the share offer and thought that the independence of the Commonwealth Bank board may have been compromised by that. I would like Senator McMullan to address that issue. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In conclusion, Mr Acting Deputy President, I put it to you that the Labor government has brought before this parliament an historic bill. I will support the government on this bill. During the 1980s and early 1990s we on our side received from the Labor Party venomous, silly, overstated, exaggerated abuse. I can remember standing on the street outside a branch of the Commonwealth Bank in St Kilda where Commonwealth Bank officers were handing out how-to-vote cards; they were encouraging passers-by not to vote for the coalition because, would you believe, they felt that the coalition would privatise the bank. How poorly they were advised by the Labor government. The Commonwealth Bank officers were not the first to be misled by a Labor government and they will not be the last. It is a lesson they should recall. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The questions I put to Senator McMullan are, in summary: what was the nature of the promise that was given by Mr Keating regarding compulsory retrenchments? Was the joint press release of Mr Keating and Mrs Kirner saying that there would be no compulsory retrenchments as a result of the merger of the Commonwealth Bank and the State Bank an accurate reflection of the promise and commitment made? Is the 8,000-strong massive retrenchment program of the Commonwealth Bank in line with the policy Mr Keating announced at the Institute of Directors soon after the election? What is the propriety of Mr Willis making an offer to potential purchasers of shares, rather than the offer coming from the Commonwealth Bank board? Does the government feel this may have compromised the apparent independence of the Commonwealth Bank board?</PARA>

I do welcome the fact that, apart from him, there were thoughtful contributions on matters about which there are strong views in this place. They are different views, but they are strong and legitimate views. I think they were well debated on the principle and some questions of detail, particularly by Senator Watson.

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I just want to make two points in response to the amendment. It has been moved thoughtfully and it warrants the courtesy of a response. I want to reiterate that the government firmly believes that having at least 50 per cent of one of Australia's major banks in public hands remains a worthwhile matter of public policy. It has desirable consequences for prudential controls and customer service, and we intend to pursue that policy. It has been our policy for a long time. We intend to retain it. Therefore, we have no further plan to sell our holding below the level of a government majority. We intend not to do that. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Boswell, in particular, raised concern about the change to the Commonwealth Development Bank charter. I was not able to hear Senator Campbell's comments on that, although I understand from the nature of the amendment that he raised some similar issues. I do apologise to him that I did not pick up those things which he said on that debate, but I heard Senator Boswell speaking on it. I know that others expressed some concern. I think that the change to the Commonwealth Development Bank's charter is a significant plus for small business. It strengthens its capacity to provide the sort of assistance that is necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Once again, change does cause apprehension. This is a body that people have turned to. I am not sure I like the phrase `lender of</PARA>
<PARA>last resort'. It sounds a bit like certain faile Western Australians with whom I do not want to particularly make an analogy. I know the point that is being made. It is a place that you turn to when other institutions have not been able meet to your demands, and people do not want to see that capacity undermined. But it seems to me clear, although it is a proper concern to have and express, that the change to the charter does not change its current role as a lender of last resort. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The bill will enable the development bank to continue to provide funds to businesses which should not otherwise be able to obtain funds. But, in contrast to the existing legislation, it adds to that the capacity for the bank to provide the full financing requirement, rather than only part of the requirement, so it can actually provide more rather than less. Therefore, I think it is a positive for the Commonwealth Development Bank and for small business, and I think it is an appropriately structured way to do it. It is a matter everybody will want to keep an eye on, but I think it is a plus and a positive for both the bank and small business. I support the bill and oppose the amendment.

<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this Bill is to introduce amendments to the following Acts within the primary industries and energy portfolio&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals Act 1988 and the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Act 1992,</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987 and the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation Act 1987,</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Selection Committee Act 1984, and the Meat Research Corporation Act 1985,</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Dairy Produce Act 1986,</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Fisheries Legislation (Consequential Provisions) Act 1991 and the Fisheries Management Act 1991,</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989, the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991,</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Power Act 1949 and the Wheat Marketing Act 1989.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals amendments will enable the National Registration Authority to involve the public in determining the clearance of an agricultural or veterinary chemical product. The National Registration Authority's operations in respect of the clearance of chemical products are to be open and transparent and seen to be such. Similar provisions will also be included in the package of registration Bills to be introduced shortly and proposed to commence operation in July 1994.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The public's involvement will be facilitated by the National Registration Authority releasing a summary of its evaluation of a chemical product before making a determination. Also, the NRA will be able to seek the advice of certain organisations or persons by releasing confidential commercial information to assist in its evaluation of applications. However, precautions will be taken to ensure that trade secrets and certain information subject to possible commercial exploitation are safeguarded.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The National Registration Authority will be able to conduct public and private hearings for the purpose of obtaining comment on chemical products and will be required to notify the times and places for such hearings in daily newspapers throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Directors and staff of the National Registration Authority are exempt from suit in respect of the granting or refusal of clearance of a chemical product. These amendments will extend that exemption to the National Registration Authority itself.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Agricultural and Veterinary Chemicals (Administration) Act 1992 will enable the National Registration Authority to issue receipts in a more efficient manner and will enable the NRA to determine progressively conditions of service for staff transferred from the Public Service.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government has a commitment to remove all forms of discrimination in the formulation and administration of government policies and programs. One part of that commitment is removing the 65 year age limit which was imposed in many areas of public activity.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Australian Horticultural Corporation Act 1987 and the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation Act 1987 will remove the maximum age limits for members and executive directors of these bodies to ensure that the best available people can be appointed to positions in the Corporations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Government's decisions on a national ecologically sustainable development strategy require the incorporation of ESD principles and priorities into the normal activities of Government decision making and administration. Within the primary industries and energy portfolio, that incorporation process involves&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">the inclusion in enabling legislation of objectives focusing on ecologically sustainable development for research and development corporations;</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">ensuring that expertise in ecosystems management and conservation, as well as economic and social factors are taken into account when people are selected to serve on Corporation Boards; and</PARA>
<PARA LEFT-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2">requiring these bodies to take ESD principles into account in determining priorities for allocation of funds; to report ESD related research, development and demonstration in annual reports and to report progress in achieving all of the Corporation's objectives, including the new ESD objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Horticultural Research and Development Corporation Act 1987 already makes provisions for the Board to have expertise in environmental and social factors. The amendments in this Bill implement the other components of the Government's strategy for the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Australian Meat and Live-stock Industry Selection Committee Act 1984, the Horticultural Research and Development Corporation Act 1987, the Meat Research Corporation Act 1985 and the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 will achieve these objectives.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment to the Dairy Produce Act 1986  will remove any uncertainty about the operation of the arrangements under which manufacturers of exported dairy products currently receive market support payments which are financed by a levy on all milk production. On behalf of the Commonwealth the Australian Dairy Corporation administers the market support scheme which includes what is known as an `import offset' arrangement.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Under the arrangement recipients of market support payments must declare purchases of imported dairy products. When these are `like products' to a firm's exports, the firm is liable to pay the Corporation an amount equal to the market support payment on an equivalent volume of exports. In effect, payments are made on net exports rather than total exports.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of the import offset arrangement is to prevent companies from receiving market support payments on exported product (which would otherwise have been sold on the domestic market) and then importing the same type of product for domestic sale.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">If the arrangement is not enforceable, the Australian Dairy Corporation would be required to make payments on the gap between net and total exports (ie for the volume of imports) and in recent years the effectiveness of the market support scheme would have been reduced by between $1 million and $2 million each year.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Because of uncertainty concerning the basis of the import offset arrangement the Corporation has not applied the arrangement for the last two seasons. This legislation removes any uncertainty and allows the Corporation to proceed to apply the arrangement for 1991-92, 1992-93 and the remainder of the life of the market support scheme.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The International Dairy Federation's World Congress will provide Australian dairy producers with increased exposure to international technological developments, and allow them to develop closer working relationships with those at the forefront of the world dairy industry. Australian industry will have the opportunity to demonstrate that it is efficient and that there are positive effects from this Government's policy of reducing both assistance and trade distortions.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Minister for Primary Industries and Energy has agreed to allow the industry to use the Dairy Industry Fund to underwrite the World Congress. The Fund is presently used for Australian contributions to the International Dairy Federation, the organisation under whose auspices the World Dairy Congress is held. This Bill includes an amendment of the Dairy Produce Act 1986 to enable the use of the Industry Fund to underwrite the Australian hosting of the 1994 Congress.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is a long-standing agreement between Government and industry that $1 million would be made available to underwrite the Congress. It is expected that significant income will be obtained from sponsorships and other sources and that expenditure from the Dairy Industry Fund will eventually be reimbursed from Congress' proceeds.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendment to the Fisheries Legislation (Consequential Amendments) Act 1991 extends the period during which Part IVA of the Fisheries Act 1952 continues in force. Part IVA enables the Commonwealth to enter into arrangements with the States and Northern Territory to vary the jurisdictional arrangements for identified fisheries in accordance with the Offshore Constitutional Settlement. These provisions are complemented by State and Northern Territory legislation. Similar powers have been included in the new Fisheries Management Act 1991 but these provisions cannot commence until State and Territory legislation has been amended.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Initial expectations were that these changes would be finalised by 3 February 1994. This timetable has not been achieved. The amendments will extend the operation of Part IVA for an additional 12 month period to enable the necessary State and Territory legislation to be put in place. Part IVA of the Fisheries Act 1952 will be repealed when all complementary State and Territory legislation is in place.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Fisheries Management Act 1991 reflect the original intention that seasonal and other closures may be authorised under a Management Plan and provide greater flexibility in the type and number of fishing concessions a fisherman may hold.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Fisheries Management Act 1991 which commenced on 3 February 1992 provided the new Australian Fisheries Management Authority (AFMA) with a firm foundation to undertake the Commonwealth's fisheries management responsibilities. In particular the Act established a new system of Statutory Fishing Rights and provided for the making of Fishery Management Plans to be the primary instrument for managing Australia's commercial fisheries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Act provides general powers for AFMA to make Management Plans and create and issue various types of fishing concessions. The success of this approach relies on the certainty that Management Plans, rights issued in accordance with those Plans, and any other action taken under a Plan are fully supported by the law.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Recent legal advice indicates that the provisions of the Act may not fully support the level of flexibility needed to implement some fishery management arrangements. Rather than leave the issue uncertain and open to different interpretations, these amendments put beyond doubt the matters that may be included in a Plan.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Statutory Fishing Rights were created to give greater security to fishermen. For fishermen to have confidence in the arrangements there must be unambiguous provisions to support the issue and holding of the widest range of Statutory Fishing Rights that may be required under a Plan. Provision is made for a fisherman to hold a number of Statutory Fishing Rights as a discrete package of Rights which authorises a particular fishing activity. Examples are combinations of quotas to take various species of fish or specified combinations of fishing gear or boat characteristics such as size or engine power. Provision is also made for the smooth transition of existing fishing rights in fisheries subject to Management Plans, to the new Act.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Primary Industries and Energy Research and Development Act 1989 and the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991 are consequential to the establishment of the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation and the related forest industries research levy and charge Acts.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments reflect changed funding arrangements for the Corporation of $1 Commonwealth for every $2 from industry rather than the $1 for $1 currently provided in the Act. The basis of the changed funding arrangements for the Forest and Wood Products Research and Development Corporation arises from the structure of the industry&mdash;half the industry has a primary industry focus, while the other half has a manufacturing orientation. Commonwealth funding is intended to match the rural half of the industry contribution, consistent with arrangements for research and development in other rural industries.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments will also provide that revenue derived from charges under the Forest Industry Research Import Charge Act 1993 will be directed to research and development of relevance to the timber importing industry.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The amendments to the Primary Industries Levies and Charges Collection Act 1991 will enable the forest industries levies and charges to be collected under the same arrangements which apply to the collection of other primary industries levies and charges.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill also includes a minor amendment to the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Power Act 1949 to empower the Snowy Mountains Hydro-Electric Authority to invest surplus funds in specified classes of securities without the need to obtain prior Ministerial approval for each transaction. The amendment will avoid the delays which can occur while obtaining this approval and associated unnecessary losses. It furthers the Government's objective of reducing controls over day-to-day operations as part of its wider Government Business Enterprise reform to deliver best possible performance.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The main amendment to the Wheat Marketing Act 1989 is to correct an anomaly in the Act to ensure that it provides the necessary constitutional power for the States to confer functions on the Australian Wheat Board to allow it to conduct intra-state trade in grain and grain products. Changes are also being made to improve efficiencies in the operation of the Wheat Board.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Doubts had been raised as to whether the Commonwealth Act presently confers the necessary powers to enable the Wheat Board to conduct intra-state trade in any grains other than wheat even though State Acts have purported to confer those powers since the commencement of the revised wheat marketing arrangements on 1 July 1989. In order to validate the Wheat Board's intra-state grain trading operations these amendments will be made retrospective to that date.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The proposed amendments in other areas include provisions to allow the Wheat Board flexibility to make adjustments to pool return payments based on variety, quality, transport, storage and handling costs and other similar matters which are unable to be accurately specified in the delivery contract, so as to ensure that growers within a pool are treated fairly in respect of the wheat they deliver.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill also corrects a number of minor operational deficiencies which have been identified by the Wheat Board as restricting its commercial and pooling operations.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">I commend the Bill to Honourable Senators and I present the Explanatory Memorandum.</PARA>

<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL"><EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">The speech read as follows</EMPHASIS>&mdash;</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">This Bill is a machinery financing measure to enable certain defence expenditures to be met from the Loan Fund rather than the Consolidated Revenue Fund and to supplement the moneys available to the Consolidated Revenue Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Legally, expenditure from the Consolidated Revenue Fund cannot exceed the moneys available to that Fund. Successive Governments have adopted the practice of introducing a Loan Bill to authorise the issue of moneys from the Loan Fund to meet expenditure that have been appropriated by the Parliament, but for which insufficient funds are available in the Consolidated Revenue Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The purpose of this Bill is to make provision for the financing of the prospective deficit in the Consolidated Revenue Fund. The Budget deficit of $16 billion for 1993-94 gives rise to a prospective deficit in the Consolidated Revenue Fund about $7 billion higher. This situation arises because appropriations from that Fund include various items which are functionally classified as financing transactions rather than outlays, and thus do not affect the Budget outcome. These items include payments to the National Debt Sinking Fund to redeem or repurchase Commonwealth securities and superannuation payments made by the Commonwealth on behalf of public trading enterprises.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The Bill provides authority for the Loan Fund to meet defence expenditures incurred after the passage of the Bill that would otherwise have been met from the Consolidated Revenue Fund, and to supplement the Consolidated Revenue Fund so that it can meet its other commitments. The Bill also provides the authority to raise loans to cover these payments from the Loan Fund.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">Except for loan raising expenses, which are currently estimated at $13.4 million for 1993-94, the Bill does not authorise expenditures additional to those already appropriated, or currently before the Parliament. I emphasise that the Bill does not in any way impinge on the prerogative of the Parliament to appropriate moneys, but simply provides the means to finance expenditures previously approved and appropriated by the Parliament.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;During question time today I asked Senator Cook some questions in relation to the hearings of Estimates Committee A which examined the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service. I asked those questions because there is grave concern about what is happening in AQIS and with the management of AQIS. Senator Brownhill and I and other honourable senators, such as Senator Boswell and other members of the committee&mdash;I notice that Senator Crane is in the chamber, as is Senator Panizza, who has taken an interest in AQIS in the past&mdash;are all very concerned about what is happening in terms of management and accountability.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Brownhill and I raised particular criticisms in relation to AQIS which can be summarised as accountability and scrutiny. There is a clear obligation on us in this place to ensure that public administration gives the taxpayers value for their tax paying dollar. Section 27 of the Public Service Act sets out very clearly that the Public Service Board must devise `means for effecting economies and promoting efficiency in the management and working of departments'. It also says:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">All officers who incur or authorise expenditure shall exercise due economy.</PARA>
<PARA>These are lofty sentiments which we hope the Public Service abides by. Senator Brownhill and I have been attempting to ascertain whether this has happened in the case of AQIS&mdash;a government department operating on full cost recovery from its users, who are mainly farmers or those involved in the processing of primary industry products. Our attention was drawn to the matter because recently there have been two separate audit reports relating to AQIS activities and both have found inefficiencies and unsatisfactory management practices. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Our interest was further heightened when an internal review of AQIS SES travel, albeit one that was considerably more curtailed than envisaged by those who commissioned it, discovered numerous irregularities and other actions which are contrary to the terms of the Public Service Act involving the senior executive service within AQIS. For some reason that we simply have been unable to discover, this review was wound up with only nine months travel activity monitored, despite discovering hundreds of instances of prima facie irregularities and breaches of the rules. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The progress report of the initial review stated:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">With AQIS's move to commercialisation and with full cost recovery a reality for industry we need to know what the actual costs of travel are.</PARA>
<PARA>It went on to say:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is overwhelming evidence to suggest that the handling of payments, acquittals . . . general record keeping . . . is woefully deficient.</PARA>
<PARA>Surprisingly, however, at the estimates hearing and in light of those statements, we found that there is no budget for travel within AQIS. Coming on top of the statement about woefully deficient record keeping, this is of great concern. The irregularities include&mdash;I list these for the benefit of the Senate&mdash;travel without authorisation, authorisation for travel by officers when they are not in Canberra to do so or when they are overseas on the date on which they are supposed to be signing the authorisation, officers appearing not to have been where their travel documentation says they were, and overuse of mobile phones for personal use. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The final draft of the management review suggested that there was `serious and consistent obtaining of benefits to which recipients are not entitled'. It went on to say that there is `lack of management' and `consistent disregard for the Secretary's instruction'. It detailed extensively the breaches&mdash;major and minor&mdash;of every SES officer. It produced various drafts to chart usage and it produced travel summaries. The review concluded:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">There is overwhelming evidence to suggest that the handling of payments, acquittal . . . general record keeping and accessibility to these records is extremely deficient.</PARA>
<PARA>It noted that one officer's travel records could not be ascertained for most of the nine months that were examined for the simple reason that the Mastercard files were missing. It noted that the weekly report to the secretary to the department of AQIS SES movements omitted, on a regular basis, details of overseas trips of some weeks duration involving several officers. It noted the frequent occurrences of travel remaining unauthorised or being authorised subsequent to the travel. That is not supposed to happen. It noted such things as the head of the service spending 46 per cent of his time travelling outside the office. It noted that this same officer requested his travel documents back from the review team during its review and it is suggested that he altered them&mdash;or persons altered them on his behalf&mdash;on several occasions. They are very serious matters. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The review noted that one officer undertook a private trip to Dublin after an authorised visit to North and South America and there was no documentation on file to authorise the change, although the travel allowance was calculated to match the revised schedule. That is rather strange. Neither was this additional leg of the trip notified to the secretary, as is required in the guidelines. The same officer had repeated instances of claiming for taxis in cities he was no longer in or claiming airport parking fees when he took a taxi to the airport. This is the same officer who had no Mastercard files for any period after June 1991. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We also saw evidence of a senior officer soliciting money from the private sector to attend an overseas conference for which he was quite happy to admit he had no automatic entitlement for financial assistance from AQIS. Yet it also appears that he subsequently did attend, on pay, and claimed travelling allowance. The review recommended that the SES officers have their travel benefits independently investigated. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">At the same time as this internal review was being conducted, another unit of AQIS&mdash;the internal investigations unit&mdash;was also asked to look at SES use of Commonwealth plated cars and domestic travel. This internal investigation team also experienced difficulties with SES officers removing original travel documentation and returning it amended. I understand that there is substantial evidence to show the documents before and after they were removed, and they are not one and the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The internal investigation unit submitted a progress report on its assignment, saying:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . suffice to say that at this point we have established examples of administrative irregularities and what I would term blatant criminal fraud.</PARA>
<PARA>That is a fairly serious allegation. I asked the author of that document whether he still stood by those comments and he said that he did. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Subsequent to this progress report being submitted&mdash;this is an important point&mdash;the unit experienced difficulty in having its authorised officer status maintained. Indeed, it had an officer removed from the unit&mdash;there were only three officers in the unit to start off with&mdash;notwithstanding that it had a number of assignments to undertake, requiring full staffing capacity. The officer who was removed was the linchpin of the unit because he had 22 years of investigative experience with the Australian Federal Police. The words that we heard from the head of the internal investigations unit at the hearings was that it emasculated the unit. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The head of the unit complained about those restrictions but, unfortunately, to no avail. It appears that there was an internal departmental review of the methodology and findings of the travel review but it has not been sighted. The secretary to the department then appointed another authorised officer from outside the service to investigate the issue of SES travel irregularities. This officer then proceeded to undertake this review, accepting written documentation from officers without ever accessing the original travel documentation to ascertain their veracity. He concluded that there were no indications of irregularities. He argued:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . misconduct should only be construed if officers make significant personal financial gains from failing to comply with travel conditions.</PARA>
<PARA>I will come back to that in a minute. I suggest that what he wrote is a personal interpretation, his own view, which is not based on any departmental ruling, and it is quite simply wrong. It is wrong in law and, more importantly, it is wrong in the practice of that service. It fails to take into consideration the necessity for senior officers to adhere to a standard of professional care and skill, as outlined in the discipline manual. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It has been put to me that there are numerous flaws in the analysis that that review officer did. That analysis, the findings and the way in which the SES officers were treated are hypocritical when one recalls that the same department&mdash;that is, the Department of Primary Industries and Energy, because AQIS is an outrider of that department&mdash;took a junior officer to the Magistrates Court in Canberra in September 1991, which is the same time these irregularities were supposed to be taking place, and prosecuted her for altering a sick leave form for a personal financial benefit $71.83. As far as the quarantine service is concerned, it seems that all animals are equal, but some animals are more equal than others. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The officer suggested that the officers who undertook the original travel management review were at fault and that they had denied natural justice to those they had examined. This is a bit of a furphy because they were asked to do an investigation and go through the documentation. They were not making allegations; it was not a trial. They were outlining what had happened and what they had found. The comment made by that officer was very strange, as far as I am concerned. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I do not know why or how this authorised senior officer came to the conclusions he did; I also do not know why the officer who came home from Washington via Dublin did not have his travel plans authorised. I do not know why this same officer's Mastercard files are missing. At the last estimates hearings we tried to find out&mdash;goodness knows we tried! We provided a forum for those officers to defend themselves, but the minister denied them that opportunity by refusing to allow them to answer questions and by refusing us the opportunity to ask them questions, and that is very important. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Natural justice has been denied, but not by us or the review team, as the minister has accused in the estimates hearings; it has been denied by the minister himself. Public interest has been denied by not allowing the chamber to undertake a thorough review of what appears to be a most unsatisfactory situation, a situation that appears to have continued for some time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As I pointed out in question time today, contrary to the assertions of the minister, the Australian National Audit Office did not give AQIS a clean bill of health. In fact, the evidence we had that morning was that the Australian National Audit Office did not find it satisfactory at all. The officers of the Australian National Audit Office were not happy with the task that they had been given. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What is the department and the minister trying to hide? The public has a right to know why the original review was cut short in what the minister himself admits was the review's infancy and why AQIS's internal investigations unit was gutted to render it ineffective. We need to know why and how the authorised officer came to make two reports which were not released and which contained all the hallmarks of either innocence or possibly fraudulent negligence. We need to examine the implications of the audit report and ascertain why the cases of misconduct have not been proceeded with. I remind honourable senators of that junior officer who altered her personal sick leave form for a personal financial benefit $71.83 and who ended up in the Magistrates Court. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">AQIS is about to embark on a major rationalisation of staff. It is an overdue clean-out of a department that has for far too long drained the public purse. But how can any department tell its workers that they need to become more efficient when the officers at the very top, the officers who are directing that efficiency, are failing to adhere to the department's or the service's own guidelines? How can the department move to full cost recovery when it does not even know how much it should be spending on travel and when it apparently does not even care whether or not the travel is approved?</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I remind honourable senators that, unless we scrutinise this department, the people who pay the cost&mdash;the users&mdash;have no say at all. We have user-pays, but we do not have user-says. We are dealing here with public money in a department that bases its charges and costs on full recovery from the rural sector. It does not base its charges and costs on what that sector can afford to pay; rather it bases them on the amount it needs to rake in to meet the costs of things that it wants to spend its money on. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We are dealing here with very senior levels of the Public Service who, like Caesar, think they should be above reproach. All we have sought to do is ascertain whether there is any substance to the irregularities that have been uncovered by the original review. We are talking about integrity and principle. Indeed, it is our job and our obligation as senators to ensure that the interests of our constituents are being served and that the costs they incur in dealing with this department are fair and equitable. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have in my possession many documents which I could table that go into much detail about those travel irregularities. Do not let it be said that I am denying anybody natural justice. I have pages and pages of documents which list name after name. They were not tabled in the estimates hearing and at this point in time I will not table them here in this chamber. But honourable senators can see this weighty tome. There is a proper place for this to be discussed and I believe it should be at the supplementary hearings of the estimates committee. The officers should have the opportunity to answer for themselves. If not, it must be properly addressed in another committee at another place. That is why I am withholding these documents. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are, however, documents that I seek the leave of the Senate to table, and they are as follows: an AQIS progress report on review of AQIS travel in 1991-92, which is AQIS minute dated 3 November 1992, authored by K. Rush and S. O'Shea; the AQIS executive board meeting number: review of AQIS travel by K. Rush, which is undated; the AQIS SES travel review minute to Mr Core, the Acting Secretary to the Department, authored by Rush, O'Shea and Jones, which is some 19 pages plus attachments and dated 12 March 1993; the AQIS executive board agenda item 5 meeting 2/93: travel review 19 March 1993 cover page, which is seven pages plus financial management instruction; and, finally, a letter to Mr Ken Murphie of the Cold Storage Association from Mr P.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;This afternoon, while I was absent from the Senate on other duties, a bill dealing with the wine tax was debated. I am very keen to have placed briefly on the record my concern about this legislation because it would stand to have a major effect on the fledgling wine industry in Tasmania, which is the state I represent.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I draw to the Senate's attention the fact that about 40 to 50 wineries have been set up in Tasmania in the past 30 years, many of them in very recent years. About $9 million worth of wine is produced in a year at wholesale value and the retail value of that wine is about $15 million. About three-quarters of the wine is sold in Tasmania, about 20 per cent is sold to the mainland and about five per cent is exported. So it is a very fledgling export industry, but it has great potential for the future. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The wine industry certainly already has great significance for Tasmanian tourism and the hospitality industries, because it complements the image which Tasmania has built up so carefully in recent years in the production of fine foods. Fine wines go very well with fine foods when it comes to selling an image of quality for Tasmania. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There are around 100 full-time staff and between 300 and 400 casual and part-time employees in the industry in Tasmania. The important thing to remember is that most of those workers are in rural areas where we already have high unemployment. In some parts of Tasmania, youth unemployment is around 40 per cent. If this legislation were to go through, the impact of these extra job losses on Tasmania would be horrific. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is ironic that the secretary of the ACTU, Mr Kelty, was in Tasmania only last week looking at issues of regional development, employment and unemployment. At the same time the federal government is wilfully trying to put measures in place which will throw another 300, 400 or 500 people out of work. It is beyond belief that on the one hand it could do one thing and on the other quite the opposite. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This proposed tax increase would affect Tasmania more than almost any other state, as our wines are very expensive because they are produced on a small scale. If ever the term `boutique wine' were correct, it certainly is correct in relation to most of the wineries in my state. This proposed tax hike would put between $1.50 and $2.50 on top of bottle shop prices. It is just beyond the pale for people to expect to pay that for wines that are already pretty expensive for proper reasons. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The industry is really very aware of the price barriers. Wines are already being carefully priced according to those barriers. The problem for the industry is that the increase would push the purchasing price over the top and Tasmanian wines would be left on the shelf. As I said earlier, it is a fledgling industry that is capital intensive and no one vineyard yet has its business stabilised. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The national estimate of the effect of the tax is a sales drop of 15 per cent, but we believe that in Tasmania that would probably be higher. I believe that no vineyard in Tasmania could cope with that effect. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The government has argued that winegrowers should develop the export market, but I believe that at this stage that is a dream for Tasmania. As I have said already, only five per cent of our wines are exported and growers are not yet in a financial position to develop an overseas market. It is early days yet for  most  of  them,  much  as  they might like to do so when they get on a firmer footing. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We must remember that it takes about seven years to sell wine from this year's cuttings. The government's argument that wine should be taxed at the same rate as lemonade is quite ridiculous. It is an insult to the people who are trying to produce quality wines. We all know that lemonade and beer are produced today and can be sold tomorrow. That is quite irrelevant to the economics and the realities of the wine industry. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">We have huge potential in Tasmania for a fine wine industry, including an export push at the proper time. But this wine tax would have killed off this potential. We must remember that the people who have gone into these vineyards and wineries have put all their savings, hopes and dreams into a fine wine industry in our state. They should be supported, not thwarted. I urge the government to accept the will of the people as evidenced in the Senate vote today. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Unfortunately, the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) has threatened the imposition of an excise if this bill were to be rejected by the Senate. That threat is disgraceful and intimidatory. The opposition is committed to rejecting that excise if the Treasurer proceeds with his obscene threat. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Earlier tonight the Senate effectively defeated the 55 per cent wine tax hike by returning it to the other place with the request that it be removed from the sales tax bills. I want to raise a couple of issues which I hope the members in the other place will carefully consider in dealing with that request and, it is to be hoped, accepting it. I refer to the issues of tax equity and international competitiveness.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the face of overwhelming evidence of the detrimental effect on the wine industry of an extra 55 per cent increase in sales tax on its investment, employment potential and export growth, the only defence which the government can offer, apart from shonky figures and analysis, is the need for tax equity. But unlike the federal Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), the wine industry knows its grapes. It knows that the Treasurer's rationale for the 55 per cent tax hike is unfounded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Among the fanciful claims to support the Treasurer's view that tax equity demands this impost occur are as follows. There is the claim that Penfolds Grange Hermitage be taxed at the same rate as lemonade; that the previous tax structure discriminates against other alcoholic beverages; that the previous structure ignores the pre-eminent turnover and employment position of the brewing industry; and that it ignores the socioeconomic consumption patterns regarding different alcoholic beverages. All these claims are false and have been shown and demonstrated to be such by the wine industry in publicly available evidence, of which the government must be well aware. The facts to support the Treasurer are very scarce on the ground, as indeed will be new vineyards if the government, with its majority in the other place, persists with this tax. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The theory of tax equity requires that like industries bear similar tax imposts. To say that wine should be taxed at similar levels to brandy, beer or spirits begs the question as to whether they are indeed like industries. They all produce alcoholic beverages, but a logical comparison beyond that suggests that they are not the same. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The beer industry relies on raw materials with short production lead times. Crops, such as barley and hops, are sown and reaped on an annual basis. Beer is comprised mostly of water to which those raw materials are added. The raw materials of spirits are essentially waste products. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In contrast, grapevines, the raw material source  for  wine,  require  up to  seven years from planting to adequate grape produc</PARA>
<PARA>tion. So the supply tap cannot be turned on and off annually at the whim of government tax policy without doing severe damage to grape growers, not to mention winemakers. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Another contrast is that beer production is essentially big business, with some exceptions, such as Coopers in South Australia. Wine production is essentially through many small businesses, although there are again some big business exceptions. But by and large, on the one hand, breweries are big business and, on the other hand, wineries are small business. So these and other differences destroy the tax equity arguments. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">The second issue of importance to the wine industry is international competitiveness. This Keating Labor government talks repetitively and quite correctly about the need for Australia to become internationally competitive. But in reality it only gives lip-service to the creation of that competitiveness. International competitiveness is not just about having product competition in the domestic market, better investment and better labour productivity and so on; it is also about having an internationally competitive tax system. The government has steadfastly refused to establish this. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Senate. All these countries, with the exception of France, completely exempt wine from excise. French excise on wine represents only 0.3 per cent of the excise on spirits. Even value added tax, which like a GST is uniformly applied at retail level, is less for wine in a number of these countries. This reinforces the argument that a wholesale sales tax, which already in Australia applies to different goods at different rates, at the wholesale stage in Australia should most definitely give preference to wine. Reference to this table clearly shows the strong preference given to wine by our competitors in the international marketplace.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In these countries wine gets far better tax treatment than in Australia with our pre-budget tax structure, let alone what it will become under the tax hike rejected today in the Senate. Quite simply, every successful wine exporting country treats the industry preferentially, as against other alcoholic beverages, in terms of taxation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">On the other hand, countries which fail to do this have destroyed the export potential of their industry. New Zealand is a prime example of this. Investment and expansion for export has dried up since New Zealand changed its tax structures to bring so-called equity between alcoholic beverages. Its export potential has not been realised as a direct consequence of this. It is one of the few areas where New Zealand has ignored international best practice and, in contrast to its resultant success with other commodities and products, it has suffered the consequences. So international best practice and competition demand that this tax hike be rejected, and I trust that members in the other place will see the wisdom of the Senate's decision this evening. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Before concluding, I wish to turn my attention to the consequences of the legislation passed today to correct anomalies in the motor vehicle import by-laws to prevent certain vehicle importers reclaiming duty paid and, therefore, contrary to the intent of the government's motor vehicle plan, effectively allowing vehicles in duty free. As my colleague Senator Ferguson indicated during the lunch time debate on this legislation, the opposition reluctantly accepted it, despite its retrospective features, to protect the integrity of the car plan. However, we are highly critical of the sloppy drafting of earlier regulations which made it necessary. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I wish to draw attention to certain consequences that will arise now that legislation has been passed. Senator Schacht commented earlier that he still did not have a response from the Minister for Finance, Mr Willis, regarding the refund of application fees to the companies which lodged applications for customs duty refunds. The government's steadfast refusal, prior to the correction of the anomaly by today's legislation being passed, to refund these fees is unacceptable. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="FF4">Senator CHAPMAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Under the by-law provisions each application for a refund of duty requires a lodgment fee of $200 from the applicant. All companies which have sought refunds under this loophole have therefore paid to the government $200 for each and every separate application.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the case of Volvo, the major applicant, it has lodged 271 applications costing it $54,200. While we accept the retrospective closing of the loophole to deny it some $10 million in duty refunds, I believe it is unacceptable that Volvo should be financially penalised for lodging applications under the law as it stood prior to this amendment. While on this occasion we accept action being taken to prevent the company obtaining an unintended windfall gain of $10 million, we do not accept that it should lose $54,200 in application fees.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Had the by-law been correctly written at the time Volvo imported these vehicles, it would never have lodged the refund application and paid $54,200 in lodgment fees. Volvo is therefore morally entitled to a refund of these lodgment fees. As the minister interjected a few moments ago, there is no provision in the existing legislation for these fees to be refunded. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I am pleased that on a unanimous multiparty basis, the Senate standing committee that examined this legislation, prior to its passage in the Senate earlier today, recommended that an ex gratia payment be made to all applicants refunding their lodgment fees. I also welcome Minister Schacht's acquiescence in agreeing to approach the Minister for Finance to provide that ex gratia payment. However, I regret that as yet, as he indicated today, he does not have a response from the Minister for Finance to that request. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is essential that Minister Willis agree to Minister Schacht's request. If he refuses, the passage of this legislation today will not only leave a very sour taste in the mouth of the opposition but also, I believe, of all members of the Senate committee who unanimously passed that recommendation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to raise a further concern which came to light with regard to the car plan in evidence to the committee hearing. It was claimed by a witness that further loopholes exist in the by-laws allowing any manufacturer to import vehicles duty free, virtually without limit. Customs officials denied this, so clarification was sought. However, Minister Schacht's subsequent letter providing this clarification in effect confirms the claim of the witness. The relevant part of the minister's letter said:</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">The volume of goods imported by the participants under its determination is monitored by plan administration,</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . As volume entitlements are reached, participants voluntarily discontinue imports under the determination in accordance with agreed plan arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA FONT-SIZE="-=2">. . . The plan administration audits volumes regularly and may revoke determinations should the voluntary discontinuance referred to above not occur.</PARA>
<PARA>In other words, the volume of duty free imports allowed to a manufacturer is not directly controlled by the by-laws. It is a voluntary action by the manufacturer undertaking such imports. If the volume imported exceeded the duty free entitlement under the export credits accrued, the only action the government could take would be to revoke the determination allowing those imports. That is, a further initiative is required by the government to prevent such an occurrence. We cannot rely on the immediate effect of law. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">This raises the question: what if a manufacturer decided it no longer required the benefit of that determination for whatever reason it might have? Without the certainty of law, what is to prevent it importing vehicles duty free, willy-nilly and then subsequently being willing to sacrifice its determination. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Under the present voluntary arrangements, the government is at best relying on the goodwill of manufacturers and, at worst, its own capacity to blackmail them to control duty free imports. In the light of the experience surrounding the need for the legislation that was passed today, this is hardly acceptable. I believe the government should take a long hard look at this situation. I warn the minister that the government should not come back to the Senate again with another piece of retrospective legislation&mdash;relating to the by-law anomaly that was corrected today&mdash;and seek the opposition's support if a problem emerges with regard to this issue that I have raised in the latter part of remarks. Given the experience we have had and given the warning given to the government, it would be very hard pressed to gain our support. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I want to make a few remarks tonight. It may be coincidental that I am the duty minister when issues relating to customs are raised by a number of speakers and I will respond to those in a moment. Before I do, in my capacity as Minister for Science and Small Business, I want to comment on statements made by the shadow minister for science, Dr Kemp, during a debate in the House of Representatives yesterday and also in a press release that he issued today.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">First of all, in a debate yesterday in the House of Representatives, Dr Kemp used most of his time to attack me in my role as minister for science. That is fair enough; it is a political forum; and if you dish it out, you have to be willing to take it, so I am not worrying too much about that.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Dr Kemp said that he had visited the Australian Institute of Marine Science in Townsville and that he was impressed with the work of AIMS. He commented on the excellent work of AIMS and said that it should continue, and commented on the structure that I had proposed back in July, which is now being assessed by the committee chaired by Mr Ken McKinnon. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">What I find most interesting is that after this visit, Dr Kemp is laudatory in his comments about the work of AIMS as a stand-alone institute operating in the tropical areas of Australia. I am very pleased he recognises that but what I find astonishing is that in March of this year during the federal election campaign it was coalition policy to merge AIMS with the James Cook University in Townsville. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">It is quite clear that Dr Kemp&mdash;who may not have been the shadow minister for science, but who was a frontbencher in that period&mdash;was not aware of the excellent work of AIMS and was proposing that it be merged with James Cook University. I am very pleased that he now recognises the value of the work done by AIMS. I have never said anything on the record other than that I have always been very impressed with its work. I have also been very impressed with the work of the CSIRO divisions of oceanography and fisheries based in Hobart.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I also want to refer to a statement issued tonight by Dr Kemp on the summary report that I tabled yesterday on behalf of ASTEC entitled <EMPHASIS FONT-SLANT="ITAL">Research and Technology in Tropical Australia</EMPHASIS>. After making some comments about the report, Dr Kemp cannot help but turn most of the press statement into a diatribe against me as minister for science and my performance. Again, that does not particularly worry me. However, I do want to point out an absolute error in his statement that he continues to perpetrate, despite the fact that I have never said it. In his statement Dr Kemp claims:</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">During my recent visit to major centres for tropical marine research in Townsville, there was concern expressed about the possibility that tropical R&amp;D could be "lost" in a new institute, particularly if it were located in Adelaide or Perth as Senator Schacht has suggested.</PARA>
<PARA>I have never suggested any such thing. I have been on the public record from early July of this year saying that I do not support any such institute having its headquarters in Adelaide or Perth. If a new institute were created, the board would make that decision. I would have thought that it would decide that the headquarters of such an institute would be either in Townsville or Hobart where most of the infrastructure for that new institute would be. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">There is nothing on the public record that I have ever suggested that I am supporting this new proposal only on the basis that its headquarters would be based in Adelaide. This is typical of the ranting of Dr Kemp on these issues. As I say, earlier this year he had no compunction in proposing that AIMS should be merged with the James Cook University&mdash;it was just announced by the opposition; now it is recognised that AIMS is an excellent body after he has at least visited the organisation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now want to turn to the customs issues raised here tonight. First, I turn to the speech made by Senator Chapman on the amendment to the Customs Tariff (Deficit Reduction) Bill dealing with retrospective legislation to close off a possible loophole that could have ended the export enhancement program for the car industry. I emphasise `possible loophole'. We in government never conceded that that loophole automatically meant the outcome that was claimed; that is, that people could import cars into Australia without paying a tariff. We did concede in the estimates hearing that there was a chance that if the legislation went to the courts and ultimately to the High Court it could rule against us. No matter how small that risk was, we as a government were not going to put at risk that excellent program and policy for the car industry in Australia. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">In the debate today, I listed most of the major car manufacturers in Australia who supported us with this retrospective legislation because they understood that an excellent car industry plan would be put at risk if there was not this retrospective legislation. They themselves were willing to play by the general rules, by the policy as it was announced some years ago by Senator Button. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chapman raised the issue of a possible further loophole and says that the way it is operating is awkward&mdash;I suppose that is the best way to describe it&mdash;and unclear.<TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I would agree with Senator Chapman that there is an element of goodwill in the operation of the car industry plan with the major manufacturers, but they have given no indication other than their goodwill in the operation of that plan. It is true that if that goodwill does come to an end and someone tries to, as Senator Chapman says, break the rules we can revoke it with a determination of legal matters, which I am not an expert in. That is probably a clumsy way to have it drafted. <TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">As always on legal matters, I will take further advice. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chapman quoted my letter that I sent to him as a result of the hearing. I will again ask the legal section of the Customs Department to have a look at that particular matter. I suspect that the answer will be the same, but this is a legitimate issue to be raised&mdash;no-one wants to have to deal with closing of loopholes and retrospective legislation. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I have to say, whoever is the government of the day, sooner or later Senator Chapman will discover, if he is ever a minister, that he will probably have to front up with some retrospective legislation to cover an unforeseen error&mdash;not done maliciously or malevolently, but an honest mistake. It is good government to cover those mistakes and repair them. I do not think we ought to expect that we can just let that mistake last so that some people get an unnecessary advantage at the expense of the rest of the community. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Senator Chapman also mentioned the issue of the ex gratia payment made to the agents for Volvo of over $50,000, and, I think, one other company. I have written to the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) who is the only one who has the power to make an ex gratia payment. I have not received an answer the reason being, as I understand it, that investigating an ex gratia payment takes some time. I am sure Senator Chapman would not want us to rush in and establish an unfortunate precedent or make an error about the way we establish an ex gratia payment. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I assure Senator Chapman that I will monitor the progress of dealing with the issue of the ex gratia payment. As I have indicated, I believe such a payment is fair. I said that to the committee after we debated the issue in the hearing and I have said it here in the parliament as well. I hope that we can come back with good news. I do not think it will be as quickly as Senator Chapman would like, or obviously as Volvo would like, because I understand these things take some time. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I now turn to the issue raised by Senator Bishop regarding customs and the famous&mdash;infamous, notorious or whatever honourable senators want to call it&mdash;long, exasperating saga of Midford Paramount and the Australian Customs Service. I have already spoken briefly in this chamber about this case and about the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts which was tabled in December last year. I have said before in this chamber that I may be one of the very few senators who has actually read the whole 600 pages of that report. Three weeks into the job as minister, I spent the whole of my Easter this year reading the whole of that report. As a result I have had lengthy discussions with the customs officials over many hours, going through one by one not only the recommendations of the report but also the descriptions in the report about what happened in that case according to the public accounts committee. </PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">I think Senator Bishop would acknowledge that we have now tabled in the parliament the recommendations&mdash;I think there are 130 of them&mdash;that have been accepted by the government as far as administrative procedures are concerned. I anticipate that there will be amendments coming into the parliament in the next sittings to alter the Customs Act in a number of areas&mdash;again as a result of the government's acceptance of some of those recommendations in the Midford report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts. I have noted before that that report was supported by both sides of the public accounts committee. I think it has been acknowledged that this is not a majority and minority report; it is a bipartisan unanimous report. That fact certainly carried considerable weight in my mind when I read the report. </PARA>

It is leading the world in the introduction of electronic technology and removal of unnecessary paperwork. The Compile system is still being developed. It still has some teething problems. We recently adopted optional port of lodgment, with some controversy; some custom brokers completely opposed it.

I appreciate that this has taken longer than anticipated.

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="ZW4">Senator Sherry</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(1) The Commonwealth has approved an allocation of $16 million for the establishment of around 8,000 hectares of eucalypt plantations in Tasmania on both Crown and private land. This is part of the $50 million Helsham structural adjustment package agreed by the Commonwealth and Tasmanian Governments under the 1988 Heads of Agreement following the World Heritage Listing of certain Tasmanian forest areas. It is important to note that a key objective of this package was to enable Tasmania to replace resources which were withdrawn as a result of the World Heritage listing and the agreement specifically included provision for this plantation program. To date, some $4.957 million has been provided to Tasmania for specific activities relating to this project. All plantations established to date are located on Crown land.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(2) The funds are to be used for the establishment of eucalypt plantations in Tasmania, consistent with the intent of the Heads of Agreement. Financial and administrative conditions for the use of the funds are set out in an intergovernmental funding agreement between the two Governments which includes all projects funded under the Helsham package.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">Where plantations are to be established on forested land to be logged as part of the Tasmanian Forestry Commission's (TFC) normal operations, the approval of the Minister for Resources is required where this involves export woodchip operations. This is done on an annual basis as part of the Minister's normal consideration of woodchip export licences and in making his decisions, he is subject to the Commonwealth legislative obligations outlined in the response to Question 3 below.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">For its part, the TFC is required to adhere to the State's Forest Practices Code which provides a set of standards to protect environmental values during forest operations.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">(3) The Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974, the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975 and the Endangered Species Protection Act 1992 impose obligations on a Commonwealth Minister relating to avoiding or minimising the impact of activities which would adversely affect the environment, a national estate area or an endangered species, respectively. As noted above, of particular relevance to the Minister for Resources is the obligation imposed in the consideration of proposals for the export of unprocessed wood under the Export Control Act 1982.</PARA>
<PARA FIRST-INDENT="16" FONT-SIZE="-=2"><TAB LEADING="NONE" TYPE="NORMAL">To date no plantations under this project have been established in national estate and advice from the TFC is that it is not their intention to do so in the future.</PARA>
